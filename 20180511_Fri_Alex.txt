[00:26.800 --> 00:33.280]  This is real. This is not fiction. This is our enemy showing themselves. Maxine waters
[00:33.280 --> 00:40.640]  triggered. Explodes on the house floor. Takes back her time. Will not let someone speak.
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.760]  Saying I resent making America great again. Here is the revealing footage.
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.840]  We are trying to make sure that we're making America great every day and every way. And
[00:51.840 --> 00:55.920]  the best way to do that is to stop talking about discrimination and start talking about
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.040]  the nation. We're coming together as a people in spite of what you say.
[00:59.600 --> 01:00.800]  Thanks gentlemen. I yield back.
[01:01.360 --> 01:05.680]  Gentlemen's time has expired. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the chair.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.040]  The gentleman from Texas Reserves, a gentle lady from California.
[01:09.040 --> 01:15.520]  Thank you very much. The gentleman, Mr. Kelly, please do not leave because I want you to know
[01:15.520 --> 01:21.840]  that I am more offended as an African-American woman than you will ever be. And this business
[01:21.840 --> 01:27.040]  about making America great again, it is your president that's dividing this country. And
[01:27.040 --> 01:32.560]  don't talk to me about the fact that we don't understand what happens on the... No, I will
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.080]  not yield. No, I will not yield. Don't tell me that we don't understand. That's the attitude
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.720]  that's been given to women time and time again. The gentle lady will suspend. The chair wishes
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.080]  to remind all members that they are to address their remarks to the chair. I respect the chair,
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.120]  but don't stop me in the middle when you didn't stop him in the middle. And so I shall continue.
[01:55.120 --> 02:00.560]  Don't you dare talk to me like that and think that somehow women don't understand
[02:00.560 --> 02:07.200]  what goes on on the floor of automobile dealers. Minded to direct her remarks to the chair.
[02:07.200 --> 02:11.600]  The gentle lady will continue in order. And I am saying that I will continue to do that. However,
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.440]  I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous remarks
[02:17.440 --> 02:23.840]  about him knowing more about discrimination than I know about discrimination. I resent that and I
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.400]  resent the remark about making America great again. He's down here making a speech for this
[02:28.400 --> 02:33.840]  dishonorable president of the United States of America. Having said that, I reserve the balance
[02:33.840 --> 02:40.880]  of my time and no, I do not yield not one second to you. Not one second. Not one second to you.
[02:40.880 --> 02:47.440]  That woman is worth reportedly 50 plus million dollars. She went to Congress with no money.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  She's given massive direct cash payments to her husband's bank that he chaired.
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.520]  She lives in multiple mansions, drives the finest cars, wears the finest clothes,
[03:03.520 --> 03:09.280]  and bitches and gripes and hates this country. We're trying to actually turn the economy back
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.880]  on, bring people together. And she's up there talking about men harassing women on car dealership
[03:14.880 --> 03:19.680]  floors. When the borders are collapsing, billions of people are close to starvation,
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.720]  the world's in a critical crisis, and the globalists are on record trying to make us fight
[03:24.720 --> 03:31.360]  with each other any way we can. You know, there's a famous congressional report back in the late
[03:31.360 --> 03:40.960]  50s on the goals of communism from captured FSB and previously KGB documents. And in there,
[03:40.960 --> 03:44.320]  it talks about making men and women fight with each other, making families fight,
[03:44.320 --> 03:50.320]  getting rid of Christianity, and then replacing it with a godless state so that people have nothing.
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.480]  They stand for nothing. And you heard her, I resent your make America great again comments.
[03:56.480 --> 04:03.440]  And this dishonorable president and notice Trump is just delivering
[04:05.760 --> 04:08.400]  on every single front.
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.160]  I'm going to go over the current communist goals later in the broadcast directly from
[04:18.160 --> 04:28.400]  White House.gov. Because that is in the congressional record. And then I want to ask you, has it not
[04:28.400 --> 04:35.040]  happened? When you think communist goals to globalist goals, who funded communism, the richest people
[04:35.040 --> 04:41.040]  in the world to con the serfs, all the world slavery was ending, land servitude was ending.
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.600]  So they had to con you as the cities became industrialized back into a form of communism,
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.640]  back into a form of the communal or living in the communal on the land.
[04:50.640 --> 04:56.880]  But the Lord is above you in the castle. You're in a communal. But they're not called slavery.

[06:14.640 --> 06:25.280]  America from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:27.120 --> 06:37.840]  Maxine Waters is a mad dog. She is like Kujo. She has cultural, political, spiritual rabies.
[06:38.560 --> 06:42.400]  I don't know which dog bit the other dog, but Hillary's got the same disease,
[06:42.400 --> 06:47.040]  megalomania. Everything in their wake is death and destruction.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.080]  And we're going to be breaking down this incredible speech where she said, quote,
[06:52.640 --> 07:00.400]  I resent, make America great again. We'll play the full remarks coming up,
[07:00.400 --> 07:05.360]  but I want to play just the end part here in a moment where she says, I resent,
[07:05.360 --> 07:13.760]  make America great again. And I resent this president and the hatred, the vitriol, the anger,
[07:13.760 --> 07:20.720]  and the way she's talking about women and blacks. Like it's a title. Like I am oppressed. I have a
[07:20.720 --> 07:28.000]  title. Like I'm a king. I'm an Earl. I'm a queen. I'm a Duke. I am a woman. You have wronged me.
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.640]  I have resentment for all of you. I have chips on my shoulder and I'm black and you've done
[07:34.640 --> 07:41.280]  something to me. And people are sick of it because we know it's weaponized to keep people in a
[07:41.280 --> 07:46.160]  cultural plantation. That doesn't mean there aren't racists on all sides. It doesn't mean there's
[07:46.160 --> 07:49.520]  all sorts of bad things in the world. There's also a lot of good in the world. And Trump is
[07:49.520 --> 07:54.960]  really trying to build factories in Detroit. How about affirmative action he is building
[07:54.960 --> 07:59.360]  and getting companies to build hundreds of new factories in predominantly black areas
[07:59.360 --> 08:08.240]  and incentivizing major government loans to not sit there and just give somebody affirmative
[08:08.240 --> 08:14.160]  action, put them at the head of the line, head of even Asians, women and blacks and Hispanics ahead
[08:14.160 --> 08:19.760]  of Asians because they don't deserve it because, you know, all the top slots the Asians are basically
[08:19.760 --> 08:25.200]  getting. See how that works? Tenalizing people that actually work hard. The Trump's actually
[08:25.200 --> 08:30.880]  deploying billions and billions and billions of dollars of scholarships to minorities.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.040]  That's being radically expanded and the Democrats cannot stand it, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:37.040 --> 08:40.880]  They are pulling their hair out as the factories come back, as the jobs come back,
[08:40.880 --> 08:48.640]  and as we try to unify the nation. That's right. Fiat Christ is removing some production back
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.720]  from Mexico due to pressure from Trump. That's USA Today. There are hundreds of big factories
[08:54.720 --> 09:00.000]  that have already come back, hundreds more coming back, thousands of little ones that have already
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.080]  come back. That's right. Trump signed the executive order on black colleges, 25 billion
[09:13.040 --> 09:17.760]  for infrastructure, college readiness, financial aid and other priorities, shingling blacks out
[09:17.760 --> 09:23.760]  particularly. Obama never did that. Remember black leaders in Chicago going, man, he didn't
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.240]  even come visit us. He didn't even care about us. Well, that's because you've got the image of a
[09:28.240 --> 09:34.000]  black guy and that's all you need. Instead of the reality of an actual good-paying 50, 60,
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.120]  70, 80 thousand dollar a year job. Would you rather have that or live in the projects
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.280]  and mama can't have daddy at home or she doesn't get the check? You know, he wrote a bunch of letters
[09:43.280 --> 09:48.720]  there in the Library of Congress. His name was Lyndon Baines Johnson, a KKK member. And he said,
[09:48.720 --> 09:54.720]  I'll have those inwards vote in Democrat for a hundred years. We're going to get those daddies
[09:54.720 --> 09:59.520]  out of the house and we're going to pay off their mamas and they're going to be under our control
[09:59.520 --> 10:07.680]  and within just 20 years, black illegitimacy went from 10, 15 percent to over 80. Just like that.
[10:08.400 --> 10:16.080]  And any other culture or group that gets on the welfare, it's over. It's over. It's over. And they
[10:16.080 --> 10:28.720]  know exactly what they did and Maxine Waters is a monstrous, monstrous, monstrous person. Oh,
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.600]  look at CBS spinning it. Lyndon Johnson was a civil rights hero, but he was also a racist.
[10:36.800 --> 10:37.760]  He was a hero.
[10:37.760 --> 10:45.920]  You know, until the 1950s, blacks had lower illegitimacy than whites in this country.
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.120]  And they always spin it like, oh, you're attacking women that don't have a man at home. Nobody's
[10:51.120 --> 10:56.640]  doing that. There are a lot of single mothers that are heroes, the real heroes, but the system's been
[10:56.640 --> 11:09.120]  set up to make you dependent, to make everybody dependent. Just search engine, Lyndon Maynes
[11:09.120 --> 11:15.520]  Johnson's comments about black people. They've got the actual letters. I'll have those GD in words,
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.960]  voting Democrat for 100 years. There's even recordings of it. I played them years ago.
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.640]  YouTube took them down once when I put them out and they were racist. You can't report on a racist
[11:24.640 --> 11:27.920]  because see then you're racist. But if somebody's one of the little low level racist, they want
[11:27.920 --> 11:32.560]  you to know about, they'll leave it up. And he's sitting there on the tapes at the White House
[11:32.560 --> 11:36.400]  talking. He's going, I tell you, he's, I won't even say it because the media will edit it together
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.160]  and then say, I said it, but he's saying there's these uppity people. We're going to get them.
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.960]  We're going to shut them down. We're going to bypass these Republicans who got the Civil Rights
[11:44.960 --> 11:51.360]  Act passed. And the Democrats, the Dixie Cratch did not know what to do. So the social engineers
[11:51.360 --> 11:59.440]  came up with a plan and it worked great. And now here we are 50, 60 years later and Maxine Waters
[11:59.440 --> 12:04.400]  has been in Congress for 30 years. She went in there with nothing. She's worth reportedly $50
[12:04.400 --> 12:13.440]  million or husband even more. Some numbers are 30 to 80 million. The numbers vary on her 30 to 50.
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.440]  She gave tens of millions of dollars over and over and over and over and over and over and over
[12:19.440 --> 12:25.440]  and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
[12:25.440 --> 12:30.240]  to her husband's bank. Look it up. Nobody's gotten away with what she's gotten away with
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.120]  because she is so arrogant and so hateful. And here's the video, full video is coming up where
[12:37.120 --> 12:45.760]  she says she resents Make America Great Again. Here it is. The chair. I will continue to do
[12:45.760 --> 12:51.840]  that. However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous
[12:51.840 --> 12:58.640]  remarks about him knowing more about discrimination than I know about discrimination. I resent that
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.600]  and I resent the remark about Making America Great Again. He's down here making a speech for this
[13:03.600 --> 13:09.040]  dishonorable president of the United States of America. Having said that, I reserve the balance
[13:09.040 --> 13:16.080]  of my time and no, I do not yield not one second to you. Not one second. Not one second to you.
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.480]  You know, if Maxine Mad Dog Waters
[13:23.040 --> 13:27.680]  had ever been to the stuff I've been through at the hands of white people,
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.120]  then I could expect some of that hate. But you know what? She doesn't have one story about a
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.640]  white person physically attacking her or anything. I grew up in Dallas, Texas
[13:34.640 --> 13:41.040]  and I have experienced gangs of racist black people. See, I'm not an idiot. So I don't hate
[13:41.040 --> 13:45.760]  all black people and most black folks aren't like that. But growing up in Dallas, Texas,
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.440]  there were a lot of really racist black people. In fact, if I had buddies that played football
[13:49.440 --> 13:52.800]  that were black or whatever, and sometimes I'd be out with them, you know, going walking to
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.400]  somebody's house or something or going to play baseball and card pull up, much big black guys
[13:58.400 --> 14:00.960]  get out and say, what the hell are you doing with this cracker? We're going to beat your ass too.
[14:00.960 --> 14:07.920]  And Maxine Waters knows full that she's a raging race pimp. She hates black people.
[14:07.920 --> 14:13.760]  She knows how to sucker them and manipulate them and get rich off of them. She's a dirty monster,
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.000]  just like Hillary Clinton and just like Michael Moore and all these folks. And they are so pissed
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.040]  that Republicans are trying to bring people together. The old blue blood Republicans are
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.760]  all dying off. The Donald Trump opened up all his golf courses, the black people and Jews.
[14:25.760 --> 14:29.360]  They all know that's why he was such a big hero to the hip hop groups. That's why they're all
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.320]  crapping their drawers. Because somebody's coming around that isn't there to screw everybody over.
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.320]  You witch, you nasty, evil, dirty, globalist piece of crap. Excuse me, I'm a little bit angry here.
[14:41.280 --> 14:45.280]  We're going to go to break and come back with all the speech and so much international news.
[14:45.280 --> 14:52.000]  Just oh, QAnon. The biggest news on QAnon ever and that intel. QAnon has been penetrated,
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.920]  has been flipped, identity stolen. That is confirmed. I talked directly to the real

[15:04.400 --> 15:07.520]  real QAnons are for about a year and a half, but I'm going to break it all down for a solicitor

[19:58.400 --> 20:09.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.600 --> 20:25.680]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:25.680 --> 20:36.800]  I will continue to do that. However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him
[20:36.800 --> 20:41.920]  when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more about discrimination
[20:41.920 --> 20:47.840]  than I know about discrimination. I resent that and I resent the remark about making America
[20:47.840 --> 20:52.960]  great again. He's down here making the speech for this dishonorable president of the United States
[20:52.960 --> 20:59.120]  of America. Having said that, I reserve the balance of my time and no, I do not yield not one
[20:59.120 --> 21:02.880]  second to you. Not one second. Not one second to you.
[21:06.160 --> 21:11.280]  Meanwhile, black people get poor, more umber in prison. Hillary got the laws passed when Bill
[21:11.280 --> 21:15.440]  Clinton was in office to make black people come to heal like a dog because they're quote super
[21:15.440 --> 21:20.880]  predators. Should I play that video clip of Hillary saying that again? There she is with Bill Clinton.
[21:20.880 --> 21:29.360]  She's part of the ruling class. She is the apprentice, the baby Sith Lord of LBJ who
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.160]  openly wanted to enslave black people with welfare and they did a pretty good job of it.
[21:34.720 --> 21:40.800]  It's sick. And then she's triggered by a speech we played excerpts of earlier where he's just
[21:40.800 --> 21:45.600]  talking about making America great again and coming together and not being racist and not
[21:45.600 --> 21:50.080]  pushing the race card all the time. But that's what the me too movement. All of this is about
[21:50.080 --> 21:56.320]  total division and she is so corrupt. She's listed as one of the most corrupt members of
[21:56.320 --> 22:01.600]  Congress. She knows it. She's got this whole stick. She's running a virtue signaling as a
[22:01.600 --> 22:07.040]  smokescreen, the incredible crimes that she's committed. In fact, we ought to take some of
[22:07.040 --> 22:10.960]  her speeches and weave them in with Hillary Clinton saying blacks are animals that they
[22:10.960 --> 22:16.400]  need to be brought to heal like dogs, all the rest of it because it is unbelievable how long
[22:16.400 --> 22:24.240]  all this has been going on. It's truly sickening. Yeah, there's a LBJ. I'll have those inwards
[22:24.240 --> 22:30.000]  voting Democrat for the next 200 years touting his underlying intentions for the great society
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.480]  programs. LBJ confided with two like-minded governors on Air Force One. That's the congressional
[22:36.480 --> 22:43.120]  record. But also there's letters with similar things. He was a dragon, not a grand dragon. He
[22:43.120 --> 22:49.280]  just ran a major city in south Texas. He was a dragon in the KKK.
[22:52.560 --> 22:56.960]  And you see, those that don't know history, don't repeat it. The Republicans were the abolitionist.
[22:58.160 --> 23:05.360]  They were the big Christian party, you know, Lincoln. And then by the 50s and 60s, people like
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.400]  my grandfather, whose family were all Democrats in these Texas, even in World War II, he said,
[23:10.400 --> 23:15.520]  no, we need to stop treating black people like second-class citizens, third-class citizens.
[23:16.160 --> 23:21.840]  And so there was a big Republican sweep with Eisenhower in the 50s. The Democrats didn't
[23:21.840 --> 23:25.760]  know what to do. The Republicans were passing civil rights acts. So they came up with a southern
[23:25.760 --> 23:30.000]  strategy. They tricked the Republicans into it, the bluebloods, by diving in and saying,
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.760]  oh, we love the minorities now. We're going to give you free stuff, but you got to go under our
[23:33.760 --> 23:39.120]  control. And the Republicans switched back to a southern strategy. There were a lot of racist
[23:39.120 --> 23:44.400]  bluebloods in there as well. But here we are today with the rebranding of the Democrats as
[23:44.400 --> 23:50.960]  the guys that care about you. It's unbelievable. In fact, here is Hillary Clinton and her
[23:50.960 --> 23:56.320]  super predators comment when they were running for president. And then there's similar comments
[23:56.320 --> 24:03.120]  she made when they were running for reelection in 1995. Here it is. Not just games of kids anymore.
[24:03.120 --> 24:08.880]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators, no conscience, no empathy.
[24:08.880 --> 24:12.960]  We can talk about why they ended up that way. But first we have to bring them to heal. And the
[24:12.960 --> 24:18.960]  president has asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere. In
[24:18.960 --> 24:24.000]  addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar. You probably saw him Tuesday night. He's one of
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.880]  the most distinguished, active- Okay, so there you go. And they made it where blacks were caught
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.520]  with cocaine. They got three times that of a white. And how'd they do that? Well,
[24:35.520 --> 24:42.320]  they made crack cocaine, even though per volume it had the same amount of cocaine in it,
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.440]  they would then give you triple the sentence, because it was a drug blacks predominantly used
[24:49.440 --> 24:56.880]  at the time. Remember, slits malt liquor almost exclusively drunk by blacks. It'd be like saying
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.920]  if the cops catch you with slits malt liquor, drinking and driving, you get 10 years in prison.
[25:01.920 --> 25:09.760]  But if they catch you with Kurz light, you get probation. You're like, but it's the same thing.
[25:09.760 --> 25:15.040]  I mean, you could argue a slits malt liquor might be a little bit stronger, but per ounce of alcohol,
[25:15.040 --> 25:21.680]  it's still the same charge. Think about that. Think about that. Oh, well, you got a slits
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.480]  malt liquor. We're going to put you in jail for 10 years. Oh, you're drinking Milwaukee's best.
[25:26.480 --> 25:32.880]  You get probation because that's what whites drink. By the way, if you're going to drink cheap
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.520]  liquor, I know in high school and college, let's mall liquor is pretty good actually. I wouldn't
[25:37.520 --> 25:44.640]  touch Milwaukee's best and all that Schaefer light and Pearl horrible Texas beer. Absolutely
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.720]  horrible. But I mean, you want to drink some nasty cheap beer, let's mall liquor is actually good.
[25:49.600 --> 25:52.160]  Anyways, I've had a slits malt liquor in probably 20 years, but
[25:52.160 --> 25:58.480]  I'll give you a headache though the next day. What a malt liquor. We're now having a malt
[25:58.480 --> 26:01.680]  liquor discussion, ladies and gentlemen, you know, where the big bull comes to the wall.
[26:04.400 --> 26:07.920]  Did the Kool-Aid guy rip off slits malt liquor when he busted the wall? Or was it
[26:08.960 --> 26:15.440]  the bull that ripped off the other way around? Who knows? I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:15.440 --> 26:19.840]  but do blacks deserve triple the time for cocaine that whites do? No, they don't. That's racist.
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.880]  Who did that? Bill Clinton. And then who says, Oh, there's so concerned about blacks in prison.
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.600]  Maxine waters and Bill Clinton and the whole filthy stinking democratic party.
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.320]  I've now digressed into three full segments on Maxine waters and I still have got a ways to go.
[26:36.320 --> 26:39.440]  So I'm going to, I'm going to stop right there because there's so much other big news to hit.
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.360]  What we need is Christian culture, even if we don't believe in God,
[26:45.360 --> 26:52.320]  creole Christian culture, big families, all of that creates low crime, incredible prosperity
[26:52.320 --> 26:55.680]  and happiness all over the world where it's practiced. You'll have one African tribe that's
[26:55.680 --> 27:00.480]  Christian and they're super rich and wealthy and successful. And you'll have another African
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.120]  tribe that isn't the exact same genetics in places like Rwanda and they're living in mud huts.
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.440]  One tribe 200 years ago adopted Christianity. The other tribe didn't. One lives in mud huts.
[27:11.440 --> 27:23.040]  One has high tech factories. That's what we have with the story by Dan Lyman at europewars.com,
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.400]  our European division. It's also up on news wars.com. We will build a 21st century Christian
[27:28.400 --> 27:33.120]  democracy says Hungary's prime minister who's fighting the globalist or bonds, bold vision
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.240]  explained. This is the answer. They want to get rid of it just like the goals of communism.
[27:38.240 --> 27:44.960]  All right, now when we come back, I'm going to shift gears out of that and into the big
[27:46.320 --> 27:53.680]  enchilada. I have known that QAnon was a consortium of six or seven real military
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.440]  intelligence individuals with their view. Didn't mean it was all accurate or all perfect,
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.120]  but I've known for about six months who some of them are by name and the White House said,
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.880]  yeah, we kind of like the things QAnon saying. They told Corsi that I was also told that
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.600]  another source, that was somebody below the president. But the last few months it's been
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.680]  going sideways. I've had some private discussions that disagreeing with folks that still thought
[28:13.680 --> 28:19.520]  QAnon was real. And I just said, I'm not doing any more QAnon coverage. Well, this morning I
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.200]  talked to some folks while they were out playing golf, some officers, and went ahead and had a
[28:25.200 --> 28:32.240]  chance to talk to the original individual, let's just say Q, that's a consortium and not Q that
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.280]  does some security work that Q's not associated with it, even though he is in Florida as well.
[28:37.920 --> 28:43.280]  And where you've got Central Command and all the rest of it, Special Operations Command.
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.160]  So we're going to just go ahead and tell you Q has been compromised. The identity has been taken
[28:48.160 --> 28:53.920]  over by a deep state group that is attempting to also destroy the presidency and the Make America
[28:53.920 --> 29:02.560]  Great Again reboot. We'll be back with Dr. Jerome Corsi. Stay with us.
[29:23.920 --> 29:36.160]  You have been lied to. My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally,
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.960]  someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:40.960 --> 29:46.640]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:46.640 --> 29:50.080]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake folks doesn't mean other people are.
[29:50.080 --> 29:53.840]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church. Get them right now

[35:48.000 --> 35:57.520]  right won't it fine southern gentleman like bill clinton who when he ran for governor had had the
[35:57.520 --> 36:02.240]  rebel flag and i'm not saying the rebel flags even what the left says it is but come on and imagine
[36:02.240 --> 36:09.120]  if trump had ever run on the rebel flag it's crazy or to be technical the confederate battle flag
[36:11.280 --> 36:15.200]  which i must say is a handsome flyer something to do with slavery but it's all been turned into
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.840]  that so what does it matter like the word gay used to mean happy now it means something else
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.760]  a fag used to be a burning ember a cigarette they still called that dangling someone said hey
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.880]  give me a fag somebody else with a cigarette you're like a fag and like there it is so we're
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.040]  going to go to court see this segment the next a little bit the next hour and then we've got

[37:22.880 --> 37:30.720]  basically yet is funded by the establishment and i remember the first time i wanted to get milo on
[37:30.720 --> 37:37.120]  he had to get permission from the mercers to come on i mean i'm not putting milo down he's a great
[37:37.120 --> 37:42.400]  guy i mean i grew a lot of his politics on some of the lifestyle stuff but he has his free speech
[37:42.400 --> 37:45.920]  and he was one of the people who first be banned off the internet basically twitter you name it

[39:23.520 --> 39:27.920]  killing on put out a lot of exclusive info that was accurate made a lot of predictions
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.520]  that were accurate up front then a lot of things started to be said that weren't exactly accurate
[39:33.520 --> 39:39.760]  didn't happen and then i noticed mainstream media and online twitter facebook and youtube wouldn't
[39:39.760 --> 39:44.640]  block you when you were promoting that and i thought that's a little suspicious but i talked
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.560]  to people i know in the military and others they said no we know some of the people on those boards
[39:48.560 --> 39:54.480]  using that name there's only five or six people but did it sort of get a little bit weird and they
[39:54.480 --> 40:00.880]  said no somebody's hijacked it uh and and basically hacked it and is using it and is now putting out
[40:00.880 --> 40:06.720]  this information but separately people like zach super good source i know his full name who he is
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.000]  we got a lot of other big sources in the military i mean i've got sources i'm not going to say from
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.960]  what units or groups but the most elite of the most elite highest level we have it i'm gonna leave it
[40:18.960 --> 40:27.040]  at that cia dev group delta force you name it all of it whole nine yards because they're patriots
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.600]  and then they know what this country is in right now where we're going and dr coursey's written
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.840]  three number one new york times bestsellers he's changed elections he's got amazing sources
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.880]  he got told by the white house six months ago hey we like you went on but now that's not the case
[40:40.880 --> 40:46.400]  and so i was on the phone this morning and talked to some folks who are out playing golf with people
[40:46.400 --> 40:50.800]  that have been involved in q and on they say hey that's been taken over we're unable to even post
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.520]  anymore that's not us anymore and then coursey is was round the same line two days ago in private
[40:55.520 --> 40:59.920]  conversations we had saying hey it's been compromised that i was didn't even talk about it on air
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.880]  then i was separately told us by q and on i'm saying in i've talked to q and on
[41:06.320 --> 41:10.400]  there's only about five six people that have actually been posting i've talked to q and on
[41:10.400 --> 41:14.480]  and they're saying q and on is no longer q and on so dr coursey tell us about your angle on this
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.840]  well it's very similar to yours i think alex i you're correct i think the white house for a
[41:19.840 --> 41:26.960]  long time did support q and on i've been following it since december and then periodically there would
[41:26.960 --> 41:32.320]  be cyber attacks and it would shift it was clear that the q and on identity was under attack
[41:33.120 --> 41:39.360]  the real shift occurred really on april 28th that's when i really concluded began concluding that
[41:39.920 --> 41:47.280]  q and on was now completely hijacked by a psychop operation that had hijacked the identity and was
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.080]  starting to publish this information designed to destroy the movement and dividing the movement
[41:53.120 --> 42:00.640]  the post change in quality and their content we started to get attacks on people profiteering
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.480]  making money you know you can't make any money on the uh... patriot movement if you're starting to
[42:06.480 --> 42:12.240]  see a fog of confusion attacking the platforms yes and no leader i mean first of all no leader
[42:12.240 --> 42:18.080]  like you know why would you attack prominent spokespeople in you know in the movement attacking
[42:18.080 --> 42:24.080]  you know me for writing a book and making money on writing a book and so i began to get then just
[42:24.080 --> 42:32.480]  you know inundated with our troll type emails and postings on twitter attacking me uh... for
[42:32.480 --> 42:38.080]  profiteering even though i've been one of the most prominent supporters of q the whole movement began
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.480]  to turn on by your book is about the conspiracy to overthrow the president with the fake russia
[42:42.480 --> 42:45.760]  gate nothing to do with q and on even though there's some of the books so so that's how the
[42:45.760 --> 42:50.560]  distraction began so the identity got grabbed you one of the people promoting the original real
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.720]  q and on i began getting demonized as the public spokesperson basically q and on i mean that's what
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.520]  you become and so now we go the rest of the way but i was told months ago it was comprehensive
[42:59.520 --> 43:04.560]  north carolina thanks for holding so long go ahead yeah i just have to say something man it seems
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.920]  like every time i turn on your broadcast your bragging it just gets old now i'm gonna shut

[46:00.960 --> 46:06.160]  assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that their president is another
[46:06.160 --> 46:11.760]  hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[46:11.760 --> 46:17.520]  narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[46:17.520 --> 46:24.240]  all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia
[46:24.240 --> 46:30.800]  and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize
[46:30.800 --> 46:38.160]  the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.560]  and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the
[46:44.560 --> 46:51.840]  only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched
[46:51.840 --> 46:58.720]  fist of truth i'm the national rifle association of america and i'm freedoms safest place
[47:03.760 --> 47:06.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:06.400 --> 47:12.400]  so
[47:13.760 --> 47:20.160]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[47:21.760 --> 47:26.080]  so there's a civil war going on in this country between the tories those that
[47:26.080 --> 47:28.880]  are with the globalists the big robber barons the internationalist
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.520]  who want to end sovereignty and end the free market with the general public and
[47:33.520 --> 47:38.720]  nationalists like trump who says he wants a victory for the world he wants world peace
[47:38.720 --> 47:44.320]  he wants economic development he doesn't want a strategy of tension a strategy of destabilization
[47:44.320 --> 47:51.360]  but a very good pragmatic strategy of development we haven't had that since really eisenhower
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.720]  warrants about the military industrial complex kennedy was in over his head somebody that
[47:56.720 --> 48:02.400]  dr corcy knew when he was a youngster and they killed him but if you read the 45 secret goals
[48:02.400 --> 48:08.880]  of communism leaked to congress in 1963 that we've just posted to info wars dot com you will see
[48:08.880 --> 48:15.040]  that communism is an instrument of the robber baron class to sabotage society and to sabotage
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.000]  culture that's on info wars dot com right now please get it out to everybody now going back to
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.600]  dr corcy the reason this is important obviously is qanon was a good source i talked to my military
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.880]  folks they ferried it into it they actually know some of the people involved with it uh with people
[48:32.880 --> 48:36.240]  acting on their own they weren't giving anything secret but they were showing that they knew what
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.760]  was about to happen on some issues to get credibility my concern was that could have been a setup to
[48:41.760 --> 48:47.280]  get people's confidence and then sit there and put out a bunch of disinfo but they're not talking
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.600]  to some others they said no overall those are some you know good people but how they do it is
[48:51.600 --> 48:58.240]  they go into the 4chan they hack it they take down the links they put out a fog then they
[48:58.880 --> 49:04.000]  start attacking people that had been supporting the real qanon to basically just destroy the
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.640]  entire thing and discredit it and that's why i was always saying i'll focus on it but my main focus
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.640]  is just public intelligence human intelligence uh the major trends what we know is unfolding
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.720]  and we know there is a war going on inside the deep state so the narrative being put out by
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.680]  qanon before was one of hope and truth and very very positive uh now it's one of uh
[49:23.680 --> 49:28.560]  infighting and destruction so i just think we should recap what's happened get in the latest
[49:28.560 --> 49:34.800]  and then basically stick a fork in the avatar of qanon it is now an overrun disinformation
[49:34.800 --> 49:41.280]  fount dr zoram coursey well i i agree with everything you said alexa this is a now completely
[49:41.280 --> 49:48.400]  compromised source the psych op that took over uh qanon and i see now i think i think they're
[49:48.400 --> 49:54.800]  signs of uh nasa being involved at this point but the board you know the the 8chan board has
[49:54.800 --> 50:02.640]  now been overrun with i think increasingly uh cia operatives posing as trolls posing disinformation
[50:02.640 --> 50:08.480]  certainly the attack i've gotten in the last 48 hours after saying the qanon was compromised
[50:09.120 --> 50:16.080]  on my twitter feed and my emails have just been obviously hate generated uh psych op
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.480]  operations that's right this isn't just a few kids with hot pockets in their mother's basement
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.000]  playing video games this is this is them taking control of the symbol of qanon and now weaponizing
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.520]  it and the and the goal seems to be that the psych op taking a hold of it is going to destroy
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.800]  the movement that what they're basically saying things to divide in other words you can't make a
[50:36.800 --> 50:43.200]  profit well clearly that's you know they attacked me for writing a book and profiteering on the
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.440]  patriot movement well by the way what is in the clinton foundation not their new bigger one
[50:47.440 --> 50:52.400]  with the original library foundation documents the judicial watch and world net daily got over
[50:52.400 --> 50:57.600]  70 000 pages they said the number one thing is don't let christians conservatives or nationalists
[50:57.600 --> 51:03.040]  ever build an economy the number one rule is call them conspiracy theorist and the number two rule is
[51:03.040 --> 51:09.360]  always attack profiting don't let them create an economy precisely and that's what qanon has done
[51:09.360 --> 51:15.760]  now what leader divides their own followers by this kind of a comment and besides look at president
[51:15.760 --> 51:21.920]  trump yesterday in indiana he said you know let's make wealth great again well listen listen off
[51:21.920 --> 51:27.600]  record of course i told you through an army special operations source who you talk to don't
[51:27.600 --> 51:34.000]  say any first names either who's been in you know most elite army units multi group units there are
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.480]  that they told you we told you months ago that it was being compromised and that it had been
[51:38.480 --> 51:42.160]  compromised and they were going to operate like they were good until they built the movement to
[51:42.160 --> 51:46.240]  try to take control of it so it's already destroyed i mean did we not a few months ago on a phone call
[51:46.240 --> 51:50.960]  in here yes you you warned me on this i mean you understand that source you were talking to has been
[51:50.960 --> 51:57.440]  yes i i did it was credible it was a real source that source is what we got sources all over the
[51:57.440 --> 52:02.800]  place bigger than the original qanon people i know i was on the phone this morning with the real people
[52:02.800 --> 52:09.760]  right well i mean the real people have been identified and i had a pretty good idea who they
[52:09.760 --> 52:14.880]  were at the very beginning as i went into it the identification became clearer and clearer
[52:14.880 --> 52:20.560]  i mean the the groups that originally put this together were military intelligence and very loyal
[52:20.560 --> 52:25.680]  to general flinn and the goal was to you know provide enough of the background and that's
[52:25.680 --> 52:29.520]  exactly right and that's that was the group out playing golf this morning that's exactly right
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.560]  right and that group that group i think is the group that now we can have some background
[52:34.560 --> 52:38.080]  noise it'll go away that's okay we don't mind the lawnmower it's kind of soothing that lawnmower
[52:38.080 --> 52:44.000]  is going on enough that i could do about it at the moment the um look the the key element here is
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.440]  now you're looking at something that can be generated by artificial intelligence and there's no reason
[52:49.440 --> 52:55.840]  it can't be generated by artificial intelligence these are just now formulaic you know all open
[52:55.840 --> 53:01.840]  source they can be decoded by open source so you get a you know a few inflammatory statements
[53:01.840 --> 53:06.880]  that you're promising boom boom boom we're gonna have these big developments a bunch of cryptic
[53:06.880 --> 53:13.520]  questions and a few open source references and that's all q is and then it's buried inside it
[53:14.080 --> 53:20.480]  are now attacks which are basically socialistic new world order attacks intended to divide the
[53:20.480 --> 53:26.400]  movement and to drive out of the movement anybody who's a real patriot anybody who you know has
[53:26.400 --> 53:32.560]  supported president trump and oppose the new new world order that's the goal of the psychopsies to
[53:32.560 --> 53:37.760]  take over the movement and divide it and then destroy it we just put on screen the one and
[53:37.760 --> 53:43.840]  guardian saying exactly that and admitting and that they've had for decades already these automated
[53:43.840 --> 53:48.080]  systems not artificially intelligent the classical sense but automated now they're artificially
[53:48.080 --> 53:56.400]  intelligent and what you're saying is they load in a few pages of rumors of disinfo of keywords
[53:56.400 --> 54:00.960]  then they have facebook and twitter and google push that so everybody starts pushing it because they
[54:00.960 --> 54:05.200]  don't get censored when they push it they go wow my post is going viral well it's because it's
[54:05.200 --> 54:10.240]  disinfo the establishment wants out whatever the establishment pushes and force feeds you know is
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.560]  bad whatever it's trying to contain and block and control you know is good we're going in that
[54:14.560 --> 54:19.280]  direction and so i knew going back a couple months ago that suddenly they weren't blocking QAnon
[54:19.280 --> 54:23.920]  as they were before they were suddenly force feeding it so i did a few tests where i would
[54:23.920 --> 54:29.520]  talk about QAnon and it would suddenly get force fed millions of views instead of blocking us
[54:29.520 --> 54:33.680]  and shadow banning so then i made some phone calls they said oh yeah it's definitely not the same
[54:33.680 --> 54:37.680]  people it was a group of folks before they've taken over the identities they've blocked them
[54:37.680 --> 54:42.480]  they've basically penetrated 4chan they're in control of those boards at the management level
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.720]  and are force feeding you know these these these these false avatars and so i'm glad we're in
[54:48.720 --> 54:53.200]  agreement on this because i talked to the folks finally this morning and they said yes that that
[54:53.200 --> 54:59.840]  is indeed what is going on and indeed what is what is happening so basically we can just stick a
[54:59.840 --> 55:06.720]  fork in it and move on and believe nothing that comes out of the avatar QAnon that is now synonymous
[55:06.720 --> 55:12.400]  with disinformation correct and and it's going to get worse because the movement now controlled by
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.680]  psychops is going to do everything they can to further divide the donald trump supporters
[55:17.680 --> 55:23.520]  those who are believing it who want a intelligent source internally that they think they can trust
[55:23.520 --> 55:29.040]  are just going to get fooled and misled uh even the photographs photographs are largely i mean
[55:30.160 --> 55:34.800]  posting a photograph of singapore well that's not intelligence everybody knows it was announced
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.320]  by the wait house yesterday that president trump is going to meet with north korea in singapore
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.600]  so we're we're going to go from you know some good intelligence that was legitimately dropped by the
[55:45.600 --> 55:52.640]  q and on identity originally and i think even through april 28th and now it's 100 co-opted
[55:52.640 --> 55:58.800]  the attack on the board was even reported it was documented uh the the board administrator
[55:58.800 --> 56:04.880]  still doesn't believe he's been compromised or height hijacked or you know cyber attack
[56:04.880 --> 56:12.080]  but i assure you between the n at nasa the nsa and the cia anything on a computer can be
[56:12.080 --> 56:17.360]  compromised and hijacked and people using it may not even know that's the that's how
[56:17.920 --> 56:25.280]  effective a sayop operation can be and again 15 years ago they were called sock puppets or bullhorns
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.440]  the u.s has them israel has them everybody has them and again you you load in the data you want
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.640]  and then it goes out and pushes it as a i other people then join it who are real then it recruits
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.840]  them as moderators in a internet movement just like you do with your own website and then they
[56:41.840 --> 56:48.080]  roll those out weaponized now with real people just like the russian bots uh that the democrats
[56:48.080 --> 56:54.080]  paid for to have protest outside of trump tower that michael moore attended uh last year when he
[56:54.080 --> 56:59.040]  would been elected president michael moore didn't know that he was at a russian bot funded event
[56:59.040 --> 57:02.480]  so no wonder hillary said it was russians because 80 percent of it was funded by the democrats
[57:03.200 --> 57:06.800]  because there's a bunch of troll farms you can hire in different countries so there were russian
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.880]  bots they were just working for the democrats and russian bots were able to then create a big
[57:12.880 --> 57:17.840]  protest with over a thousand people in front of trump tower with even michael moore not knowing
[57:17.840 --> 57:24.240]  that's the power of a i and what they do also is you know you've got the ability here to do
[57:24.240 --> 57:31.040]  is a program of psychok program where you ask these questions and so it says loyal disloyal
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.960]  you know these different dichotomies you punch the button and it generates out cryptic questions
[57:36.960 --> 57:42.720]  for you the whole thing they basically created a little mind control video game choose your own
[57:42.720 --> 57:46.400]  adventure thing that they're manipulating people with and so folks should know that we'll be right
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.960]  back stay with us anything anonymous is always dangerous the scientists at info wars life have
[57:50.960 --> 57:56.640]  created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support discover the power of

[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:34.320]  we now take you live to the central texas commence center in the heart of the resistance
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:40.800]  you're listening to alex jones look there's so much disinfo so many bots that these big
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.080]  mega corporations are throwing at us we just have to know americana free market christianity
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:52.000]  free open society and promote that anytime you get into all this anonymous stuff unless it's
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.040]  sources that you've known for years and years like info wars that then has sources that we
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.600]  know the identity of that we know have given us good information in the past and still you can
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.320]  get set up down the road on that but that's why info wars is so attacked because the public
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.920]  trusted and say how does scent come they got us on a big projector in one of the meeting rooms
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.480]  in there right now some folks are watching dr coursey they're very interested in this whole
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.960]  kewin on thing as well i just hope we can move on from it because you know we have so many
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.240]  anonymous sources that are real that are documented not anonymous to us and then the media just
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.720]  ignores it but then the way they pick up kewin on you could see where the trap was going so
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.920]  dr coursey any other points you'd like to add well i think that now that we see the q identity
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:44.240]  has been compromised by a psycop and you know psyop is in charge we are just not coming forward
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.800]  with much more of our own deep source information which you know i've been filtering through kewin
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:57.520]  on basically utilizing it as a vehicle so that information we independently had could be blended
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.800]  into the kewin on story that's been largely my methodology in the decodes i've been doing
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.480]  so i think we need to just quit that and go directly with our own sources and our own
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.680]  intelligence information because right now we're at a critical point this is the point at which
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.440]  i believe the trump administration is positioning to fire miller or put miller under criminal
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:23.920]  investigation himself for the uranium one cover up that he did which i think was criminal and
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.760]  trump is about to launch into a serious counterattack in which i believe sessions have to be has to be
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:37.120]  fired rosenstein has to be fired and i think what this signals i think alex is we ought to go more
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:44.400]  directly even now even ramp it up with our own internal intelligence information that we can share
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.000]  with the public i mean not anything classified nothing that is you know top secret i'm not
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.320]  interested in dealing in classified information but the own own interpretations and directions
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.120]  we're getting pointed in by the intelligence sources you and i both work with almost on an
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.880]  everyday basis well that was my issue with kewin on the whole time some of the stuff was accurate
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:13.040]  some of it was good a lot of it was just publicly available information and then i had the hostage
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.080]  rescue team tell me he went to the middle east he had a woman in there for days before there was
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:28.080]  anti for paraphernalia it was a gun running deal gone bad saudi arabia was having a big conference
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.000]  there we believe they used the fact that he sold them guns before to meet to see the weapons then
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.640]  they used those to set him up in part of a saudi civil war and then months later that's basically
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.520]  the facts that have come out i mean wow really have sources in the hostage rescue team really have
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.240]  sources in the cia and i'm going to leave it that i don't mean like pencil pushers either
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.800]  and i'm talking about direct action covert action all that and they want the country to come back
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.040]  they know the globalist of hijacked the nation they know the communist chinese dip cheney came out
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.320]  yesterday and said communist china is the threat they've infiltrated this they're the enemy not
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.760]  the russians and not because he's a rusa file the chinese are the problem people go ahead dr
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.840]  coursey well and i i think we've got information that has been extremely valuable now it's time
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.520]  shared directly i mean one of the things i see about qanon as soon as the embassy was going to be
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:30.480]  moved uh to uh from televieve to jerusalem soon as president trump decided to tear up the iranian
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:38.000]  agreement uh the anti-semitism on on the q boards and me being hit with tweets and emails you know
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.240]  i tell you what can you come on can you come on the fourth hour day this is so important to

[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:01.280]  thought it's your own coursey fourth hour today i want to plow into all of this that i'm going to
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:08.480]  spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts

[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.640]  let's just say the folks that brought you brexit want to go the next level with info wars
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:03.360]  we're fighting hard ladies and gentlemen we're the tip of the spear and that's why they're out to get
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.400]  us that's why they're trying to shut us down because we're promoting ice water and hell
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:17.360]  or an ice warm house at the north pole we're promoting americana we're promoting free market
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:24.320]  we're promoting mom and apple pie and not venezuela collapse so paul's always loaded for bear we're
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.640]  going to talk to him he's going to co-host this hour with me about what he wants to get into and
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.800]  then i've got several subjects after he's covered the first few segments of this hour that i want
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:43.600]  to get to the secret 45 goals of communism leaked to congress in 63 this is must see we've published
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.440]  it to info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.040]  also we are going to look at the whole north korea deal coming up and the fact that trump
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.560]  said i don't really care about getting a nobel prize we'll play the clip i care about
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:13.360]  worldwide victory victory for the planet 1776 worldwide true innovation true age of
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:19.520]  discovery renaissance 2.0 i told you that's what this is and you're going to start hearing
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.360]  it you're going to start seeing and i told you with trump it's all about energy what does jz say
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:33.120]  the energy of trump and his energy behind the scenes trump is all about energy the energy
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:39.760]  he loves black churches the energy he loves the holy ghost trump is becoming a very strong christian
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:48.000]  and he just likes the energy well why wouldn't you like that energy and so that scares the culture
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.320]  of death because they can see trump is alive he's virile he's strong he's not one of these
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.000]  so-called alphas that wants to see you be weak so they feel powerful and over you
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.840]  we're also going to get to as robotics and ai sprint ahead us must battle china for supremacy
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.960]  but then battle to put the ai in full control of everything there's some major pitfalls to that
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.840]  also alphabet is considering investing in flipkart alongside walmart insiders explain why
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.680]  we're also going to be burrowing into this really key report next hour emp commission
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.280]  warns of year-long blackout and massive death toll that's the real way the globalist may try
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.200]  to depopulate us but they'll want to build their hardened bunkers and facilities first
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.520]  the problem is they've done that and then i saw this a couple weeks ago and then i saw it again
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.760]  today when uh my personal trainer came over he pointed out this is everywhere in his in his
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:53.520]  feeds on facebook and twitter pat riley pointed it out that paul watson uh said hey this young lady's
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.640]  interesting reporter she's coming to south by southwest she ought to let her be a guest reporter
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:04.800]  for a day and i said sure i guess ashton whitties her name i've only met her once briefly
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:11.200]  real very nice lady like she's like 20 something years old and i was getting tired of putting 20
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.240]  30 40 videos on our youtube and our facebook today because the guys told me that we should not do more
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.120]  than 10 because then it doesn't let the others go viral so i've said put these things on sub channels
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:27.280]  so i walked in and saw like 20 videos that have been uploaded and i said delete those
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.520]  it's like the day after she'd been here and i said and then reupload them on the sub channels
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.880]  that's how we're gonna build those i walk out the media watches us so closely they went
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:45.920]  jones is scared he removed this video of her she's destroyed by this woman who's a genius
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:53.200]  the woman can hardly talk so i finally watched it and ashton witty i guess i'll try to hire her
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.560]  she's a great job they're celebrating this like the kid that walks up and tells oh and shroyer f u
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.480]  they celebrate their weakness as a victory it's a total scyop
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.240]  and i've never watched this clip i've just seen like dozens of videos and i'm like i told you guys
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.800]  stop posting 50 videos a day on the youtube i'll normally raise my voice but i said delete them
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.080]  they said a lot of them are yours i went i don't care put them on sub channels that's how we're
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:26.480]  gonna build those and they went oh my god he deleted these study what videos why did he delete
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.480]  them we found them over here oh look we found it on twitter and we found it on facebook he
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.880]  didn't leave it there we found it in the article's go we found it he tried to hide it because we
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:43.840]  posted it there idiots but that's not the story the story is how dumb this woman is and they have
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:51.120]  vote teen vogue and newsweek and vice and hbo celebrating her and she sounds like she's got
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.960]  about a 70 iq and that she's wearing all these fancy clothes saying she loves socialism how much
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.920]  she loves venezuela it's devastatingly dumb so i've already covered i apologize to go to paul
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:11.440]  watson paul joseph watson is here we appreciate him joining us paul what do you have in your raft i know
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:18.000]  of incredibly important information well i mean just picking up on what you just said that girl in
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.360]  that video actually did an interview with teen vogue because they made her into a big superstar again
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:30.000]  with a 70 iq she said quote capitalism is evil okay so she's got she's sipping on a star books or
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  whatever she's got her head buried in a smartphone but capitalism's evil okay so it was a very bizarre
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.360]  how they how they turned the whole thing into a meme but again you were right it's the oh we found them
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.600]  deleting a video this must be scandalous it's like it's not even that interesting of a video but
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:54.480]  they've turned her into a superstar so if that's the best they've got the sailor socialists then
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:01.040]  that they're struggling pretty hard but alex you were talking about energy and trump um
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.080]  trump obviously doesn't drink alcohol i like a drink you know you like a drink most of us like
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.640]  a drink i like to have a laugh with my friends i think a lot of what we need to move towards with
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:17.280]  info wars aside from the politics is basically you know info wars lifestyle and just teaching young
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.880]  people how to live you know there's a there's an art to living and one of those things is to
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.720]  you know try and get off alcohol at least for a certain amount of time you can go out with your
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.680]  friends you can have a laugh you know alex i haven't drunk alcohol for a week i like to drink you
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.400]  know a couple of times a week normally feel like a completely different person you're talking about
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.200]  trump being on energy of course trump doesn't drink because his brother died of alcohol poisoning
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.400]  just feel like a totally different person alex so i think increasingly and tell me if you agree
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.720]  we need to move towards advising young people on simply the art of living i didn't even know you've
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.960]  done this i didn't even know you've done this guess what i did a week ago the crew knows about it
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:03.920]  guess what i did a week ago yeah i mean you feel absolutely 200 better i quit drinking a week ago
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.360]  that's crazy you did it i didn't we did not talk about that
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:16.160]  exactly i mean you talk about energy you just feel like even you're down to your dreams at night
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.760]  i mean i'm not saying it was an alcoholic like i had a couple of drinks and my friends
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.640]  you know during the week or whatever but just your dreams i can just spring up out of bed
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.440]  how you get so much more done in the day and it also relates to social media and checking your
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.520]  phone alex every single day and i made a youtube video about this which you played on the show
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:39.840]  before i tell people especially young people stop checking the messages on your phone every five
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:45.360]  frigging minutes okay are you kidding younger kids do it constantly they're doing it every second
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:50.800]  it's horrible have you ever been with someone in their 20s and like there's a you know the
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.120]  sound on twitter where people refresh the notifications it's like a plot plot plot
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.640]  i've been around people who literally do that every five seconds it's rewiring people's brains
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.520]  making them depressed making them lose focus making them lose their attention span it's
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:10.560]  absolutely horrific oh this is hundreds monkey syndrome i hadn't told you this yet but i've told
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.120]  the crew i want to go full on against cell phones full on against the manipulation of dopamine
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.440]  how the globalists submit the social engineering and launch the anti-transhumanist movement
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.560]  with a foundation officially and then i was about to call you and say i wanted to change direction
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.760]  just into saving humanity itself uh and because we've already exposed the globalist
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.480]  and you're already on the same page that is synergy that is serendipity that is synchronicity

[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.880]  engineers the ultra rich mega billionaires are against the middle class against the poor
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.360]  they're all ruthless very exploitive people except for donald trump and he's not perfect
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:40.800]  but he believes in largesse he believes in africans should be able to have cars africans should be
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.720]  able uh to you know have air conditioning but obama went and said you can well now the daily
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:53.360]  mail london telegraph reports uk sharing hate posts including criticism of gays bible verses or
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.720]  islam could lead to six months in jail under newly proposed rules well look at count dankula
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:07.920]  he's hasn't had sentencing yet he's facing up to what a year in prison for his pug being hitler dog
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.720]  i actually did one with the late captain a white french bulldog with brown spots and gray spots who
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:20.880]  did not have hair on his nose and he looked like hitler and uh i pointed out that they you know
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.840]  they banned the teapot at jc penny because somebody in the reflection thought they saw hitler and so
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.160]  i said well my god do we have to get rid of the dog you know euthanize it because he looks like
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.880]  hitler but don't worry he's dead now buried at my parents place you know he died of natural causes
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:40.560]  the fact you look like hitler we apologize so this is the level this is this is here there he is
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.920]  ladies and gentlemen of your tv viewer the late hitler dog and then the teapots even worse so
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:54.640]  so paul it's here it's it's now happening yeah the calling it hate fact okay this is literally what
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.080]  tommy robinson was banned on twitter for he pointed out the fact that i think it was and it's around
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:06.960]  this ballpark figure i think he's around 89 percent of grooming gangs in the uk or either pakistani
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.640]  muslims or bangladeshi muslims now it's it's in that ballpark but he he made this fact it was
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:19.360]  confirmed by actual anti extremist muslims like majid noirs he posted that on twitter
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.880]  that's one of the reasons why he was banned they're calling them hate facts they may be true but
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:31.040]  they're still hateful because they make a certain minority group look bad you've got the same situation
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:37.920]  in other european countries there was a 55 year old in sweden who said that migrants muslim migrants
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:45.120]  are over represented in sexual assaults and violent crime completely statistically true
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.120]  but she put it on facebook and was charged and fined about 1200 dollars other people are getting
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:56.960]  actual prison time for this and yeah now they're saying they're going to consider six months in
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:03.360]  jail and in fact they if you read it into the details of this they say merely influencing
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.760]  somebody might be a threat and in fact they have more severe punishments for influencers
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:16.000]  with larger social media followings who post these so-called hate facts and paul this is
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.640]  that is the precedent my told my lawyers this thing now go you're right it's incredible
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.240]  i've talked to dozens of you know top-of-the-line first-minute lawyers they said yes we've been
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.280]  to conferences the plan is it's like saying banned video games they're linked to mass shootings
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.760]  they're going to say alex jones brightmark drudge report conservatives donald trump
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:38.560]  cnn keeps saying is going to get reporters killed even though they're praising people that went
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.880]  and shot congressman scalia saying you know that he was basically a hero will blitzer saying he wasn't
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:49.040]  a monster they're the ones pushing all of this and now they're saying oh it's like fire in a theater
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:54.080]  they want the alex jones statute where they misrepresent what i've said and done and then set
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.720]  a precedent when people commit crimes the liberal police go say alex jones influenced you and will
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.480]  let you go so what you're hitting on out of europe in the uk is the planetary plan to shut this down
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:13.200]  to shut free speech down exactly it's all about creating this new moral panic to sideline the
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.320]  voices that are challenging their power monopoly that's what it's always been about you know you've
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.680]  got the same situation with these um deep fakes which i know you want me to talk about where they
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.640]  now have the technology to make it look somewhat i mean it's it's it's somewhat convincing it's not
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:32.800]  completely convincing you know having certain political figures say things that they're not
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:39.280]  actually saying through this manipulation um of video where as we see on screen now it they can
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.880]  plaster somebody else's face onto a um a template and make it look like somebody's saying something
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.720]  they're not now you look at how the media treated this when it became a controversy last month buzz
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.880]  feed came out with a video where they had a voice actor who sounded like barack obama and they made
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.640]  obama say these things and it wasn't completely convincing it the voice obviously wasn't obama's
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.760]  but they're saying they're creating this hysteria saying nobody can tell the difference this is a
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:14.080]  horrific threat to democracy and then you read down you watch the buzz feed video and they literally
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.480]  say the solution to these deep fakes to this voice technology to this face technology the
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:27.840]  solution to it is to trust mainstream media more so they're creating the moral panic and giving the
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.280]  solution which is to blame it on the evil right wingers to blame it on the alternative media
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.120]  to blame it on fake news so they've rolled this deep fake controversy into their fake news hysteria
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.960]  and they're going to use it to try and shut down independent media further like we'd have a motivation
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:51.360]  to create these fakes in the first place well paul remember megan kelly before she left fox she
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:56.400]  covered pizza gate misrepresented everything i'd said and done and then played an edited audio but
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.960]  it was actually video from the show but it's harder to edit video because you can see the cuts of me
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.840]  saying hillary killed children the bottom of a pizza place when i said she was responsible for killing
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:12.560]  kids in the middle east so they edited two different things together to put out the total fraud so
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:20.080]  that's a low tech way that they do this yeah and they're using it to denigrate the value of the
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.280]  internet as an alternative source of information by using hijacking this deep fake controversy
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.560]  there's a boston globe article about it at the looming cloud deep fakes and the silver lining
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.640]  and they say the silver lining is that now we will be trusted less basically alternative media
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.840]  outlets i'll read the quote the the author says i can't help but consider whether the complete
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:47.120]  vaporization of truth online might actually be preferable to the uncertain state we found ourselves
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.840]  in if we can change our view of the internet from the information super highway to tabloid on steroids
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:00.320]  we may stand the chance at maintaining power over it so they're saying the establishment media the
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:06.240]  legacy media is losing their power to alternative voices which is what's happened over the past five
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:13.040]  ten years and this is a way that they can hijack that to blame us for all this deep fake contrived
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:20.640]  hysteria so they can retain power maintain power over the internet and barriers in the algorithm
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:26.240]  even further so they're openly saying that in their own publications now alex you've seen the
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:33.040]  facebook figures literally websites like info wars gateway pundit since 2016 is definitely
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:38.960]  accelerated in the past three months completely decimated on facebook in terms of engagement
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.720]  in terms of shares it's a deliberate policy they're bragging about it they're proud of it
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:49.920]  we've had studies shown that this can shift millions and millions of views this is why we
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.040]  need to be this is this is the biggest subject for me going into the midterms going into 2020
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.880]  is the fact that we're all slaves to the algorithm drudge predicted this years ago on your very show
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.000]  which is why we need to bring our audience back in back home rain it back in and not have it
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.920]  sacrificed to this algorithm which is what's happening right now that's right because next
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.960]  they're coming for drudge they're coming for info wars they've said that once we're kicked off
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.600]  twitter facebook and youtube we've always been telling folks come to info wars come to news wars

[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:31.120]  with them personally but through our own site where they can't censor us we've got to do what
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.080]  drudge said and come out of these these electronic ghettos that he predicted that we're now in we've
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.000]  got to have trump bust up these monopolies we've got to educate the public but yes they're flooding
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.040]  the web with this info then blaming us in a call to end the first amendment and to end the internet
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.200]  as we know it that's the plan news corps talked about it three months ago and they said first

[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:37.360]  all right we're going back to paul watson right now if you just joined us i'm your host alex jones
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:43.280]  i found the video it's only got 360 000 views that sounds like a lot it's not in each 10 million
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:51.040]  views exclusive megan kelly caught lying to the public red-handed and this is the video where i show
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:34:00.720]  what i really said about hillary being responsible for dead children in the middle east and in north
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:08.960]  africa and then i go in and i show what i really said and then how she edited it in
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.840]  to make it where i was saying that the kids were killed in a basement of a pizza place
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.840]  now folks you think about that massive massive deception
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:32.000]  now again think about the level of deception of these people think about how stupid they think
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.600]  you are and now they're flooding the web with even more the same mainstream media that told you
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:44.000]  about the wmd so the video we're going to put on screen for everybody from youtube is titled
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.760]  exclusive colon megan kelly caught lying to the public comma red-handed
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:55.600]  people walk me on the street they go how dare you say hillary killed babies in a basement
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:02.800]  and i said i did not say that that is edited and they go shut up liar why don't you apologize for
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:11.200]  saying she murdered those kids and then my lawyer went to a conference this weekend in dc and they
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:17.360]  were saying the same thing that i've gotten people killed so this is like the hysteria telephone game
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:26.320]  that they have created and that they've put out so go to that video and you can then see
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:35.280]  all of it there for yourself what i really said versus what she aired in her incredible deception
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.440]  and it gets worse and worse and worse and imagine being the beneficiary of this and i say that
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.520]  sarcastically but you know what i'm not trying to win a popularity contest i'm here to force the
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:55.440]  big issues out to be at the tip of the spear expose this entire lying system so we all have a future
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.440]  i'm not like all these other cowards that put their finger in the wind and try to figure out the
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:05.120]  best way to go for their own personal lives because you go that direction so long pretty soon
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:11.440]  everything collapses everything falls apart when everybody's a yes man when every woman's a yes
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.640]  person when everybody goes along and whatever they think and then pretty soon the social engineers
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.320]  go we'll say mother and father is not a good thing okay i won't say mother and father
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:27.920]  say there's no christ say you'll let muslims in to have holy prayer in your church or you're
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:34.480]  a racist more more more more more more more to see what you'll put up with to see what you'll go

[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:07.360]  and attacks are going to fail paul well the polls suggest they're failing alex because this whole
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.800]  blue wave that would be you know drummed into us for the past six was oh the blue wave the democrats
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:19.040]  we've got the congress is guaranteed alex there were 16 points ahead in december in the race for
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.880]  the house according to cnn's own poll the latest poll has it within the margin of error you know
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:31.600]  they've lost nine percent of the millennial vote since 2016 where is this blue wave where's the
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:37.920]  backlash where's the resistance alex doesn't seem to be manifesting itself in the polls

[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:07.360]  the three prisoners from north korea barely a foot no you know when that was happening
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:13.280]  they were talking about michael cohen they were talking about stormy daniels the the six top stories
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.120]  on cnn when that hostage deal was taking place and also when israel was you know the bombs
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:24.720]  were flying between israel and syria the other night the top six stories were michael cohen
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:31.680]  and stormy daniels nobody cares these are not platforms on which you can win national elections
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.800]  you know the food stamps are coming down the jobless rates keeps coming down you know if he
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.240]  can maintain hold of that now even cnn alex is saying in an article this week this blue wave
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:47.440]  has become a trickle and it's because they've still got no actual platform that resonates with
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:53.360]  the american people at any level because they don't care about stormy frigging daniels so it's
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:59.120]  looking pretty good for trump the approval rating keeps climbing it's looking pretty good compared
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.600]  to this time last year definitely and that's incredible news i saw that top uk betting sites
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.080]  that are almost never wrong they say two to one he'll win the nobel prize and and and just think
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.120]  about that and trump says i don't care about that i care about the world winning i care about victory
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.480]  for the planet i mean that is that is so exciting their blue wave is dead and remember they add 15
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:26.080]  points or more cnn even more in those samples so that means trumps like way ahead not dead heat
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.600]  that means conservatives are way ahead nationalist populace the pro prosperity movement is way ahead
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:38.240]  paul this is so exciting they've got to be pulling their hair out cnn famously would sample 36 points

[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:23.600]  there's so much to get into and i'm getting really amazing information here dealing with
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.680]  what's happening in the white house the president surrounded uh they're going to be massive attacks
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:37.440]  against eric prince in uh the next week uh not good so-called qanon asked do you want to play a
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:42.720]  game it's not a game and then it just goes into the point being the white house chain of command
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:51.440]  mainly bolton was the wedge there trump surrounded possible job that's that that's from a real source
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.120]  and all we're trying to do is turn the economy back on and we see the insanity
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:01.840]  paul have you seen maxine waters i want to play the longer clip now in context or some people are
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.400]  like oh what was he saying must have really made her mad this congressman is talking about we need
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.280]  to stop all this racism we need jobs when you're on a detroit assembly line and you're a man or
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.440]  you're a woman or you're black or white you know you're just people all together and there's not a
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:23.760]  bunch of racism because there's not and she flips out and says i don't like this make america great
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:31.040]  against stuff and it's really really rude and and the speaker does admonish the republican for
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:35.040]  kind of looking her way and saying something to her she's just she's famous for yelling everybody
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.920]  and then she says that oh he's not admonishing the white guy so have you seen this incredible
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:47.520]  footage paul yeah but i mean we should be celebrating this kind of footage because as i said before
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:54.080]  the break it's not working they've lost nine percent of millennial votes since 2016 specifically
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:49:00.320]  because they still are obsessed with this identity politics which doesn't translate into votes
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:04.640]  hillary clinton's still talking about it we should celebrate them still talking about it
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:10.800]  you know bernie sanders the people from his school of thought we may disagree with it vehemently
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:16.000]  they know and sanders has said it on several occasions in the past they know this identity
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.720]  politics ticket is never a winning ticket so we should be applauding this kind of speech we
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:27.040]  should be applauding hillary clinton talking about it because it doesn't work it hasn't worked in
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:35.840]  the polls show that it won't work in 2018 and in 2020 it's a losing game paul i want to go ahead
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:42.720]  and play some of this because i want it to be in in context when maxine waters goes completely crazy
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:49.360]  she's talking to this congressman and again i basically paraphrased what he had to say but
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.080]  i thought that we should actually have what he said in context representative mike kelly
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.360]  and and her bizarre response maxine waters explodes on house floor i resent making america
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:05.680]  great again you cannot make up this type of statement here it is thank you very much give
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.160]  me some time i i know i just heard the the phrase that i am appalled by what's taking
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:14.080]  place on the floor today i would tell you i i joined in those comments and i really do believe
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.920]  that for a person whose family has been in the automobile business since 1953 and sold thousands
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.520]  and thousands of cars to people of any color it doesn't matter the color of the person buying
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.920]  the car do we match them up with the transportation need that they that they were looking for and
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.240]  were we able to arrange financing that was affordable to them you cannot be in business
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:40.480]  for 65 years doing it the wrong way and to impune the integrity of the automobile people is absolutely
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.720]  beyond reproach and so if you run out of facts i guess the next thing you have to go to is
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:50.240]  discrimination and when we talk this way it is a pause for a minute and the context the
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:54.480]  democrats is that there's hours of this had been complaining that people aren't giving black people
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:01.600]  car loans if anything the car dealers are predatory to everybody trying to get you to take as big a
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.600]  loan as possible that's how they make their money they don't like it when you come in and buy car
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:13.600]  cash again and she knows that she's filthy rich anyways let's go back to it let's divide them
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:18.480]  let's try to separate them the color of the skin the shape of their eye their gender let's make sure
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.600]  that we can make every statement possible to show that there are bad people out there doing things
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:28.480]  to other folks and it's only it's only by discrimination that these things get done i will
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.200]  tell you i am greatly offended as a member of the automobile industry and as someone who has
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:37.760]  served thousands of people if you think the dealers are that bad please go to your hometown and look
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:42.320]  at the little events and find out whose names out there look at your high school programs and see
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.120]  who it is it's funding all these things go to any charity and see who's on the list of who takes
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:52.480]  care of people to sit here today and have to listen that somehow this is discriminatory just
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.720]  adds to the fact that when you're out of facts when you don't know what you're talking about and
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:02.160]  what you've never done not one of your people have ever been on the floor and had tried not this floor
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:06.640]  i'm talking about the automobile floor you know an awful lot about laptops but you know nothing
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:11.120]  about blacktop you get on that floor you get on that lot and you work with people to make sure
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:16.880]  they can have affordable transportation affordable transportation rather than this person trying to
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:23.920]  arrange financing by his self or herself we rely on a dealer who has great great heft within the
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:29.200]  financial community and to talk to lenders and say we have a great customer here who's looking to buy
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:35.680]  a car we need you to work with us to get them in this transportation how in the world can you reduce
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:41.200]  this down to discrimination we are doing the same thing every day that you are doing we are trying to
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:46.160]  make sure that we're making america great every day in every way and the best way to do that is to
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.800]  stop talking about discrimination and start talking about the nation we're coming together as a people
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:56.240]  in spite of what you say thank you gentlemen i yield back gentlemen's time has expired members are

[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:57.760]  about the fact that we don't understand what happens on the autumn no i will not yield no i will not
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:03.840]  yield okay don't tell me that we don't understand that's the attitude that's been given to women
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:10.480]  toward women time and time again the gentle lady will suspend the chair wishes to remind all members
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:15.840]  that they are to address their remarks to the chair i respect the chair but don't stop me in the middle
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:22.240]  when you didn't stop him in the middle and so i shall continue don't you dare talk to me like that
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:28.160]  and think that somehow women don't understand what goes on on the floor of automobile dealers
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:37.280]  minded to direct her remarks to the chair and i will continue to do that however i don't appreciate
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.960]  that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:49.520]  about discrimination than i know about discrimination i resent that and i resent the remark about
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.480]  making america great again he's down here making a speech for this dishonorable president of the
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:00.240]  united states of america having said that i reserve the balance of my time that's enough i can't
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:06.560]  listen anymore paul the guy she's there earlier attacking the car dealerships that they won't
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.120]  give black people loans and all this made up stuff if anything they're trying to give everybody
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.840]  loans some people can't afford white or black this is just crazy of course car dealers want to sell
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:22.400]  you stuff and i mean it's just it's they turn everything into racism paul well this is a woman
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.840]  who's clearly losing it remember she said what was it that hooting was writing trump's campaign
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:33.200]  slogans like he wrote locker up and everything like that drain the swamp clearly lose yeah clearly
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.040]  losing it but again it's we should be celebrating it why do you think the viewership for the academy
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.600]  awards for the oscars for the grammy's why i think the audience for the nfl is hemorrhaging
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:48.800]  because americans hate this identity politics nonsense you heard the clip there women this
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:54.240]  african-americans that you're not making any actual point you're just dropping in buzzwords
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.600]  when you drill down into the polls americans hate this this is turning them off entertainment
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:05.280]  it's turning them off award shows and it's turning them off democratic politics which is why they say
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.560]  can this owens and cognac west is such a threat because they're directly uh neutralizing this
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:17.360]  this kind of messaging and it's not resonating with people alex a long term paul what do you think
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:21.360]  they're going to do as they figure out this doesn't work it's in the wiki leaks they say
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.520]  we're going to use race war culture war to control the people but it's not working it only
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:33.920]  works on a small group of morons carry on i can't talk i know how that is sometimes when
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.080]  you're on air and drink some water it goes down the wrong way paul was set to host a little bit
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.960]  more into the next hour with us but we'll see if his voice comes back you know he has a lot
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.920]  he wanted to get into today um you know i haven't gotten with a big thing i said i'd get to
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:52.800]  and we had to play it when come back and then we've got a first amendment lawyer in here in
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:57.040]  studio with us look forward to him being with us we'll cover the waterfront to these just hundreds

[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:22.640]  so there's a tactic i've noticed where the globalist media will take the stupidest person
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:28.400]  and make them an icon knowing that their constituents are a lot of drooling slobbering rich kids
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:34.160]  skinny jeans thousand dollar you know smartphone in their hand at south by southwest you know
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:39.360]  three thousand dollar tickets staying in palatial fancy hotels that are five hundred dollars a night
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:47.760]  to a thousand so you've got rich millennials always pulling up in their fancy cars all posh
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:54.720]  and then paul introduced me to ashton witty a young lady from california that he interviewed a few
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.800]  times she was coming to town she wanted to do some reporting well we had a glut of reporting
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.240]  we've got like 10 different youtube channels and i had said right around that time
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.480]  don't flood the main channel with 30 40 videos so getting right to it i come on then there's like
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:10.720]  20 videos of south by southwest and i said they just been put up i said delete them put them all
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:16.560]  on sub channels i'll walk out of the room a month later this has been all over cnn you name it
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:22.480]  we're gonna go to right now sailor socialism dasha nick kirk koza if you pronounce it right i don't
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:29.360]  know explains her viral info wars interview here's vice the very chill woman who owned info
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:35.440]  wars is now an excellent meme so they say we took it down because she destroyed our reporter blah
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:43.120]  blah blah so i finally watch it she's like uh yeah like bernie sanders i like socialism i want
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:51.040]  everything free uh i mean she you'd think i hired her she's so stupid like the guy that dumped
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:55.520]  coffee on me they thought i hired him because he was so stupid no that really happened that guy's
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:01.840]  real he really hates me anyway so i'm gonna play this video and then get paul's take on it uh but
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.400]  this is what they say i'm afraid of i finally watch it this morning i feel sorry for this
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:14.400]  woman she's so stupid here it is hi are you at bernie sanders yeah i am what do you like about
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:24.880]  him um but he's a socialist why is socialism good are you like uh um i don't really want to do this
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:30.320]  what is this for um we're asking people why they like bernie sanders for info wars
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.240]  yes we are info wars i think he has a lot of integrity i like his value system i like what he
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:42.160]  stands for exact what values stands for um eating the rich eating the rich well are you
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.320]  aware that bernie sanders lives in three she's taking a drink over five dollar latte while she
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.000]  looks at the expensive smartphone at a very expensive deal and it just gets worse i mean
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.200]  and then they say i'm afraid of this i'm gonna have this tattooed on my brain here it is well
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.720]  are you aware that bernie sanders lives in three million dollar homes uh no i was not aware of that
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.520]  yeah and are you aware i'm gonna ask you something um so if they're about eating the rich why do you
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:16.800]  think so many of the one percent support socialism is that true it's very true like who well for
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:22.640]  example you know venezuela right a majority of the country is currently eating rats while their
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:33.440]  politicians are drinking champagne on a daily basis um check the phone but that's not the one
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:39.600]  percent the one percent of venezuela i'm talking about america well and i'm well i'm saying again
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:46.880]  since america is the problem continue sanders were president right and he wanted to bring
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.080]  the same ideas as social for socialism into this country yeah don't do you think that would be
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:59.200]  would benefit yeah yeah but i just told you venezuela is eating rats but i just want people to
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:09.280]  have health care honey i don't want like oh my god oh my god we'll have like worms in your
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.480]  brain honestly i mean you're the one who can answer the question what question the question

[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:29.120]  brain i wanted for you there for here we're gonna come back and let paul watson finish up and then
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:36.400]  we've got great first amendment i want everything free i would have asked man you got a nice smart
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:39.840]  phone then you're here three thousand dollars between south by southwest where you stay in

[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:32.720]  here's not even the same universe i mean he is an abject psychopathic demon from hell
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:39.280]  people around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:44.720]  nightmares they're freaking out let me say listen obama and hillary both smell like sulfur
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:54.560]  oh
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:01.040]  there's too much coke and too much smoke look what's going on inside you
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:08.880]  what's different at this point does it make? i have two words for you can't you smell that smell
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:28.720]  smell that smell the smell best around you
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:50.720]  the smell
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:09:12.560]  you
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:27.560]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:47.560]  Well, you found it. This is where we're fighting for the Republic. We're trying to restore the country to its axis of renaissance.
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:58.560]  Here it is, Daily Mail. They're all reporting it. UK sharing hate posts online could lead to six months in jail under newly proposed rules.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:06.560]  And then a liberal like Count Dankula who makes comedy videos like Charlie Chaplin or John Cleese making fun of Hitler had the dog, Hal Hitler.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:11.560]  They're saying he's facing six months to over a year in prison.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:20.560]  So this is real and joining us for the rest of the hour is Mark John Randazza, a Randazza.com. He's a very respected First Amendment lawyer out there across the country.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.560]  That's a lot of people who are really good. They're like, well, Mark Balin, Mark Randazza.
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:32.560]  There's a lot of guys that are older than them that were also famous for that, that are retired, but the law firm I've got in D.C. represents the bushes in people.
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:42.560]  But they're there representing me on a bunch of these, you know, fake things that are going on with the whole Sandy Hook deal. I'm not saying Sandy Hook's fake. I'm saying the fake lawsuit against me is filled with lies.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:50.560]  And all the rest of it, but this is the whole law fair situation. We're finishing with Paul Watson. This all ties together. Paul from the UK.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:11:03.560]  What do you make of vice and kid Vogue and all of this teen Vogue with this young woman who looks like she's about 25 at South by Southwest $3,000 ticket for the full ticket.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:11.560]  She's got a smartphone. She's got the most elite ticket you can get according to her lanyard. She's got fancy clothes, all this stuff.
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:22.560]  She's got some, you know, rich looking dude, all dandied out. And she's saying she wants socialism, but only for America, but does nothing about Venezuela.
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:30.560]  And they hold her up as this genius and say our reporter is a moron and that we're scared of this interview.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:38.560]  And I finally watched it. Why do you think they take the most collapsed, stupid, moronic people and we'll play some of her in a moment.
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:46.560]  Play it from anywhere. She sounds like an idiot. What is this tactic like the CIA putting up ugly architecture, ugly art to like make ugly or stupid.
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:51.560]  The new I have on guard. What is this, Paul? What is this tactic? How do we quantify this?
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:59.560]  Well, you could say the left court meme. I mean, if this is their big hero, this is a woman who gave an interview saying capitalism is evil.
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:06.560]  She's got a head buried in an iPhone. I don't see Venezuela. I don't see North Korea producing many iPhones, Alex.
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:14.560]  I mean, she's being given a platform by vice. They love her. They've done like three articles about her calling her an extremely chill woman.
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:24.560]  In other words, meaning an apathetic dombo moron who can barely talk, who responds to the question about Venezuela by saying, heard of it, heard of it.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:31.560]  This is their big hero, a drooling idiot who can barely talk, who has no arguments, who is a complete hypocrite.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:37.560]  Of course, vice.com gives her a platform. They give a platform to some other very interesting other people.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:42.560]  Todd Nickerson, the admitted pedophile, he's still on vice.com.
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:48.560]  Remember, salon.com reported on him, gave him a platform, gave him several articles, deleted the articles out of shame.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:51.560]  He's still on vice.com. They've got no standards.
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:13:05.560]  Remember, he shows a four-year-old girl. They've literally taken a drooling idiot who knows nothing about socialism, who knows nothing about the fact that to fund government programs like healthcare, you need a creator class.
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:13.560]  You need wealth at the top. Otherwise, it doesn't get paid for. It collapses literally into people eating zoo animals and rats.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:25.560]  They're like, oh, my God, she said they're eating rats. They are eating rats. Can you do a Google search? Venezuela's collapsing. Their currency's worth less than video game currencies at this point.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:30.560]  This is the end game of socialism. It's killed millions of people throughout history.
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:41.560]  Oh, but this is cool and trendy now because this idiot drooler who can barely talk says some chill things in response to actual questions.
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:45.560]  This is the best they can do than they're struggling big time.
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:51.560]  Now, Tommy Robinson, they want to put him in jail. They've been talking about it under this new UK regulation, not even law.
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:58.560]  Paul, in closing, for saying 88% of rapes are Muslims.
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:08.560]  Well, I mean, that's in the statistics. But hey, all they've got to do is do what Finland's done now and a few other countries where their high court has ruled that they're allowed to rape children.
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:13.560]  So a 20-year-old can rape a 10-year-old and it's not rape because that's the Muslim culture.
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.560]  So we have literal rape culture from Islam being defended.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:22.560]  Meanwhile, they put up a statue in Florida of the famous sailor kissing the nurse and she said she liked it.
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.560]  By the way, he did it in front of his wife, the sailor did. Baby Boom was about to happen. They just beat the Nazis.
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:35.560]  They actually compared this to Nazi oppression, though, in these articles and call it rape culture.
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:43.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me take a beating Hitler and losing family members and losing your brothers and your sisters and everybody and the people that lived.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:48.560]  Yeah, there was an orgy when everybody got back. Sorry, that's how it works. That's not rape, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:54.560]  But let's look at some of these rape photos or some powerful vintage photos of soldiers kissing their loved ones.
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:15:00.560]  Look how evil this is, that man and woman loving each other. This has got to stop. This celebration is so horrible.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:08.560]  This is so evil, Paul. Look, look, look more. Again, viewer discretion advised nowadays these photos are just absolutely terrible.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  Nothing like beating Hitler to drop the panties. I mean, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.560]  But on Twitter, they compared me to Hitler for tweeting some of these out, Paul.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:20.560]  Closing comments on that, my friend.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:34.560]  Well, I mean, we had a situation in Britain where they banned a beach body out of a toned fit athletic woman because it was body shaming and replaced it with these three obese land whales who are going to unfortunately for them have premature deaths.
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:45.560]  This is the complete reversal of sanity. This is anti woman. This is anti human. Everything they do is an absolute despicable reversal of logic inflicted upon us.
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.560]  What can we expect at this point? It's absolutely incredible.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:55.560]  Well, in every culture, when you lose millions of people, there's a baby boom right after that's called instincts.
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:02.560]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.

[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:18.560]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:21.560]  News, Analysis, Reports. It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:44.560]  All right, I couldn't think of a better time to have Mark Randazza, a leading First Amendment lawyer, here in studio with us. I'm not having my lawyers on about particular defamation cases against me by the Democratic Party using the families of Sandy Hook and using others to basically try to build a case to go up the Second Amendment, First Amendment.
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:52.560]  But at the same time, more and more people are recognizing this is happening and InfoWare's has been chosen as the test case.
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:21:15.560]  There's a lot to cover in Europe. Mark, we were talking during the break. You wrote a story for CNN.com about Count Danculo's, a comedy guy. Again, John Cleese, all the other famous comics, did their Hitler jokes. They've had Sarah Silverman do the Hitler jokes on late night TV, but he did a Hitler joke and he's been convicted and is facing up to a year in prison for having his pug, Hal Hitler.
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:29.560]  Which is absurd. I mean, this guy had a, his girlfriend has a little pug dog that she squeals all the time about how cute it is. It annoys him, so he decides he's going to do something funny and teach it how to do a Nazi salute.
[02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:30.560]  A dirty trick, yeah.
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:35.560]  Yeah, I mean, you got to admit in the scheme of like trolling your girlfriend, it's somewhat brilliant.
[02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:40.560]  My wife pieced me this morning. She wasn't mad at me. She just slammed a key lime pie into my face.
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:52.560]  I mean, something else to my clients, but okay. Anyway, this is just a, it's just, you know, messing with his girlfriend and they decide that this is a hate crime. Why?
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:22:04.560]  I mean, it's just, it's absurd, but it is this view, you know, this idea that bothers, that really, you know, it bothers me when one side of a debate decides that it can't win in the marketplace of ideas.
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:12.560]  It just says it's going to try to win through suppression of those ideas, even jokes about it. I mean, this is nothing but a joke. Any idiot could see that.
[02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:21.560]  And for the prosecutor to even bring the case much less for the court to convict him, he's a travesty in a country that's supposed to be a democratic society.
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:28.560]  And here's the thing. This is mechanized, it's organized, it's moving. Just to be clear, I wouldn't pick the weights up in the garage because I use that as a gym.
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:36.560]  And it became a joke for days that I wouldn't pick them up. And I said, she's not my mommy. And then I'd asked her to get me a key lime pie like a week ago, but I didn't ever eat it.
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:43.560]  So it was a friendly joke, but she did pie me. While I was laying there doing flies, all of a sudden my wife goes, bam, key lime pie. It was kind of fun.
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:47.560]  Well, if she had put a swastika on the pie, you could charge her with a hate crime, I suppose.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:53.560]  Absolutely. So he's flirting with his girlfriend, messing with her, and plus it got millions of views. He made money off of it. He's a comic.
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:58.560]  How can Charlie Chaplin do it? Or how can John Cleese do it? But this guy can't do it.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:08.560]  I don't think it has anything to do with what the guy is. I think it has to do with people who want censorship are going to try to push the envelope at every opportunity.
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:16.560]  And right now, it happens to be that this is much more the purview of the left, at least in the West.
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:25.560]  That wasn't always the case. Heck, I've got shoes that have been around longer than it's been a liberal value to be in favor of censorship.
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:30.560]  How did they completely flip since Trump had elected? They're now, we want to end it. It's evil. Get rid of it.
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:38.560]  Because so few people are committed to neutral civil liberties, and they're more committed to tribe, so they decide if they can use censorship to further their views.
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:46.560]  I mean, heck, I remember back in the Bush administration, his entire Justice Department was devoted to trying shutting down pornography.
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.560]  For rappers.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:51.560]  And before that, you had Piper Gore, my God, Al Gore's wife.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:55.560]  And the left was all freaked out about it. But now, here's why they're doing it.
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:24:01.560]  The left before was making money out of Hollywood and all the smut and the porn and the rest, and they wanted to break down society.
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:04.560]  I'm not saying censor people, but I have my comment on what they were doing.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:10.560]  Now they have the tools of social media and big tech. So now that they have the ring of Mordor, they're putting it on.
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:25.560]  I agree. You see this with people on the right being systematically no platform from, not just from media sites, but from YouTube, from Facebook, from Twitter, and now from PayPal and Stripe.
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:31.560]  If any company decides that it doesn't like the kind of thing you have to say, you're off.
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:36.560]  And that's exactly what Mark Baylum was telling me yesterday, my lawyer on this.
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:41.560]  He said, no, they're building towards a total no platforming where you're going to be in a ghetto, just like the Nazis did.
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:45.560]  They're going to kick you off everything. They're going to try to bankrupt you, which they admit they're trying to do.
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:49.560]  Look, from a legal standpoint, I have to admit, they have a legal right to do that.
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:56.560]  They can decide. They don't want them on here. You can decide. You don't like what I have to say and go to a break and kick me out of here.
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:10.560]  But when you invite that kind of one sided debate, when you invite that kind of suppression of views that you don't like, you're doing something that is just not in any way healthy for a free society.
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:17.560]  Mark, I don't know if I totally agree with you. If a gay couple gets a half million dollars because a Christian didn't want to beg your cake.
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:22.560]  I'm a libertarian. I say, hey, beg your cake, but hey, $500,000. Come on, give me a break.
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:31.560]  But if we're getting to the point where conservatives and libertarians are being discriminated against about being able to enter marketplaces, that's very discriminatory.
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:41.560]  I mean, if we said we're not going to let black people have a platform on YouTube or something, they're going to say, oh, well, that's racial.
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:46.560]  But if it's political, it's the same thing. I know judges have ruled, hey, you can refuse conservative service.
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:54.560]  Well, where's that leading? It leads to a total war. Plus, we've got this larger issue where it's going to go tit for tat.
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:26:01.560]  I mean, take Amazon. They're not letting Christians use the platform for their whole program of charity.
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.560]  And so, Christians eat the boycott.
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:09.560]  Look, that's, you know, they may, when it comes to racial discrimination, we do have laws that are clearly against that.
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:16.560]  When it comes to political discrimination, there are some laws in California, for example, the Unruh Act has been interpreted to prohibit that.
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  But that's really not a, it's not a slam dunk theory. It's one that I'm trying to push in some cases.
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:29.560]  But you're right that if we don't look at it just so much as a legal issue, but as a normative issue, you're right.
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  At some point, this, you know, this kind of speech doesn't go away. Where it goes is it goes underground. People will find a way to organize, reorganize.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:46.560]  And then I think you're going to find it even more scary. I mean, the thing is, nothing has given, I think, the extreme, extreme right.
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:53.560]  The neo-Nazis, nothing's given them more credibility and more strength than the efforts to shut them down.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:59.560]  I mean, in the past, when you'd have a neo-Nazi march, a bunch of people would stand around, point at them and laugh.
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:04.560]  And it would be a ridiculous spectacle of five or six guys, you know, trying to cosplay Nazis.
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:07.560]  And everybody would laugh at them and no one would take them seriously.
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:15.560]  But now, when you have this organized effort to commit violence against them, to try to take them down off of, you know, off of any means of expression,
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:22.560]  well, then you wind up giving them just that little bit of martyrdom. You give them that little bit, that edge of, now they're the rebels.
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:29.560]  Oh, I was about to say, or take Info Wars, where Megyn Kelly edits tape of me saying that Hillary killed children in a basement.
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.560]  And I was talking about Hillary funding the Arab Spring. It's in the same clip. She just edited it and then played it.
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:41.560]  That's the defamation. That's the disinformation. That's the attack. And then they used that to try to de-platform us.
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.560]  That's going to cause a major strizand effect for Info Wars.
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:54.560]  Perhaps, yeah. I mean, look, there was a time when, you know, when I remember the Internet companies just wouldn't listen to anything resembling censorship.
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:28:03.560]  The whole mantra in Silicon Valley was that, you know, we are the free speech wing of the free speech movement and, you know, we're going to let the marketplace of ideas decide.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:09.560]  But that's when they were getting total dominance over the web. Now that they've got 90-plus percent total control, they are the Internet.
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:16.560]  Now that the Internet has been privatized to these multinational groups, Google is bigger than most governments, they are now rolling up the trap.
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:23.560]  And they're not accountable. And, you know, what really bothers me is that it's almost like it's an experiment.
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:27.560]  Let's see if we can do it to the far right. Let's see if we can do it to Klansmen and Nazis.
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:30.560]  Because if you can do it to them, you can do it to anybody.
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:34.560]  Well, that's how it was in Nazi Germany. First, they went for this group and that group. That's how authoritarians always work.
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:39.560]  It's a formula. It's in the WikiLeaks. Mark Randazzo stayed there. We're going to come back up and talk about solutions.
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:45.560]  What do we do to turn the tide and defeat this? Because the censorship is here. Europe already arrests you if you say, hey, a Muslim raped little girl.
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:29:05.560]  You're arrested. England's now putting that in. It's coming here next. This is Draconian.
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:24.560]  Our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help. Go to blackriflerealestate.com. That's blackriflerealestate.com.
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:30:13.560]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:22.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:33.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:47.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:55.560]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:33.560]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:57.560]  The American Bar Association is saying that if you make politically incorrect statements, according to their definition, you will be disbarred, not just in the practice of law, but in your own life.
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:11.560]  That is an end to the First Amendment. This is a clear assault by the big corporations, the institutions, the tech giants, the old media that's falling apart, the old political guard to absolutely bully everyone into submission.
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:26.560]  Mark, I didn't even know about this. I mean, this is just incredible that this is happening. And you were saying when you take a political test, you're right smack dab in the middle of the liberal column. And I've known about you for years. I know that. But you're a First Amendment guy.
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:42.560]  And all these lawyers I know, liberal and conservative, my local Austin lawyer, very liberal, very good guy, Eric Todd, he was telling me that he's never seen the corporations, the law firms, the companies, the individuals so scared and just saying we have to do this.
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:53.560]  Well, this is total bullying. That's what political correctness has become where there's always more you've got to do. Now they're taking, you know, mankind or humankind, you know, out of the National Anthem of Canada.
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:35:09.560]  They're taking mother and father off the forms because that's a hurtful word. I mean, is there any end as the as the scourge of the political correctness and authoritarianism of the universities like like like diseased tumors busting open and
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:23.560]  metastasizing. Look, it's it's a it's a requirement of orthodoxy. And that's one thing I've never liked orthodoxy. You know, the fact that I do seem to be, you know, if I plot myself, yeah, I do wind up right smack in the center of the liberal field.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:38.560]  And the allure of the old left was that it wasn't orthodoxy. No, it had room for debate. You know, these are the people that there was a time when communism was something that we wanted to suppress here. And it was the it was the old liberals that said, wait a minute, there's room for the
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:54.560]  philosophy that killed 90 million people. There's room for the philosophy of Stalin and Mao in our society. There's room for that because the marketplace of ideas will discredit it. And to the extent it doesn't. I mean, heck, even they might have one tiny shred of something
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:36:10.560]  that might be true that we take out and use as our own and get rid of the rest. But that's just not how people want it now. And that's what troubles me. You know, when you talked about rule, this this ABA rule, the American Bar Association has been trying to push this rule
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:26.560]  8.4 G, which would require lawyers to always be politically correct. I mean, I mean, I could go into border that would turn it into a full bore cult. Yeah, I mean, I can pour the hell out of your viewers with the legality. No, that's huge. This is this is one of the biggest guilds, biggest professional
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:43.560]  groups in the country, one of the most powerful things in the world. And they're saying you will adhere to whatever our new doctrine is. And not only in the practice of law, but anything connected to it. So for example, I'm on your show right now. And I'm a lawyer. This is connected to the practice of law.
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:59.560]  I'm Oh, you're going to be criticized for coming on. Oh, yeah, that's already happened. But I'm also pretty sure you're not winning the political correctness award this year. You know that I could be disciplined under 8.4 G. If any of the bars that I was a member of had adopted it. Fortunately, to this day, so far, I believe only Vermont has adopted
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:15.560]  it, which is a little strange. But Montana and Tennessee rejected it. Nevada has taken it off the table. So people are pushing back. It's not as terrifying because lawyers are looking at this. Arizona is currently considering it. So if you're a lawyer in Arizona and you want freedom
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:31.560]  of the point is there's an iron tension to quote Churchill guys trying to pull up Churchill's iron curtain speech. There is an iron curtain descending down now across Eastern Europe. And the evil Soviet empire is expanding. And they're destroying free speech and censoring. I mean, this is an iron curtain
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:44.560]  descending. You know, it's almost too bad that the iron curtain fell. I've said sometimes because it gave us at least this negative example of what we did exactly don't be like that. Yeah, because now we're becoming that because
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:57.560]  yeah, because it was, you know, it was one party rule, one way of thought. You know, yeah, you could be a dissident in Eastern in East Germany. You could do that. You wouldn't get ahead. You wouldn't get into colleges. You wouldn't get the jobs you wanted. And that's the new system they're setting up here.
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:10.560]  Right. And we, you know, when you think about just think about like communist East Germany in America, we're going to live on. Sorry, go ahead. But also, you know, at the time we also said we didn't we wanted to fight. We put everything against that because we wanted this freedom of
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:25.560]  thought. We wanted this freedom of expression and we didn't want to live in a surveillance state. And now where we voluntarily given so much more surveillance power to the 650 area code than we ever would have tolerated under the even the Stasi would
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:41.560]  rule over what we've given to Silicon Valley as far as as far as surveillance powers. And now we've also got that coalescing into a way to suppress public political thought. And are we surprised that Germany three years ago began hiring senior former Stasi to run
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:53.560]  Facebook censorship program and to call the police. No, not at all. I think I think the Stasi would would be absolutely at home in Silicon Valley today.
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:39:03.560]  Well, when we talk about England, as is already happening in Europe, if you criticize Islam or gays, six months in jail, and now it's happening.
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:18.560]  Sure. And, you know, even, but I say, even if that criticism is unfair, even if that criticism is mean, bigoted, so what? Because are those ideas are these bigoted ideas so scary to these people that they can't stand in
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:34.560]  opposition? But it's even worse. It always only expands. They're just setting the precedent with what sounds popular. Oh, let's ban the Nazis. Next, it's over going to fire this police chief. He reported that 92% of the rapes in in in Stockholm are for Muslims.
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:42.560]  I mean, of course, like you said during the break, first, it's we can hit Richard Spencer in the head. I don't like Richard Spencer, but no, don't. But next, hit anybody you want the head.
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:54.560]  Well, it's, yeah, it's, you know, first, it's everybody thought it was funny when you said, hey, it's OK to punch a Nazi. And then it becomes, you see it right there on the screen. Now, that's OK. Why? Because you disagree with his politics.
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:40:04.560]  You cross that speech violence divide and you are the one firing the first shot. And then what would happen if Spencer knew how to fight? And then he broke that guy's neck.
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:14.560]  Well, then was it OK? You got your neck broken? These rules are there to protect you people. You know, honestly, had that happened, maybe the world would be a better place because the kid with the mask I think should have had his neck broken.
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:28.560]  But, you know, that's not what happened. But then it expands, right? It's it's it's edgy and great and get you adulation down at the local Starbucks when you say it's OK to punch a Nazi. But then it's suddenly they define me as a Nazi and say the problem.
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:40.560]  Yes, the ever expanding definition of Nazi to these idiots is anybody who isn't 100% in their camp and they will they demand such political orthodoxy that you see them also eating their own.
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:48.560]  I mean, eventually you're going to have only one person left on the list. I was so politically I was so politically blind growing up or anything.
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:59.560]  I didn't even think when I married my first wife that she was half Jewish, what that meant and the white supremacist hating my kids. And then I get to have my sister's Korean adopted my kids, you know, you could say apart Jewish, whatever.
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:08.560]  I'm proud of that. The point is, is then the Nazis hate me, but then the left calls me a Nazi everywhere when there's not anything racist. I'm even saying, well, and they go that Nazi doesn't even deserve to be on the air.
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:21.560]  Right, because everybody who doesn't agree with me is a Nazi. I mean, that's that's really where it's going. And then and then you take you extrapolate that to well violence and and other forms of suppression are OK against anybody who's a Nazi.
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:28.560]  But if you expand that view, next thing you know you're left with I can just Nazi just means somebody that I want to punch if I'm on the left.
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:39.560]  Well, it used the real Nazi analogy. They did it with the Jews and a few of the groups first. And as we know by the end of World War Two, then if a Richard Nazi wanted somebody below him's money, they just called him a spy and took their stuff.
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:49.560]  And pretty soon it was mainly Germans who'd been serving the Reich. And you know, and like people that Hitler was jealous of. Oh, suddenly, suddenly filled Marshall Rommel. You're a Jewish agent.
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:52.560]  We're going to make you commit suicide. It just expands.
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:42:00.560]  Because he tried to kill Hitler. Well, he did. That's a little bit of a reason to get you in trouble. You try to try to try to kill the dictator or even the democratically elected president.
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:03.560]  You're in trouble. But still, it's you did show your little bit of history.
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:11.560]  Well, I'm tiny, but not not enough that I could debate it long, but I can I can definitely say that hearing Rommel. They think Rommel knew he actually wasn't.
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:20.560]  But yeah, they wanted Rommel to lead Germany into a peace deal. And Rommel had agreed that day. They were already surveilling him and then killed him that day.
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:26.560]  Yeah, look, all my knowledge of it comes from that movie Valkyrie. So it's good movie. It's very accurate. That was a great movie.
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:37.560]  But you know, really, if this this comparison, when you try to compare anything to Nazis, it doesn't work. You know what what it's like Nazis, just Nazis, even neo-Nazis of today.
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:47.560]  No, but I agree. But if you want to do a parallel of youth brigades, hitting people in the habit by clocks, calling for other people to have their speech taken and calling to be able to use violence exclusively against somebody else, that's pretty Nazi like it.
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:54.560]  Look, we don't have to call it Nazi like to make it wrong. It's authoritarian. We'll be right back. Stay there. Stay with us, folks.

[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:24.560]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:34.560]  You know I should have introduced Mark Randazza as the guy that represented the Daily Stormer. You name it. And you know there he was with a Jewish lawyer, a gay lawyer.
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:44.560]  He was told during the break representing this guy. And when they were taking his website down off the providers, people thought it was a hoax. Liberal media was like just a year ago, oh whatever Daily Stormer, you're just doing this.
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:54.560]  No one's trying to take you down. Now you have the court case all of it. A year and a half later, take Alex Jones down. You know he's a horrible criminal and then they misrepresent what I've said.
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:48:03.560]  It's bad enough if I was really a Nazi you shouldn't take me down. But then they lie. So can you speak some of the Daily Stormer model? Because again they start with something really unpopular.
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:11.560]  People don't believe what's happening in America. Not even a defamation suit. You're not allowed to be online and you told me you can't get into details of it.
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:17.560]  Well let's just say this. You've been threatened before and lawyers have not to even represent people.
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:33.560]  Yes. I mean frankly that was worse back in the Bush years when I was representing pornography companies. I mean I first started carrying a gun because I was getting emails from people saying that with Bible verses telling me that I should be taken out for representing pornography.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  AKA Larry Flint.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:39.560]  Yes. So you know that's when I started carrying. So people asked me why.
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:46.560]  Larry Flint used to publish my articles when I was exposing Inside Job 9-11 or all this stuff. As soon as I supported Trump.
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:47.560]  Yeah. Well you know.
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:55.560]  But my point is when Bush was in I was. He is. When Bush was in I'm supposedly a communist. And then now that Trump's in I'm this right wing Nazi.
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:49:08.560]  Well that's you know that's a good sign. If the political winds shift around you and you are nailed down to this rock of neutral civil liberties I think that's a good place to be.
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:16.560]  Certainly there's not too many people clinging to that rock. But you know to answer your your inquiry here about you know what happened to the Stormer.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:20.560]  I mean I don't like anything on the Stormer. I had never read it before I represented it.
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:21.560]  It attached me a lot.
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:23.560]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:26.560]  The only times I saw it it was vicious. Is it still up.
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  It is.
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:34.560]  Guys I'll prove this type in Alex Jones daily Stormer dot com. And I mean I hardly ever look at the lies on there. Go ahead.
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:39.560]  But you know what it is that rat is it has his right to have that up there.
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:47.560]  That's how I look at it. He has a right to express himself but also not only is it is it good that he has that right.
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:54.560]  But I think it's good that we let people like that express themselves if you want to defeat that idea bring your own idea.
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:50:03.560]  But unfortunately what's happened is people who want these ideas down who I mean I don't understand what it is about that that somebody who feels that their arguments are so
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:09.560]  impotent so weak that they can't stand to have this website up so they go to the domain name servers.
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:13.560]  They go to the domain name providers and tell them yank their domain name.
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:19.560]  Then they go to their web host yank their web hosting yank all their their banking ability and drive them completely underground.
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:22.560]  That has done more to help this guy.
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:23.560]  Here go back go back.
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:24.560]  There it is. There it is.
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:26.560]  ADL shill Alex Jones here here.
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:27.560]  Let's pull up the daily Stormer.
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  I don't mean to interrupt you.
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:29.560]  For TV viewers.
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:30.560]  Go back to your show.
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:33.560]  No, no, no, it's your show when you're on scroll scroll down guys.
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:48.560]  But I mean look all of this if this is you know if this here you look at this and if you can't combat that with your viewership and you can't combat that through arguments that you can make on this show.
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:51.560]  Then you know that doesn't say a lot about you.
[02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:52.560]  And frankly you can.
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:57.560]  I mean this is I'm kind of upset used to he attacked me where some of these aren't even that mean maybe maybe he's woken up here.
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:50:59.560]  Let's take a picture of you.
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:00.560]  I was just saying I'm a fat ass here.
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:05.560]  Here go back and show some of the older articles scroll down as I know I saw stuff on there before it was mean about me.
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:08.560]  Yeah, I mean look of course that they're Nazis.
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:09.560]  They're not nice.
[02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:11.560]  I mean that's that's part of the philosophy right.
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:15.560]  But you don't you're not going to look at feel good pieces on here.
[02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:18.560]  But this is part of the marketplace of ideas.
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:23.560]  The way you defeat these ideas is you don't buy them and you bring other ideas forward.
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:28.560]  I mean, I don't know if anybody who's ever been mentioned on this site is probably proud of themselves.
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.560]  You know, or at least proud of the article.
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:34.560]  Except sometimes, you know, sometimes I'm pretty proud of the people who criticize me.
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:41.560]  I mean, Westboro Baptist Church did a did a video criticizing me and you know, threatening me with fire and brimstone.
[02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:43.560]  And the day that happened, I called my mom.
[02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:45.560]  I was like, hey, mom, I've arrived.
[02:51:45.560 --> 02:51:47.560]  Westboro Baptist Church is protesting me.
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:52.560]  So, you know, I can fuse all the daily stormers and storm or the storm or that.
[02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:56.560]  I know some of those stormer sites of attack was a little bit of a tax in there, but not what I remember.
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:51:59.560]  But that was years ago. I didn't pay attention to that stuff in so long.
[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:00.560]  It makes my head hurt.
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:02.560]  I mean, look, Nazi ideas are silly.
[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:03.560]  I mean, that's why sure.
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:08.560]  But this obsession with it, we have the new authoritarianism, not the Nazi 70 years ago we're facing.
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:10.560]  And I think your point about the Nazis were the Nazis.
[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:11.560]  Yeah.
[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:12.560]  Moving on now.
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:15.560]  What would you call the modern authoritarian left there?
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:16.560]  There's something new.
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:17.560]  I mean, this is a new thing.
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:19.560]  What do you call it beyond?
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:20.560]  I don't have a label for it.
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:21.560]  You know, maybe we could invent one.
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:24.560]  But really, I think legal terrorism, I don't think it needs a label.
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:28.560]  I think you just need to look at it and see how utterly scary it is.
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:32.560]  You know, remember when I remember when Silicon Valley was this great thing.
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:38.560]  It was going to disrupt everything in these big closed fortresses of companies that had run everything forever.
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:40.560]  We're going to start to lose some ground.
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:42.560]  And now it's made the new boss worse than the old boss.
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:43.560]  That's yeah.
[02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:44.560]  That's the problem.
[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:48.560]  You know, we're down to we're going to be down to five CEOs who run everything.
[02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:55.560]  And heck, at least at least an authoritarian government is at least in some ways accountable to something.
[02:52:55.560 --> 02:52:57.560]  These are completely unaccountable.
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:53:04.560]  Well, you look at how Bezos is so cold-blooded about everything and so mean and anti-liberal and how he basically pays no taxes.
[02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:08.560]  And then he's funding all these groups pushing for the middle class to have higher taxes.
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:10.560]  He's such a hypocritical villain, man.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:12.560]  And then I find out he's in my business.
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:15.560]  He's got the Washington Post calling me a snakehole salesman.
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:17.560]  When I sell supplements that he sells as well.
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:19.560]  I mean, it's just come on, dude.
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:22.560]  Well, this is yeah, this is how I mean this.
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:29.560]  This is the result of letting these companies have so much immunity and so much control.
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:35.560]  I mean, you look at Google and Google used to have used to be don't be evil was their motto.
[02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:39.560]  And now I think if you wanted to have a similar motto today, it'd be don't be Google.
[02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:41.560]  I mean, Google is is one of the more.
[02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:42.560]  Did you invent that?
[02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:43.560]  I said it.
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:44.560]  Don't be evil.
[02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:45.560]  Don't be Google.
[02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:48.560]  Yeah, I'm going to put it. I'm going to sue anybody who uses it.
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:49.560]  I'm just serious.
[02:53:49.560 --> 02:53:50.560]  Hey, get that domain right now.
[02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:51.560]  Our guys in there.
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:52.560]  I want don't be Google.com.
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:53.560]  Get it.
[02:53:53.560 --> 02:53:54.560]  Get it.
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:55.560]  Get it.
[02:53:55.560 --> 02:53:57.560]  You know, they must have it.
[02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:00.560]  We got to get you as one of our legal analysts here.
[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:02.560]  Only if you wear a swastika arm.
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:04.560]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.560]  Not now nor have I ever owned one.
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:07.560]  It's a joke.
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:10.560]  I have an Italian flag KIPPA, but you know, that's about it.
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:11.560]  You can have that.
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:12.560]  That's good.
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:13.560]  We like Italians.
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:20.560]  Seriously, though, expanding on this without getting into the details of my cases, my lawyers
[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:21.560]  don't want me to, obviously.
[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:22.560]  Right.
[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:23.560]  That would be a bad idea.
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:24.560]  What do you make of this?
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:25.560]  The assault you've seen on us.
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:26.560]  Look, I read the lawsuits.
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:27.560]  I have seen.
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:32.560]  Let's just generalize to the number of what I call slapsuits that have been filed against
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:35.560]  people for political reasons over the past couple of years.
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:37.560]  They have always been there.
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:41.560]  You know, they've always been slapsuits have always been people who try to silence others
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:42.560]  through.
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.560]  You know, the process is the punishment.
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:48.560]  Sometimes as you're probably aware, I'm sure you write a lot of big checks to your lawyer.
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:52.240]  Law lawsuits are not expensive and they feel extremely wasteful.
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:55.560]  And at the end of it, you're you're drained and that's the whole point of it.
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:55:00.560]  I see this happening, you know, not just to you, but to a lot of people politically on
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:02.480]  the left and on the right.
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:08.640]  And the point of it is to drain you to make sure that there is a price for expression that
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:10.760]  perhaps you cannot pay.
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:13.960]  And that is that is just completely disgusting to me.
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:17.600]  And it's what's even more disgusting is when you see cases like this, they aren't just
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:18.600]  thrown out.
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:20.240]  I mean, they really should be thrown out.
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:26.360]  And you know, there's, I mean, for example, there's a there's a, you know, in Charlottesville,
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:31.640]  there is a very large lawsuit going on right now against the guy who drove the car into
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:34.360]  the crowd of people that guy should be sued.
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:37.640]  I can't see any justification to let him off the hook.
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:38.640]  Absolutely.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:43.800]  And also the list of defendants is anybody who talked about going to Charlottesville.
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:46.160]  Anybody who said, let's go to Charlottesville for this protest.
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:49.280]  They're now saying anybody that showed up, they're even calling reporters that showed
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:50.280]  up.
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:51.280]  They weren't part of the alt-right.
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:54.360]  They're calling them alt-right and saying they need to get in trouble.
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:59.360]  Briefly speaking of the devil, if you stand with us and buy the products, which are already
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:02.840]  excellent that you already need, all this garbage will not bring us down.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:06.760]  But if it is able to bring us down, ladies and gentlemen, we're confident that it won't.
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.440]  And I'm not just confident, we're extremely confident, then it will set a precedent for
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:12.440]  the entire world.
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:13.800]  But I've talked to the top lawyers across the country.
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:19.680]  They now agree that we are the test case to try to end the First Amendment in this country
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:23.080]  and hear what they're doing to the American Bar Association, trying to get those rules
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:24.680]  through where they have no free speech.
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:28.440]  It's time for lawyers too to stand up for free speech like Mr. Randiz is doing.
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.600]  And it's time for listeners to understand we make it easy to support us.
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:37.440]  We've got 50% off, super high quality, concentrated, fluoride-free, organic toothpaste with 4-5
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:40.840]  with iodine, tea tree oil, colloidal silver, peppermint, you name it.
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:44.360]  The children's has all that in it, but the tea tree and the peppermint is just too strong.
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:48.320]  We have the three immune gargles and the mouthwash with colloidal silver, iodine and more.
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:49.480]  They're all there.
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:50.480]  Super next level.
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:55.600]  We're talking 16 ounces of the silver, the silver salt solution, one of the best types
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:56.600]  out there.
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:00.000]  I mean, I have not really hyped this up enough to name the immune gargles how great it is.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:03.680]  But it's all set to sell out, I'm still putting it out there because I want you to see how
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:05.880]  great it is to keep reordering it.

[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:45.280]  Stay with us, hour number four.
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:47.160]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:48.160]  Go ahead.
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:50.480]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:54.160]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:00.960]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:06.120]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome Brain Force
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:07.120]  Anthroplex.
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:10.040]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:11.040]  Thank you.
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:14.720]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:15.720]  toothpaste fans.
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:20.480]  The Super Blue is awesome and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:21.680]  They are quality.
[02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:26.400]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:27.400]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:33.400]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:37.960]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:46.040]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:52.400]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:58.760]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:58:58.760 --> 02:59:06.040]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:10.960]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:11.960]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:15.600]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[02:59:15.600 --> 02:59:20.760]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:21.760]  children and adults.
[02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:25.960]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[02:59:25.960 --> 02:59:33.800]  and iodine as well, InfoWarsLife.com or triple-A2533139 and your purchase of the products stands
[02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:37.320]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:41.560]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:49.080]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:59:49.080 --> 02:59:59.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.320 --> 03:00:06.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:12.640]  Well, Mark Randaz is a great First Amendment lawyer, one of the top guys in the country,
[03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:17.400]  writes great articles even for CNN.com, fighting for the First Amendment.
[03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:21.480]  He's a real liberal because I used to be on the fence, you know, conservative, part liberal,
[03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:22.480]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:26.520]  They used to call me all these names and now here we are.
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:29.760]  They're trying to end the First Amendment and Mark Randaz is one of the only liberal
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:30.760]  lawyers.
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:35.040]  I've talked to a bunch of them and they say, listen Alex, at the ACLU, you name it, they
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:38.320]  said, we agree with you, they go, this is off record obviously, I'm not going to say
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:42.000]  the names, but they say, we agree with you, this is a really dangerous climate, it's
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:46.440]  like a 500 year flood and we've been told by our boards and everybody do not support
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:47.440]  you or any conservatives.
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:52.600]  Well, that's shameful and so you guys ought to know if we fall, you're next, I mean, it's
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:53.600]  just obvious.
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:58.680]  Yeah, well look, the ACLU gave up on the First Amendment a long time ago, it's not new that
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:03.960]  they've given up on that and then that's back to what I said earlier in the show is that
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:08.000]  people are instead of, instead of siding with neutral civil liberties, they're siding with
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.360]  tribe and you can't do that, you know, right now, the ball is in the conservatives.
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:17.760]  My tribe is the Bill of Rights, don't people get, that's the real universal system of freedom?
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:21.240]  That's what I believe in, you know, and that's what I, but when I hear people, you know,
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:25.240]  I hear people that are conservative now saying, well, we've got to play by their rules, we've
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:28.720]  got to bring the same thing to the left that they're bringing to us.
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.720]  The censors win.
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:31.520]  The idea, it's a really bad idea.
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:35.320]  And you know behind the scenes, News Corp has this new CEO, he did a big article three
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:38.160]  months ago saying, we're going to ban Alex Jones and WikiLeaks.
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:41.280]  Once the precedent's set, we're going to end the free internet and we're going to make
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:44.720]  hundreds of billions and he bragged, he just met with the Silicon Valley heads and they
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:45.720]  agreed.
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:51.640]  Yeah, and that's, that's a scary, scary future because if Silicon Valley, you know, let's
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:56.520]  say, if Google can just say it's going to completely wipe something off the internet
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:00.520]  because it doesn't agree with its politics now and it's very easy to do that when it's
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:01.520]  the Nazi.
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:05.160]  Because who's going to stand up for the Nazis besides some freak first amendment lawyer
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:06.160]  like me?
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:09.560]  Other than that, there's going to be a very small group at that pity party.
[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:10.560]  But you know what?
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:14.440]  When you can take that political group and get rid of them, why can't you then get rid
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:17.120]  of somebody who simply opposes your candidate?
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:22.680]  Why can't you one day, hey, hey, Larry Page decides and that's obviously the goal here.
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:23.680]  I think it is.
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:24.680]  Total power.
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:25.680]  The idea is control.
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:31.240]  I don't think you're ever going to see Google or Facebook or Twitter manage themselves
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:34.560]  ethically in any way or neutrally in any way.
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:39.000]  No, they're going to pick and choose winners and right now it's really easy to say it's
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:44.200]  just these people that a lot of people hate, but it's going to get less and less just like
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:45.960]  it was okay to punch a Nazi.
[03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:47.320]  Now it's okay to punch a Republican.
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:51.000]  And here's the coup de gras, the final blow.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:54.960]  Apple and all these companies are now finally agreeing to China and censorship and reporting
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:58.360]  to Falun Gong and Christians who have their organs taken.
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:02.760]  And Apple is now in China and just has new terms of service where the Chinese government
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:04.720]  gets the keys to everybody's iCloud.
[03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:05.720]  This is Reuters.
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:11.240]  So imagine if big tech is signing on to Communist China, they'll sign on to anything.
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:14.720]  Oh yeah, look, the way the Chinese system is, you know, it's funny that we have this
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:19.720]  comp, the biggest communist country in the world has through capitalism simply become
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:22.560]  a capitalist authoritarian state.
[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:25.680]  And I feel like we're going the exact same direction.
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:27.320]  We're just coming at it another way.
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:33.360]  I mean, ultimately, whether somebody's so-called free or communist really is of no distinction.
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.000]  It's how much power you've given.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  Exactly.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:40.840]  And to these authoritarians in a small group of authoritarians, it can make it that the
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:42.360]  wheel just can't spin anymore.
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:46.520]  And if you look at Davos, they admit that they go, we're technocrats.
[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:49.880]  For five years they've been saying this, we don't want elections, we'll just run your
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:50.880]  country.
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:51.880]  They're so arrogant.
[03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:55.680]  Like, oh, Bezos, you'll just run me, thank you, you're so nice.
[03:03:55.680 --> 03:03:56.680]  Sure, why not?
[03:03:56.680 --> 03:04:01.520]  I mean, when you can have unfettered wealth, you know, an unfettered control, but you know,
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:03.720]  this is where the crazy liberal in me comes out.
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:08.160]  You know, maybe it's the, it is the profit motive that causes this to happen.
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:12.920]  Well, that's the, you have so much wealth that you can have incredible wealth for people
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:13.920]  at a base level.
[03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:17.280]  They don't even understand there's other stratas above them, so that gets consolidated
[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:19.520]  and then takes out the lower strata.
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:23.840]  So it's like Victor Hugo said, prosperity makes monsters, adversity makes men.
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.080]  Yeah, I mean, and the way, and the way that this concentrated wealth, you know, just,
[03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:34.840]  just kind of, it can, it can warp democracy in a way that like a black hole warps light.
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:38.200]  And that is something that I think we're, we're really missing if we're not afraid of
[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:39.200]  it.
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:40.200]  I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm already knew about your great work, but I'm impressed.
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:43.360]  I can't wait, you're going to come on the war room, really raise the alarm club in one
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:45.560]  hour and then we're going to, we're going to meet about some other stuff.
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:46.560]  I'm Mr. Randazzo.
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:47.560]  Thanks for coming in.
[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:48.560]  Hey, my pleasure.
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:51.520]  The QAnon, the new fake hijack QAnon is attacking us.
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.400]  We're going to blow it wide open straight ahead.
[03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:55.400]  Frank in North Carolina.
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:04:56.400]  Thanks for holding so long.
[03:04:56.400 --> 03:04:57.400]  Go ahead.
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:04:59.400]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:03.120]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:04.120]  It just gets old, man.
[03:05:04.120 --> 03:05:06.120]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:07.120]  Okay.
[03:05:07.120 --> 03:05:09.320]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:13.480]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:15.960]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:19.200]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:21.760]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:22.760]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:23.760]  You know what, Alex?
[03:05:23.760 --> 03:05:24.760]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:30.320]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[03:05:30.320 --> 03:05:32.200]  under attack, we need your help.
[03:05:32.200 --> 03:05:36.560]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:39.560]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:40.560]  You understand?
[03:05:40.560 --> 03:05:41.800]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:44.080]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:49.360]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:50.360]  Do you understand?
[03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:52.080]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:55.680]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[03:05:55.680 --> 03:06:00.680]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[03:06:00.680 --> 03:06:06.840]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this
[03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:09.840]  country is about to be handed over to SCUM.
[03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:16.840]  The Russian SCUM.
[03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:26.520]  Listen, please listen, if you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the
[03:06:26.520 --> 03:06:30.040]  same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike in you.
[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:33.040]  The function of all life is survival.
[03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:34.040]  Sleep, sleep, sleep.
[03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:41.040]  We're coming, we're coming, help, help, they're coming, they're coming, listen to me, listen,
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:42.040]  help me.
[03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:55.040]  Your next, please, please, your next, we're in danger, please, listen to me, it's something
[03:06:55.040 --> 03:06:56.040]  terrible.
[03:06:56.040 --> 03:07:03.040]  Please, your next, here they are, they're already here, help, your next, they're coming, they're
[03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:10.040]  coming, please, your next, you, who will lose this Georgian girl?
[03:07:10.040 --> 03:07:13.800]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:15.360]  The Forth is Lincolnveerni.
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:16.360]  Sleep.
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:17.360]  The Seed is planted.
[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:18.360]  Slet-E.
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:19.360]  Terror grows.
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:28.360]  Atlas, you just wake up, and you'll get you when you sleep.
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:29.360]  Sit-up.
[03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:30.360]  Invasion of the body-snatchers.
[03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:31.360]  Tommy.
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:32.360]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:34.360]  The fear begins to grow.
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:36.360]  We're being cornered.
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:39.360]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:41.360]  Ibarricating the street.
[03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:44.360]  Invasion of the Body Sanctals.
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:08:12.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:14.360 --> 03:08:17.360]  Alright, well QAnon's been around for about a year.
[03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:22.360]  Got real big in the last eight months or so on these different message boards online.
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:24.360]  And some of what QAnon said was accurate.
[03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:25.360]  Some of it wasn't.
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:29.360]  I mean by December we were going to have Hillary Clinton in a FEMA camp.
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:30.360]  That hasn't happened.
[03:08:30.360 --> 03:08:33.360]  They'll put out a photo of Singapore and saying,
[03:08:33.360 --> 03:08:36.360]  here's where the meeting is going to be two days after it's announced.
[03:08:36.360 --> 03:08:38.360]  So that's the latest thing.
[03:08:38.360 --> 03:08:43.360]  We give you sources like Dr. Jerome Corsi who's written three number one New York Times bestselling books
[03:08:43.360 --> 03:08:45.360]  One elections, gotten elections changed.
[03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:47.360]  One elections.
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:52.360]  We have guests like Rand Paul, like Donald Trump.
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:55.360]  And we have all these guests behind the scenes, all this intel.
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:58.360]  And we have sources without getting into too many specifics.
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:07.360]  Currently in Dev Group, formerly in Dev Group, in the CIA, covert action, direct action, analysis.
[03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:09.360]  All of it who were patriots.
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:15.360]  And we know that Trump was recruited two years before he ran by these groups who decided not to run a coup against Obama,
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:19.360]  but to try to run an operational information war to reboot the Republic.
[03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:24.360]  And so I'd ask Corsi, because two months ago I told Corsi, I said,
[03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:26.360]  I think QAnon's been compromised.
[03:09:26.360 --> 03:09:35.360]  And I'm getting information from my Pentagon sources who knew some of the people in kind of a consortium who agreed to put out information out of CENTCOM in Florida
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:41.360]  that they thought was informative via this pen name QAnon.
[03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:46.360]  And then a few weeks ago I told Corsi, I said, I don't want to report on this anymore,
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:50.360]  because I think it's a load of bull and it's been compromised for my sources.
[03:09:50.360 --> 03:09:53.360]  Well, I talked to one of our sources who can't come on today.
[03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:55.360]  He came on yesterday, Zach.
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:02.360]  And when Zach's name's known, I mean, his family's well known, he's well known.
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:07.360]  His family's involved high level with Eric Prince, high level with Trump,
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:11.360]  high level with Middle Eastern royalty.
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:14.360]  Yeah, Zach connected to that.
[03:10:14.360 --> 03:10:21.360]  So you talk about go-between in Libya and Saudi Arabia and Morocco and everywhere else.
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:23.360]  I mean, Zach's been in the newspapers.
[03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:27.360]  He's been on TV for 10 years.
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:34.360]  So this is a real guy who the FBI really comes and grabs him off airplanes
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:37.360]  and really sends him to CENTCOM.
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:40.360]  And there's patriots that wanted to say what he's saying, but others that don't.
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:43.360]  So that's a real guy.
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:47.360]  And the same, not Zach, but someone else in the State Department,
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:50.360]  White House Connect said on March 8th, the video's up there.
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:54.360]  So now, they've already agreed in the meeting a few days ago in North Korea
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:59.360]  with the intelligence chiefs that they are going to tassily agree to giving up the nukes
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:06.360]  and reunification in 10 years and starting with the cold plants and all of this
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:09.360]  because Trump's really going to hit them in March.
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:11.360]  In late March, this doesn't happen.
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:15.360]  And Kim Jong-un has unconditionally rolled over as long as there's a public statement
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:17.360]  that we're not going to invade them.
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:20.360]  And as long as they're giving those guarantees by the South.
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:22.360]  That all came out a month later.
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:24.360]  And I was asked, why am I being given this?
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:27.360]  Well, so you know we're credible and it happens, and so people know we're the real folks.
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:29.360]  By the way, watch out for QAnon.
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:32.360]  That's in March, and I'm skiing with my daughters.
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:35.360]  And I've got high-level people, and I'm going, this shouldn't be over in regular fun.
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:37.360]  They go, we don't give a damn.
[03:11:37.360 --> 03:11:39.360]  The president knows what you're doing. This is what's going on.
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:41.360]  And I'm like, well, of course he likes QAnon.
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:45.360]  Well, some people in the White House say that earlier it might have been good.
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:47.360]  You need to get away from it.
[03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:50.360]  So I've been on air saying, I don't agree with QAnon.
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:53.360]  Whoever it is on a message board.
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:56.360]  Now, I'm a real person. I'm Alex Emerick Jones.
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:59.360]  Alexander Emerick Jones. I've been on air 23 years.
[03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:02.360]  Hillary Clinton calls me the dark heart.
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:04.360]  I've been sued by George Soros.
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:10.360]  Been sued by Georgetown University, run by the current globalist pope.
[03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:14.360]  I deliver. I'm for real. I'm committed.
[03:12:14.360 --> 03:12:16.360]  Everybody knows it.
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:19.360]  I'm world famous, not bragging.
[03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:22.360]  I've got 5 billion views on YouTube.
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:28.360]  But let me tell you, fancy pants, dandy pants, QAnon, whoever that says they are.
[03:12:28.360 --> 03:12:29.360]  I should always say about anonymous.
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:31.360]  People are like, do you like anonymous or not?
[03:12:31.360 --> 03:12:34.360]  Anybody can put on a Guy Fawkes mask.
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:38.360]  My son, that Q it up, did one.
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:44.360]  Rex Jones, understanding terrorism, something like that.
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:46.360]  Rob, you'll have it.
[03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:49.360]  My son told the truth in that piece he did. The first piece he ever did.
[03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:50.360]  I said, is this guy an idiot?
[03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:54.360]  So far, he did a better job than I could when he was 10 years old.
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:58.360]  He's 15 now, already bigger than me.
[03:12:58.360 --> 03:13:00.360]  Or like the secrets of terrorism or something like that.
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:03.360]  So, of course, it's going to take over the rest of the hour.
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:05.360]  It's just anybody can put on a Guy Fawkes mask.
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:07.360]  Was QAnon real before?
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:10.360]  Yeah, I told it was a group of guys doing it.
[03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:12.360]  And then it got, it changed.
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:17.360]  And then this morning I was talking to one of those guys, not Zach,
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:20.360]  but another person while they were playing golf.
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:22.360]  They're like, yeah, no, we were involved in that earlier.
[03:13:22.360 --> 03:13:24.360]  Just put down our comments on what's going on.
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:27.360]  But we haven't been in control of this for months.
[03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:29.360]  And so I don't know how it got compromised.
[03:13:29.360 --> 03:13:31.360]  What went on? What happened? What's going on?
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:34.360]  It's that QAnon, this big phenomenon, if you talked about it,
[03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:37.360]  suddenly YouTube, Facebook and Twitter would let you promote it.
[03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:40.360]  And I was like, that's funny that they let this stuff go viral.
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:42.360]  They're not shadow banning us.
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:44.360]  And that's when I really got concerned.
[03:13:44.360 --> 03:13:46.360]  And then I was told by people, yeah, watch out for it.
[03:13:46.360 --> 03:13:48.360]  So I want to move on from it.
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:51.360]  I'm not going to sit here and have some fight with something called Q
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:55.360]  that's on message boards and that it speaks with all the gravity of the universe.
[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:58.360]  I told you Trump was going to win, he did.
[03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:00.360]  I told you we were going to restore the Republic.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:01.360]  It's happening.
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:03.360]  I told you the jobs would come back. It's happening.
[03:14:03.360 --> 03:14:06.360]  I told you Trump would start talking about global peace
[03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:10.360]  and victory for the world, 1776 worldwide.
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:13.360]  It's happening.
[03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:15.360]  Do you ever see QAnon's face?
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:17.360]  Do you ever have the president on the show?
[03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:22.360]  The president called up to congratulate his wife when they get married.
[03:14:22.360 --> 03:14:24.360]  I'm bragging, I'm real.
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:25.360]  Of course he's real.
[03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:27.360]  You can sink your teeth into us.
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:29.360]  So Dr. Corsi, I'm not going to cover it when you come back.
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:30.360]  You're welcome to get into it.
[03:14:30.360 --> 03:14:35.360]  But I guess whoever this new Q guy is, he says we're hate mongers.
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:38.360]  He talks like the Southern Poverty Law Center now.
[03:14:38.360 --> 03:14:41.360]  Well, I think it's pretty humorous actually.
[03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:50.360]  Now this psi op that is now Q has decided that the best way to advance the music
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:54.360]  is to get all these people hating us.
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:15:01.360]  So they have a piece, a disinformation piece they published, Alex, on You and Me.
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:08.360]  And this Q has just posted them, post 1339 and post 1340.
[03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:11.360]  So this post has drawn out an army of haters.
[03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:14.360]  I'm just now capturing all their hate messages.
[03:15:14.360 --> 03:15:16.360]  A lot of them are, you know, scatological.
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:21.360]  I mean, these are, you know, if this is the group that Q wants to recruit,
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:24.360]  you're not recruiting the highest and the best.
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:28.360]  And if he wants to divide those of us like you and me, Alex,
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:31.360]  who supported Donald Trump, the 2016 election,
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:35.360]  and turn the movement against us and other Trump supporters,
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:40.360]  I think it's pretty obvious that now Q's true role is coming out.
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:43.360]  And Q talks like the Southern Poverty Law Center or ADL now.
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:45.360]  And let's understand that.
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:47.360]  We helped get Trump get elected.
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:50.360]  Now this imaginary person is the Trump defender.
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:51.360]  It says we're bad.
[03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:53.360]  Good luck with that, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:15:53.360 --> 03:15:55.360]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:55.360 --> 03:15:57.360]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[03:15:57.360 --> 03:16:00.360]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:02.360]  Finally, someone has come out and written
[03:16:02.360 --> 03:16:05.360]  what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:07.360]  We're in a constitutional crisis,
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:11.360]  and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:13.360]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks,
[03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:14.360]  doesn't mean other people are.

[03:19:49.360 --> 03:19:53.360]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:19:57.360 --> 03:20:00.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:00.360 --> 03:20:22.360]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:22.360 --> 03:20:33.360]  This is Drone Corsi, and I'm going to have the next hour here where we can look at some new developing intelligence
[03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:39.360]  that I think is important to understand the most critical developments going on in Donald Trump's,
[03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:43.360]  basically defensive as presidency.
[03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:50.360]  I'm seeing, by the way, we've got just these new posts from Q attacking Alex Jones and me directly.
[03:20:50.360 --> 03:20:56.360]  I think this is a PSYOP operation. We're not going to discuss it in length.
[03:20:56.360 --> 03:20:58.360]  I'll discuss it on Twitter.
[03:20:58.360 --> 03:21:05.360]  I'm encouraging everyone who's impressed by this new queue to continue the
[03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:09.360]  scatological kinds of abuse you're doing attacking me.
[03:21:09.360 --> 03:21:15.360]  It's kind of amusing when I look back at the attacks I've had on unfit for command in 2004
[03:21:15.360 --> 03:21:22.360]  and then in 2008, it goes on with the Obama Nation when I oppose Barack Obama.
[03:21:22.360 --> 03:21:30.360]  It looks like the same group of Soros and Saul Alinsky communists have joined the Q movement
[03:21:30.360 --> 03:21:34.360]  because I've got to say kind of abuse I got in writing those books.
[03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:38.360]  I mean, it's actually kind of abusing.
[03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:43.360]  And if this is what Q wants for his supporters, if this is where Q is headed,
[03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:50.360]  I think it's just proving the points that we're making today in that this is not a way to support Donald Trump
[03:21:50.360 --> 03:21:59.360]  by dividing the movement by getting one group of extreme haters to express their views and terms
[03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:03.360]  that would not be allowed at any acceptable party or gathering.
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:09.360]  I mean, if this is the nature of what the Q support is all about,
[03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:13.360]  I doubt Donald Trump would want to have anything to do with it.
[03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:15.360]  So go ahead and distinguish yourselves.
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:19.360]  I don't watch it all day and I may toy with it for a while,
[03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:24.360]  bat it back and forth and see if I can't get it to go into even more of a frenzy.
[03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:27.360]  But you're doing a pretty good job with it right now, Q supporters.
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:29.360]  Just keep at it.
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:34.360]  I'm having a good time with it and I'm sure you're going to ruin me just like they ruined me
[03:22:34.360 --> 03:22:39.360]  and unfit for command and made 30 other books.
[03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:43.360]  This is not my first rodeo through this hate campaign, but have at it.
[03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:45.360]  Let's see how good you guys are.
[03:22:45.360 --> 03:22:52.360]  Now, what I really wanted to take in this article, this hour, is really not to waste time with more false Q stuff.
[03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:54.360]  You guys can all figure out yourself.
[03:22:54.360 --> 03:23:00.360]  I decided for myself that I was done trying to support Q.
[03:23:00.360 --> 03:23:04.360]  I think when it did change or when I perceived a change,
[03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:10.360]  I'm not going to support a site op that's designed to divide the movement and destroy Donald Trump.
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:19.360]  I'm going to just now continue with what we see as real information here to bring this to you on a current basis.
[03:23:19.360 --> 03:23:26.360]  Because I don't think we need Q any longer to really give us open source information with riddles.
[03:23:26.360 --> 03:23:35.360]  There's an article that has been posted by Zero Hedge and it's keying off of a very important article that's on the Wall Street Journal.
[03:23:35.360 --> 03:23:43.360]  As many of you know, we've been following the investigation of Mueller into the Special Prosecutor,
[03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:55.360]  and issues arisen in which the FBI and the Department of Justice are refusing to turn over to Dennis Nunes in the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:23:55.360 --> 03:23:59.360]  And to the Congress in general.
[03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:04.360]  It looks like maybe up to a million pages of FBI and Department of Justice records.
[03:24:04.360 --> 03:24:10.360]  And in fact, Rosenstein went on record as saying that he wasn't going to be extorted.
[03:24:10.360 --> 03:24:19.360]  He was not going to do anything that he needed to do, that he was compromised, the agency, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:27.360]  Well, what it turns out, I think, and this I think is really the shocking part of this, is that there is a...
[03:24:27.360 --> 03:24:33.360]  It is now clearly admitted, Wall Street Journal picked up on it. Nunes has broadcast it.
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:40.360]  The FBI had a mole inside the campaign of Donald Trump.
[03:24:40.360 --> 03:24:51.360]  So the FBI, now we're talking about, again, the deep state conspirators. People like Andrew McCabe, who was number two under Comey,
[03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:55.360]  James Comey himself, who had to know about this mole.
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:25:02.360]  We're also talking about Strozik and Page, Strozik headed the counterintelligence operation.
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:04.360]  These are all college educated.
[03:25:04.360 --> 03:25:08.360]  These are not the FBI that went out and caught bank robbers.
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:17.360]  And what they did decided to do in their New World Order insanity, they don't want no borders, their love of Hillary Clinton,
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:20.360]  decided they were going to commit treason.
[03:25:20.360 --> 03:25:25.360]  And they got a mole placed within Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:35.360]  Now, what the article I think says clearly is that this spells that, in fact, the FBI was spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:38.360]  And it's spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:47.360]  That's never been done by an official Justice Department agency personnel in the history of the nation.
[03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:50.360]  Not only spying, but then leaking to the press.
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:58.360]  I mean, committing any number of crimes using the Fusion GPS dossier, which James Comey told Congress,
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:11.360]  could not be authenticated, could not be validated as the basis for an agreement of warrant to go ahead and have electronic surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:15.360]  Now, the mole, I think the mole is Carter Page.
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:20.360]  And Carter Page was a former FBI paid informant.
[03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:22.360]  We can see that from 2015.
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:31.360]  And what his job as a mole, as a spy, was to go into the Trump campaign and talk to everybody he could talk to about Russia.
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:39.360]  Because you see under the rules of FISA electronic surveillance, the warrant was issued only on Carter Page.
[03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:48.360]  But anybody Carter Page talked to, including Jeff Sessions or any of the other campaign officials, as collateral,
[03:26:48.360 --> 03:26:55.360]  could now suddenly be under electronic surveillance by the Department of Justice.
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:27:06.360]  We don't know how many of Donald Trump's campaign were under electronic surveillance, but I bet most of all the top officials.
[03:27:06.360 --> 03:27:22.360]  And then the electronic surveillance, we now know, continued at least through an extension in July 2017 that Rod Rosenstein gave it, which means that the FBI and the Department of Justice were conducting electronic surveillance
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:32.360]  on Donald Trump through the first year of Donald Trump's presidency with the goal of trying to impeach Donald Trump.
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:36.360]  This is a coup d'etat based on false premises.
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:50.360]  Now, this is why Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions, and I do not trust Jeff Sessions, why they both want to keep these papers from Congress.
[03:27:50.360 --> 03:27:57.360]  Because the moment these papers are at Congress, Congress is going to realize that there's been a conspiracy involving even Mueller,
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:03.360]  who Comey consulted with after he was fired, as to what Comey should do.
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:15.360]  And what Donald Trump should do right now in order to preserve these documents, I think, is over the weekend, somehow or other, secure them so these documents aren't destroyed.
[03:28:15.360 --> 03:28:17.360]  There's a million pages there.
[03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:24.360]  Donald Trump ought to make sure, even if he needs to send in military troops, that these papers are preserved.
[03:28:24.360 --> 03:28:32.360]  Because once these papers are made public or made available to Congress, these papers, the Department of Justice and the FBI,
[03:28:32.360 --> 03:28:41.360]  Mueller's investigation is finished, and the coup d'etat criminals are going to have to face justice in Donald Trump's counterattack.
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:56.360]  This could not be more important breaking news, and it's developing right now.
[03:29:12.360 --> 03:29:30.360]  Healthcare reform is confusing. But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions,
[03:29:30.360 --> 03:29:37.360]  navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge. Control your own healthcare costs and choices with Liberty Health Share.

[03:33:14.360 --> 03:33:25.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:38.360]  This is John Corsi and I'm doing this hour to try to bring to you some of the most recent intelligence that we're getting on how Donald Trump is planning to fire,
[03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:46.360]  first of all Mueller, the special counselor, secondly Rod Rosenstein, number two in the Justice Department and third Jeff Sessions.
[03:33:46.360 --> 03:33:56.360]  I think the plan is developing very fast. If you just stay with me, we'll be able to show you the several dimensions of this developing plan.
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:34:17.360]  The first one being that we now know that the FBI hit a mole, a spy, within Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 while they were utilizing this fake Russian dossier in order to develop the idea of Russian collusion,
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:28.360]  which so far has not developed in any serious indictments. I'll talk in the next segment about the one indictment that has resulted from that. It does not look like it will result in a conviction.
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:38.360]  But at any rate, there's a million pages that the FBI is refusing to turn over to Congress and Dennis Nunes has been demanding it.
[03:34:38.360 --> 03:34:50.360]  And so far, Rosenstein even gave a little speech saying, stamping his foot and saying, I'm not going to be extorted into giving to Congress anything which I'm not supposed to give.
[03:34:50.360 --> 03:35:01.360]  Well, Rod Rosenstein then got a lecture on how the fact is that Congress has oversight rights over the FBI and the Department of Justice, and they can demand these papers.
[03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:21.360]  So it's essentially not a standoff, but it's a refusal by Rosenstein to do his job, comply with the congressional oversight request, which has led Congress both to develop articles of impeachment for Rosenstein and contempt charges for Jeff Sessions.
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:40.360]  Now, why they don't want to turn these pages over is because it's developing a couple of stories. One was in the Wall Street Journal, another in Zero Hedge today, in which Zero Hedge made it clear that in a meeting with the FBI and
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:53.360]  Dennis Nunes, who is the GOP head of the House Intelligence Committee, the FBI blinked that allowed Nunes and his staff to begin reviewing these million pages.
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:36:14.360]  Now, Nunes evidently figured out the name of the mole, and this is I think the first step towards turning the tables because once the mole is identified, once we know that the, you know, if you think about it for a minute, once we know that the Department of Justice and the FBI,
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:29.360]  and I say this conspiracy started within the FBI, this coup d'etat conspiracy, where Strozik and Page started exchanging these messages and deciding they were not going to let Donald Trump be president.
[03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:45.360]  Then they advanced this fusion GPS dossier, which Comey said told Congress under oath could not be authenticated by the Department of Justice, yet they used it as evidence in part of Russian collusion, something which, by the way, is not even a crime.
[03:36:45.360 --> 03:36:48.360]  There's no crime of Russian collusion.
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:37:04.360]  And now we know they went so far as to put a mole. I think the mole is this Carter Page, who in 2015 had played a role with the Department of Justice and another sting operation on Russia involving U.S. citizens.
[03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:24.360]  Now, this whole plot means that the FBI and Department of Justice went so far as to not only do electronic surveillance Donald Trump's campaign on a false pretense, but spy within the middle of them, but continue the electronic surveillance with
[03:37:24.360 --> 03:37:39.360]  what Rosenstein is doing, an extension of it, July 2017. So they were collecting data, the FBI and the Department of Justice on Donald Trump's campaign while Donald Trump was president.
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:56.360]  Now, if we go one level deeper into the story, what you're going to find out, this came in, I think the conservative treehouse did a good job and supports a lot of the intelligence that I've been given about the operation being one that
[03:37:56.360 --> 03:38:18.360]  involved the CIA directly, and John Brennan specifically, because John Brennan was, I think, the handler of Barack Obama since the beginning. What John Brennan did with his private research firm is they went in and they stole the passport information from Barack Obama
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:34.360]  so as to sanitize it. This was before the 2008 election. Now, essentially, I think what's happening here is that Rosenstein and Sessions, by trying to deny Congress the right to see these papers, know as does
[03:38:34.360 --> 03:38:55.360]  Devin Nunes and Grassley in the House, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, that once the American people know what's in these million pages, and the depth of which a coup d'etat, a treasonous conspiracy was hatched at the heart of the FBI,
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:39:14.360]  and that's the central premise of my book, Killing the Deep State. You can get that deep state premise in your heads that the Department of Justice, supposedly there for law, went so deeply rogue that they thought they could begin breaking laws
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:31.360]  in order to get Donald Trump impeached. That's the heart of what we're talking about. And Mueller was, again, put in place to have the first round in which he was going to impeach Donald Trump.
[03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:48.360]  The problem is that Mueller's failed in his assignment because Donald Trump was not guilty of Russian collusion. And if these pages get brought forward, and we see the involvement not only of Rosenstein, Comey, McCabe,
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:40:01.360]  Strozik, and dozens of others in the FBI and Department of Justice, but extending over into John Brennan at the CIA. This is a giant criminal conspiracy we know goes all the way up to Obama and Hillary that ordered it.
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:09.360]  Let me just stop you there. I was going to take over in the next segment, but I've been sitting here watching and listening to you. I just wanted to add something here about the whole Q&A thing that I said we were going to get away from.
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:19.360]  I had a chance to read that latest work of fiction. We just were moving away from it because we could see dozens of the predictions didn't come true. We got attacked.
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:29.360]  Now, whoever this Q latest cutout is, is saying we attacked them. No, they attacked us. They attacked you. We're not good Trump supporters. We're actually Hillary supporters.
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:40.360]  That's why Hillary has people suing us or calls me Dark Carter. You know, all this crap. We're real people. These are our names. We're here. So I demand whoever the cutout is Q, prove who you are, Q.
[03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:51.360]  Prove who you are. Come on the show then as a real boy, not Pinocchio, but a real boy in the real world, but you have to tell the truth and risk your life yet before the little fairy makes you a real boy.
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:41:00.360]  See, Dr. Corsi is a real boy. I'm a real boy. 24 years on air. Corsi decades fighting the globalist. Bestselling books. One of the top advisors to Lou Dobbs.
[03:41:00.360 --> 03:41:08.360]  Exposing the whole new world order. The whole globalism. Worldwide, we're there exposing it with Ron Paul and others have a whole global system works.
[03:41:08.360 --> 03:41:15.360]  How the new world order operates. How the nation state could be rebooted to come back and now it's happening. The world, us and our listeners built.
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:24.360]  We're the resistance and you came along, I know, and you were going to teach us all anonymously on some message board how the cow ate the cabbage and some of what you said was true.
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:32.360]  Like, Trump is going to meet in Singapore two days after it was announced. Oh my God. Here. You know, let me tell you that tomorrow is Saturday.
[03:41:32.360 --> 03:41:40.360]  Wow. I'm Q now. I'm like magic now. I'm a big boy now too. So I had a chance to go read it while I was listening to you. What a joke.
[03:41:40.360 --> 03:41:46.360]  So we're going to publish Corsi. Why don't you write an article about 20 times QAnon said outrageous crap that wasn't true.
[03:41:46.360 --> 03:41:54.360]  We'll just we'll give whoever that is just what they want. We're so scared. We're pooping our little pants right now over you.
[03:41:54.360 --> 03:42:00.360]  The mighty whoever you are from the Clinton campaign or the Southern Poverty Law Center. That's what you're right like.
[03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:05.360]  We're going to take on Soros and the globalist of the new world order and if Georgetown sue me and all the attacks.
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:14.360]  But my God, you're so good QAnon. You you expose Corsi as an evil Clinton operative and me. Oh, exactly.
[03:42:14.360 --> 03:42:19.360]  Oh, thank God you're here to save Trump. Thank you for all you've done.
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:25.360]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, info wars dot com news wars dot com spread these live links coming up war rooms.

[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:20.360]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription.
[03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:25.360]  But they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.

[03:46:08.360 --> 03:46:32.360]  And then they use their ex president to endorse the resistance all to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:32.360 --> 03:46:47.360]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:47.360 --> 03:47:03.360]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[03:47:17.360 --> 03:47:43.360]  This is Jerome Corsi and I'm going to take this last segment following up with Alex Ledwith and that is this attack on infowars and on me and Alex personally that has been launched by QAnon today in post 1339 and 1340.
[03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:56.360]  Now, one of the points I want to make, I can read of course in my Twitter feed, I can look at the notifications. And what's clear is that there is an army out there of posters who are ready to pounce.
[03:47:56.360 --> 03:48:25.360]  In other words, all the haters. This again, how do you identify a psycop? The psyop is going to be basically an attack founded on half-truths or part-truths. So you get an article posted on Reddit that is this long thread about how Alex and I had had this conspiracy and our conspiracy was really to steal QAnon's audience,
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:35.360]  build QAnon's audience up and then steal it, which is pretty much a joke. I think only a high school student would think that could work.
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:46.360]  And basically when I supported Q, I did it because both Alex and I had intelligence and confirmation from pretty high up that this was legitimate for a while.
[03:48:46.360 --> 03:48:59.360]  When it changed, all of our intelligence sources, mine I can verify for personally, alerted me that it looks like an entire psycop stealing of the identity.
[03:48:59.360 --> 03:49:11.360]  Why? Because the Q who was posting originally, well, I think it was military intelligence who was close to General Flynn, would never divide their group.
[03:49:11.360 --> 03:49:26.360]  A leader who divides their group by taking people like myself who was more than willing to continue to support Q and Alex and I had had our differences in terms of whether to continue or not to continue.
[03:49:26.360 --> 03:49:36.360]  I've always been wanting to take the best of what Q was saying when it was the Flynn military intelligence group.
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:51.360]  This group is not them. Even the syntax, the language is different in the posting. This is very formulaic. This is done by AI of artificial intelligence that generates these kind of threads.
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:50:07.360]  You can see you've got some points being made and then routine statements that expand your thinking, etc. Then questions asked and then predictions made that don't come true.
[03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:21.360]  This SyOQ was actually posting pictures. Alex was ridiculing the one of posting a picture from Singapore as if that was a big mystery after the White House announced that the meeting was going to be held in Singapore.
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:45.360]  This is distinguished by several things. One is you've got open source information and those who are decoding this, some medic or whatever, I can't remember the name of it, will take one of Q's, these Q's posts and just give you all the newspaper articles from which it's derived.
[03:50:45.360 --> 03:51:07.360]  This is 100% open source. Then thrown in with some cryptic things and some conspiracy-like questions. It mimics the original Q style, but it is distinguishable in its characteristics which are largely hollow compared to the original Q style.
[03:51:07.360 --> 03:51:21.360]  Secondly, the real sign of a SyOQ. By the way, I wrote on Fit for Command with John O'Neill in 2004 and we're just vilified by the Soros supporters of John Kerry.
[03:51:21.360 --> 03:51:45.360]  I mean, things that were said were just outrageous attacks, personal, scatological, foul language, insults, threats, saying we've lost our minds. These are all generated in advance so that you push the button and the trolls pop into.
[03:51:45.360 --> 03:52:06.360]  And some people are here really, I'm sure, confused or wanting to jump in on the hate bandwagon, but Q started a hate bandwagon. It reminds me also when I published Obamination in 2008 or questioned Barack Obama's birth certificate.
[03:52:06.360 --> 03:52:22.360]  Again, the same kind of vilifying personal attacks. This Q is really interesting because he is vilifying me and particularly for writing a book, monetized it to sell a book.
[03:52:22.360 --> 03:52:41.360]  First of all, if I wanted to monetize a movement, I wouldn't be saying anything possible to keep the Q audience, even lying when I thought that it was no longer authentic.
[03:52:41.360 --> 03:52:52.360]  I have to tell you, though, that thank you Q, I mean, this new Q for attacking the book, because now what you've done, people say they're throwing their book away and they want their money back and all these things.
[03:52:52.360 --> 03:53:03.360]  Well, I mean, this is classic troll stuff, want their money back, we'll find, you know, I mean, this is, there's nothing wrong with making a profit, selling a book.
[03:53:03.360 --> 03:53:19.360]  Donald Trump, these Q supporters are supposed to be supporting. They just look critical thinking. They're attacking the fundamental profit motive that it's criminal now or somehow subversive to write a book and to promote it and expect to be paid for it.
[03:53:19.360 --> 03:53:33.360]  Well, Donald Trump gets paid for his books and, you know, when I was with WND, we wanted to sell the various Trump mega gear.
[03:53:33.360 --> 03:53:42.360]  Trump licenses all that and the Trump organization sells it, I'm sure, for a profit and they don't allow it to be resold.
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:57.360]  So, you know, there's, I guess Donald Trump is profiteering on the Trump train. Is that what it is? Or is this really basically a socialist attack, you know, profiteering is wrong to make money.
[03:53:57.360 --> 03:54:16.360]  That type of attack is usually left to George Soros and Saul Olinsky, disinformation artists. And if the Q movement is going to be swayed by a leftist socialist attack against writing a book and making money, calling that profiteering.
[03:54:16.360 --> 03:54:29.360]  And by the way, that in the classic books on KGB techniques, profiteering ends up being one of the words they emphasize to use most, bad and social justice.
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:38.360]  That capitalism violates social justice and is run by a group of people seeking to profiteer from class distinctions.
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:55:03.360]  So the current Q lines are pretty much communism 101. Pretty much communism. And this is the first time that Q in the entire movement since last October has decided to call out Alex Jones and me in order to provoke a controversy and a fight.
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:18.360]  What leader, you know, developing the Patriots movement would not embrace someone like myself who, you know, the even disagreements with Alex in terms of when the Q movement had turned into a PSY op.
[03:55:18.360 --> 03:55:37.360]  Now I'm convinced Alex is right is 100% cooperated as a PSY op. And possibly I should have listened a little bit more carefully earlier on. But I found, you know, the Q, when it was the military intelligence with General Flynn, we're advancing some good information and we're doing it in an authentic way.
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:50.360]  And I could take information that I had and my analytic information as an investigative journalist and weave it together and we can bring people along to expand to millions, the group that we're following Q.
[03:55:50.360 --> 03:55:59.360]  That was always my stated aim. Now they have Q turn on us and attack us, you know, some of the big supporters.
[03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:10.360]  I mean, I don't remember George Washington attacking Thomas Paine or getting Sam Adams. Now he's really crazy. He's profiteering.
[03:56:10.360 --> 03:56:18.360]  Unless, you know, maybe George Washington had a future vision and could say, oh, Sam Adams is going to be making a beer out of this.
[03:56:18.360 --> 03:56:30.360]  It's pretty ridiculous. And if I were to read you some of these are so some of these posts that are being attacked with right now are just too scurrilous even to bother to write.
[03:56:30.360 --> 03:56:50.360]  I saved some of them may post it, but you're getting people attacking me are attacking me with such a level of hate, such a level of intensity of feeling, you know, scatological and other abusive references, you know, to me and my family,
[03:56:50.360 --> 03:57:04.360]  because we, you know, I don't know why, because I guess I dare to say this had changed. It was not a sigh. But I guess Q and I not being smart enough to figure it out, decided to prove it was a sigh.
[03:57:04.360 --> 03:57:21.360]  If this is the quality of people support, you know, supporting the new Q, I'm not sure Donald Trump wants them. This army of rabble, I'd be much happier if they were supporting Hillary with this kind of vehemence.
[03:57:21.360 --> 03:57:26.360]  It's how they sound like a little bit like they're, you know, on just this side of Antifa.
[03:57:26.360 --> 03:57:42.360]  These people rocks and stones and they'll start throwing them. Q is basically misguided here philosophically. I don't know if he really understands the implications of saying that patriots are selfless.
