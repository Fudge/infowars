[00:56.720 --> 01:04.680]  it's like our government is run by some cartoon or comic book bad guys now it's
[01:04.680 --> 01:09.160]  one thing for the crooks up in DC to pass a law saying they could secretly
[01:09.160 --> 01:14.760]  arrest citizens and put the army on the streets and do all of this it's another
[01:14.760 --> 01:19.480]  thing to actually implement it now they have implemented a lot of it and that's
[01:19.480 --> 01:24.760]  the problem but now it's gonna really start to wake people up as they see
[01:24.760 --> 01:29.800]  regular army TSA you name it on the streets and now when you drive up to
[01:29.800 --> 01:34.080]  Marines with side arms wanting to do a sobriety checkpoint you say in this
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.040]  against the law they'll be like get out of the car we're doing this for your
[01:38.040 --> 01:43.960]  safety no you're not you're doing this as a psiop rollout to suppress the
[01:43.960 --> 01:49.600]  population during the controlled collapse of this nation the traders have
[01:49.600 --> 01:56.200]  publicly seized the government just like a hijacker seizes an aircraft and if
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.880]  you can't see that the military people the police and others you're gonna be
[02:00.880 --> 02:07.480]  just like the Germans who went along with Hitler's orders or the Soviets the
[02:07.480 --> 02:15.360]  communists who went along with the orders of Stalin and undoubtedly we are a
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.080]  very immoral demonic country no one can deny that fed a steady diet of debauchery
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.560]  and murder and mayhem and a lot of people think it's cute and fun and they get
[02:26.560 --> 02:30.880]  people nice little cover stories for what they're doing but if you scratch one
[02:30.880 --> 02:41.040]  micron beneath the surface if you scratch beneath the surface at at at any

[07:57.640 --> 08:19.000]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:27.640 --> 08:37.720]  welcome my friends welcome here we are it is Friday the second day of December
[08:37.720 --> 08:43.120]  2011 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours we're just an
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.100]  amazingly important transmission each and every day the information just gets
[08:48.100 --> 08:53.600]  more and more hardcore the corrupt private corporate mafia world government
[08:53.600 --> 08:59.240]  unclokes itself more and more our job quite frankly becomes easier and easier
[08:59.240 --> 09:07.480]  by the day and that is to wake up the population to the fact that hard core
[09:07.480 --> 09:14.680]  classical tyranny with a high-tech integrated overlay is upon us and the
[09:14.680 --> 09:19.080]  tyrants are so arrogant there are thousands of white papers and handbooks
[09:19.080 --> 09:24.320]  and publications going back 50 60 70 years and right through to current
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.400]  dates admitting what they're going to do and that's what's so frustrating last
[09:29.400 --> 09:36.320]  Sunday and this Monday I read from a different Alvin and Heidi Toffler books
[09:36.320 --> 09:42.160]  that Newt Gennrich wrote the forwards to he calls for global government he calls
[09:42.160 --> 09:47.080]  for an end of America he calls for an end of the family he calls for the new
[09:47.080 --> 09:52.800]  age higher consciousness and he doesn't mean a real or a real you know higher
[09:52.800 --> 09:56.880]  awakening or consciousness he means they're weird Illuminati version of
[09:56.880 --> 10:02.880]  that the counterfeit and despite all that despite the fact he supported NAFTA
[10:02.880 --> 10:10.880]  GATT gun control open borders total amnesty government-run health care I
[10:10.880 --> 10:18.760]  mean he is like Al Gore on steroids carbon taxes but he says I'm the most
[10:18.760 --> 10:26.960]  conservative and he is the candidate of Fox News Fox News I was doing an
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.040]  analysis of the last few days and went looked up the numbers has given him more
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.880]  coverage than any other candidate and the coverage has been overwhelmingly
[10:36.880 --> 10:45.000]  positive the other night I watched an hour-long lovefest with Sean Hannity and
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.160]  Newt Gennrich and there's no doubt these polls are a fraud saying he's the
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.640]  front-runner Ron Paul has been number one number two or number three in every
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.920]  straw poll every scientific poll and when he wins first second or third place
[10:57.920 --> 11:05.280]  they just don't list him on CNN CNBC MSNBC Fox unified power structure they
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.480]  want to give you control left or controlled right choices that at the end
[11:09.480 --> 11:16.480]  of the day final equation are bought and paid for by the very same interest you've
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.640]  got Mitt Romney basically a clone of Newt Gennrich just not as evil I've
[11:20.640 --> 11:24.920]  studied both men Newt Gennrich is dangerous he talks about he's destined
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.160]  to be president he told the Washington Post I look to overturn the world
[11:29.160 --> 11:34.520]  political system to change the world I mean that's a dangerous guy Mitt Romney
[11:34.520 --> 11:41.360]  like an Obama teleprompter reader social climber corporate sellout I mean if you
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.120]  gave him a memo to throw his mom off a cliff he'd probably do it but it would
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.480]  be because there was a process and he was told it was okay and he wouldn't be
[11:48.480 --> 11:54.000]  happy about it he's horrible absolutely horrible Rick Perry absolutely horrible
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.840]  but compared to Newt Gennrich there's not normally a lesser or two evils but I
[11:59.840 --> 12:06.520]  will tell you Barack Obama is better than Newt Gennrich Newt Gennrich is pure
[12:06.520 --> 12:14.120]  evil he is an actual illuminist he said he is he's made the statements Newt
[12:14.120 --> 12:21.480]  Gennrich is a member of the Illuminati I can say definitively here he is a
[12:21.480 --> 12:26.520]  Cody who is hateful and vicious and narcissistic that has been allowed in to
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.320]  the Bilderberg group and the highest levels of the New World Order and he's
[12:31.320 --> 12:34.840]  somebody they like now I'm already digressing we've got incredible news
[12:34.840 --> 12:42.880]  and information here but Ron Paul look at how he was given 89 seconds in the CBS
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.120]  debate basically banned from it they just didn't want to outright banning
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.720]  because that would have given him more attention on average he's given two
[12:50.720 --> 12:55.240]  minutes and 14 seconds if you average all the debates together other candidates
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.160]  are given on average about seven people like Mitt Romney Newt Gennrich more than
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.800]  10 sometimes more than 12 you can go look at the numbers they've been broken
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.080]  down on each one they've done indexes boiling them all down we've posted the
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.880]  articles at info wars calm and present planet calm as they come out you've
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.240]  seen them they've done big scientific studies and we've linked to them where
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.760]  major universities have found yes major statistical analysis firms have found
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.720]  yes scientifically he gets the least amount of tension unless you count
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.560]  Gary Johnson who's completely blacked out and the attention he does get is
[13:34.560 --> 13:40.720]  negative now that's one issue the other issue with Ron Paul is that even if you
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.240]  don't support him this is an example of the media choosing for you who you can
[13:45.240 --> 13:51.720]  choose from they're like you can choose from these horses but all the horses are
[13:51.720 --> 13:58.840]  owned by the same mafia and the jockeys have been told to pull a fast one and to
[13:58.840 --> 14:04.080]  basically throw the race and the globalists will gauge public opinion
[14:04.080 --> 14:07.680]  and they'll decide will the public be suckered better by four more years of
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.920]  Obama or will they be suckered by Newt Gennrich or will they be suckered by
[14:11.920 --> 14:17.760]  Rick Perry any of them could surge back to life at any time I told you weeks ago
[14:17.760 --> 14:24.240]  Herman Cain is a liar Herman Cain is a liar and it's come out now he is a
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.200]  liar and I hear mainline conservatives all over talk radio defending him
[14:28.200 --> 14:36.960]  saying hey don't convict him by hearsay convicting by hearsay he settled
[14:36.960 --> 14:44.400]  sexual harassment suits that's one thing but then it gets worse for 14 years
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.200]  he was given a woman money because he was her friend and only gullible moron
[14:50.200 --> 14:56.800]  Republican mainline voters would buy that oh she was my friend I didn't do
[14:56.800 --> 15:03.400]  anything with her I just gave her money and paid for her rent I mean he's
[15:03.400 --> 15:10.360]  publicly her sugar daddy he's publicly has her as his mistress his side dish
[15:10.360 --> 15:18.880]  his extra thing his strange whatever you want to call it and he sits there on
[15:18.880 --> 15:25.520]  Fox News and on television all over the place saying she was just a friend and
[15:25.520 --> 15:33.520]  he is so obviously lying I mean my his wife didn't know and for almost 14 years
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.960]  he's paying her rent and giving her money oh yeah and he went on to say I give
[15:38.960 --> 15:45.960]  money to people that are poor in my church he spends it and I heard neocons
[15:45.960 --> 15:49.440]  all over national and local radio going hell loving it's just like his church
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.920]  I heard one local host going he said it's like his church you know when our
[15:53.920 --> 15:57.680]  church women come in needing money mainly I'm just sure he was just helping her
[15:57.680 --> 16:05.680]  oh sure that's like these old mama supporters who still say well he's
[16:05.680 --> 16:08.720]  gonna get me a free car and free health care in a free house and everything's
[16:08.720 --> 16:18.880]  gonna be free mm-hmm and is it again it is a lucky charms creature leprechaun
[16:18.880 --> 16:23.040]  gonna pop up in your backyard this Sunday and give you a pot of gold look in
[16:23.040 --> 16:29.040]  ain't happening okay and it's a nation of children a lot of us are awake but
[16:29.040 --> 16:33.680]  there's still a nation of children who a guy can sit there I mean I watched her
[16:33.680 --> 16:37.800]  and Kane lie over and over again on other issues and he would lie so well
[16:37.800 --> 16:40.880]  that I'd say I better go double check that just in case my memory fell and I'd
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.000]  go look check it out and he'd be a complete liar what do you expect folks
[16:46.000 --> 16:56.520]  he headed up one of the most powerful Federal Reserve regional bank systems in
[16:56.520 --> 17:03.240]  the nation arguably the number two position or number three depending on
[17:03.240 --> 17:10.440]  how you look at it Dallas maybe number two the point is Kansas City had Herman
[17:10.440 --> 17:15.600]  Kane was the head of a giant Pillsbury division which is absolutely
[17:15.600 --> 17:23.040]  skull and bones run Herman Kane was planted in Bill Clinton debates and
[17:23.040 --> 17:29.640]  Bill Clinton Town Halls back in the 1990s I mean Herman Kane has always been
[17:29.640 --> 17:40.120]  there and the fact that we're even talking about him is incredible now now
[17:40.120 --> 17:46.760]  getting back to Newt Gennrich Newt Gennrich is a would-be tyrant guaranteed
[17:46.760 --> 17:50.800]  you can look in his eyes you can look at his actions you can look at everything
[17:50.800 --> 18:00.920]  he's ever done and his messianic complex he is uber uber uber bad news I can't
[18:00.920 --> 18:04.520]  stand Obama the people he represents but if he was to stay in office can you
[18:04.520 --> 18:09.480]  imagine him trying to get things through with as lame duck as he is and as
[18:09.480 --> 18:15.160]  hated and mistrusted as he is you give him a fresh newt Gennrich in there
[18:15.160 --> 18:24.520]  guaranteed stage terror attack like 9-11 guaranteed World War three guaranteed
[18:24.520 --> 18:32.520]  newt Gennrich is burning with evil energy and works and lies and twisting
[18:32.520 --> 18:39.520]  okay I'm telling you danger will Robinson danger danger danger I can take
[18:39.520 --> 18:45.080]  one look at him and my discernment through three alarm fire I mean just red
[18:45.080 --> 18:52.480]  flags sirens red alert like in Star Trek I mean the minute I take one look at

[25:03.520 --> 25:08.240]  this guy talking about I want you to listen to me very very carefully this
[25:08.240 --> 25:14.520]  is a extremely life-and-death situation we face okay there is a private world
[25:14.520 --> 25:19.200]  government there is a new world order remember you heard folks talk about that
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.400]  in the last 20 30 years you laughed at them you made fun of them they said
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.400]  there'd be three global regions and mega banks and they would bankrupt the
[25:28.400 --> 25:33.720]  nation states and consolidate power into a one-world government whose goal was
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.840]  to take private property disarm the public and then break up families and
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.600]  then reduce population and then you notice that on that timeline everything
[25:43.600 --> 25:49.720]  the old-timers told you that you laughed at has happened turns out the old-timers
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.400]  were actually listening to members of Congress it turns out the old-timers
[25:54.400 --> 26:00.040]  were actually reading declassified documents it turns out they actually
[26:00.040 --> 26:04.000]  knew what was going on there were people who learned of this strategic plan a
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.800]  long time ago and tried to stop it now it's into the latter phases where things
[26:10.800 --> 26:15.600]  are going to start getting really really nasty now I'll get into the
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.400]  indefinite detention bill passing at the start of the next segment I'll get
[26:19.400 --> 26:24.000]  into former massage chief Israel attack on Iran must be stopped to avert
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.880]  catastrophe Texas could face rolling blackouts next year report says and by
[26:28.880 --> 26:31.560]  the way you could duplicate this in every state in the union this is just
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.960]  the Austin American statesman due to carbon taxes and carbon regulations the
[26:35.960 --> 26:38.960]  White House actually attacked us earlier in the year when drudge linked to our
[26:38.960 --> 26:44.280]  article pointing out that last Christmases and last January and February
[26:44.280 --> 26:48.080]  power outages were because they shut down power plants the next round of
[26:48.080 --> 26:53.240]  closures is this year at the end of the year start of next and they're admitting
[26:53.240 --> 26:58.400]  power prices will double and you're gonna have rolling blackouts a lot of the
[26:58.400 --> 27:04.320]  time which is the plan it's an incredible article and I want to read it
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.000]  because it's got the quote environmentalist who are really just mafia
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.040]  groups seizing power seizing the energy infrastructure you wanted to seize a
[27:12.040 --> 27:18.960]  country you'd seize its energy and their select lobbyist groups are and
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.800]  companies like general electric are all exempt I'm gonna get into that but I
[27:22.800 --> 27:29.760]  wanted to finish up here with the situation with Ron Paul and newt
[27:29.760 --> 27:37.160]  genrich if this country gets a newt genrich heaven help us I mean that
[27:37.160 --> 27:45.520]  will just be a curse upon a curse he has said he will use the indefinite
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.120]  detention mill to arrest citizens he's called for censorship over people that
[27:50.120 --> 27:54.560]  criticize military operations he thinks you don't have a right as a citizen to
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.880]  criticize military operations they tested this a few years ago and they even
[27:59.880 --> 28:03.400]  have the attorney general of California who was a Democrat at the time right at
[28:03.400 --> 28:07.400]  the start of the Iraq war threatened to arrest protesters saying that the war is
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.840]  against terror if you protest you're aiding terrorists we will arrest you
[28:11.840 --> 28:19.360]  that was in the Oakland newspaper I'll never forget it and then I went and
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.320]  found the video clip of him on the news saying it so they want to do this and
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.640]  they're gonna do it by successive approximation by inchworming by
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.840]  incremental moves now going back to Ron Paul and how he's being censored how he
[28:31.840 --> 28:35.800]  is the top tier candidate the only one there's always new ones coming forward
[28:35.800 --> 28:40.080]  and then people find out about them and then they sink back into the polls you've
[28:40.080 --> 28:45.960]  seen it with Herman Cain you're seeing it with other people like Perry only Ron
[28:45.960 --> 28:50.320]  Paul stayed up there in the top three and they've got others who work for Obama
[28:50.320 --> 28:53.400]  like Huntsman and others waiting in the back they may bring them out as the
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.080]  savior and the public's like will you save me oh you're bad oh will you save
[28:57.080 --> 29:04.480]  me same thing with Obama but now it's being reported by reason.com Republican
[29:04.480 --> 29:08.240]  Jewish Coalition bars Ron Paul for presidential debate saying he's too
[29:08.240 --> 29:14.920]  misguided and extreme because he's not accepting an attack on Iran he is banned
[29:14.920 --> 29:18.920]  from the debate Newt Gennrich Herman Cain Michelle Bachman John Huntsman with
[29:18.920 --> 29:24.160]  1% of the vote Rick Perry Mitt Romney Santorum they'll all be there but not
[29:24.160 --> 29:30.640]  Ron Paul funny over 60% of the polls I've seen in Israel are against a strike on
[29:30.640 --> 29:36.160]  Iran and here's Herat's, Herat's former Mossad chief the one Netanyahu got rid
[29:36.160 --> 29:39.640]  of earlier this year Israel attack on Iran must be stopped to avert
[29:39.640 --> 29:46.680]  catastrophe that's a quote so see I mean this is so amazing I'll finish up with
[29:46.680 --> 29:52.320]  this when we get back on the other side we're on the March the Empire's on the

[33:37.640 --> 33:51.560]  standard time for the Sunday edition of the transmission looking at what's
[33:51.560 --> 33:59.960]  happening with Congressman Ron Paul Republican Jewish Coalition bars Ron
[33:59.960 --> 34:07.560]  Paul from presidential debate saying he's too misguided and extreme Paul was
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.720]  not invited to attend the RJC's candidates forum that's going to be on
[34:11.720 --> 34:16.600]  national television the organization as it has stated numerous times the past
[34:16.600 --> 34:21.960]  rejects his misguided and extreme views that are similar to George Washington's
[34:21.960 --> 34:28.960]  said RJC executive director Matt Brooks he's just so far outside the mainstream
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.320]  of Republican Party and this organization and I guess it's true the
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.840]  mainline Republican Party is a larcenist traitorous un-American group of
[34:38.840 --> 34:45.040]  criminals publicly insider trading and voting 93 to 7 almost every Republican
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.320]  in the Senate and most almost every Democrat for indefinite detention of
[34:49.320 --> 34:53.760]  Americans the end deposit commentators troops climbing all over as something
[34:53.760 --> 34:56.880]  they've been planning forever and now they're getting us right up to the total
[34:56.880 --> 35:03.760]  implosion just an absolute criminal group and you know what it's it's true it
[35:03.760 --> 35:10.040]  is true that Ron Paul is outside the Republican mainstream if he was in
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.840]  Soviet Russia under Lenin or Stalin he'd be outside the mainstream if he was in
[35:13.840 --> 35:17.920]  the Aztec kingdom a thousand years ago he'd be outside the mainstream if he was
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.080]  in Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge Cambodia 20 years ago he'd be outside the mainstream
[35:22.080 --> 35:26.440]  if he was in Nazi Germany in 1940 he'd be outside the mainstream it's you
[35:26.440 --> 35:31.200]  people that are out of control and everybody's got to do exactly what the
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.600]  corrupt politicos say who are just bubbling over with arrogance and and
[35:36.600 --> 35:44.600]  megalomaniacal confidence you people are going to destroy us he's just so far
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.400]  outside the mainstream and Republican Party and his organization Brooks said
[35:48.400 --> 35:53.840]  inviting Paul to attend would be like inviting Barack Obama to speak and they
[35:53.840 --> 35:59.080]  went on to criticize his stance on not attacking Iran and other issues funny I
[35:59.080 --> 36:02.180]  happen to have an article here out of her odds or her it's putting on a
[36:02.180 --> 36:07.560]  permit now said one of the big Israeli newspapers former Mossad chief Israeli
[36:07.560 --> 36:14.360]  attack on Iran must be stopped to avert catastrophe and for folks out there
[36:14.360 --> 36:19.200]  public school educated like myself that means a gigantic horrible multifaceted
[36:19.200 --> 36:26.000]  disaster and for those even dumber disaster means really horrible situation
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.960]  a lot of people hurt but this would be a man-made disaster former Mossad chief
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.240]  Ma'ir Dagan warned last night against an Israeli attack on Iran saying such a
[36:37.240 --> 36:42.560]  move would likely lead to a regional war involving Hezbollah Hamas and Syria
[36:42.560 --> 36:47.800]  I'm concerned about possible mistakes and I prefer to speak out before this
[36:47.800 --> 36:52.360]  there is a catastrophe Dagan said an interview on the Israeli television
[36:52.360 --> 37:00.280]  program UVDA I think that engaging with open eyes in a regional war is warranted
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.560]  only when we are under attack or when the sword is already cutting against our
[37:04.560 --> 37:12.080]  live flesh it is not an alternative that we should choose lightly Dagan
[37:12.080 --> 37:16.320]  stressed that though he cannot predict how many casualties attack on Iran would
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.760]  yield he said I have to assume that the level of destruction paralysis of
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.520]  everyday life and Israeli death toll would be high and it goes on to break
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.520]  that down he said he has no interest in hiding his fervent opposition to an
[37:31.520 --> 37:35.640]  Israeli attack on Iran from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense
[37:35.640 --> 37:40.560]  Minister Ehud Barak but see they know that once they start a big giant war
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.040]  it'll quote have to be one and then no one's gonna say after a horrible war
[37:45.040 --> 37:52.360]  well you were wrong to start this and the big mega banks need a distraction some
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.440]  terror attacks are needed in America to clamp down on the evil Americans and to
[37:56.440 --> 38:04.080]  shut us up and that's why the Congress is getting it all lined up right here by
[38:04.080 --> 38:12.120]  the way the Russians have delivered high-powered cruise missiles ship to ship
[38:12.120 --> 38:21.000]  or land to ship anti ship weapons and a bunch of other systems will be breaking
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.320]  down and here's Paul Joseph Watson's article indefinite detention bill passes
[38:27.320 --> 38:33.800]  Senate 93 to 7 Americans completely stripped of all rights under section 10
[38:33.800 --> 38:41.720]  31 and they voted 93 to 7 Rand Paul of course voted against it to
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.240]  allow not only Americans to be grabbed and disappeared and no one even know
[38:45.240 --> 38:51.280]  where they went but it gets even more horrible to have the military quote
[38:51.280 --> 38:55.640]  fight terrorist on American soil and then you go to the definition the new
[38:55.640 --> 39:00.480]  definition of terrorism the last ten years under Patriot Act before the
[39:00.480 --> 39:05.320]  definition you can pull it up to paraphrase it was engaging in a in a
[39:05.320 --> 39:11.000]  violent action targeting non-military targets or threatening to engage in an
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.600]  attack for political or criminal gain in fact guys will you print me definitions
[39:18.600 --> 39:24.320]  of terrorism the classical definition the new definition is in section 802 of the
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.720]  USA Patriot Act and that's any action that endangers a human life it's a
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.960]  violation of any federal or state law so any misdemeanor and that's why per state
[39:33.960 --> 39:38.800]  every year thousands of charges using Patriot Act provisions and we're under
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.520]  a civil emergency that's how they have a 10 governor region a rural affairs
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.640]  division under the Pentagon that Obama signed three months ago four months ago
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.880]  all of this is aligning us up for the total depression that we've already
[39:51.880 --> 39:54.280]  been in for a few years but it's just going to get worse and worse and worse
[39:54.280 --> 39:58.560]  and then the criminals that engineered it will grandstand they'll implode Europe
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.560]  then implode the US then merge Asia the US and Europe under one giant global
[40:03.560 --> 40:08.800]  bank of the world governments will buy bonds citizens will have taxes levied
[40:08.800 --> 40:15.000]  VAT sales tax carbon tax family tax home tax travel tax airline tax literally
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.880]  hundreds of taxes all to pay to the private bankers total control it'll all
[40:21.880 --> 40:26.200]  be selectively enforced just like the power plant taxes are and it is just
[40:26.200 --> 40:31.360]  total rule by mafia with paramilitary roid heads who love to kill people
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.720]  whether they're a returning Iraq vet or a little girl they're ready to kill they
[40:35.720 --> 40:39.720]  like it they all envy the guys on the team you know have killed some people
[40:39.720 --> 40:45.040]  they all want to get a citizen bagged it's coming sorry I have to announce
[40:45.040 --> 40:50.200]  that to you I mean this is a country that rationalizes 51 dead aborted
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.760]  American babies and says they're not humans all right continuing here the
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.640]  Senate last night codified into law the power of the US military to
[40:59.640 --> 41:05.200]  indefinitely detain an American citizen with no charge no trial and no
[41:05.200 --> 41:13.560]  oversight and accompanying announcements torture and kill secretly execute with
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.360]  no oversight whatsoever with the passage of s 1867 the National Defense
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.320]  Authorization Act one amendment that would have specifically blocked the
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.840]  measure for being used against US citizens was voted down and the bill was
[41:26.840 --> 41:32.320]  passed 93 to 7 and remember this was that we were told in the Psyop last few
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.120]  weeks citizens aren't in it citizens aren't in it and finally the media was
[41:36.120 --> 41:40.240]  forced to admit they were and they and the senators went okay you are get used
[41:40.240 --> 41:44.360]  to it and they literally got a gleam in their eye and then I was watching them
[41:44.360 --> 41:48.960]  when they passed it last night I was up here about 730 when they passed it I
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.320]  sat there in the coffee room watching it and those senators and they were voting
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.440]  yay they were saying the names as they counted down from a to z and when and
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.120]  when they said Rockefeller we were taping it back there the the woman
[42:01.120 --> 42:06.280]  reading out the names goes Rockefeller and he came over and gave his vote he
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.720]  just kind of did a skip and you know with his hand like who we won just yeah
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.760]  look at this republic one way or another and of course it was his
[42:15.760 --> 42:20.560]  grandfather who publicly funded Hitler mainline history publicly funded the
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.200]  Kaiser Velom Institute got laws passed in 37 states to grab men and women and
[42:25.200 --> 42:30.400]  chop their genitals off cut women open cut their uruses out people say well
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.440]  why not just tie their tubes they want to do medical experiments I mean just
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.040]  hardcore and they were just smiling and getting off on it and seething with
[42:40.040 --> 42:45.760]  evil power and I sat there in the coffee room drinking a pollen burst
[42:45.760 --> 42:52.080]  vitamin drink and I just sat there and I watched it with horror and I watched
[42:52.080 --> 42:55.960]  their body language and I watched them shaking hands and laughing and just these
[42:55.960 --> 43:01.800]  old evil people just ha they're just because they've stolen the country they
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.160]  engage in insider trading they give themselves investments every crime you
[43:06.160 --> 43:10.480]  can imagine in your face they're gonna take the bank accounts they've
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.800]  militarized everything they're gonna collapse everything they don't care
[43:14.800 --> 43:20.480]  they know for two years they've had a 9% approval rating the lowest ever 91% of
[43:20.480 --> 43:23.280]  people hate their guts and say they're illegitimate and they're like you know
[43:23.280 --> 43:31.040]  what we are North com is standing by and they're just you want to hear us roar
[43:31.040 --> 43:38.200]  yeah they're just yeah and they're announcing we're gonna take your kids
[43:38.200 --> 43:43.200]  for no reason they're announcing yeah in Texas we've got the average foster
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.600]  kid on seven drugs and over 70% an hour on them look at the new numbers even
[43:47.600 --> 43:50.960]  higher yeah we take healthy kids and two years later they're having convulsions
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.120]  they're on so many drugs and then we cut into their brain and the local groups
[43:55.120 --> 43:59.200]  doing it even more money the more disabled the child is they take healthy
[43:59.200 --> 44:02.880]  kids and disable them and soft kill them we're gonna take foster kids and test
[44:02.880 --> 44:06.720]  pesticides on them till they die and it's gonna be a New York Daily News and
[44:06.720 --> 44:13.160]  nobody's gonna get in trouble we are satanic just just in your face in your
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.320]  face pure evil and Rockefeller walked up and she said she was saying the names
[44:18.320 --> 44:21.840]  of the senators and when Rockefeller walked up she was just saying a real
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.560]  normal deadpan but when he walked up she went
[44:26.560 --> 44:31.120]  Rockefeller and I said he and I saw his little so he had his alarm and he just
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.840]  did it like that yeah like a victory like we're in you know at the race car
[44:35.840 --> 44:41.840]  track and and your favorite driver gets the checkered flag and and gets the
[44:41.840 --> 44:52.160]  win and you're like yeah just throw that fist in there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[44:52.160 --> 44:55.880]  whoa it's good
[45:00.760 --> 45:04.640]  the old days I'd actually scream but I don't have the voice to it anymore I'm
[45:04.640 --> 45:09.360]  like an old man now continuing
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.080]  another amendment introduced by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Diane
[45:14.080 --> 45:17.600]  Feinstein that hip to debar the provision for being used on American soil in
[45:17.600 --> 45:20.560]  effort to ensure the military won't be roaming around the streets looking for
[45:20.560 --> 45:25.800]  suspected terrorists that's a quote also failed so she still voted for it
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.400]  anyways knowing it would fail was like that's what Rick Perry does he bring
[45:30.400 --> 45:33.360]  something forward it looks like it's gonna pass he has it killed behind the
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.560]  scenes it's called having cake eating it to continuing and her idiot
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.600]  constituents will buy it Feinstein was and look for Obama to do something
[45:43.600 --> 45:48.120]  similar he'll probably sign it won't veto it now but it'll have a signing
[45:48.120 --> 45:53.360]  statement saying he will deploy it he will decide how it's used in fact they
[45:53.360 --> 45:56.200]  already did that yesterday they had White House lawyers cannot say we can
[45:56.200 --> 46:01.120]  already do this but we control it not Congress as I said on Monday this already
[46:01.120 --> 46:04.960]  happened a few years ago and with the belligerent act McCain previously tried
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.200]  to get more where if you even criticize the government you disappear how dare
[46:09.200 --> 46:14.360]  you'll speak of the global crown that way take him away take him to a dungeon
[46:14.360 --> 46:21.440]  in fact off with his head just the total overturning of everything America is in
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.360]  your face by a bunch of admitted criminal bankers
[46:29.280 --> 46:33.280]  Feinstein was able to include a largely symbolic amendment which states that
[46:33.280 --> 46:36.640]  nothing in the bill changes current law relating to the tension of US citizens
[46:36.640 --> 46:41.520]  and legal aliens but they've already passed laws basically saying they can do
[46:41.520 --> 46:44.680]  all this before but this measure is mainly according to Republican
[46:44.680 --> 46:48.280]  Congressman Justin Amash a fierce critic of the bill some of us are to the
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.960]  senator Feinstein's amendment 1456 protects the right of American citizens
[46:53.960 --> 46:59.440]  and preserves constitutional due process unfortunately it does not it's just
[46:59.440 --> 47:04.000]  more cleverly worded nonsense that's right designed to deceive as he said on
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.440]  Monday though the White House is threatened to veto the bill the fact
[47:08.440 --> 47:12.160]  that Obama administration lawyers yesterday reaffirmed their backing for
[47:12.160 --> 47:16.360]  state-sponsored assassination of US citizens would suggest otherwise well
[47:16.360 --> 47:21.280]  yeah and they said the executive decides that's why we may veto your bill
[47:21.280 --> 47:24.760]  because we already have that power they're all a bunch of out of control
[47:24.760 --> 47:29.480]  tyrants so they're saying this is a dangerous precedent to have the Congress
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.920]  be able to say you can do this because they can say you can't we fought hard
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.280]  to make the president separate and not under the command of Congress so you
[47:39.280 --> 47:47.800]  must rebuke this but while claiming the power sire though you are our puppet
[47:47.800 --> 47:54.200]  vassal the institution is powerful and is ours to quote the New World Order's
[47:54.200 --> 47:58.680]  in her heart not voting for the bill or in other words upholding the oath to
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.000]  protect the Constitution has been described over and over again as
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.280]  political sub aside the bill puts military detention authority on
[48:05.280 --> 48:08.920]  steroids and makes it permanent American citizens and others are at great
[48:08.920 --> 48:12.640]  risk of being locked away by the military without charge or trial said
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.040]  Christopher Anders senior legislative council the American Civil Liberties
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.720]  Union I already see cases where they're putting J walkers in jail or a deaf
[48:21.720 --> 48:25.280]  person no one can communicate with them so they stay in jail two or three weeks
[48:25.280 --> 48:30.160]  you know it is for nothing I'm seeing cases now where they pull you over for
[48:30.160 --> 48:34.080]  speeding I saw a case two weeks ago for six miles over and they went ahead and
[48:34.080 --> 48:38.880]  took the three kids and gave them the CPS and then CPS found some other reason
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.440]  to go ahead and just keep them now all the time you eat a twinkie or a bottle
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.400]  water you saw that case no criminal record military family you pay for
[48:50.400 --> 48:55.160]  everything forget to pay for the bottle water and the twinkie and as you're
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.280]  going up the door they security runs over like oh I forgot and haven't we all
[48:59.280 --> 49:02.040]  done that before I've been in the car before and gone back and paid for a
[49:02.040 --> 49:05.320]  bottle of water or something because the person ringing it up forgets to see it
[49:05.320 --> 49:10.880]  there or a thing of milk of my kids one or whatever and they just said nope
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.440]  you're going to jail your kids are ours and there last time I checked they were
[49:14.440 --> 49:18.080]  fighting to even get their kids from CPS they're like well that's in danger that
[49:18.080 --> 49:20.960]  you're a criminal must mean you're in danger your children we're going to go
[49:20.960 --> 49:26.160]  ahead and keep them and remember this is a government 17 times we did research I
[49:26.160 --> 49:29.200]  kept saying five times because I've seen that Justice Department number and
[49:29.200 --> 49:32.560]  Newsweek had reported it a long time ago in their shame of foster care
[49:32.560 --> 49:38.360]  headline and Watson called me he said you're wrong Alex the Justice
[49:38.360 --> 49:45.480]  Department's numbers are 17 times more likely to sexually abuse CPS there is
[49:45.480 --> 49:51.560]  than any other group they are the most dangerous I mean you're throwing your
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.440]  child into a the most powerful concentration of child rapers and
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.240]  perverts you could on record and and they are the people that take the kids
[50:01.240 --> 50:12.360]  of course and then five times other physical abuse five times five times and
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.640]  then now in England in certain areas the US they're taking children with
[50:15.640 --> 50:22.440]  computer programs quackery that say you're at risk to abuse your children
[50:22.440 --> 50:27.240]  nothing's happened it's pre-crime what about you then with that same logic if
[50:27.240 --> 50:33.200]  you're 17 times why does CPS have our 50% turnover every year because good
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.600]  people get in and find out it's a pedophile ring and get out you're like
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.920]  well they've warned somebody they do and they get killed it's a huge racket I've
[50:41.920 --> 50:45.880]  interviewed state senators who exposed rackets and we're murdered remember the
[50:45.880 --> 50:53.040]  lady from Georgia great lady dead killed I mean these people are running things

[54:19.320 --> 54:25.480]  your support we are here actually breaking down the reality of what faces
[54:25.480 --> 54:29.640]  our society the true nature of the government running our country and the
[54:29.640 --> 54:34.960]  world the republicans and democrats fight over the levers of power but they
[54:34.960 --> 54:38.400]  are bought and paid for by the same interest and the general public is
[54:38.400 --> 54:46.560]  still to a great extent locked locked in a debate between the controlled left and
[54:46.560 --> 54:52.160]  right which is a tiny controlled reservation we have got to get outside
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.720]  of that people have got to discover that global mega corporations that are not
[54:56.720 --> 55:00.840]  free market have taken over the government and are using it to shut down
[55:00.840 --> 55:06.920]  their competition coming up after I take calls draconian EPA regulations to
[55:06.920 --> 55:15.640]  cause rolling blackouts critics attacked by White House for making connection
[55:15.640 --> 55:20.720]  proven accurate and of course we went over the fact that the different
[55:20.720 --> 55:23.880]  commissions pointed out the rolling blackouts all over the country last
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.360]  winter were because they shut down a bunch of plants and the head of the EPA
[55:27.360 --> 55:34.200]  said we're gonna shut down massive numbers in 2011-2012 and now it is
[55:34.200 --> 55:40.600]  being reported by the Austin American statesman you name it that power is
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.880]  going to basically double in price on average in the next few years and that
[55:44.880 --> 55:47.120]  you're gonna have rolling blackouts because the government shutting them
[55:47.120 --> 55:54.480]  down but the statesman says it's great wait till I read this wait till I read
[55:54.480 --> 55:57.800]  this later because I want to be able to read the statesman to hear what the
[55:57.800 --> 56:01.720]  general public is reading and being brainwashed with I mean it is
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.640]  incredible they make it look like the environmentalists are trying to get
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.000]  people more power in this article the average moron I shouldn't say that the
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.680]  average uninformed person in a trance reading this the average mind control
[56:14.680 --> 56:23.440]  victim shouldn't get mad at them they are victims God love them it's really
[56:23.440 --> 56:28.440]  painful seeing our our wealthy country destroyed I have children just like a
[56:28.440 --> 56:33.480]  lot of you do and it makes me angry and it's so criminal it's so over the top
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.280]  it's be so easy to wake up to these people and bring them to justice but
[56:38.280 --> 56:41.400]  instead it's just gonna get worse as we told you last week now it's official
[56:41.400 --> 56:47.680]  they're gonna have some stupid show congressional subpoena of Corzine about
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.480]  where the money is and he's gonna sit there and fill him full a bunch of bull
[56:52.480 --> 56:56.160]  when it's known he committed crimes it's known he did 40 to 1 bets it's known he
[56:56.160 --> 57:02.240]  took private accounts Corzine subpoena to appear before House panel we've got
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.320]  that I've got all this other news I haven't even gotten into yet in fact I've
[57:07.320 --> 57:10.920]  got the article about the government spying on people's phones and built in
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.360]  backdoors more confirmation on that I've got the articles here that never got to
[57:15.360 --> 57:19.520]  a few days ago about the numbers of foster children on drugs I'm gonna be
[57:19.520 --> 57:27.160]  getting into beginning into that report but it's incredible to see Ron Paul
[57:27.160 --> 57:30.720]  banned from the next TV debate because he doesn't support an Iran attack I mean
[57:30.720 --> 57:35.640]  that is outrageous censorship he's a top-tier candidate and they don't want
[57:35.640 --> 57:39.680]  him there talking about it when 60 plus percent of Israelis don't want it the
[57:39.680 --> 57:45.160]  former head of the Mossad is saying it's a disaster I mean our foreign policy is
[57:45.160 --> 57:49.360]  being dictated by the Israel lobby to a great extent and the particular part of
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.520]  the Israel lobby that's super hawkish pro-war I mean that is just wrong wrong
[57:54.520 --> 58:00.120]  wrong and then Ron Paul censored so now the Israeli lobby is messing with our
[58:00.120 --> 58:03.800]  internal politics and I'm supposed to just sit here and love it and and thank
[58:03.800 --> 58:09.680]  Israel for it and again supporting Israel means supporting the most radical
[58:09.680 --> 58:17.440]  elements of it insane totally insane by the way we've got a special deal running

[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:41.080]  hour Rod Paul banned from the next debate it was a system so scared of him
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.280]  because he doesn't support an attack on Iran that's admitted just unbelievable
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.520]  we have the bill passing that the military can operate domestically on
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.920]  the streets told you that was coming forever they've been training and you
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:00.160]  know what the training's for going block by block sector by sector taking your
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.520]  guns just does the military have any idea no matter what psi-op they run to
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.960]  have an excuse what's gonna happen when they try that if one percent of gun
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.240]  owners fight back well that's the globalist plan they want to start a
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.440]  civil war in fact I should give the number out and ask military in fact
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.760]  stop right there I already see the phone lines loaded pretty much instantly
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:28.240]  stop right there John I said I was gonna have open phones but after we go
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.280]  through these first five or six that are on the board right there the Genesis
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.200]  phone system only has six phone lines they should have more ours has like a
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.600]  hundred just digital but side issue I want to hear from current military after
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.320]  I take these five calls whoever gets in now that's fine I want to hear from you
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.080]  I want to hear from current military I want to hear from police I mean now's
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.840]  the time are are you so cowardly some of you that are current military or police
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.960]  to call in and tell us because now everything I've talked about another
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:07.840]  horrible chapters come true because I've studied them it's admitted don't you
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.240]  understand how frustrating it is that's why I yell and scream this is real these
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:19.560]  are criminals these are bad people they're destroying our civilization we
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.840]  have responsibility as men especially to be involved and be informed and face
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.400]  these people everywhere I go people thank me for what I do and I look at them
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:39.200]  and I say you do not thank me it's just like in the old 30s and 40s movies that
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.880]  Indiana Jones was a remake of that genre of the archaeologist adventure movies
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.120]  and everyone there in some temple and the walls start closing in on them or
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.040]  water starts coming in or sand or the ceiling starts collapsing with spikes
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.280]  are a lot of temples around the world that actually have stuff like that in them
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:04.880]  and it's like I'm in the in this cage the ceilings coming down on me spikes are
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.800]  coming out of the ceiling historically I saw when it first started to move and
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.880]  warn people now we're down to about two feet the spikes are touching us and I'm
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.840]  saying folks we got to get out of here we got to reverse this we got to find the
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.760]  lever in here that reverses this there's always a lever the leverage taking
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.200]  action getting involved never stopping believing in yourself praying
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:32.160]  to God repenting taking action trusting God to type your camel is the better
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:39.040]  one say and people like thank you for your courage courage I mean if I if I
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.480]  was out on an ocean liner and in an iceberg and I got my family into a
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.000]  life raft it wouldn't be courage that I'd climb down and put them in a life
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.960]  draft it wouldn't be courage to be in this system warning people and fighting
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:57.840]  it it's called self-preservation do not thank me because in thanking me you're
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.960]  saying I'm extraordinary you're saying it's special what I'm doing you're
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.720]  saying it's it it shouldn't be it is special what I'm doing I've been
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.760]  dedicated I've built something big and powerful thanks to your support we've
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:17.320]  built this together but it shouldn't be extraordinary it is not oh thank goodness
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:23.400]  Alex and Ron Paul are there folks we're all in this that's what's so
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.840]  frustrating when a cop or a military person is serving the new world order
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.000]  through the brainwashing template download they've been given is that is
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.200]  that I know they're being destroyed by it they may think they're serving the
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.640]  system they may think the system's good they think they're on the winning team
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:45.640]  you're not you're in this with us it's ridiculous and once you break your
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:52.840]  trance once you can see this it's so obvious how did you not see it before

[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.340]  Mossad who Benjamin Netanyahu got rid of a year ago because he thought that was
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:53.920]  bad to attack Iran at this time so anybody that attacks people like Ron

[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.040]  rights up why are they saying the army has to be on the streets and has to
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.440]  secretly arrest citizens because al-Qaeda is out there but then al-Qaeda works for
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.440]  them in every case in history the hijackers trained at US military bases
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.040]  here's Newsweek oh hey the head of the embassy said they were ordered to let
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.880]  al-Qaeda into the country they were really CIA the underwear bomber was put on
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.000]  the plane by the US government uh Amaral al-Aliqi the head of al-Qaeda
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.800]  dined secretly at the Pentagon Fox News huh what's that mean I want to give my
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.840]  rights up because of al-Qaeda hey the manuals say nothing about al-Qaeda it's
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.560]  all about libertarians conservatives returning veterans gun owners do you
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.880]  get it's a corporate takeover using the excuse of terrorism which they
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:33.320]  manufacture provocateur and allow huh well you just keep saying huh because
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.760]  it's fun to go though it's popular to like Herman Cain and be conned it's
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.640]  popular like Obama it's popular like newt genridge it's popular to get into
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.560]  hating al-Qaeda and and to be a bunch of idiots while we're busy hearing about
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.920]  Herman Cain and debating whether or not he was having sex with that woman
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:59.320]  watching that woman's body language he's a hundred percent credible and that
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:04.640]  doesn't even matter Herman Cain now admits that he gave her money for almost
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:10.480]  14 years rent money oh cuz she was a friend anyone who believes that is a
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:17.280]  idiot a total moron and I hear all the right-wing hosts endorsing him and
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.360]  saying it's it's I'm sure he was just helping her he's got such a big heart
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.880]  oh he helped her all right and helped her get her clothes off over and over
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:32.960]  again and he he loved helping her so much and it's it's quite normal to keep
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:38.120]  a 13 and a half year secret cash every month to a woman from your wife I mean
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:45.800]  if my wife caught me giving a woman money for two months it'd be oh honey I
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.360]  just felt sorry for I was given a rent money cuz I love her I was being
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.200]  friendly with her I mean and I hear these women calling him going I like
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.640]  Herman Cain I believe him idiots want to see once you give in to grand delusions
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.840]  willful delusions great delusion the Bible talks about it once you train
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:10.000]  yourself to buy ridiculous lies you just buy them all and these people get off on
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.040]  it they like having their dollar devalued they like losing their jobs they
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.280]  like the New World Order they like checkpoints they like potbellied pedophiles
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:23.040]  grabbing their children's genitals they like Jerry Sandusky ESPN likes
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.200]  covering up you know documented reports of children being
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.600]  sodomized because it's it's just it's just it's just pure evil all right I'm
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:40.480]  gonna shut up now I got is that Maryland my eyes must not be as good as
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.000]  they should be a little bit screened up with calls on I can barely read it
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:53.040]  that's Maryland is Highway Patrol in New York Cole is military in Montana we
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.440]  got military again the military Jerome in Virginia I'd already given the
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.520]  number out and then I thought hey we're talking about the military arresting
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.680]  citizens and then you disappear forever with no trial for no reason and they
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.440]  say they can kill you if they want and torture you or have a military trial
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:16.400]  whatever they want I mean this is this this is this is best in show if tyranny
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.560]  was a dog show this is best in show this is the royal flush this is the
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.000]  creme de la creme the cream of the cream this is the top of the mountain this is
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:33.760]  the pyramid summit this is it this is Moby Dick of sperm whales this is the
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.960]  Mike Tyson and his prime of boxers the Babe Ruth of baseball the Ayatollah of
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:51.680]  rock and roll the humongous motorcycle gangs the Elvis of rock and roll the
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:58.520]  Jesus of Christianity the Buddha of Hinduism not Hinduism the Buddha of
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:08.240]  Buddhist the Krishna of Hinduism I mean you sit here and you look at this and it
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:15.320]  is so mind-blowing and it's happened and now they're just gonna slowly roll it
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:20.280]  out and they'll use it on examples of you know turbaned brown people so it'll be
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:32.080]  okay let's hear from Cole no no who's first look let's hear from Marilyn who's
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.640]  highway patrol in New York then we'll go to Cole Martin Jerome Ironhead and
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.720]  others what's your view on this
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:52.200]  Marilyn no yes go ahead you're on the air hey Alex how you doing oh I'm not
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.040]  doing too good everything's coming true like I knew it would unfortunately yeah
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.960]  I've been following you for a little bit here and I agree with pretty much
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.640]  everything you've been saying just to let you know New York police officers
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.280]  they're brainwashed okay most of them not all of us thank God they've been
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:14.680]  drinking too much of the Kool-Aid out of the juice containers that the
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:20.280]  department feeds them hopefully some of them will wake up and stop worrying
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.960]  about themselves and start worrying about the oaths that they took and one of
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.120]  these days maybe more of us come around well Marilyn you know what happens
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.200]  historically and I want to hear your view on this when when people only start
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.680]  caring about themselves everybody else just cares about themselves and
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.240]  civilizations fall we're going to destroy ourselves by going along to get
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:49.080]  along at a certain point that's what allows the evil to totally take over I
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:53.520]  hear you 100% and that's why I'm probably one of the few that don't agree
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.480]  with the Kool-Aid mixing and the brainwashing so is there any discussion
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.800]  in the New York Highway Patrol about the the military not just being now on the
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:10.280]  streets everywhere but but arresting citizens and citizens disappearing I
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.960]  haven't heard of anything to that respect I'm former military as well so I
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:21.240]  mean I have strong roots and I'm just I'm just disgusted with the way things are
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.880]  going and how people just like I said earlier they just worry about themselves
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.880]  and that's all they care about is their own little bubbles well the good news is
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.400]  Marilyn Burma's who's guest house on the show made some films here with us he
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.720]  lives in New York and he knows a lot of police he's friends with and he says
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.520]  they're starting to wake up and I I talked a lot of other police they're
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.280]  starting to wake up but but I mean what's the line in the sand is there in
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.280]  with the Highway Patrol people you know is there any line in the sand will they
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.640]  confiscate the guns if they're told to will they go arrest political
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:57.480]  dissidents if they're told I mean is there is there anything they won't do that
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.440]  would be up to the individuals themselves to draw that line in the sand I
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.880]  know I have my line and I can only speak for myself okay do you ever people
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.640]  talk about a line in there's in the sand I mean is there any discussion of the
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.160]  way this country is going like I said most of them are just the brainwash
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.560]  Kool-Aid factor and mostly what they do is they worry about themselves and
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.200]  their paycheck every two weeks well Marilyn you're a veteran and a peace
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.240]  officer in the Highway Patrol I mean I would imagine have you thought about
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.480]  what's gonna happen if they do try gun confiscation that is not gonna be a
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:38.920]  very good job to have no it's not and I'm hoping that my retirement comes
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:44.160]  before that I hear you God bless you Marilyn I appreciate you having the
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.080]  courage to call in we get some men police officers to call them a lot of
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.880]  times it's females I men have been castrated to a certain extent in this
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.480]  country I guess it's the new land of the castrated male home of the Nellie
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:00.840]  male or something let's talk to a Jerome who's military in Virginia them
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.960]  will go to Cole and others Jerome what's your view on all this this secret
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.560]  arrest secret detention in deposit commentatus hey Alex how you doing hey
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.440]  long-time listener first time caller I am to get straight to the point me my
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.200]  friends you know the guys I serve when we talk about this on a daily basis and
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:26.440]  the thing is I I think there's more military people that will not go along
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:31.360]  with the arrest of citizens and things of that nature I think more police on
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.040]  that case will you know I guess until it starts to be turned on them but I think
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.120]  the military a lot of military actually listen to you know a lot of military you
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.720]  know they do follow the orders but you know I think there's a now a lot more
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.840]  military people I know that I'm serving with I think is what is waking up to the
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.880]  fact that that they are being used as mercenaries you know different regions of
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.880]  the world and I think if it all came down to it I believe that the military
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:08.920]  will side with the citizens I think for the most part and I know that there will
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:16.680]  be those that won't at the beginning I believe but but I mean but I do feel
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.640]  that we're in trouble though Alex as far as that goes you know I've been following
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.600]  you for years and and been preaching you know a lot of the same things that you
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:30.520]  you know talked about to a lot of people around me and in my inner circle and
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:36.600]  things like that and of course I was told you know that I'm a tinfoil hat
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.160]  where you know I'm a conspiracy theorist things like that and now right now they
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.480]  just call me Josh Jostridamus to be honest because a lot of stuff is coming
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.360]  true you know about the gold you know the physical gold give physical silver
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:55.520]  everything like that but the positive comatosis is I see it here because in
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.080]  where I'm in Virginia I'm really by the big naval bases and things like that you
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.440]  know and I see it every day and with the checkpoints and then things of that
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.360]  nature the exercises that's going on the helicopters flying around a different
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.480]  you know some exercises that's going on you know around us so I see it on a
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.560]  daily basis and I see it growing on a daily basis a lot of more night
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.800]  operations and flight operations and things of that nature so oh yeah there's
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.200]  a major gear up this is in Stars and Stripes three years ago they said we're
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.120]  preparing to pull triggers on Americans it's a new mission for us we're quote
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.240]  getting used to it we're gonna build up with a core of 4,000 up to a hundred
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.920]  thousand and finally they want to stand by force of 370 plus thousand I think
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.680]  is 379,000 I mean this is the army speaking and had quotes about this
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.680]  kernel about pulling triggers and then a week later they pulled that quote out
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.440]  of the article in Stars and Stripes but I mean I've been there I've witnessed it
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.840]  and I've got so much family in the military and it doesn't matter if they're
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:05.040]  in logistics in supply and repairs or in combat roles they're all being given the
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:10.200]  auxiliary training for the first time ever some of them in 23 years for riot
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:16.040]  control cordoning barricading cities I'm getting chills right now because you
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:21.240]  can see it they the global banks have taken over they're gonna stage events
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.320]  where it looks like you're you're fighting a real enemy they're gonna
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.120]  torture people bring them out and they'll confess domestic groups and
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.680]  there's gonna be a lot of rioting and stuff as the depression gets worse and
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.880]  a lot of people the cops are gonna stand down the military is gonna come in and
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.600]  restore order and that's gonna set the precedent oh look the military is doing
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.200]  a great job and then they say those of you that criticize the end deposit
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.360]  comment on us see you're a bunch of idiots I look I can think like the enemy
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:53.120]  I've studied them so long I know how they're gonna operate and it's very simple
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.600]  our military men and women are some of the best people out there I've met them
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:02.680]  I know them my family you know right here in Texas is military family they're
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.760]  good people but the leadership it's like Hitler the average German soldier was
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:12.240]  brave moral most of them weren't Nazis but you know what they were serving evil
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.040]  I mean it's kind of like a tires on a truck the tires aren't evil but when a
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.440]  psycho is driving it and tries to run over people on the street it's those
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.040]  tires and the bumper that kill people and the military and the police have to
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:30.360]  ask that are you gonna be some mindless machine that that does whatever you're
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.440]  told this is the age-old question and and and the story you tell us key you've
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:39.760]  got and I didn't know this when I started out 17 years ago it'll be 17 years of
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:46.560]  what in February I've been on air in the 17 years I've been on air the first few
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.000]  years I knew about a little bit of history I knew about tyranny and knew
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.400]  about the UN that was about it and I was kind of like a libertarian style
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:02.520]  Republican Ron Paul type and I had no idea Jerome or Josh I had no idea that
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.840]  once you were attacked and things came true people would listen to you I just
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.480]  knew I had to be attacked because I had to warn people I didn't care about being
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.000]  attacked but you're absolutely right you've gone the last few years for me
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  and laughed at to now you know they call you Jostridamus and imagine when more
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  of it how many talk show hosts have heard me say they're gonna get rid of
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.640]  posse commentatus and say they're gonna arrest citizens indefinitely I thought
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.920]  that would come after they got rid of posse commentatus they just went for it
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:35.080]  all because most of Congress are crooks that have been part of the scams and the
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:40.080]  bailouts and the insider bid rigging and all of it they're crooks just like when
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.400]  the cops go to a crooks house sometimes they pull a gun and say you're not taking
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:47.560]  me alive the Congress has grabbed the military and said you're not taking me
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.840]  alive and is pointing it at the public now this is declaring war now now just
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.360]  because they've passed this doesn't mean they're gonna be able to implement it
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.760]  we've got to say no to this just I know this is new Jerome but once you tell
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.280]  your buddies about this now obviously you've been getting the training now
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.720]  they announce why you're getting all the training again that's compartmentalization
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.800]  true intelligence though is seeing the manifestation of the training that tells
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.000]  you what it is without having the secret memo now we have it publicly what are
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.280]  your buddies gonna say now that this has happened well I think they're gonna say
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.160]  hey you were right again you know because we saw this come like you say the
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.040]  training things like that you know because we see some things on the inside
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.680]  that the public don't see first and things like that and they're actually you
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.520]  know nervous as well you know because they see it is coming true and they see
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.160]  you know that that the stuff that we actually learned about and found out
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.480]  about you know two three years ago now it's come to fruition now they say okay
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.360]  so what are we gonna do and to be honest a lot of them are retiring a lot of them
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.600]  are getting out of the military so they don't have to follow those orders so they
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.680]  can be no patriots to the Constitution the oath that we by the way that and the
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.040]  government knows that and this was ten years ago in secret documents now it's
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:07.000]  public the you know in the Mayak and Homeland Security and all those reports
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.800]  you know who they're training these other paramilitary cadres for and the
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.320]  mercenaries for they have files on all the veterans and they literally know your
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:22.400]  profile and if you're a real American they hate you obviously who was Hitler's
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:28.880]  number one enemy good people in the military exactly exactly and and we all
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.400]  know that and and we're you know forming our coalition you know of of good

[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.160]  the nation you know that the different groups throughout the nation armed
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.120]  forces network you know on on you know the YouTube and and on Facebook you know
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.200]  things like that there are some good people out there you know hopefully you
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.600]  know some more good soldiers to come back some good soldiers to come home you
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.240]  know and and those that are be able to protect the nation you know from from the
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.480]  UN soldiers that you know right across the border in Canada right down to the
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.920]  border in Laredo Texas you know things like that exactly sir God bless you and
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.600]  I appreciate your call good to hear from you we're gonna go to Cole and then well
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:19.160]  Ironheads actually before him and Martin and Philip and everybody that's
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:26.800]  holding but I just want to say briefly this is so important the system can't
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.120]  get away with this if you speak out and it's just like in the old movies where
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.800]  they say hey this is a scam pass it on hey this is a scam pass it on real news
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:44.320]  and truth has a way of spreading once it gets going that is unstoppable and it's
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:49.480]  real simple foreign banks have engineered our collapse they plan on using
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.640]  the military for the takeover like a third-world country pass it on it's real
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.200]  simple it's a foreign banking takeover just like Europe they're the ones that
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.960]  did all of this you know they want to use the military and police against the
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.080]  public let's not go along with this pass it on and the globalists are gonna pick
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:10.880]  up that chatter and back off right now they're testing though I cannot stress
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.640]  enough to you folks how much danger we're in I mean look at the bombing of
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:19.720]  Pakistan the Russian ships the cruise missiles getting moved into Syria the
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.680]  Israeli must former massage chief coming out saying they're planning to attack
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:29.920]  it's gonna be a catastrophe of course it is and politically the globalist are
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.760]  going to stage terror attacks I've been telling you this it's coming and it's
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.360]  gonna be bad folks and they may come arrest people like Alex Jones and you
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:47.120]  know I've got to make a decision at that point what I do because it's one thing
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.920]  if they arrest you through a corrupt court system at least then you can fight
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.320]  it now they could just arrest me and take me and blow my head off put me in a
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:05.360]  vada acid and that's the end of it and I mean it's like Stuart Rhodes said the
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.800]  other day with Oathkeepers he said there comes a point where they escalate to the
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:16.240]  point you don't have a choice defensively it's really sad it's gone this
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.480]  point and it's gonna get you're gonna look back at this day as the good times
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.840]  just like I told you six months ago you're gonna look back at this day as the
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.360]  good times we are a country going into judgment God isn't gonna let us kill 50
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:35.320]  million babies 51 million babies and get away with it not gonna happen not if
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.640]  we don't repent and I mean really repent and repenting means saying you're wrong
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.120]  and then going out there and fighting evil the proof is that you're standing
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.880]  up against evil the proof that you've got God in your heart is that you don't
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:56.720]  have fear those of you out there they're paralyzed with fear I don't know
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.600]  what God you're communicating with there's only one thing I fear and that's
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:11.120]  God Bible says the beginning of knowledge is fear of God that's not like
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:17.160]  fear it's fear of displeasing it's fear of being bad it's fear of falling it's
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:23.320]  fear of joining all these evil people being in with those people and realizing
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:28.240]  how close all of us are to that how weak we all are I promise I got no me

[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.520]  but no me prince i don't know back in the 2002 2003 went public she was a managing director
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.560]  at Goldman Sachs spoke out about the derivatives fraud the corruption wrote a best-selling books
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:07.400]  she's a guest here from time to time she's got a new novel out dealing with the great depression
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:13.800]  that dovetails what's basically we're about to go into here and she joins us today but we'll
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.800]  also be going to your calls here but i want to get her take on what's happening with the police
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:24.120]  state and then what's happening in europe and this giant power grab that we're witnessing no me prince
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:32.360]  thanks for being on with us thanks a lot alex well so uh it's all happening a breakdown what's
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:38.200]  happening financially right now from your expert view and what the next dominoes are to fall um
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:43.720]  yeah i mean we saw this week that um as we've been talking about as i've been writing about um and
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:51.480]  some others not enough obviously uh that the fed basically um stepped into supposedly bail out europe
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.200]  that's a very very simplistic and and really wrong way of looking at what the fed did what
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:03.880]  the fed did was um use what it called a rescue package for europe in order to basically rescue
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:11.160]  again us banks that have had exposure to europe through a massive increase in derivatives in
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:17.880]  leverage in all sorts of trades where they basically dared uh european government after european
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:23.480]  government to try and and deal with them um and as things were falling apart the fed stepped in
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:29.880]  they looked at the positions of companies like oldman sacks um and i believe there were conversations
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.960]  that happened we don't know about them these things come out you know years later that the
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:39.400]  calls that that happened between the fed the treasury department the major bank CEOs um but
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:46.840]  what we know from the results is a lot of potential money came out again in the guise of helping europe
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:51.640]  but also and only to help the us banks who are looking at losing money through the very bets
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:56.840]  they placed on europe um and so yeah again just like we had in the subprime crisis you know these
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:04.520]  banks create um these these crazy toxic securities assets derivative transactions they've increased
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.400]  their derivative transactions by 20 percent just from last year to this year um but going into the
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:16.520]  subprime crisis same thing they they dare they do bad bets and they get bailed out um by the
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:21.240]  federal reserve and the sort of backup of the treasury department and it's just happening again
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:25.320]  it's manifesting in europe i believe this is something that's continuing around the globe
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.080]  which is why i think we're in a multi-year depression um and we'll manifest ourselves
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.680]  through asia we'll go through latin america we'll come back to the united states but it's all for
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:39.400]  the same reasons that we are bailing out bad bets by us banks printing money through the federal
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:47.400]  reserve and being backed by the treasury department's um philosophy for this no i mean i've noticed that
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:52.920]  well in the case of corezine and mf global and others the former head of goldman sacks they're
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:58.600]  making 40 to 1 bets and things and engaging in more derivatives as you said more than they were
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:06.360]  in 2008 so they're continuing the same behavior that got the world in this situation and the
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:12.840]  bigger the crisis gets the more power they get to fix the problem they created now that that's
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.920]  exactly right i mean the corezine situation and you know he still has misplaced billions of dollars
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.360]  you know he's he's still not even been indicted for anything which is insane i mean you know not
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:30.280]  just for betting against various sovereigns countries in europe but also for misplacing um
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:36.200]  you know the money that was trusted for whatever reason but trusted to mf global um to be segregated
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.760]  from his own bets and that obviously didn't happen but you're right there's there's this daring
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.680]  and it happened here it's happening in europe and the reason it's happening more um larger now and
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.000]  why the derivatives positions are bigger now than they were before the first set of bailouts after
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.320]  the 2008 crisis is because beds saw hey you know what we can do whatever we want we will get bailed
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:02.840]  out we will get zero percent loans to do other transactions and that's exactly what they did
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.720]  they dabbled in commodities for a little bit did a lot of volatility a lot of chaos in the commodities
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.440]  market but then they said you know a better place to do this is in europe and they went from country
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:18.600]  to country they increased their bets against countries as they went from ireland to greece to
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:24.680]  italy to spain under the cover of the main media saying oh these economies are just falling just
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:29.960]  like the u.s economy supposedly just fell as if it wasn't pushed to fall by the fact that we're
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:34.520]  printing money to save the bets of banks and it's the exact same thing it's it's on a bigger scale
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:39.640]  now it's more global as the financial community is global anyway um and there's there's more
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:46.440]  governments involved but it's it's the same game same rules for them um just just different trades
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.360]  so where do we go from here what's going to happen next well you know the the market's definitely
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:03.080]  loved the fact that the fed you know coordinated this uh you know this action with the ecb bank of
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:08.840]  england and so forth because they like cheap money and they like to know and and bank stocks rallied
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:14.600]  on this as well that whatever muck whatever dirt whatever bad transactions whatever risk is on the
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:19.560]  books of these banks it will be taken care of so what happens the banks go in they leverage more
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:24.600]  they bet more they bet bigger because they just got you know a really nice present instead of a
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:30.200]  smack in the face and a breaking up of their size so i think that continues to happen you know i was
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:37.640]  looking at um what's going on for example in china jp morgan chase um has had um a lot of
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.760]  sort of ads but really articles slash ads in in some of the china daily papers saying you know
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:48.040]  we're coming here 30 percent of their profits are international and again when we say profits we
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:52.680]  could mean derivative bets that get backed by central banks um but that's what they're saying um
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:57.800]  they're they're opening more communications betting um bigger there because they've noticed
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.280]  that europe you know the game might be almost over they they bet big they've got it sustained they've
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:08.280]  got it backed um and so now where's the next place to go and the next place to really go is is asia
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.920]  europe will continue to play itself out i think over the next year or so um but they're they're
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.160]  really gearing up to say okay well you know we're going to move around the globe and that's what's
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.800]  happening um i read an article actually that that was in a student newspaper in sarah q's because
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.440]  there's a bunch of jp morgan officials telling them um that the place to be right now is china
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.160]  and asia because uh china and india because that's where they are focusing their growth meanwhile and
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.880]  it's not really the news they're firing people here well that's been the globalist admitted cfr
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:43.080]  trilateral commission plan for at least 30 years is to destroy our countries financially suck everything
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:53.000]  out of them and then move to china and other areas in asia and so while all this is happening we see
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:00.280]  them now in europe uh creating austerity taking over the countries and the controlled media never
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.680]  really points out that most this debt that we're being told americans and europeans oh
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:11.320]  isn't even their debt it's the derivatives so you worked at goldman sacks at the highest levels
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:17.400]  what is the strategic planning i mean obviously they have to have an end game to this it's not
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:22.200]  just about making money because the central banks issue the currency in credit it's about
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:28.920]  political power so what is what is their end game in this overall strategy and because they've
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.800]  spent decades getting their operatives into every major regulatory and government uh executive
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:40.040]  position uh is that why they're so openly criminal because they literally can do whatever they want
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:46.520]  they are doing whatever they want the difference now um or the increased difference now over the
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:51.800]  last 30 years or so is not only um you know for example does does goldman have people you know
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.120]  running italy and running greece and you know running the european central banks but that they're
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:03.960]  also um the the growth of the derivatives market um has increased so much and and has accelerated
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.320]  so much um first since the 2008 crisis when banks realized they could do whatever they wanted anyway
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.480]  and get away with it anyway and they they piled on positions because they had all this cheap money
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.440]  they had all this zero percent money from the fed that's why the us banks are leading um this
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:23.320]  degradation degradation across the the globe because they have the cheap money first and they
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:27.160]  got it from from the fed from the treasury department and where do they do they bet with it
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:32.360]  the derivatives market that has grown by 20 percent just in the last year um the credit
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.440]  derivatives market when i wrote that book when i wrote other people's money the credit derivatives
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:42.920]  market was was was tiny um it was it was nascent and and right now it's it's a 32 trillion dollar
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:49.080]  market um which has a lot more risk attached to it the entire derivatives market is 707 trillion
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:55.000]  dollars that's many many gdp's over um and and what it really is is controlled by just a few banks
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:02.280]  four banks in our country right control 95 percent of derivatives they control 249 trillion dollars
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:09.160]  worth of risk from your research from your research break down who's at the top of the pyramid uh the
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:15.160]  the four big u.s banks the two or three big european ones yeah well the the four big u.s banks
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.680]  there's this jp morgan chase um which is the top and then sort of tied for second third and fourth
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:27.640]  is is city bank bank of american golden but um what what no one really looks at is is how many assets
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:33.800]  these banks really have which is you know deposits loans things with real uh physical assets attached
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:39.240]  to them our money for example um and jp morgan chase has over a trillion dollars worth of assets
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:46.840]  and they have about 45 or six times that in um derivatives now goldman sacks um which is just
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:52.760]  kind of a fourth in that in that top four they only have 88 billion dollars of assets they have 48
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:59.080]  trillion dollars of derivatives meaning that seven percent of global derivatives jp morgan chase is
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.360]  11 percent on the other two around around those figures as well um so you're talking about you
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.240]  know a few banks really controlling your massive parts of the derivatives market globally um i
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:14.120]  don't have the figures but you know you have sock gen you have ubs you have dorcha bank um and
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:19.800]  there probably some are also within that you know seven percent to eleven to ten percent range um and
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.160]  then there's several other banks throughout the world that are sort of one to two percent and
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.160]  then everybody else has like you know crumbs off of this derivatives project sure what about the
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:34.920]  article i saw in us today a month ago that 79 trillion in derivatives has been moved by bank
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:42.280]  of america over into a taxpayer backed account and they may want a bailout of that well well
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:47.800]  that's exactly right bank america as we know is is is an insolvent bank and we know i you you and me
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:53.480]  and and a lot of your audience but um and uh what happened is that merrill lynch um which had a
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:59.640]  massive massive derivatives book to begin with um that's why it was going to go bankrupt in the fall
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.560]  of 2008 what happened was it was ran run by john thing who was an old golden sex co-president
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.640]  and uh the fed and treasury department said hey you know what how about instead of you dissolving
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:14.600]  we just give you the bank of america whatever we'll just back you um and so bank of america took
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.480]  merrill lynch obviously had countrywide as well which is a toxic toxic company and is still undergoing
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:24.840]  tons of of fraud and and also it's a criminal investigations by by attorney generals not so
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.320]  much by the government um outside of that but anyway merrill lynch had all these derivatives
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:32.760]  that were just festering um and i wrote about this and it takes the pillage and what happened
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:41.160]  was in the last month is that the shareholders and the derivatives um partners of merrill lynch said
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:48.120]  bank of america had just gotten downgraded that meant that bank of america wasn't as as credit worthy
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:53.320]  to be on the other side of the derivatives transactions with their customers the big
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.360]  customers the big other banks um and so what we want is the merrill lynch stuff to at least move
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:03.560]  into the part of bank of america that is more credit worthy okay so there was the part that was
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:09.400]  more speculative that was downgraded the big part where all of the people's deposits and loans are
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:14.680]  was also downgraded but not as much so all the merrill partners said you know what can you just
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.360]  move it over there so we have a better rating so it's cheaper to keep those derivatives going
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.840]  and so we're more certain that bank of america won't fail on them to us and so okay let me ask
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:32.120]  you this question we're going to go to calls i mean i know they planned all this is a way to
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:37.480]  bring down government's takeover but they've done such a good job at wrecking things they've they've
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:42.600]  been exposed i don't see any way they're going to get away with this and as you've pointed out
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.760]  other economists have pointed out it's a black hole it's impossible to ever pay back they can't
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:52.200]  convince the public forever it's our debt when again over 90 percent of it globally is is their
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:57.960]  their fraudulent made-up debt and so they're they're living on a prayer they're living on a hoax
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:04.680]  that people don't call their bluff uh and i see the only way they're going to try to stay in power
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:11.160]  is stage terror attacks new wars that's why we're seeing the senate pass a law that you
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:16.920]  citizens can just be disappeared the military can arrest you all of this is happening what's your
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.840]  view on that and then i'm going to go to calls for military and police officers and others that
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:27.480]  have called in on that subject this indefinite detention the bedrock hallmark bellwether
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:33.480]  certification that you're living in a super tyranny well the whole notion of this police
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:40.840]  state and you know it's basically to keep people quiet is to keep them from you know looking into
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:48.360]  what's really going on and if there are any sort of you know clawbacks from from population
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.240]  standpoint to quiet it to dampen it because when you have a sort of financial terrorism going
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.600]  throughout the world it's the money that controls all of this you know whether it's a military
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.640]  operation that's new somewhere or whatever you're somewhere in that equation you know there's defense
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:06.120]  contractors making some money but beyond that honestly there are banks betting on what will
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:11.240]  happen um and it's so sort of increasing um you know the the sort of overall risk in the world
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.080]  which yeah you're right it has nothing to do with individuals our debt here in the united states 14
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:21.240]  trillion 14 trillion dollars of debt uh the banks have 249 trillion dollars of derivative so it
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:30.600]  obviously isn't isn't us but to to subdue um discontent information gathering um the public
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:37.560]  disclosure of that information um just just helps to propagate all of this um all of this crime
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.880]  because if no one's around to call it out or no one can call it out or people being jailed to call
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:46.920]  it out or or journalists are even being jailed to call it out um then you have a situation where
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:53.880]  information becomes really hard to go by and it allows those in control to stay in control because
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.680]  the the dissent is just squelched well i just want listeners to know and most people figure this out
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.800]  now over the years detractors come and tell probes that i'm a fearmonger predicting all of this
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:09.320]  history's pretty wild history's pretty scary and we're definitely going down a very nasty path
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:13.560]  unfortunately it's all coming true in some cases worse than i thought it would and quicker
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:18.040]  and i just hope people realize you know a full spectrum of our guest and other even you know
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:27.480]  mainline researchers agree now we're in a whole lot of trouble and uh and this culture of denial
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:35.640]  has allowed this to happen know me no i agree i i am whenever i get emails and i'm sure you get
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:39.960]  more from people saying you know thanks for sharing information because we're not getting this from
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:45.000]  mainstream media we're not getting these details um because there's there's there's these past
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.480]  stories you know like in europe oh the european countries are doing bad so we're helping them out
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.400]  no that's not the case we have banks that bet on them and have gotten bailed out you know so
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:59.400]  now the banks are getting our money in a bailout which isn't a bailout it's a robbery uh no me stay

[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:40.360]  this is literally the the disappearance as they talk about in north korea no it's it's so sad it's
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.240]  that suppression of content we're supposed to uh be a democracy you know we're supposed to be able
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:49.640]  to express information and opinions and everything else as long as we're not hurting anyone and
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:54.360]  obviously doing so isn't hurting anyone unless you're getting violent with it which isn't the
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:01.160]  intent of of what's going on now the intent is really to just quell uh information journalism
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:08.680]  discontent and it's it's it's amazing in a world in which there is so much that needs to be extracted
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:14.360]  that needs to be made light because things are more rapidly decaying now you know the derivative
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:19.960]  stuff is it's it sounds all techy but but i mean it's not we're talking about uh you know capital
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:25.640]  that used to be just uh decimating and causing depressions in the 20s when it was easy to sort
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:31.720]  of understand it now it's it's more complex but it's much more garbage that they've sold into the
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.720]  market that they make money on the front end with and then they make us bail it out on the
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:42.280]  back end it's incredible theft coal in uh where are you calling from coal you're in the military
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:48.040]  you say you're concerned about this where you calling from that's um sir okay missouri uh give

[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:59.240]  active duty current uh national guards and i was there on the ground uh july 12 2007 during the
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:04.840]  patch check i was in a different company though um i just wanted to hit on a few things real quick
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.720]  yesterday i was scanning uh a story on yahoo about where i'm calling you see all the comments and
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:13.560]  it's just you know people that are bashing see all just you know negative comments they're all
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.280]  hidden and then you know the story gets disappeared so you see the that's high up going on with that
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:25.000]  um the current state of uh the national guardian i mean i'm getting out here in just a few months
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.280]  but one of the one of the guys there he was all fired up about the fast and furious thing
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.120]  and uh we talked about it for a little while and uh here came September 11th and he posted
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.680]  something on facebook and said you know you know everyone needs to shut up about this inside job
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.400]  thing and i posed the back of like hey you know you just were all fired up you know about them

[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:54.440]  doing things like 9-11 he's like well you know point taken i guess so you just got to point
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.440]  little things out to that people exactly governments get caught doing this stuff all the time it
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:03.560]  doesn't mean there aren't terrorists somewhere but the point is most of this stuff is provocative
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:07.880]  or manufactured we'll talk into your friends in the in the national guard are they concerned about
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:14.360]  this uh quite a few among a lot of them gotten out a lot of them you know they sign long contracts so
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:18.920]  they're just they're just stuck with it but uh a good number of them are then you know there's
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.240]  always the guys that are just oblivious to everything and are just there for whatever reason

[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:28.840]  and now live from austin texas alex jones know me prince dot com is her website and me
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:34.280]  rambling over articles and info wars dot com the feds european rescue another backdoor us bank
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:39.400]  colman bailout our final segment with her i really appreciate her joining us we're
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:45.240]  we're also getting to your calls right now dealing with this military takeover situation
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.600]  i know i'm harping on this because we kept telling people this was coming and and and now it's here
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:57.400]  and and tsa is setting up checkpoints on highways i mean how much more obvious does it have to get
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:01.880]  that this homeland security system is for the american people and not for terrorism know me
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:07.720]  it's it's unfortunate but it seems like every step you know like like even time i like what's
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:13.320]  going on now it's it's it's obvious that it's not going to go backwards i mean that there's there's
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:20.120]  a consolidated effort to to squelch uh you know individualism here which is really not what this
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:26.280]  country which was you know founded for um and it's it's really really dangerous because once you do
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:32.520]  that um you know as you've spoken about us as others know um there's there's it's hard to turn back
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.280]  it is hard to turn back and and that's what tyranny does it tends to slide until it collapses itself
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.640]  because the society of criminals will just rob and rape and loot everything until everything
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:50.600]  collapses and i mean you worked around these people max keiser has many others have they
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:54.760]  i mean max and others have said they're they're like suicide bankers like the banker that stated
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.320]  his desk even though he knew that he's probably going to die on 9 11 to make an extra 10 million
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:05.400]  dollars and i mean certainly they're not going to stop themselves are they no and and and they've
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:11.320]  only they've only seen that what they do is is more and more coddled by the government we had
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:17.320]  unprecedented bailouts and subsidies um you know starting in 2008 we have another slew going on now
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:23.000]  with respect to to us bank exposure to europe it's only ramping up and and in the face of that you
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.920]  know the the top us bankers are basically just laughing because it's like like we're increasing
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.000]  our risk even though we we screwed up the world back then we're going to continue to do it you're
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:38.040]  going to continue to back us the federal reserve is so um you know supportive of this that they in
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:43.080]  broad daylight say on their website which i pointed out in this piece what's no one else seemed to
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:50.920]  point out that this recent european intervention by them was a way to support the us banks this
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:56.680]  isn't even me saying this this is like the feds own words and yet we're so conditioned to just
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.640]  follow you know the mainstream headlines which is just so we're bailing out exactly exactly but
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.360]  then even question this it's out there sure but then even the so-called us banks as you pointed
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:13.160]  out earlier are moving to china so they're not us banks well the finances global that's 707 trillion
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:17.880]  dollars worth the derivatives is global and the us banks even if they're domicile here the head
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:23.000]  quarter here they have the ability to do whatever they want wherever they want the part that's not
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:28.920]  global um is how the fed and treasury department will basically increase our debt as a nation
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:34.440]  in order to support their bad bets when they go wrong and then keep them from going wrong for
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:39.400]  next time um and so that's that's the part that's more domestic the international part is global
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:45.240]  finance it's fast it's powerful it's uh it's controlled by a few banks and and a few people
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:49.800]  that are strategically positioned within various governments or government agencies i mean even
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.840]  the new york federal reserve was run by you know tim geithner it's it's got a class a directorship
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:04:01.640]  given to jayme diamond ceo of jp morgan chase which he had during the subprime crisis and it
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.760]  was reconfirmed for him to be there now so you have the biggest global bank in charge of of
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:14.760]  basically uh you know having having a relationship to be able to get money to to bail out subsidize
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:20.520]  and increase their exposure and their power globally so yeah it's it's it's it's a true mass
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.120]  it's just bigger now than it's ever been because we have had a derivatives market that's grown
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:33.400]  even more quickly uh than it has in the past wow nomie prince thank you so much uh the inside

[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:15.480]  information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network well bob Chapman is quite a
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:21.560]  character he's a military veteran working intelligence then he was a private silver and
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:27.080]  gold broker the largest private silver gold broker at one time in the united states he's
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:32.040]  lived all over the world and he then helped put out the gary allen report exposing the globalist
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:39.160]  and undare call conspiracy 40 plus years ago and he now lives in an undisclosed location
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:44.200]  outside the united states because the long arm of the new world order has been seeking after him
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:51.400]  and he joins us in this hour to take calls from police military and others to get their view on
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:56.440]  the fact that the media is going hey the army is going to be on the streets of america
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:00.920]  you've already seen us illegally doing it well now it's legal of course they can't pass a law
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:05.720]  saying black people are slaves again my point is just because they say something's legal doesn't mean
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:11.640]  it is legal marbury versus madison and other rulings as well as just common sense can the
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:16.760]  government pass a law saying they can blow children's heads off no and the government
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:23.480]  pass a law they can ship opium into the country no they do though so the point is that we've
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.480]  reached a new level of corruption so they're saying also that they will secretly arrest
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:34.200]  citizens whenever they want that they will take you to a secret prison and you're never seen again
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:40.440]  and obama came out and said i'll do more i'll kill citizens without a judge during your trial
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:47.720]  in america so that's all these hit men and mercenaries need to be told is it's okay we're
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:53.080]  allowed to do this now you're covered by law go go kill who we want go assassinate who we want
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:58.760]  just an unprecedented situation you've got cruise missiles high tech ones given by the russians a
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:03.880]  whole bunch of them 76 of them at least to the syrians you got the u in declaring it a civil
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:11.720]  war zone and to get ready to call for the humanitarian bombing bombs are now loving orwell's
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:16.520]  vision has come true double think double speak up astound down is up blackish white
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:22.840]  israel's saying they may hit iran the former head of the massage is saying it will cause a quote
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:30.040]  catastrophe but the globalists want catastrophe they want global crisis order out of chaos
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:35.400]  i want to go to your calls and later in the hour we'll get in to the european situation
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:40.520]  with bob the latest on mf global i came out to bring that up with uh no me prince but i forgot
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:45.000]  with bob we'll talk about the power plant shutdowns across the country that we predicted
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.360]  now happening uh the white house of course is not very happy also more governments and others
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:56.040]  are calling for lithium to be out of the water that's lithium and antipsychotic so you'll be calm
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:01.800]  when the government abuses you all of that is coming up today bob Chapman of the international
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:07.160]  forecaster dot com always great talking to you my friend i was talking to my mom this morning and
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:13.080]  she said that she she looked forward to hearing you today she said is bob Chapman gonna be on
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.400]  and i said yes i said do you like him she goes yes i do like hearing him on the show so
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:23.160]  so my mom's a fan out there listening right now bob well i thank you i thank you mom
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:27.400]  um the only thing is your mom's probably old enough to be my daughter
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  yeah i think so that means that may uh i was floored with this vote on uh 1867 the senate bill
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:46.040]  93 to 7 that shows you how many people are totally corrupted and paid off in our senate
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:49.000]  because nobody in their right mind would have voted for that
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:55.400]  well you're right i mean this really shows that they'll do anything
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:00.840]  obviously they're scared they know they've committed crimes it's come out there insider trading
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.880]  to an extreme extent and they're now just trying the hidden in plain view thing because they have
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:10.760]  a nine percent approval rating because they know that we know they're crooks they're now just okay
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.560]  we're criminals we're butchering everything and we're allowed to insider trade and we're allowed to
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.280]  uh give congressional money the companies were invested in i mean they are really
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:29.560]  light speed past the rubicon now bob well the general says um it's the gambino's and the bananos
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:38.520]  only i grew up with those people and uh uh the equivalent and they were nowhere near as bad as
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:44.680]  these people are i mean they wouldn't think of doing those things in fact luchiano said in 44
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:51.400]  after he helped with the invasion of sicily and they had let him out of danimore of penitentiary
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:57.560]  he was in there for narcotics violations he said i finally figured it out i should have
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:03.640]  became a banker he said i could have done all his stuff legally and so you know we have a
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:10.360]  marriage of crime and uh that's been prevalent for a long time in civilization and in america but
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:16.680]  not to the extent that it is today and these people who control washington and washington and
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:25.080]  the bureaucrats technocrats which are bankers uh they all uh afraid just like you said alex and as
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:29.400]  you know we discussed that we're breathing down their neck every day and they don't like it very
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:35.720]  much and so all the rules gone out the window there are no rules there's rules for you and i but not
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:41.080]  for them and they're trying to do what they can do to grab what they can before the ship goes down
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.680]  and then they're going into a post-industrial world this is a criminal group who's who in their
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:52.920]  own words study dictatorships and the science of oppression and have tried to codify a system
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.280]  where instead of getting thrown out or getting in trouble they'll get always still more power
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:07.480]  always you know still more control as they drown the public in just absolute unmitigated tyranny
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:14.280]  and and they call it command destruction this looting this wrecking of society is a planned
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:21.880]  depression and the psi op is you're not in depression and there seems to be no into it but
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:27.800]  gauging this it i see that all is not well and they're not in full control they've been a little
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:33.640]  too good at stealing and i see a certain desperation when people like correspondent mf global are
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:39.080]  making 40 to 1 bets what do you expect to see out of the congressional hearing they'll like massage
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:44.680]  his feet and telling what a delicate genius he is and maybe chew on his toenails for him or something
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:51.480]  well as you know they won't do that but they'll certainly let him off the hook it's my feeling
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:59.320]  and i i only base this on experience i don't have any evidence i think that the mf caper
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:08.440]  was government run uh course i was told what to do and uh he can't be that suicidal on his own
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.960]  he's a professional in the bond market he knew what he was doing and they needed support over in
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:20.040]  europe in the bonds that belong to the countries that were insolvent and he was told you're going to
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.560]  buy him and then when he ran out of money so well loot the accounts whatever you got to do but buy
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:31.480]  more and that's what he did and they will cover up from he's not going to go to jail he might get
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:39.560]  fined and that'll be the end of it well let's expand on that you are the only person the only
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:44.280]  expert i interviewed who says that my gut tells me you're right because that was a sure loser
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:50.440]  uh and uh other experts say no this is the craziness of these people and they give other
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:55.160]  examples but if you look at everything that happened in the way this is being dealt with
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:00.920]  i think it's more than just an order this was a test to see if they can start taking people's
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:08.280]  private accounts ahead of a bank holiday and a devaluation maybe we don't know that yet we'll
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:15.240]  just have to see what path they follow after this don't forget this has to be digested first
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:23.400]  there's going to be in the headlines uh at least for another six months and and so i think we're
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:28.520]  going to have to be patient on this one uh you know most people don't understand there's a big
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:35.720]  difference between what goes on in the commodity market and other markets a commodity is not a
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:44.120]  security it's an agreement between two parties and of course if you read the contract and as you
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:51.400]  know i was in the uh in the business of uh owning a brokerage firm for many years although i didn't
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:57.480]  trade in commodities uh if you read the contract you'll know that you have no rights whatsoever
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:04.920]  the cme and the comics can change the rules anytime they want uh and stocks and bonds it's
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:12.040]  different now oh less than one percent of the action in the markets come from commodities
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.160]  the big market is bonds 100 times bigger than the stock market and then there's the stock market
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:27.720]  and these criminals most of their action is very subtle and they get away with it
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:33.080]  because nobody knows what they're doing usually on inside information and that's where they make
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:40.840]  them and so i can see them sacrificing mf with a leader who's one of them
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:49.240]  in order to get the build up in the purchasing of bonds that are virtually worthless as far as
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:53.400]  i'm concerned all right in europe all right let's let's move on when we come back for break i'm
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:57.800]  going to go to some calls for a while for military and police and others that are concerned about
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.960]  this but but notice how long we've known they're getting rid of positive commentators how long
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:07.400]  they've been trying to like like rats under the floorboards eat the foundation out from under us
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:14.280]  but to add on top of it secret arrest of citizens in definite detention we've got to make a big deal
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:20.120]  out of this we've got to challenge this but it but it really does signify just how criminal these
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:25.480]  people are why didn't they just go for the end of posse commentatus why did they go ahead and go
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.360]  go for it all because this is woken a lot of people up i can't tell you how many phone calls
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:36.280]  emails how many big news sites how many people are calling me and apologizing and saying well i guess
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:44.840]  you were right well i think you have to look at who they've hired since the second world war first
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:51.880]  operation paper clip and the gestapo and and other nazis and then at the fall of the soviet union
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:19:00.120]  in eastern germany uh they hired soviet experts and stasi which is a secret place in eastern
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:05.400]  in germany they hired them to come to america to tell them how to suppress the population
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:14.920]  and i think the the wording and the and the direction of this legislation was really put
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:21.960]  together by them because they understand how it works them being the nkvd and the stasi i used
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:29.720]  to work against those people so i know where their heads are at and so i think this patent was set up
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:35.240]  by these people in behalf of the people who control our government absolutely the bankers knew they
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:40.440]  were going to engage in this gangster fraud this giant takeover and by the way what bob's talking
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:47.320]  about is true it's on record in 2001 two three four five six bush hired marcus wilt the former head
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:56.360]  of the stasi they hired a bunch of former russian experts and and our model is is a communist model

[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:57.800]  recon marine what's your concern uh with secret arrest the military on the streets i mean what's
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:03.960]  wrong with north korea i took an oath to support and defend the constitution united states against
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:08.120]  all enemies foreign and domestic the problem is they never trained us on how to freaking fight
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:13.080]  domestic terrorism everything they're doing is eroding the constitution and i believe that all
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:18.840]  these freaking members and congress and such should be tried by a jury of i would say a jury
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:24.520]  of their peers but we're not their peers they see us as bugs and here we are oh yes sir i'm
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:29.080]  listening to you and you look at the definition of terrorism it's threatening or carrying out violence
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:37.080]  to get a political goal and and that's what these crooks do talking to family friends other military
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:41.960]  people are they concerned about the military operating in america and being able to grab
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:47.960]  citizens and have citizens disappear i mean it's bad enough to have the military operating domestically
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:53.640]  the military kills people and breaks things it doesn't engage in peace officer activity it's
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:26:01.240]  totally illegal always has been in any free country uh but but now secret arrest and disappearing
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:09.320]  even the worst third world cess pits don't have that only north korea only nazi germany
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:15.640]  communist china doesn't have that i mean i mean do people realize that words cannot describe how
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:22.040]  big a deal this is it's a hundred percent confirmation that it's worse than we even thought
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:26.760]  we're in trouble i'm sorry go ahead you're absolutely right alex you're absolutely right and
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:31.400]  the thing about it is people refuse to like people refuse to believe it people refuse to wake up i
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:36.360]  try to tell people inform them all the time i'm talking about it you know about the tsa and
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:40.360]  everything else and what's going on because the nazis had a word for the tsa was the gestapo
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:46.280]  and uh his response was well at least you know if they had searched timothy mcvay maybe would
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:50.920]  have stopped the oklahoma bombing exactly let's have a checkpoint everywhere let's ban knives like
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:55.720]  england's trying to do let's arrest people for their speech like england's doing in canada listen
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:00.440]  we sent a film crew out yesterday it's going to air tonight on the nightly news seven o'clock this
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:05.480]  evening and we found a bunch of people i didn't believe it i wrote the questions for darin Mcbrane
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:12.520]  about the military commissions act you know do they support it uh uh of this new uh national
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:17.480]  defense authorization act secret arrest and we found a bunch of people that were like well i think we
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:21.320]  should arrest people and throw away the key and ever seen again i think tripp should be on the
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.280]  streets and we're like but north korea does that well i guess they're good and and and they're like
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:31.400]  i want the government to keep me safe folks a government that can do that is always the big
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:39.320]  threat a lot more scary than some cave dwelling guy with a foo man chew beard i'm sorry don't
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:47.320]  you get it folks that's what our second amendment rights are for oh absolutely i appreciate your
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:52.040]  call and then they spun the bill and said it does allow the military to arrest americans
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:28:01.640]  but you know we've got to have our military able to shoot back under common law if somebody shoots
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:07.000]  at you no matter who you are military cop citizen you're allowed to shoot back
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:15.480]  okay let's go ahead now and get bob chatman's take on what uh the recon marine was saying
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:23.400]  what is very concerning uh not especially among older people my age and and that group
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:33.080]  uh they have been conditioned generally speaking all through the world war two and since that and
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:42.040]  they've been uh captured by the propaganda and it's understandable that you get a responses like you
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:50.360]  you the gentleman talked about from older people what's what's very very concerning here and i'm
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:59.240]  sure it is the to the gentleman who just called in is the military being injected into our society
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:09.640]  on a uh official and uh progressive basis uh that is not historically been the job of the
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:17.400]  military and it's something that they certainly don't want to do and it's something that could
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:25.240]  very well lead to revolution i mean you might have uh uh units decide no we're not going to do that
[02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:31.480]  and if that happens what does government do do they send other units after them
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:39.640]  and if they do that does the public get involved well i mean look look look stay there i want to
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:44.120]  get your take on this finish your story on the other side but these are the direct final steps

[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:37.240]  what's your view on the total military not military takeover total banker takeover through the
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:42.040]  military but that's nothing into posse commas comment on this is nothing compared to saying
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:49.080]  we'll secretly arrest you kill you torture you you will disappear forever uh your view on that
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:56.360]  well actually alex i was calling about uh something you were talking about earlier about cps taking
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:02.200]  away your children yeah that's all part of the martial law yes yes i actually happened to me
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:09.240]  yesterday i was on my way back from corpus in a highway patrolman pulled me over saying i crossed
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:15.400]  the the white line on the shoulder my two tires touched the reason he pulled me over when he asked
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:23.560]  me if i had any drugs or anything uh i told him no he asked me to search my car uh i told him no
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:32.520]  when he did he threatened me to put me in jail and put my son on child protector services now all
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:37.480]  this was because my driver's license was invalid because i haven't changed my driver my address
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:43.000]  in a year oh no i had a guy pull me over and try to say my address wasn't right and do all that
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  so what happened what happened i've had him on that same was it was it 37 uh yes there was 37
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.960]  no listen listen listen listen i mean i you know when a wolf's on you i got pulled over going five
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:00.520]  miles over the speed limit once and my two children were asleep in their in their safety
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:05.400]  chairs this is like six seven years ago or five years ago behind me and my wife were driving down
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:10.600]  to the beach about eight o'clock at night they pull us over and they walk over and they start
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:15.640]  looking at my kids and looking at me and there was a woman with a male and looking at me real
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:20.200]  criminally she said i want to check their seats and make sure they're safe or we're gonna have to do
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:26.040]  something and i said listen here right now okay you go ahead and give me your ticket but stop looking
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:31.480]  at my kids like that they weren't used to a slave so they kind of backed off but man they're oh this
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:36.200]  country's gone it's so gone it's so gone so did they did they take your son or just threatened to
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:41.640]  get him they just threatened and i felt the same way i felt as soon as the officer stepped out of
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:46.840]  his vehicle now here's the deal here's the deal our kids is enough and i'm going to tell the
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.320]  criminals in government keep your hands off of them okay i know you want to hand them over to your
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:57.080]  rapers okay but you work for pedophile scum and i put you on notice keep your hands off our kids
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:02.760]  keep your hands off of me you murdering scum you and they and by the way i got all the articles
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:07.080]  will they get the kids totally healthy and drug them up so bad they kill them i've just had enough
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:11.960]  of you murderers i'm sorry just i appreciate your call i can't hear it i can't hear it anymore
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:16.600]  chatman i'm gonna go to other calls i gotta settle down for a minute but do you want to comment on
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:25.720]  any of this no i think it's upsetting enough let's move on okay i can't handle it anymore
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:33.240]  you know it came out at surroguse espn knew about the tapes and the wife admitting the
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:39.240]  guys raping little kids and and espn covered it up bob and the state police in texas got
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:43.480]  ordered to stand down and basically did with all the youth commission where they raped the kids
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:50.040]  they i mean even if that idiot god doesn't isn't a child rapist himself when they take the kids
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:56.040]  that's who they take them to bob and i know you've researched this i'm am i exaggerating this threat
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:06.600]  of the pedophile armies uh you're not uh even touching the the the smallest part of it uh this
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:17.960]  is so and then has been so uh within our society for so many years and people in their decent minds
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:24.920]  can't conceive of people being that evil particularly with children and they've been
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:32.520]  getting away with it and they will continue to do so but times will change uh one way or the other
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:40.200]  and uh i think that they've made a terrible mistake uh one thing i would like to interject here
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:49.560]  and no Naomi prince touched on it in the previous letter part of the program and that is the very
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:59.640]  power of these people behind the scenes emanates from the financial sectors of all of society
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:04.920]  in the different countries the best thing that can happen to us and you're not going to like this
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:09.640]  because if you're not in gold and silver related assets you're going to lose almost
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:16.200]  everything but the best thing that could happen would be the collapse of the financial system
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:22.440]  and then we could go after these rats show the people what they've done and get rid of them
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:28.280]  and change the entire system bob you've done very first and i have in your 50 years fighting them
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:35.400]  but in every case it is the six big megabanks that she listed or here too in europe that run all the
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:43.800]  evil plans the shutdowns of power plants the cps the eugenics all of it i mean i mean here's abc news
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:48.680]  saying a year long investigation that 70 plus percent of the kids they grab they put on multiple
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:55.880]  drugs of course they do i mean i don't just get up here and say this and and and you know they
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:00.920]  can only push so far bob i mean that's that's what concerns me is years ago i still had a little
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:05.880]  concern and held back and stuff now i just am sick of these people i know they're criminal
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:13.240]  i know there's not no servants are a bunch of morons and i just and i you know i know more
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:20.520]  and more how the founding fathers felt in 1774 you know what i mean bob they had very little support
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:26.520]  very little and five percent of the people who were against the british and they made it work
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:35.320]  and uh people will never realize the chances that they took the hardship that they went through
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:40.280]  to make the country that we have today and we're not going to let these other people take
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:47.800]  it away from us and you know putting military on the streets of america just might boomerang
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:53.720]  and there might be a coup so i think the people in new york city of washington ought to think
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:44:00.440]  about that because you know something we're not going to take any prisoners well i think
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.520]  stewart rode's likened it to sticking their arm down a badger hole i mean that they really
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:09.560]  but that's what always happens to these arrogant people they always push too far bob
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:14.840]  you know the military you know the military is telling them not to do this and is on record
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.720]  on every front they're telling the bankers stop what they're doing you know why because they actually
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:25.880]  know what's going on and they know historically they're going into very dangerous waters right now
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:31.800]  you know again it's not just us going to dangerous waters the criminals the good the bad the ugly
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:39.320]  we're all going together there that's the thing this is not going to be fun for anybody that's
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:46.200]  for sure and don't forget there's a lot of good people out there in the military and law enforcement
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:50.840]  they're just waiting for us to say we want to help you and it's going to come about
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.160]  there are some positive things to this and these people continue to make mistakes we know that
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:03.000]  because we're breathing down their neck and uh we're going to win in the end we may pay a great
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:08.360]  price but we got to keep doing what we're doing especially with this legislation now which is
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:15.480]  coming up in the house we've got to climb all over washington we have to hit them with a
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:21.720]  hundred thousand or a million emails a day and just absolutely put them off kilter
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:27.880]  well if they start trying to snatch and grab citizens you know they're going to snatch and
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:33.880]  grab unpopular groups first to set the precedent but it's it's it's it's it's let's go to iron head
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:39.320]  in washington thanks for holding iron head your your trooper go ahead gentlemen absolute pleasure
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:45.560]  i've been a long time subscriber to bob i've been following you alex spreading your emanation
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.040]  emanation across the entire universe thank you we have to remind ourselves that life's going to
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:54.520]  give us whatever we need for the evolution of our consciousness and if both of you could now
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:01.400]  in metaphorically sense grab a magic marker walk up to your wall and write fear is the ultimate sin
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:07.640]  for displays the greatest lack of faith if we try to win this thing on a carnal temporal basis
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:11.560]  we're going to lose it big time it's going to go to a much higher place of consciousness
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:15.960]  alex i want to ask you the most powerful question you've ever had asked not forceful but power power
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:22.760]  versus force a man came to us two thousand years ago he said he was here to witness to the truth
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:28.120]  and to fulfill the prophecy in your heart not your mind not your left brain consciousness
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:31.960]  but through the morphic field that you and i and bob and millions others are now
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:38.360]  in trained in do you believe that is true and if so that will alleviate eliminate
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:43.880]  take away the fear no i know it and you're right the heart is where everything gets done
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:50.360]  and the heart has its own discernment and you're absolutely right i know we're going to defeat
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:55.560]  tyranny i know evil is weak and the globalist that's why they always want to make us feel like
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:01.400]  it's you know foregone conclusion the borg will absorb you resist this is futile because if you
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:05.080]  believe it's futile you're going to sit there and let them run over you i appreciate your call
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:10.360]  we're going to more calls here in a moment but uh yeah we've got to know that resistance is victory
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:16.280]  okay and you've got to just stop worrying what your neighbors and friends bob earlier
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:21.000]  had a military guy call in before you got on and he was currently you know in in virginia
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:28.600]  they're in the regular army and he was saying in big army he was saying that couple you three
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:33.320]  years ago everybody in his unit laughed at him and called him tinfoil hat now they call him
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:39.320]  nostradamus now they now they come to him for advice and or enter away and that's how it works
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:46.280]  we've got to be i mean how many decades have you been attacked for what you've done five and a half
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:52.200]  i'm an armadillo otherwise i wouldn't have survived
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:57.000]  but the point is is that you do see those seeds sprout later
[02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:04.600]  oh yes uh it was a hard road but uh and we had some great people along the way
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:12.200]  and they serve their purpose and they're gone and uh i'm here with uh g edward griffith and
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:20.200]  tony hilder and a few others and uh we're going to make it work we're going to make it work and
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.000]  it'll happen within the next five years when i don't know but they'll make their move and we'll
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:30.920]  be ready for them because we will have told hundreds of millions of people throughout the world
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:35.320]  this is what's going on and this is how to handle these people the minute they take the financial
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:42.120]  system down we've got to go after them well make no mistake we are at the history of
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:52.200]  we are at a historical juncture right now we are at a crossroads and and it is enjoyable when somebody
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:57.560]  laughs at me and attacks me because i know that i'm getting to them and they're at least having
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:02.440]  to give me a response and i know down the road i've just planted a seed in their mind that's
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:07.560]  going to sprout and so again you need to not just get to where you don't care of your neighbor or
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:14.040]  your boss or your employees laugh at you or your pastor you've got to get to where you enjoy standing
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:18.280]  up at church and saying i'm going to hand out a hundred of these dvds at the end about what's
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:23.240]  happening to america you need to get to the point where you enjoy going before city council you've
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:28.760]  got to get to the point where you enjoy it when a corrupt government bureaucrat comes up and threatens
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:34.440]  you even if they attack you you've got to get to where you enjoy it because it's giving that fight
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:40.520]  that is victory it is standing up and telling the truth and a testament of the truth that's where
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:46.680]  the real strength and power in this universe is and when we exercise the power we've got it
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:52.520]  trumps the enemy every time even if we're defeated individually the examples we give take the alamo
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:59.960]  all killed all destroyed but that example emboldened others and that's what it takes that's why they
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:05.000]  don't like to kill patriot leaders 30 40 years ago they did kill a lot of people even 20 years ago
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.800]  but they learned it doesn't work they know we're fertilizer to the tree of liberty they want to
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:16.280]  assassinate our character publicly they want to assassinate the image of us but it doesn't
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:22.920]  matter because we've now transmitted the idea transmitted the information and ideas are bullet

[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:25.480]  to them all here Philip it's military New Jersey even holding we really appreciate you joining us
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:30.360]  Philip what's your view on not just the end deposit commentatus but the announcement
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:35.800]  that the military will arrest citizens with no charges and that we can disappear into black holes
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:41.880]  it's an absolute tragedy Alex be quite honest with you and you know I can try to explain that in
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:47.400]  a real quick story about there's two types of officers and nco's in the military you've got
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:51.560]  the officers and the nco's they're kind of just people and they go along because they're really
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:58.360]  pretty scared for their security you know if uh if you you know subvert the system you either get
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:03.480]  kicked out or you uh gracefully get walked out of the gates and you're off you go to retirement
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:10.440]  and uh then you got the other guys who actually stand up their officers men or the nco's that
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:16.280]  lead from you know lead from the front and uh go back to a real real quick story I was in a
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:23.000]  parachute accident and uh basically I jumped out got tied to the plane and went in flight with the
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:28.520]  aircraft for about five minutes and uh the guy flying the plane was the ops group commander and
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:33.320]  he basically did everything contrary to the checklist and uh they basically it was a night
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:40.440]  jump zero visibility and uh they got me over the dv and without having any real confirmation that
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:47.800]  I was still conscious they cut me loose and uh make real long story short um they basically
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:54.360]  they basically just crushed the checklist and we have checklist for a reason so they they cut me
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:56:00.760]  away not knowing that I was conscious and able to pull my reserve chest my chest reserve and uh
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:06.680]  you know it turns out that I'm here I'm alive obviously because I'm talking to you but the
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:11.720]  the real thing is that you know they everybody wanted to praise this guy that you know he did
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:15.880]  these measures that you know that saved my life well he's not the one that saved my life I saved
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:20.680]  my own life and and no one wanted to hold him accountable well that's like the pat delman they
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:25.640]  murder him and then retread him and say that he was fighting al-qaeda and then it all comes out
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:31.480]  but that's classic where when there's uh corruption in the manufacturing of parts and they fail
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:37.720]  mechanics that expose it will get in trouble and just an incredible culture of corruption that that
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:44.200]  sets in bob Chapman uh this is a microcosm of everything we're talking about it certainly is
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:51.480]  and it shows me the entrapment in all phases of life uh the military law enforcement
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:58.200]  large transnational corporations national corporations on wall street and banking I mean
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:05.880]  you either do what's within the norm or you know you're out and sometimes they'll tolerate you
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:14.360]  adult depends on how far you go but uh the military is a very difficult place to express yourself
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.920]  and if they've got psyched and done that well and if they've got psycho leaders above you
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:23.720]  then that then everybody starts following the orders of those people and you've got an incredible
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:27.960]  tyranny did you have anything else you wanted to add sir oh yeah Alex it wasn't it not so much you
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:34.200]  know the guy's a psycho but uh mr Chapman and Naomi Prince mentioned conditioning and what people do
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:39.320]  to protect each other this this guy was the obstacle commander which is a pretty high ranking
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:45.240]  position in the military or in the in the squadron so I mean he theoretically if things
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.720]  went the way they should have in the investigation this guy very well could have lost his job as
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:56.760]  the obstacle commander and very well then retired from the military and uh it's just uh you know
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:03.960]  you said it well you know will people uh will people in the military you know rise up against
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:08.120]  this stuff I don't think so because it's conditioning but as long as you see you mentioned that 10 to
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:13.880]  5% of people that you know make a stand that's the difference in what makes you know the uh
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:20.360]  the the difference you know so and they I know you I know the time is short and I get
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:24.920]  thanks a lot for my uh service and I appreciate everybody who's thanked me for my service but
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:28.680]  if you really want to thank me for my service stand up your constitution your bill of rights
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:33.640]  absolutely there's this hollow thank you for the service but never talk about what is the
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:39.160]  military supposed to protect the constitution bill of rights instead it's being set up to destroy all
[02:58:39.160 --> 02:58:48.440]  of that thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today

[03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:12.680]  this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. live and we're gonna probably get Paul Craig Roberts with somebody on
[03:00:15.080 --> 03:00:19.480]  I forgot that had a liner sorry guys but here we are in overdrive uh Paul Craig Roberts has
[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:23.960]  an article up in a video up at m4wars.com right now congress is repealing the constitution
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:27.880]  Stuart Rhodes I think said it best congress has declared war on the people when they say it's all
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:33.240]  a battlefield we can secretly arrest you you can disappear forever I mean that is off the charts
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:38.120]  crazy I want to jam in a few final calls here for folks have been holding the longest like Frank
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:44.360]  and DeWayne try to get to somebody other but uh briefly that point of the five to ten percent
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:48.280]  it's always the five to ten percent that get involved I'm not saying I'm some great guy but
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:54.040]  I've seen a four-wheeler tumble over on somebody and there's six seven people standing around nobody
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:59.000]  helps but I do or a lady choking and everybody stands around and I have to go over and help her
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:03.640]  I mean and I don't think it's always been this bad it's been bred into us now and conditioned
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:09.000]  to just stand by and look for a specialist to do it that's how slaves are made Bob Chapman
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:17.480]  it certainly is one and doubt do it what's jamming a call here let's talk to a Frank
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:22.920]  former military get his take on this is it is this what you served for and swore notes of the
[03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:28.120]  Constitution so that the military could be used as a sword to slit the Constitution's throat Frank
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:37.000]  in a world of lies and deceit info wars.com is hard to beat info wars.com I do one of those seven
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:42.360]  second ads info wars ads every week right before the air rush lumbar here locally I come up with a
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:48.840]  different ad every week so uh anyway uh yeah Alex that's exactly why I joined you know the
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:54.680]  situation is surreal uh you know they used to say send in the Marines well I can see a time
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:02:01.000]  in your future where uh these US troops refused to obey these illegal orders people like uh
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:06.520]  that a feminine Lindsey Graham or they're going to say send in the Chinese let's get some Chinese
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:11.880]  troops in here to follow orders and abuse these uppity sheep well I agree with you and
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:17.000]  look they wouldn't be being this overt if they weren't scared and I'm going to answer my own
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:22.280]  question they're overt about it now and have thrown down the gauntlet because they need to be able to
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:27.000]  tell the military commanders look we passed the law now order the military out there to secretly
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:32.440]  arrest people send the trucks around door to door I mean uh but Chapman do you see my point
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:36.440]  they're being overt now because they're thinking about trying to activate this
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:44.440]  you're absolutely correct they think the time is right I think a lot will have to do too with
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:49.880]  the next election as to how they proceed and hopefully we will have an election and I think
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:55.880]  we will have an election um if Rod Paul gets elected and people like him get elected with him
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:01.640]  that could change everything and by the way the engine the engine of the incredible free market
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:07.480]  is so powerful that we could turn this bad economy around so fast the globalists admit
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:13.960]  they spend all their time trying to screw up the economy Bob and that's true and if you noticed all
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:20.200]  the saving things that have been done have been done to the financial sector and to governments
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:29.400]  who spend more money than they should yes uh the the conditions that we see today are things
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:36.360]  that they have created yes and they think it's time to move and god help america if ron paul is
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:41.960]  not elected because they don't go into high gear they are going into high gear a duane a marine

[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:07.400]  you know was was basically to be the sword uh you know to to rip up the constitution uh yeah
[03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:13.000]  that's what we joined but of course then probably uh you know we were a lot of us were blind but now
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:20.600]  we're not uh you know and and uh you know those are just things that that we we know who's behind

[03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:28.760]  getting deeper down the road but as bad as things look now this is nothing
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:35.560]  this is nothing it's like telling somebody keep driving down that road and they're 50 miles you're
[03:08:35.560 --> 03:08:42.120]  going to come to a forest and now you can finally see the forest off in the distance well we're
[03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:46.920]  telling you keep going down that road you're going to come to tyranny and now people can see the first
[03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:53.400]  levels of tyranny but it gets a lot deeper and a lot worse and i've been to so many urban warfare
[03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:59.240]  drills i've made films it's on tape police state 2000 and others where it shows the military
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:05.000]  trained to take our guns now that was in certain small cadres now it's expanding across the entire
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:10.760]  military i had guys oh this is like 10 years ago show me footage they came to the tv station
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:17.160]  they were at a military base an army base most of my air force in san antonio but it was marines
[03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:26.360]  at a base at an army base training to mow down people with signs saying don't take our land land
[03:09:26.360 --> 03:09:32.440]  rights you know patriot type folks you'd call them tea party today i said please let me show this
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:37.240]  and they said nope we're doing a roof job and we'll end up losing our contracts but i wanted you
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:42.280]  to see this and i'm like thanks a lot for showing it to me but i mean i got a lot of stuff like that
[03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:49.160]  myself it's just that now they admit will arrest citizens for any reason and they've got plans and
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:55.800]  grids and markings and gps of your door to come knock and say come with us and put you on an army
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:10:01.400]  truck now i want to tell folks from the army trucks you may think you've got america buffalo
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:06.680]  the commanders the globalist the controllers and they'll give you some cover story for a while this
[03:10:06.680 --> 03:10:13.880]  is going to happen they can use a bio attack domestic terror any of it or both but it isn't
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:20.920]  cowardice that's been people uh you're holding back it's just a hope that we can fix things peacefully
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:27.240]  a lot of people don't care about dying a lot of people know the secret of life that it's like five
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:32.840]  minutes long okay and they're tired of it and people aren't just going to sit in their houses
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:37.080]  and wait for the swat teams and the police to come at three a.m. once this thing kicks off i mean
[03:10:37.080 --> 03:10:41.880]  i'm sure you understand that and no amount of gadgets and tracking and kill switches is going
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:48.840]  to protect you okay we don't want to go here i don't want a civil war the globalists do
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:53.800]  they don't care if police and military get killed now i went into extra overdrive into the fourth
[03:10:53.800 --> 03:10:57.240]  hour bob chap is going to give us a comment i'll take a few more calls like dusting others but
[03:10:57.240 --> 03:11:02.680]  dwayne a marine in texas called and said he talked to a woman who works i think he said north of grumman
[03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:06.440]  who does a lot of defense contracting and managing that's right up there at the top of the pyramid
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:11.720]  and defense contracting about plans to go jerk whole families out well that's actually in the
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:17.960]  emergency model states health emergency powers act it's in the emergency centers establishment
[03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:22.840]  act which that bill is so important because it's a blueprint for what's already built and they
[03:11:22.840 --> 03:11:27.240]  admit that they just want to get additional funding and it kind of have it go public kind of like they
[03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:31.880]  got rid of posse common taught us militarize the police a long time ago now they're just officially
[03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:36.040]  doing it and saying by the way we'll throw you in the dungeon and nobody'll know where you went
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:41.160]  so a steward road said an extra to get in tears in his eyes the other night i've never seen him do
[03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:46.920]  that this is like death con four going to death con five and there's a certain point where
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:52.360]  there all you you know phony tough guys that work for the system who really buy all this propaganda
[03:11:52.360 --> 03:11:58.360]  because i've seen their training videos i've seen like it's something out of a body snatcher
[03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:03.160]  movie where the cops are all being told george washington's bad they're all nodding their heads
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:09.560]  and and gasping at the name of thomas jefferson i mean it's like they're north korean generals
[03:12:09.560 --> 03:12:13.960]  or something i mean they're so whacked out i don't know how they got to this point i mean
[03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:19.960]  as a normal american watching this it's like what i mean you cannot believe it you've seen
[03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:24.120]  the road to tyranny folks i mean you cannot believe when they pull a woman over but they
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:28.920]  stop her at a checkpoint in a rural road and they say we want to search your car and abby newman no
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:34.280]  criminal record naval veterans is no they jerk her out say we're going to charge her with assault
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:40.600]  she doesn't assault them they get a pocket constitution and start
[03:12:40.600 --> 03:12:47.240]  hyper ventilating the idiots had sworn an oath to the document now they're acting like it's
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:54.840]  satan was in the back of the car i mean they are i mean i don't believe normal brainwashing
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:13:00.680]  could even do that i mean i'm sorry dwayne finish your story because the music was cutting over
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:05.080]  you start over tell us about who you talk to about the plans to round up families i mean
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:09.160]  it's all admitted now it's just it's good to hear some of the details tell us about it
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:15.880]  yeah well you know alex the the funny thing about it was it's been almost i would go as
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:22.440]  far as i say about two months ago uh i used to work for a company who provided a certain service
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:30.440]  and uh of course north ruberman is one of the uh major military industrial complexes that receives
[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:40.040]  a uh a stipend or a uh what do you call a discount on their monthly service and and of course
[03:13:40.040 --> 03:13:46.200]  her and i began to talk and and she said that she was working out at for poke right probably
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:53.000]  50 miles away from where i'm located and i asked her i said uh you know if you heard anything
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:14:00.120]  about you know anything that's on the ground as far as you know uh citizen uh dissent you know or
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:05.080]  they training for any of that or anything she's she kind of pulled me over to the side and she said
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:10.440]  you know normally i would have never talked about this with you know and sure sure enough
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:16.040]  you know she stated that they are actually right now as we are speaking right now very much in the
[03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:22.200]  middle of that uh anything from crowd control obviously to uh the extraction of families
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:27.560]  from their very home and the property in which they live in yeah that's for poloiziana correct
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:33.560]  that is correct you know we have the cooperative nugget videos of them training with foreign troops
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:40.680]  with roleplayers saying i'm an american as us and foreign troops kill us and and if you don't
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:45.960]  believe me i have the boy scouts in the new york times training to kill veterans i mean they actually
[03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:55.000]  train the boy scouts and explorer scout to kill the veterans yeah i mean as as as as wide spread
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:02.280]  is this you know it almost sounds like a nightmarish fairy tale you know but but what people don't
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:08.920]  understand is it's actually happening uh like i said they're even a neighbor of mine who lives
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:14.360]  you know right across the street from me you know he he proclaims the same exact thing and he was a
[03:15:14.360 --> 03:15:21.480]  he just got out of the army as a matter of fact uh you know he states the same exact thing you know
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:28.360]  that that that they are actually practicing those things and going into great detail with it that's
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:35.320]  the scary part you know they're trying to learn every asset or or just or basically uh they're
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:41.320]  training everyone the mechanics no i've confirmed it listen they admit it it's just they always say
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:45.720]  we want the army to help fight al qaeda but we're gonna have checkpoints and crowd control and the
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:51.320]  entire architecture is built for the average american then you get the manuals and it's us
[03:15:51.320 --> 03:15:57.480]  if you're actually a real american you are the enemy because this is a foreign corporate takeover
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:04.600]  of the country and they hate freedom and it's real and it's heartable and they're going to do it
[03:16:04.600 --> 03:16:09.080]  and we've got to get ready uh that's why i'm desperately hear people say how is this guy
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:14.280]  working 18 hours a day because once they shut us down and we go dark folks it's up to you
[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:19.960]  i mean you've got to know you they're not going to give you quarter they're not going to stop
[03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:24.440]  and and once we go down over the edge it just gets worse and worse god bless you dwayne
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:28.680]  i got to go i got a meeting i got to go to bob Chapman i'm going to let we're going to out of
[03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:33.000]  break here in in three and a half minutes and i've got to go do this interview right now bob
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:36.680]  info wars not only news tonight it's going to be particularly power packed at prison planet
[03:16:36.680 --> 03:16:41.560]  dot tv but uh i'm going to give you the last three four minutes uh taking us out to break
[03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:46.360]  and then i'll see everybody back live a sunday four to six p.m but bob i'm going to let you co-host
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:50.520]  and uh take us out here with the final word the international forecaster dot com bob Chapman
[03:16:52.280 --> 03:16:58.040]  well i think we all have to discern whether we want to defend ourselves and our families and our
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:07.560]  heritage whether we want to allow what was built by our forebearers to get on the sewer
[03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:15.880]  and it's up to us to act and do the things that are needed and information is at the heart of that
[03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:22.040]  we have that today and we've had it for the last 20 years we didn't have it before then
[03:17:23.160 --> 03:17:30.440]  and so we've got to use it so you've got to use alex's dvds and distribute them to people
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  tell people to listen to the program and other programs that are similar
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  where they can get a handle on what's going on out there i generally usually
[03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:48.040]  deeply deal with financial and economic baddest throughout the world but as you've seen
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:54.920]  i'm pretty conversant in other things as well and these are the things that you have to do
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:18:02.280]  information to other people preparing your own family with dehydrated and freeze dried food
[03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:08.280]  a water filter being able to defend your family and then if you have more money getting involved
[03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:15.160]  in gold and silver related assets because it's the only safe place to be and you've got to
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:22.360]  and it's so important even if your family doesn't believe you or agree with you and
[03:18:22.360 --> 03:18:28.520]  i'm the hottest people to convince believe me and even your close friends all of a sudden they'll
[03:18:28.520 --> 03:18:33.400]  wake up one day like we heard today with the marine that was on the program
[03:18:35.720 --> 03:18:43.240]  the gene ostradamus you had that all figured out and then he becomes the leader because
[03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:49.720]  he understands what the problems are and so you have to get into that position
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:54.520]  you have to tell people about these things and all of a sudden they say gee
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:19:00.280]  gee joe or mary said that and they were right and then they start listening
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:09.080]  and so you keep after people you continue to bring the message forward and that's why i do
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:14.040]  these programs i do lots of them and some of them i've done for a long time i've been off and on
[03:19:14.040 --> 03:19:23.080]  with alex for many years and um i have a soft place in my heart for the active and retired
[03:19:23.080 --> 03:19:30.040]  military people because i'm a veteran myself and that's why i do the marine disquisition every
[03:19:30.040 --> 03:19:38.360]  thursday which is a top rated program on blog talk and so we've got to do our job each and every one
[03:19:38.360 --> 03:19:47.560]  of us you may not think it's important but it is just one person learns from you what they're
[03:19:47.560 --> 03:20:01.240]  supposed to do what they should expect and you've accomplished everything
