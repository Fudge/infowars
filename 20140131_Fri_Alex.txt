[01:12.080 --> 01:15.920]  feds came in and basically had him removed because he signed a pledge to uphold

[02:23.840 --> 02:29.160]  officially when a lot of stations join us and go over what's happening but very
[02:29.160 --> 02:32.960]  interesting article that I saw up on dredgerport.com that I'm gonna have
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.480]  cloned over at info wars.com just for posterity in case they take it down
[02:37.480 --> 02:42.760]  because sometimes Politico does. Politico dear Americans I saw you naked and
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.320]  yes we were laughing confessions of an XTSA agent we broke all this four years
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.600]  ago in 2010 we told you all of it we told you they were lying that they were
[02:51.600 --> 02:56.680]  saving the images we talked to TSA people on and off record and we showed
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.040]  the video of them looking at your naked body shot by patriots through the
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.440]  security windows into areas where they even had jokes up on screen about
[03:06.440 --> 03:12.440]  pedo bear a pedo bear graphic a pedo bear is like a TSA agent you know a
[03:12.440 --> 03:19.480]  little bear about how they're teaching the kids how to be pedophiles and that
[03:19.480 --> 03:23.320]  photo and video of that through their screening area has been confirmed now
[03:23.320 --> 03:27.760]  was that TSA agents pointing out what they're doing is wrong because in this
[03:27.760 --> 03:32.920]  article it has them saying most TSA officers I talked to told me they felt
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.400]  the agency's day-to-day operations represented an abuse of public trust and
[03:36.400 --> 03:41.240]  funds see they know that most of me though I attacked the TSA it's this it's
[03:41.240 --> 03:44.920]  the system in the Congress and the president they almost always asked for
[03:44.920 --> 03:50.640]  my autograph and just you know wave me through but then it'll be some manager
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.360]  comes over who's a thug and gets in my face and they've had countless cases of
[03:56.360 --> 03:59.800]  Hollywood stars where they come over with the printout in England and here the
[03:59.800 --> 04:03.120]  same system since they can I have a you've signed the naked printout of
[04:03.120 --> 04:08.600]  yourself or these men sometimes was the case in Texas they settled it was a
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.240]  really good-looking woman they said man you're really hot and made her take her
[04:13.240 --> 04:18.160]  top off down to the bra and they actually asked her out for dates just you
[04:18.160 --> 04:22.160]  know some guys think if they have the authority that's their right to then
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.520]  basically push it on a woman I mean this stuff really happens and you know it's
[04:27.520 --> 04:31.040]  getting crazier and crazier where they're patting down Eric Baldwin's

[08:23.000 --> 08:29.440]  he it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[08:38.280 --> 08:44.960]  we know what authoritarianism looks like we know what an autocratic oppressive
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.080]  unfair system where the elite are exempt from the laws and the people are
[08:50.080 --> 08:55.760]  enslaved by them we know what it looks like and a very high-tech disgusting
[08:55.760 --> 09:01.120]  form of it is being established right now it's so incredibly cynical you know
[09:01.120 --> 09:08.280]  when george w bush was doing unconstitutional things and was violating
[09:08.280 --> 09:12.920]  the bill of rights and constitution and launching illegal wars I was a staunch
[09:12.920 --> 09:18.360]  critic and I was attacked by the establishment right wing and I was
[09:18.360 --> 09:23.760]  attacked by the establishment left wing because the establishment left was not
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.480]  actually really against those wars and they helped to continue them and now
[09:29.480 --> 09:34.240]  that we've seen six plus years of Obama in the nightmare has been I don't know
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.480]  three times worse than bush on most fronts ten times on others I mean I I'm
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.040]  not exaggerating it's so insane I'm totally shocked and then I see
[09:43.040 --> 09:48.400]  Democratic Party run and controlled groups out there that make jokes about
[09:48.400 --> 09:54.520]  everything we talk about you know who the usual suspects are raw story media
[09:54.520 --> 10:00.920]  matters Huffington Post Salon and they sit there knowing that we're telling the
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.280]  truth knowing that we're in a societal crisis but lying to their readers and
[10:05.280 --> 10:08.920]  viewers going haha look at alex jones look at Rand Paul look at Ted Cruz
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.760]  they're discredited they're insane no one listens to them everyone's laughing

[10:21.160 --> 10:26.560]  funding al-Qaeda is wonderful crushing Assad is wonderful and I sit there and I
[10:26.560 --> 10:30.440]  look at it and I know that they know that's all a lie and they're just trying
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.880]  to create a con artist facade that everything's okay well not everything's
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.680]  not okay for you guys all of your readership and trust levels are
[10:40.680 --> 10:48.040]  plunging look at MSNBC CNN literally imploded libertarianism worldwide is
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.000]  taking over the fact that the state is nothing but a corrupt tool of corrupt
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.680]  institutions both private and corporate and public is a fact the truth is we're
[10:57.680 --> 11:04.520]  rising you're falling and in BC MSNBC are sinking to the bottom of who the
[11:04.520 --> 11:10.600]  public trust that's the facts I'm not in a war with you people you're very sad
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.800]  Benedict Arnold's you are very sad trendies that try to come up with the
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.180]  best lies and disinformation so that George Soros and people will throw you a
[11:20.180 --> 11:26.120]  bone I mean you could put a gun to my head and say lie for the establishment
[11:26.120 --> 11:32.040]  and I would say go to hell and it's because I'm free and I'm honorable and
[11:32.040 --> 11:38.800]  I'm real and it just freaks me out that that of all the news I'm gonna cover
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.200]  here in a moment it's incredible I read what was in the the multi thousand page
[11:44.200 --> 11:48.840]  Obamacare legislation because senators and others put out cheat sheets of what
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.520]  subsections to go to and I read hundreds of pages every week or so when
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.080]  different versions came out of the three thousand pages I scanned over the
[11:57.080 --> 12:04.520]  13,000 pages first 10,000 and 3,000 more of addendums and changes and basically it
[12:04.520 --> 12:09.960]  was a blank check to do whatever they want share all your data NSA the medical
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.600]  records federalize it give it to all these corporate interests kick people
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.360]  off their existing plans kick people off that had pre-existing conditions not
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.280]  cover children lower the quality of care double triple quadruple prices shut
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.600]  down small health care divisions and providers small insurance companies and
[12:28.600 --> 12:36.480]  HMOs small clinic chains that help the poor I come from a family of physicians
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.160]  and health care management I mean I know about this stuff and I had doctors on I
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.240]  had researchers on the insurance companies brag that they wrote it they
[12:44.240 --> 12:50.120]  lobby to get it passed the Republican leadership helped write it and I said
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.680]  this is a bipartisan screw job and it's really gonna hurt people and they said
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.000]  you're a liar there's no death panels you're a liar it'll cut it in half you're
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.320]  a liar you can keep your doctor and I just sit there and they're still
[13:01.320 --> 13:06.440]  defending it saying we're discredited and Ted Cruz is discredited and they're
[13:06.440 --> 13:11.680]  literally just catering to the most mindless trendies out there and that
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.720]  hurts me that that my fellow countrymen could be such evil mercenaries I don't
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.800]  even hate these people I'm very very sad for them because their future is
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.920]  going to be sold out as well I want prosperity and I know about British
[13:26.920 --> 13:30.360]  health care I know about UK health care I know about European health care I have
[13:30.360 --> 13:36.080]  crew members that live in Europe and in England I know when you go in with a

[17:02.080 --> 17:09.800]  and then before him it was have one of those moments who's the guy with the
[17:09.800 --> 17:18.920]  demon eyes yeah Tony Blair and they would get up there and say you got out of
[17:18.920 --> 17:21.880]  the brain surgery in one month but you make him wait 18 they're dying yes it's
[17:21.880 --> 17:27.680]  unacceptable we're sorry but it continues this is the plan this is the
[17:27.680 --> 17:31.880]  plan and it's like they're denying kids care they're kicking people off the
[17:31.880 --> 17:35.680]  coverage there they're getting ready to euthanize old people and then they have
[17:35.680 --> 17:38.840]  the cover of Newsweek saying yeah it's the case for killing granny and they
[17:38.840 --> 17:43.000]  just laugh at us and go yes we're liberal give us another peace prize and
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  it's all done so these big megabanks can reap trillions and profits that own
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.520]  the insurance companies and then all these so-called liberal groups that say
[17:52.520 --> 17:57.320]  they have the moral high ground it's all this game where they tell you they have
[17:57.320 --> 18:00.480]  the moral high ground and then you respond to them and go I promise I'm
[18:00.480 --> 18:04.480]  not racist because I don't want Obamacare it's a really bad bill they go
[18:04.480 --> 18:11.360]  sure racist I mean these are really evil people and you have to come to grips
[18:11.360 --> 18:13.800]  with that and they're not going to address little kids not getting
[18:13.800 --> 18:16.680]  health care now and then it's getting rid of the free health care that was
[18:16.680 --> 18:20.200]  always there for the poor charity care is being gotten rid of under this this
[18:20.200 --> 18:24.560]  is the dream of it big insurance companies now let's go to this clip of
[18:24.560 --> 18:31.280]  another great accomplishment of the fascist criminal kleptocratic cult that
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.160]  is the Democratic Party with the Republican leadership that is basically
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.960]  the same group here it is children filed requests on behalf of 125 of their
[18:39.960 --> 18:43.960]  patients of those they say they got only 20 responses eight of which were
[18:43.960 --> 18:48.320]  denials Dr. Sandy Meltzer said all this comes after reassurances and certain
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.680]  unique specialty cases would still be covered for some of the patients who
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.960]  were denied are ones who clearly would fall into that unique category the two
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.320]  year old with a new significant neck mass that was being evaluated for
[19:03.320 --> 19:10.480]  infection or malignancy an older child with a chronic of severe medical
[19:10.480 --> 19:15.320]  condition requiring multidisciplinary care here a baby that had a skull
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.920]  abnormality children's went ahead and treated those cases anyway but dr.
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.760]  Meltzer said they can't afford to keep doing it that way a spokesman for
[19:23.760 --> 19:27.960]  yeah so what's happening is the doctors in the hospitals are still doing the
[19:27.960 --> 19:31.040]  treatments under the Hippocratic oath which they officially got rid of 25
[19:31.040 --> 19:36.440]  years ago worldwide but it's gonna bankrupt health care and that's the
[19:36.440 --> 19:41.800]  plan as the architect of it Zeke a manual sent on Fox so of course we're
[19:41.800 --> 19:45.840]  gonna bankrupt it but it's gonna be social as fascist but the profits gonna
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.940]  go to banks so you're gonna pay a lot more for nothing and you people don't
[19:50.940 --> 19:53.720]  care you Democrats don't care as long as you feel like you're on a winning team
[19:53.720 --> 19:57.680]  you're like a bandwagon like idiot sports fans you're the same type of
[19:57.680 --> 20:03.720]  people so good job good job but we travel so much and having a fake TV gives

[20:18.000 --> 20:22.240]  mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and

[24:27.520 --> 24:33.360]  you fool me with your kisses you cheated
[24:33.360 --> 24:40.080]  we've got the new cover of the new February magazine that just came in
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.720]  today and is on sale in bulk at cost right now in infowarsstore.com and it
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.160]  is a riot police officer with my face on him with a halo over his head but the
[24:51.160 --> 24:56.640]  shadow is of a devil and you learn what this cover that I came up with Molly
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.800]  Rogers actually created a great graphics person you learn what it means inside it
[25:00.800 --> 25:04.920]  means we're all angels and devils inside we can be an angel we can be a devil
[25:04.920 --> 25:09.360]  same thing with the police they are a reflection of society and of and of the
[25:09.360 --> 25:15.080]  governing class and we the people have to take the police back by taking back
[25:15.080 --> 25:20.880]  our communities and by humanizing them so they will humanize us and so that
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.000]  they become aware of the federalization and the globalization and how they're
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.080]  being turned against the population it is essential that we engage the military
[25:30.080 --> 25:35.680]  and police now the military is almost completely awake the police on average
[25:35.680 --> 25:42.160]  are more awake than even the general public so the police are one of our
[25:42.160 --> 25:45.560]  greatest hopes and also one of our greatest dangers that's always the way
[25:45.560 --> 25:52.120]  it is in in history whatever is the hope is also the danger and so it is an
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.160]  essential that we understand that the move to demonize police that become
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.720]  constitutionalists or oathkeepers is because the system is desperate but
[26:01.720 --> 26:04.000]  they've already backed off claiming they were going to fire that police chief
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.720]  now they're going to reprimand him but now they're investigating because of
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.320]  the huge backlash that he signed an oath to uphold the Constitution and a
[26:11.320 --> 26:16.080]  meeting with Richard Mack a famous sheriff who's won at the Supreme Court
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.800]  and defeated the Brady bill I mean a police chief is a lot I mean all all
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.480]  these police chiefs and go stand on stage with Obama and call for banning guns
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.280]  so police chiefs can't say they're gonna uphold the Constitution you swore an
[26:29.280 --> 26:32.760]  oath to it but they're already backing off and we've got that police chief
[26:32.760 --> 26:38.320]  coming on with David Knight in the third hour along with Richard Mack today the
[26:38.320 --> 26:44.680]  police chief from out in New Mexico but he got pulled a TSA and then by someone
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.200]  calling himself a fed who wouldn't even identify himself saying where are you
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.680]  going what are you doing they had it in the database folks with data mining with
[26:52.680 --> 26:58.480]  the NSA this is admitted with the TSA they had it in the data mine that he was
[26:58.480 --> 27:01.760]  going to that meeting a big public meeting in Las Vegas see they don't want
[27:01.760 --> 27:05.800]  us to act official and big they want us to work camo and hide in the woods like
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.280]  we've done something wrong and have code words so the feds can infiltrate our
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.000]  movements and set us up no no we wear suits and ties we're taking America back
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.120]  we're the good guys statistically libertarian conservatives have the
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.720]  lowest crime rate highest level of being middle-classed highest level of
[27:22.720 --> 27:27.520]  charity highest level of heroism of saving people go look at the crime
[27:27.520 --> 27:32.800]  statistics we're the good guys we're the good guys okay go look at the crime
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.160]  statistics we are we're the good guys we're the good guys
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.840]  conservative libertarian Americans we're the good guys where where Audie Murphy
[27:41.840 --> 27:47.040]  came from the whole nine yards ladies and gentlemen John Wayne true grit that's
[27:47.040 --> 27:50.800]  who we are we don't like screwing people over we don't like cheating people
[27:50.800 --> 27:54.960]  we're honorable and all you corrupt people call us chumps no you're the
[27:54.960 --> 27:58.400]  chumps we don't want to live in a country over Roman corruption we want our
[27:58.400 --> 28:03.360]  kids to be safe we want to be treated like we're gonna treat others I'm
[28:03.360 --> 28:09.600]  starting to rant here the point is that's coming up but speaking of TSA we
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.360]  we broke this with drudge back in 2010 when drudge would carry our articles
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.560]  every three or four days showing the naked body scanner images leaking showing
[28:17.560 --> 28:20.640]  the TSA admitting that they were keeping the images showing them grope
[28:20.640 --> 28:24.080]  people and they said they weren't and then here it is political you guys will
[28:24.080 --> 28:29.800]  punch this up punch up the political article so I can show viewers and scroll
[28:29.800 --> 28:35.040]  through it the naked body scanning shows the genitals the breast everything and
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.680]  then they dear Americans I saw you naked and yes we are laughing confessions of
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.080]  an X TSA agent remember when they said oh we can't see a naked or then we don't
[28:43.080 --> 28:47.600]  save the images it's all bull we and others were able to go up to the glass
[28:47.600 --> 28:54.880]  put our cameras up to the glass zoom in on them looking at people naked next to
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.440]  we got to find that photo from the screenshot of them looking at a pedo
[28:58.440 --> 29:02.160]  bear deal in the control room like making a joke about it about hey kids
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.720]  learn how to learn about pedo bear that's what they have on their screens
[29:05.720 --> 29:10.120]  it's all a joke to them now the lower level ones though not the ones behind
[29:10.120 --> 29:14.240]  the glass they said most TSA officers you're not officers you're not sworn
[29:14.240 --> 29:20.040]  folks I talked to told me they felt the agency's day-to-day operations
[29:20.040 --> 29:27.080]  represented an abuse of public trust and funds you see that of course the
[29:27.080 --> 29:30.160]  majority of them don't like doing this one of the highest turnovers it's like
[29:30.160 --> 29:35.280]  a 35% turnover a year the only thing higher is CPS at 52% because most social
[29:35.280 --> 29:38.600]  workers get into it for good reason they find out it's a scam and get out the
[29:38.600 --> 29:41.920]  problem is they just get a bucket of scum that's left we'll be right back

[34:49.720 --> 34:53.560]  us because the economy stock markets are going down big-time worldwide especially
[34:53.560 --> 34:58.000]  in Europe and it's all on currency devaluations that's what's happening

[35:32.720 --> 35:35.960]  things for my body I know just take the challenge regardless you're supporting
[35:35.960 --> 35:39.360]  the broadcast and then you'll learn why there's so much listener-generated
[35:39.360 --> 35:44.760]  enthusiasm not even hype because it simply is that amazing and then you've
[35:44.760 --> 35:48.360]  got fluoride shield it's really the best deal we've got it's got the nascent
[35:48.360 --> 35:53.280]  iodine in it but it's double the size in the container and has five other key

[39:11.320 --> 39:14.600]  right now but we're getting there so thank you all for your support that's
[39:14.600 --> 39:18.160]  why it's so essential to also support our local AM and FM affiliates to become
[39:18.160 --> 39:21.640]  sponsors to spread the word about those broadcasts or to support the local
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.440]  sponsors and let them know why you're supporting them I mean we're in a war
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.280]  here if you hear us on an AM or FM over 160 around the country you gotta stop on
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.960]  the side of the street you gotta go into business and tell people tune into this
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.600]  show that's how we're reaching people and despite a media blackout over the
[39:37.600 --> 39:43.200]  years we've risen from obscurity to very high profile which is extremely
[39:43.200 --> 39:48.760]  dangerous but I'm gonna go for it all folks I'm not looking for treasure I'm
[39:48.760 --> 39:53.640]  not looking for money I'm looking for freedom I would give my life right now
[39:53.640 --> 39:56.480]  to bring down the new world order I want to be clear about that it's not even a
[39:56.480 --> 40:00.240]  question if I had to hit a button that would defeat the new world order but
[40:00.240 --> 40:03.440]  kill me at the same time I would hit that button instantly as fast as I could
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.800]  I wouldn't sit there and wait one second boom I'd hit that button because I want a
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.160]  future for our children now I don't want to die at the same time and I'm not
[40:11.160 --> 40:13.840]  planning anything violent because I don't believe that's the most effective
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.440]  thing to do I know it's not that's not a cop out it's info war they want us to
[40:18.440 --> 40:22.640]  get violent we're winning the hearts and minds right now now Jakari Jackson is
[40:22.640 --> 40:26.000]  there in Times Square Jakari first off what have you experienced in New Jersey

[40:41.080 --> 40:45.080]  to prisonplanet.tv they're up on info wars right now where you got pretty
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.480]  fired up last night and some of the questions you're gonna be out there
[40:48.480 --> 40:53.400]  asking coming up. Jakari Jackson from New York City. Hey Alex we're out here
[40:53.400 --> 40:57.440]  exposing the police state and the distraction that is the Super Bowl and
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.120]  you're talking about got fired up last night I blew up my voice two minutes
[41:01.120 --> 41:04.880]  into my first report I came out here and pulled an Alamo but we continued on
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.000]  we're out here trying to talk to people wake some people up we talked to people
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.760]  about a very important topic we're talking about the police state here in a
[41:11.760 --> 41:15.120]  second Alex but we just a moment ago shot a man on the street talking about a
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.200]  very important topic that being global warming as you can see Alex maybe you
[41:19.200 --> 41:22.880]  can't see on the iPhone but it's snowing out here yeah panorail have Josh panorail
[41:22.880 --> 41:26.720]  give them a little look there Josh so it's snowing out here in New York you
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.600]  see all these people in their hats and scarves and we've heard about the ice
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.280]  breakers getting stuck in ice Art Acevedo the Austin police chief is warning
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.840]  people not to drive in the city of Austin because of black ice on the road
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.600]  but I'll thank you sir if you would just walk by but they're they're saying that
[41:41.600 --> 41:44.040]  you need to pay your carbon taxes so I want everybody out there to pay your
[41:44.040 --> 41:47.400]  carbon taxes to Al Gore because I'm here in my scarf and my under armor and
[41:47.400 --> 41:51.800]  Josh has on some under armors where so pay your your carbon taxes to Al Gore
[41:51.800 --> 41:57.320]  now let's talk about the police state there's a huge huge police presence out
[41:57.320 --> 42:03.600]  here we've seen guys walking around with canines we've seen the the temporary
[42:03.600 --> 42:07.240]  viewing devices all the screens and stuff their helicopters flying above I
[42:07.240 --> 42:10.760]  don't know if we can see any right now but there's a huge police presence right
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.200]  here in Times Square and we're out here in Times Square because they won't allow
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.560]  people to congregate outside the Super Bowl they don't want you to be out there
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.920]  because the hefty house to build another giant shrine to themselves out there so
[42:21.920 --> 42:25.280]  the fans are out here but when we get to the Super Bowl Alex that's when the real
[42:25.280 --> 42:28.760]  tyranny is going to come in because we're out here in New York and there's a
[42:28.760 --> 42:32.320]  lot of talk about stopping frisk people being stopped and frisked and pretty
[42:32.320 --> 42:35.920]  much molested here on the streets in New York but if you go to New Jersey you
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.680]  will willfully submit to being stopped and frisk when you go into the Super Bowl
[42:39.680 --> 42:43.040]  you're going to be patted down you're gonna have to bring it all your personal
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.080]  effects in in a clear baggy and I think it's to the point where you might as well
[42:47.080 --> 42:50.880]  just opt out opt in rather for a proctology exam because that's what's
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.600]  going to take to keep this country safe well that's right Ming sarcastic there
[42:54.600 --> 42:59.600]  you actually ran into people that would accept a proctology exam or a cavity
[42:59.600 --> 43:05.440]  search for their safety last night that videos up on info wars dot com and I
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.640]  know they have stopping frisk violating the Fourth Amendment 300 400,000 times
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.240]  a year in New York have you been stopped and frisked yet because I know
[43:13.240 --> 43:16.920]  they're reporting in Georgia there's a new video out where the police actually
[43:16.920 --> 43:21.000]  now pull people's pants down randomly and and are doing that have you seen
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.360]  any of that there jacari no I have not personally been stopped and frisked the
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.400]  police are in pretty good behavior out here we encountered a police officer who
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.320]  was a viewer we didn't have a chance to speak to me just said hey guys and he
[43:32.320 --> 43:36.160]  walked on about his business so the police are out here I'll give them that
[43:36.160 --> 43:39.280]  much so that they're a pretty good at least today I don't know how they are in
[43:39.280 --> 43:43.160]  other areas and I don't believe it's the Times Square area where mostly stop and
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.080]  frisk take place they're kind of out in the the other boroughs so you know I
[43:47.080 --> 43:49.600]  haven't been stopped and frisked and hopefully I won't but I definitely will
[43:49.600 --> 43:56.680]  be TSA style molested when I go to the Super Bowl how about flying up to New
[43:56.680 --> 44:02.560]  York and New Jersey where'd you fly into I forget I believe was Newark Josh
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.200]  there's no work yet we flew into to Newark Liberty yes and then we came down
[44:07.200 --> 44:12.440]  here we moved to our hotel which is just a few miles from the Super Bowl and now
[44:12.440 --> 44:16.000]  we're out here in Times Square about 30 minutes from our hotel all right now
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.640]  expanding on that what happened with the security when you flew in what they do
[44:19.640 --> 44:23.680]  well when we came in you know of course we we opted out when we're at the
[44:23.680 --> 44:29.040]  airport we got padded down another lady who was awake and quite frankly aware of
[44:29.040 --> 44:32.160]  what was going on the police say in our country she opted out as well I was very
[44:32.160 --> 44:34.840]  encouraged that she did that I didn't have time to interview her because we had
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.320]  to get on the plane so now we're out here we went to the stadium the MetLife
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.360]  Stadium we were when we approached the security guard we asked where the tailgate
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.560]  was he said man there's no tailgate out here I know what's wrong even pretty much
[44:46.560 --> 44:49.880]  to the extent like what's wrong with you why would you ask where the tailgate is
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.280]  you can't have a tailgate you can't have people congregating because it's not
[44:53.280 --> 44:56.400]  safe I'm like well bros is Super Bowl everybody congregates they don't do that
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.400]  you can't do that America land of the free home of the brave is so afraid of
[45:00.400 --> 45:03.960]  al-qaeda that the government publicly funds and the Muslim brotherhood who gets
[45:03.960 --> 45:07.920]  to go through TSA without screening I mean we're so scared no one can congregate
[45:07.920 --> 45:10.960]  no they're getting ready for a controlled implosion and a controlled
[45:10.960 --> 45:14.640]  depression and they're banning free assembly and free speech and that's
[45:14.640 --> 45:20.640]  what's going on is the authoritarian clampdown over America that's exactly
[45:20.640 --> 45:23.640]  right Alex that's exactly right and so we're out here we're going to do some
[45:23.640 --> 45:26.720]  more reports we're going to talk to people see how awake these people are see
[45:26.720 --> 45:30.680]  how distracted they are by the Super Bowl you know well you willfully submit
[45:30.680 --> 45:33.920]  to being patted down I mean you're paying thousands of dollars you're playing
[45:33.920 --> 45:38.320]  for pains by paying for a plane tickets hotel tickets the tickets to the Super
[45:38.320 --> 45:42.240]  Bowl themselves even the nosebleeds seats are around $1,700 so you're gonna
[45:42.240 --> 45:45.200]  pay all this money to sit in the cold and be molested and have your fourth
[45:45.200 --> 45:48.560]  amendment violated you know I heard they almost moved it to another week because
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.840]  of the Arctic blast because yeah that's the reason Alex I'm blaming you on this
[45:52.840 --> 45:56.400]  because I know you don't pay your carbon credits they have so much snow at
[45:56.400 --> 45:59.880]  the Super Bowl their guides right now digging out the Super Bowl there's so
[45:59.880 --> 46:06.440]  much snow in there so they're digging out the stadium well you know he teaches
[46:06.440 --> 46:09.840]  kids penguins can't swim and either can polar bears and that the ice that the
[46:09.840 --> 46:13.160]  northern ice cap completely melted of course it's record thick right now
[46:13.160 --> 46:17.880]  jacari but that doesn't matter because Al Gore controls reality and Obamacare is
[46:17.880 --> 46:21.480]  kicking poor kids off their coverage now but it doesn't matter the Democrats
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.320]  aren't gonna apologize because they have the moral high ground at jacari that's
[46:25.320 --> 46:28.280]  exactly right and also Obama said that if you live in Africa you should not have
[46:28.280 --> 46:33.440]  air conditioning or a car or or ever have any appliances exactly right Alex
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.840]  because I mean he's got to have you know millions of dollars a day on vacation
[46:36.840 --> 46:41.480]  and jumbo jets and red carpets but but but people in Africa got Americans
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.520]  have to learn how to be poor jacari we got to pay I'll ask you there well no
[46:46.520 --> 46:50.040]  I mean I just think it's really bad that you don't want to pay Al Gore carbon
[46:50.040 --> 46:53.320]  taxes to save the polar bears that are it are five times their number they were
[46:53.320 --> 46:56.680]  in the 50s well you know Alex we encountered some wicked thought
[46:56.680 --> 47:01.120]  criminals who actually use the cognitive cognitive functions here and they said
[47:01.120 --> 47:04.120]  you know sir you know now I'm asking these questions about the carbon
[47:04.120 --> 47:07.000]  credits and the carbon tax and they say sir well if we have record low
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.640]  temperatures and ice breakers are being stopped in ice and police chiefs are
[47:10.640 --> 47:13.160]  telling people not to drive in Austin Texas because it's so much ice on the
[47:13.160 --> 47:16.520]  ground I don't think that's cause for global warming I don't think that's free
[47:16.520 --> 47:20.480]  for global warming so we quickly distance ourselves a lot criminals now
[47:20.480 --> 47:23.480]  we're out here and talk to more people about more important issues like the
[47:23.480 --> 47:28.680]  Super Bowl well that's right jacari now getting serious here for a moment tell
[47:28.680 --> 47:32.600]  me what you're planning to do because I think you should go out and you know
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.040]  bring up the fact to people that hey did you know that the Taliban al Qaeda
[47:37.040 --> 47:40.560]  Muslim Brotherhood is allowed to go through TSA screening did you know our
[47:40.560 --> 47:43.880]  government's funding al Qaeda in Syria well then why do we have to take our
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.640]  rights away I think you should go and get a lot of their zombie comments and
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.920]  have you know one video about the NFL zombies on the loose I think you should
[47:51.920 --> 47:58.400]  go out and you know also discuss I mean what are some of the ideas that you've
[47:58.400 --> 48:01.580]  got to cover obviously you're gonna look at the fake security they've got
[48:01.580 --> 48:05.920]  snipers they're saying they plan for attacks on mass transit seen as top
[48:05.920 --> 48:10.480]  Super Bowl security risk I would go talk to people getting on the subway you know
[48:10.480 --> 48:14.120]  ask them are they afraid because they've been told it's a big risk or do they
[48:14.120 --> 48:18.120]  understand this is all about a climate of fear so the power structure can take
[48:18.120 --> 48:23.040]  over yeah we'll try to get those done but we'll talk about be serious here for
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.680]  a moment we talked to people about a very serious issue that's being a human
[48:26.680 --> 48:29.960]  trafficking and the prostitution that surrounds the Super Bowl we were watching
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.760]  TV last night the local news and it wasn't too far from here they busted a
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.200]  prostitution ring so we'll go out to that location film there and ask people
[48:38.200 --> 48:41.800]  are you or at least do a good report that must have been one that must have been
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.520]  one that wasn't paying it's cut you know my big issue is is just the underage
[48:45.520 --> 48:49.680]  prostitution it's really bad but Acron didn't get in trouble for trying to run
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.200]  deals doing that member that's exactly right I James O'Keefe of Project
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.080]  Veritas when I talked to Project Acorn they said yeah I'm bringing child
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.960]  prostitutes I believe he said he's even bringing them from out the country and
[48:59.960 --> 49:02.760]  the ladies responded that's fine just make sure they go to school it's not
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.280]  kind of mentality ox it's so so well you know it sucks for them that's just the
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.280]  way it is that's the moral background that's them and that's why they're
[49:09.280 --> 49:11.680]  allowed to do that because they're liberal now now expanding on this
[49:11.680 --> 49:16.040]  Chicago's I'm wargaming here the questions I would go out there and ask
[49:16.040 --> 49:19.120]  people who do you think's gonna you know I know who's gonna win the Super Bowl
[49:19.120 --> 49:22.560]  and they'll come over and debate and I'll say no I'll tell you it's the tech
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.920]  this is what I want you to do man on the street it's the tax-exempt multi-billion
[49:25.920 --> 49:28.960]  dollar stadiums some of them a billion and a half dollars like Jerry Jones's
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.960]  paid for by a guy worth billions and billions of dollars and their tax
[49:32.960 --> 49:36.280]  exempt but they'll take old ladies houses that they don't pay their property
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.160]  taxes or if you don't pay your Obamacare tax I want you to get in these
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.400]  people's faces and say shame on you after they say they don't care and they
[49:45.400 --> 49:50.280]  only care about the NFL I want you to bring that up and say hey I know who's
[49:50.280 --> 49:53.360]  gonna win the Super Bowl do you want to know it's fixed and they'll go it's not
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.840]  fixed you know I like the Seahags or you know I like the you know evil donkey
[49:58.840 --> 50:03.040]  or whatever it is you know the two different teams and then you go no I'll
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.280]  tell you who's gonna win it's the fact that their tax exempt do you think they
[50:06.280 --> 50:09.280]  should be tax exempt should you pay for their stadiums and they'll say well no
[50:09.280 --> 50:13.320]  I don't we'll go then well then chump you know realize that's why they're
[50:13.320 --> 50:16.920]  passing Obamacare and open borders and everything is because we're known as
[50:16.920 --> 50:21.600]  chumps in this country jacari that's what I want you to go ask them is about
[50:21.600 --> 50:25.320]  the tax exemption what do you say yeah we could do that we're out here got

[54:32.320 --> 54:37.440]  have Joel Scowze and joining us in the next hour and I think we'll open the
[54:37.440 --> 54:42.160]  phones up for Joel as well on your questions on the world economy on what's
[54:42.160 --> 54:48.960]  happening geopolitically there is a lot of news on the economy front that we're
[54:48.960 --> 54:52.920]  gonna be breaking down in the next hour as well huge issues with QE unlimited
[54:52.920 --> 54:59.080]  being tapered huge issues on what's happening with stock markets and
[54:59.080 --> 55:05.240]  energy it's looks like what all the experts were saying middle of 2014 the
[55:05.240 --> 55:08.640]  economy is going to get really bad it's already been a depression at many levels
[55:08.640 --> 55:13.080]  it's such a controlled economy certain globalist combines are operating and
[55:13.080 --> 55:17.160]  people that are around those groups do not are not into the depression there's
[55:17.160 --> 55:25.600]  even booms in certain areas but in the general economies worldwide it is not
[55:25.600 --> 55:33.280]  denied that we're seeing a very serious depressionary situation unfold and it's
[55:33.280 --> 55:36.240]  because special interests are picking winners and losers and shutting down
[55:36.240 --> 55:42.120]  competition and in many cases now a globalist choose to not even supply a
[55:42.120 --> 55:47.840]  service or a commodity because they've already knocked out their competition
[55:47.840 --> 55:52.200]  through government regulation and combine up operations and so they choose
[55:52.200 --> 55:56.000]  politically as a tool of control as they've done in the third world to not
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.520]  allow development or to remove development and this is the essence of
[56:00.520 --> 56:06.440]  the modern 21st century warfare model that is clowered and piven via UNESCO
[56:06.440 --> 56:12.880]  implementation of agenda 21 and it is the understanding of this and of how the
[56:12.880 --> 56:17.120]  world really works that once you shift people out of not seeing how things work
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.360]  into the globalist paradigm where they're running things and they're
[56:20.360 --> 56:25.880]  bragging they're running things people go you mean I never knew this and trust
[56:25.880 --> 56:30.280]  in the system is plunging trust in the so-called left is gone the problem is
[56:30.280 --> 56:34.160]  the Republican leadership is circled the wagons with the Democrats to go after
[56:34.160 --> 56:39.720]  a libertarian takeover worldwide of any political party we can to try to put the
[56:39.720 --> 56:45.560]  brakes on bankrupting humanity we are being conquered via economic takeover
[56:45.560 --> 56:50.720]  we are being signed on to a thousand five hundred trillion plus one point five
[56:50.720 --> 56:54.920]  quadrillion quadrillion of globalist derivatives debts that's
[56:54.920 --> 57:00.760]  USA today and ninety plus percent on average about ninety one percent ninety
[57:00.760 --> 57:04.120]  three percent of him the country of those debts are not actually out by the
[57:04.120 --> 57:10.600]  country the corporations the people it is literal toxic Bernie made off it's
[57:10.600 --> 57:16.520]  not even Bernie made off hot air there's something in hot air there is
[57:16.520 --> 57:23.760]  nothing there but fraud and our ignorance fills the sales you know what
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.360]  there is something there our ignorance is what animates this people's absolute
[57:28.360 --> 57:33.840]  lack of understanding about basic economics is the only way notice there's
[57:33.840 --> 57:39.600]  these articles out today 84% of doctors in new major poll to Harold Tribune don't
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.200]  know how Obamacare works and say they think it's broken they don't under it
[57:43.200 --> 57:48.160]  it's just like the website's broken oh sorry it would work but the website
[57:48.160 --> 57:52.320]  doesn't work and then it never works and then a bunch of idiots think they sign
[57:52.320 --> 57:55.840]  up it turns out none of them signed up we're talking a few percentage points
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.320]  and then when they do it's it's a bad deal but they go well I got it so it's
[58:00.320 --> 58:06.760]  like I got it I got this brass ring it's how they build up things like you
[58:06.760 --> 58:09.640]  wait in line for 10 hours for a cup of soup and then it tastes like chalk but
[58:09.640 --> 58:16.200]  you eat it because you stood in line it's pure psychological warfare and people
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.920]  are absolutely getting screwed seven ways to Sunday by this right now and I'm
[58:20.920 --> 58:24.640]  just sick of it I mean they're kicking sick kids off their health care plans
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.880]  and not letting hospitals give them treatments now all over the country and
[58:28.880 --> 58:33.360]  there's no apologies from the so-called left because they're not the left they
[58:33.360 --> 58:40.080]  are craven disgusting social engineer criminals understand that don't stop

[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.480]  all right Joel Scousen Korean Corps fighter pilot aviator from the Vietnam
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.480]  era best-selling author researcher his uncle of course Cleon Scousen wrote the
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.200]  naked communist really one of the seminal works exposing how the ultra rich
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.520]  use communism and socialism as a political tool of slavery and of course
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.960]  he's the editor-in-chief of World Affairs brief you know four or five days
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.200]  ago I said I want to get him on and it was about Russia and it was about the
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.320]  economy and it was about China threatening the newt the US and the sell
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.320]  out of our technology and I can't remember why I wanted to get him on now I
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.400]  mean there was one particular reason it'll pop my head in a moment but the
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.920]  point is he can speak to all the stuff that's going on in the world and then
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.920]  I can go over the news with him about what's happening in the world how the
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:26.680]  entire neocon slash liberal combine once open borders what the plan is with that
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:33.000]  and where he thinks we are societally so again we have him via Skype and we'll
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.280]  also be going back and forth with phone when his Skype drops Joel Scousen thank

[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.680]  just awesome but sometimes he's got technical issues but hey it's the wonder
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.440]  of technology that we can even talk to somebody at a distance so that's always
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.280]  good I'm sure we want to get the message across to him to be on phone and Skype
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:08.040]  at the same time that that's the key but I'll talk to him during the break but
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.560]  we'll be discussing that with Joel Scousen by the way I should mention this
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.480]  to everybody the subscription side of infowars magazine has been very very
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:20.080]  successful but it's really a tool just to get bulk magazines out and that was so
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.440]  much more successful if you didn't subscribe last month you will never get
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.120]  a subscription to this we're not going to get rid of it in 12 months we're going
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.560]  to continue with the bulk and bulk making of it I love the magazine it's
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:35.120]  very successful but but you know having 12 shipping shipping at 12 times that was
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.240]  like more than half the cost paying for the shipping each time because you can't
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.680]  get media mail in a newspaper or a magazine and so you know even at $39.95
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:50.200]  12 issues delivered it's just so much more inexpensive to sell these in bulk
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.800]  I mean we can ship you ten of these at cost for a little bit more than it would
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.440]  be to have the subscription each month so that's what we're doing get it it's a
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.320]  big glossy color magazine the February issue is out and then you've got a big
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.640]  double-cover glossy magazine full of the most important articles of the month
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.680]  and original articles this one deals with the heart to soul the police and the
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.800]  battle by the globalist to turn them into third world enforcer thugs and our
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:23.600]  battle to try to wake them up how the police can be devils or angels and and
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.720]  how the globalists are trying to turn them to the dark side how we need to
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.880]  fight to take back control of our police from the feds themselves that have been
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.920]  captured by the globalist and there's a bunch of other key articles and letters
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:44.560]  to the editors and so much more in the magazine but this is again a very
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.640]  important issue dealing with the police throughout it that I'm really really
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.920]  really proud of and it's great to give police that you know it's it's almost
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:01.000]  kind of like an officer Jack McClam vampire killer 2000 2.0 showing good
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.960]  things police are doing and examples of good police versus examples of the
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.240]  militarization of police that the globalist have basically created so I'm
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.000]  very proud of the 64-page magazine it doesn't just get into the police the
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.920]  militarization of police worldwide it gets into DHS gave Muslim Brotherhood
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:25.640]  VIP treatment no TSA Pat nouns it's got oh my favorite the giant double America

[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:54.280]  convulsions of anger and there's just so much so much more of the radiation

[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:27.120]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I wanted to
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.280]  get Joel Scowzen on last week because I was rereading over the naked
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:37.640]  communist on Wikipedia that has the goals of communism and when a lot of the
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.000]  Soviet archives got declassified in the 90s indeed these were official
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.440]  communist goals that Cleon Scowzen his uncle was able to get so I wanted to
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.000]  get him on about this because when you see the Grammys with multiple satanic
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.280]  rituals going on and I know some of the people involved they're very serious
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.800]  Lady Gaga all of them actually believe they're being attacked by demons I mean
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.200]  these people whether you believe it's real or psychological it's still an
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.880]  archetype they're manifesting this mental illness and other authoritarian
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.960]  regimes are always occult-driven Hitler was into the occult the Babylonians
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.240]  the Egyptians the Romans they serve the same archetype even if you don't believe
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.240]  in God they are manifesting the same spirit so it's real one way or the
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.720]  other and of course I know it's spiritual now we've got his nephew on who's
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.840]  an author and of course former Marine Corps of fighter pilot in the Vietnam
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.680]  era heads up world affairs brief calm Joel Scowzen via Skype and phone in case
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.360]  either one cuts out you'll hear different audio quality back and forth
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.080]  today he joins us because I wanted to get him on in the first half of the hour
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:51.480]  about the communist goals and how mega rich fund communism and socialism as a
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.440]  tool of control because people get confused by that why does George Soros
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.240]  fund socialism and communism why did the New York banks fund the Bolshevik
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.240]  Revolution on record that was in congressional testimonies and came out
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:08.240]  in documents in multiple committees what are the big foundations up to capture
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.560]  both of the political parties the United States use technical decisions of the
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.920]  courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.640]  activities violate civil laws use fake civil rights to Trump basic human
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.680]  rights and God-given rights get control of the schools use them as a
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.640]  transmission belts for socialism and current communist propaganda soften the
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.080]  curriculum use student riots to foment public protest infiltrate the press get
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.680]  control of book reviews continue discrediting American culture and now
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:43.280]  it's been declassified the CIA would put out decadent art to then basically then
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.040]  discredit beautiful art and again now you turn on any children's show any movie
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.880]  it's meant to sell you on ugliness to where now anything good and pure it's
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.360]  not enough to accept gays now no no being straight as bad we're told in the
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:06.720]  news you see it everywhere and again this is done as the subversion program
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.560]  first they want to subvert then they want to basically undermine the society
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:19.480]  they want to collapse the society and then reorganize it so we are literally
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.720]  seeing saboteur operations going on and then you understand these are not
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.840]  liberals folks they knew obama care would hurt poor people they knew it would
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.240]  bankrupt the country they want full control they hate the masses communist
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.480]  at the top are never really communist they are banker technicians conning the
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:45.000]  unwashed masses so I wanted him to break down the the program that you know came
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.480]  out that they've now discredited the American founding fathers that's number
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.880]  30 present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the common man
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.120]  when it was the opposite they hadn't fully realized these dreams but they were
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.160]  the first to really put it in paper and move it forward and so he joins us now
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.440]  to talk about that then at the bottom of the hour I want to get into the
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.600]  geopolitical outlook the economy the Russians the Chinese what's happening in
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.400]  the Middle East the major builds up for you know continued authoritarianism but
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.440]  the huge awakening we see unfolding with Joel Scalzen and when I told him I
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.440]  wanted you on a few days ago I hope they relayed that it was about this but I
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.120]  know you're an expert on it so you can speak to it but now who can deny they're
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:34.720]  trying to undermine culture and any good institutions so they can collapse them
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.320]  and bring in a total takeover Joel Scalzen well thanks Alex it's good to be
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.560]  with it's good to be with you one of the things that I want to point out at the
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.560]  inception here as I've gone through the 45 goals that claim extracted from
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.160]  communist writings important to realize that you won't find this listed
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.840]  anywhere in communist literature in other words this was in bits and pieces
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.680]  for various different communist writers at the time and actually only about half
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.520]  of them have come true and what's most interesting and you've mentioned some of
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.600]  those especially and I might mention you know getting you you in recognition for
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.440]  red China replacing Taiwan was a communist goal doing away with all
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.320]  loyalty owes resisting any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party all those
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.920]  have been done Russia access continued access to the US Patent Office they did
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.920]  not however able to capture both political parties that is for the
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:42.000]  Communist Party they were not able to get control of the schools per se but the
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.160]  schools have been under the control of what we would call globalists and this
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.720]  is the most interesting thing about what's happened is that when I look at
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.680]  the list of what they were able to accomplish out of these 45 goals the
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.760]  half that approximately that were able to be achieved were not achieved by
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:04.000]  communist but they were achieved by non-communist globalists and socialists
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.040]  and leftists and liberals in the United States who all share the same you know
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.120]  philosophy that's the key is that the Carnegie Endowment the Ford Endowment as
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.560]  you know had helped fund the Bolshevik Revolution and all the rest of it so it
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.400]  wasn't that they were imitating the communist it was that they had been the
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.440]  progenitors of that movement going back in even to the 1850s as a way to
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.040]  control rebellions by serfs against one form of slavery they were now going to
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.720]  bring in another and so the Russians and the KGB and others were actually
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.800]  working for some of the same goals as the Western establishment as Carol
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.640]  Quigley wrote and for example on the infiltration of the press I mean you
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.960]  know in the 40s and there were quite a few communists in the press but even
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.840]  some of the major communists that the Whitaker Chamber exposed like Alger
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.640]  Hiss turned out to be a globalist who only joined the Communist Party to
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.920]  facilitate bringing them into the State Department and to make the communists
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.880]  feel like they had one of their people at the top levels of the Roosevelt
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.960]  administration and Truman administration but in fact he was a
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.160]  globalist facilitating these things and that's what people have to understand
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.360]  is that this has brought support among anyone who is basically on the
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.760]  receiving end of satanic inspiration and it you know it includes conspiracies
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.800]  that includes unthinking liberals that includes you know the gay community
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.400]  that's what you're getting at is there's an energizing spirit throughout
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.640]  history that leaves the same web that's right and you know I know a lot of
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.640]  people don't believe in God a lot of people don't believe in Satan but
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:51.480]  they're both very very real and they both speak to people's minds it comes an
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.920]  own voice comes in your own grammar sounds like you talking to yourself but
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.480]  people know people recognize when when you know temptation comes in and when
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.480]  good inspiration and good reminders come and this is the battle of
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.560]  civilization is the test that's going on in each people's mind of what voice are
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.240]  we listening to and they don't have to be full communists to be listening to a
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.960]  voice that will denigrate culture denigrate society and rail against the
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:23.480]  even I ran it was a libertarian railed against God she hated God she hated that
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.800]  voice of conscience which spoke out against her immorality in her in her
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.320]  lust and other things and other people who get involved in sin have the same
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.640]  problem and that's why there is a relationship between bad judgment and
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.400]  sin and the kind of hateful philosophies that are end up being created in the
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:48.760]  minds of men by listening to the wrong sources and so it's very interesting that
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:55.160]  this is a this could be a list equally as as useful to globalists as liberals as
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.760]  communists even though they aren't members of the Communist Party but in the
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.040]  nineties it did come out almost all of these goals one way or another were
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.320]  actually being carried out to subvert but then we learn the CIA as was
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.520]  declassified last year was involved trying to put out trash art and trash
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.000]  culture well that's obvious when look what they did at the Grammys and now
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.440]  every other public event they're having open satanic ceremonies and gay
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.260]  marriages I mean there is an agenda there I mean since when is that what
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:31.560]  America is known for is satanic ceremonies and gay marriages well you
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.200]  know one of the things that you brought to the public attention was the Bohemian
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.880]  Grove and the satanic rituals that there and you have top politicians the
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.360]  leaders in the United States being invited and participating in that so
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:49.800]  it's hard to separate the satanic element that's driving this force and the
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.600]  various superficial organizations that are created and there are many of them
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.600]  whether it's the Bilderberg group whether it's the Communist Party whether it's
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.320]  avian socialism Council on Foreign Relations. Exactly and when I was in Bohemian Grove
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.320]  you know you could say it was a joke a bunch of guys reenacting an ancient
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.880]  Babylonian ritual mixed in with some druidic rituals but the the old men in
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.240]  the crowd I talked to said oh this is interesting and they literally growled at
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:23.400]  me they were in focused hateful religious rapture and some of them had tears
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:29.240]  coming out of their eyes Joel what does that sound like to you well I can
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.320]  believe that but I mean these people we have to remember what drives so many
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.400]  people to get involved in this control system is the promise of immunity you
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.920]  know this is a powerful system that controls courts it controls congressman
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.440]  it controls the president man you're smart the whole ritual was about immunity
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.600]  they thought they were getting immunity in that ritual that's what they were
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.240]  doing exactly in fact I believe that there's you know not only immunity on
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.760]  this earth and we see that happen all the time I mean Bill Clinton and the
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.000]  president acted as if hey nobody can touch me and he was right nobody could
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.880]  touch him because he was on the right on this you know the control side but I
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.680]  think in terms of the satanic ritual I think there's also part of the Fausti
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:18.720]  impact is the promise of immunity from God's judgment and you know that's what
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:23.680]  I think Isaiah 14 is all about when all the rich men and high men of the world
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.840]  are sitting in chains and hell waiting for him that was going to thrash the
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.800]  world to come down and save them and then they see him defend and change and
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.520]  they say art thou become one of us meeting Satan descends and they realize
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.280]  all the immunity pact is broken he isn't going to be able to save us I think
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.760]  that's what I say it was talking about unbelievably powerful let's come back
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.560]  and discuss that I bring up communism he brings up the devil because Lenin said
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.040]  he worshiped the devil I mean that's what is at the bottom of the rabbit hole
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.640]  folks whether you believe in the devil or not these people believe in him they
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:02.240]  worship him and they're given power by him do you know about the NSA loophole
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.040]  or maybe you think your law-abiding ways are too boring for them to care about
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.600]  you tell that to the Virginia farmer who was audited by the IRS because of her
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:15.480]  tea party activities or the Texas man who woke up to a SWAT team raid because of
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.600]  online comments he had made about his gun collection no God-fearing Americans

[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.120]  team of patriots over at mypatriotsupply several years ago Matt was sitting in
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.480]  his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.320]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.520]  action a company run by patriots for patriots was born mypatriotsupply has

[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:35.800]  all right Joe Scals and this is short segment long segment coming up to get
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:40.880]  into geopolitics everyone that I know has a serious feeling in their gut of
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.720]  concern it's increasing I've never had so much concern and I think of the
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:50.560]  globalist what fools they are and I instinctively but all at a spiritual
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:57.880]  level know that the big sin is leading people astray trying to get people into
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.280]  evil trying to take advantage of childlike minds as Christ said suffer
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.600]  the little children we're not just talking about children there we're
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.920]  talking about young people folks that are looking up to you and you talk about
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.160]  God-fearing I just feel it in my spirit if something's bad I don't even want to
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:20.480]  do it thinking about it even to study it makes me have fear of separation from
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:23.360]  God not that I'm some great goody-to-sure or anything but I don't do
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.000]  conscious evil and I have a drive to stand up against evil and that's why I
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.160]  don't have fear of it I have fear of letting it take over but I think about
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.360]  what fools the worldly are they either hate God because they feel the judgment
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.440]  even if they say God isn't real or they do literally at Bohemian Grove it
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:47.320]  conduct all these rituals and say to absolve them from the care and what
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.160]  they've done in the last year and they take it very seriously as if some
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.280]  satanic ritual is going to get them out of what they've done I mean even in the
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.680]  real world when when they allow radiation out of Fukushima it hits their
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.240]  kids and them as well I mean they may get a few get out of jail free cards but
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.360]  this is the height of delusion but you're right it's the heart of the world
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.480]  is about escaping judgment but that just seems so
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.880]  mindless I mean a five-year-old should know you can't escape judgment forever
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.240]  we have to remember that these people have a great motivation to escape
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.380]  judgment they've got a mountain of sins and they've got a mountain of evil
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:31.160]  intent as well and what keeps them going is the fact that someone is
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.120]  promising immunity and they really do act as if I mean let me add it let me
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.160]  point out from another point of view I often get this question how is it the
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.880]  globalist the most wealthy man in the world with all the ownership of
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.480]  factories and then major inroads into big corporations why would they bring
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.360]  upon the nation and induce a Russian and Chinese nuclear attack knowing that
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.840]  it's going to destroy their infrastructure and the answer is that no man no
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:07.080]  evil person would simply conjure up that kind of scenario that kind of a plan
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:12.760]  on his own the only way a human being looking out for his best interest would
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.880]  do that if someone more powerful than him had said you do what I say and I
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.000]  grant you immunity you you will come out unscathed now he won't be able to
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.800]  fulfill those promises but that's the only thing it gets smart evil people to
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.480]  go along with an agenda that does threaten their existence that they've
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.160]  been promised immunity they've been promised that they'll escape now that's
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:40.360]  one of the reasons why people in our government even retired CIA DEA FBI they
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:46.440]  built major bunker safe room systems in homes in Colorado Utah and other safe
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.760]  places I mean these people are not dumb they know what's coming and they are
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:54.000]  preparing to defend themselves and the government of course and it's
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.520]  continuity government program has the huge new underground bunkers major
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.880]  system in the West Utah desert to replace Cheyenne Mountain which they know is a
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.080]  known target they're doing a lot of secret bunker systems because they know
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.360]  the Soviets and the Chinese know where the original ones were and they want
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:17.120]  protection but as I say ultimately Christ is going to have the last say
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.640]  his second coming I believe comes because Satan has near total control over
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.440]  the entire world except for a remnant of good people which won't be allowed to
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.320]  be destroyed I mean we've got a real battle royal on our hands Alex and you
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.320]  know you're doing a great job in terms of alerting people to what what's coming
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.160]  but the big thing is people need to know it's not necessarily economic
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.440]  collapse is the major problem it is this war with Russia in China and they are
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.240]  both building for it and we are disarming proposing in the next few months
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.880]  another disarmament treaty with Russia even though they have been violating
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.160]  every single one and can you imagine the irony of that is that we have three
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.800]  nuclear powers major nuclear powers and we're negotiating with one disarming is
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.920]  if the third China doesn't make any difference I mean talk about a fool's
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:13.200]  paradise you know that's not same disarmament when you aren't even
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.440]  suggesting a disarmament treaty with the third which is going to slowly outstrip
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:23.640]  even Russia in terms of ability to put nuclear throwing stay there I want to
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.640]  cover the waterfront with what's happened on the planet right now the
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:31.320]  economy Obama the attempt by the neocons to completely destroy the
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.800]  Republican Party so there's no opposition the open borders and a lot of
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:40.440]  other breaking news with Joel Scowzen I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com and

[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:04.760]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:09.800]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:15.040]  is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.320]  global takeover that's why we've assembled the most vital and important

[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:41.640]  Scouse and of World Affairs brief to get his take on them first off how are
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.920]  things going for Obama in your view that they're trying to put autocratic
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.640]  elected presidents but also appointed Goldman Sachs dictators over places like
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:58.080]  Italy and in Greece Obama is openly taking on dictatorial powers more and
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.160]  more of the Republican leadership tonight and really criticizing it or they
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:06.000]  are mildly obviously you know that's part of a longer precedent to concentrate
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.160]  power but Obamacare was designed as we know to implode health care but it's
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.720]  extremely unpopular but they don't seem to care they just go forward with every
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.320]  program even if it's unpopular like they're trying to catch up what's going
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.800]  on domestically with the economy how are things going for the globalist Joel
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.080]  Scouse and then I'm going to ask you what do you think's most important that's
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.720]  going on right now well first of all the state of the Union is touched by
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.720]  addressed by Obama was very telling the biggest thing that he announced really
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:45.000]  was a minimum wage increase to ten ten ten dollars and ten cents and everything
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.200]  else was downplayed now this is very telling Alex because it means instead
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:56.720]  of broadcasting what is agenda is going to be in the next year he was
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.360]  downplaying it all he mentioned amnesty and that we need to pass it he
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.480]  mentioned disarmament he mentioned some of these other things but were he to
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.640]  come out and make a major presentation we're going to have this presenting this
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.400]  amnesty bill and I'm presenting this major stuff there was there is a
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:19.320]  crescendo of a wave of opposition to Obama and I feel that the downplaying of
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.600]  these issues in the state of the Union was specifically meant not to raise up
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:30.240]  the the opposition not to get everything stirred up they want to slip these in
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.080]  either through executive orders or through you know their compromised
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.800]  Republicans like John Boehner getting him to go and he's preparing to go along
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.800]  with amnesty so that's how I view the Obama administration they're very much
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.360]  aware he's under fire he's very unpopular and and that's why as I've
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:53.520]  mentioned in today's world affairs brief he threw a bone to Marco Rubio
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.840]  senator Rubio it's very rare that Democratic president would say something
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.600]  positive about a republic and it's going to run against Hillary Clinton in the
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:08.960]  next election but he did and that can only mean number one that they're the
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.280]  typical corrupt politician Chris Christie that they wanted to throw it
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.680]  conservatives he was just like Rudolph Giuliani in 2008 wasn't going to fly
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.320]  with conservatives neither is Chris Christie and so he threw a bone through
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:26.440]  a major cadu to senator Rubio and that means he's the backup man the
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.040]  establishment's going to promote probably for president there's several
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:34.600]  others in the offing but that was the telling incident and it shows
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.060]  the establishment is probably going to allow the republicans to have a
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:43.920]  controlled president they get certain things done under a radical Democrat
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.760]  like Obama and they get certain things done under a person a controlled
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.120]  republican like George W. Bush and they'll have I guarantee you a very
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:59.920]  controlled republican in 2016 force now in terms of the economy the economy is
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.520]  still struggling a lot of figures are down only a few figures are up and a lot
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:12.320]  of those are manipulated but there is a comeback coming in the housing market
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.640]  mostly because demand is so high rentals are hot they're running out of rentals
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.080]  all of the millions of people that are coming online getting married joining
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.360]  the workforce have no place to live they're pushing a rental market there
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.080]  is going to be a continued rise in the housing market it won't be a major
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.080]  bubble in my opinion but it looks like they're trying their best to inflate
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.240]  in a moderate way in order to keep this thing going one of the things I want to
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:46.640]  say though about the economy is that you know this recession that we're still in
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.000]  they're calling it a recovery but we're still in a recession this really is
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.400]  what's real Alex this is where people ought to get used to the level of
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.880]  business Walmart's got to get used to lower sales because that reflects what
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.600]  people are still selling enough to make a profit nobody's going bankrupt in this
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:08.880]  thing but they are having to get used to lower sales and so rather than call it a
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:15.960]  depression or a recovery what it really is is a stagnant economy that is
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.240]  sorting out over time the longer you you allow it to go over time without
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:27.160]  collapsing the more it tends to sort each day it's out and I am of the strong
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.160]  belief that in contrast what Lindsay William keeps saying that his insiders
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.960]  I think is bogus that they are not trying to collapse economy if they wanted
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.200]  to collapse the economy all they have to do is pull the money supply and it would
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:46.440]  happen overnight all the pawns that schemes their paper gold contracts the
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.800]  naked shorts the the derivatives hit all that would collapse within weeks but
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.560]  they aren't pulling the plug on they're doing is they're pumping up their
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.600]  controlled economy while regulating out of existence all of their economy
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:06.360]  systems they don't control they're consolidating things right now well it
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.760]  is true that most of the new money that is created first of all goes through the
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.040]  speculative economy it goes through the major banks that control the Federal
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.680]  Reserve the JPMorgan Chases and the Goldman stocks gets into stock market
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.200]  that's why the stock market is due for major correction correction I think it
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:30.240]  could come down in this year as much as 20% but that won't collapse the economy
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.520]  you know economies really don't collapse unless war comes along they do go down
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.400]  there are depressions that all of those things are caused by pulling the money
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.640]  supply just like the depression in 1929 through 30 and they're not showing any
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.960]  signs right now pulling the money supply they're showing all the signs that
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.640]  continue to bail things out now I'm not predicting that things are good they
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.840]  aren't good but I I see every sign that the powers that be don't want to pull
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.800]  the plug don't want to they want a long cold depression against everybody but
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.960]  the sectors and combines they control let's expand out from that point what
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.360]  do you make of the reports by the head of Saudi intelligence four months ago
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:15.800]  that he would launch Al-Qaeda attacks inside Russia we now see those
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:19.760]  unfolding do those look like those are real terror attacks meant meaning to
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:24.080]  destabilize the Olympics for Russia helping Syria I see a motive there or
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:32.720]  does Putin have any type of motive for a false flag well it's it's complex and
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:37.240]  hard to answer Alex because there's a lot that we can't prove there have been
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:42.520]  reports of the Saudis threatening Putin I personally don't believe it I don't
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.800]  believe Saudi Arabia would ever get in the position of threatening Russia who
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:54.200]  could squash them like a bug if they wanted to there is legitimate if I
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.600]  pointed out in a couple of world first briefs back the US hand Russia have both
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.600]  used false flag terrorism to gin up the war against terror so that they can use
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.960]  that to clamp down on opposition but in doing so both the US and Russia have
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.920]  created real terror in response to their occupation in response to their using
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.680]  false flag terror to justify clamping down on peoples they have produced real
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:26.960]  care and so in my estimation there is real terror that happened in Bolodov
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:33.080]  Grodd and which is about a hundred kilometers from Sochi I'll tell you the
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.920]  reports I've got from Sochi is that the KGB and the Secret Service of Russia is
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.360]  out in force they've got anti-missile batteries on the camouflage nets they
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.680]  have got hundreds and hundreds of special forces roaming the streets and
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.840]  playing clothes now it could still happen but boy I'll tell you Putin knows
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.600]  that the real terrorists want to embarrass him and he's determined not to
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.680]  be embarrassed but I'm frankly not buying the the rumor or the propaganda that
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:10.480]  the Saudis are are trying to take out or take on Russia directly regardless we
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.840]  know that the globalist have been funding radical Islam in that area and so why
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:19.320]  are the radical Islamists activating ahead of the Olympics do you think the
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:26.800]  West is behind that well not really you kind of remember the West is is really
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:33.240]  supporting Russia and has been for them for many years they do antagonize Russia
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:38.120]  to give Russia the excuse to go before their people and say you know the US is
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.400]  meddling in our elections and other things and the US could do that pervertly in a
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.840]  very smart way they do it kind of an obtuse way so that they can get caught
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.080]  so that Putin can have the excuse to go before the people don't anti-American
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:55.400]  sentiment and that's what he's doing sure and vice versa what about Ukraine I
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.320]  mean is that because they wouldn't join the EU and this is a big issue Alex the
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:06.200]  Ukraine is gonna be an ongoing thing now Gorbachev came out and asked Putin to
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.800]  intervene militarily in the Ukraine it suggested you so Putin visited the
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:15.320]  Ukraine said no military intervention but he did want to set down the
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.400]  guidelines here's what I think happening just like Hitler used attacks on
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.800]  Germans in the Sudetenland and Poland to justify an eventual invasion Russia has
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:34.280]  put millions of Russians emigres into Ukraine into Georgia into Belarus
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.040]  into the Baltic states and they're still there today as a minority it would be
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:44.560]  very easy to get those people to you know have an attack mentality or get a
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:48.560]  false flag attack on them to justify Russian troop intervention it's too
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.400]  early for that however and I don't think that Russia wants to move too soon
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:58.560]  they're not ready to take on the United States in a major Third World War that's
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.880]  why I don't think they're going to end up supporting Syria or Iran if they go
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:08.080]  down just like they let the rack go down in other words all of the major new
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.880]  weapons systems that both Russia and China are putting online are not
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:19.440]  supposed to come online or be in operational until at least 2020 so this
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:26.880]  is clearly too early to be creating a false flag excuse to go in
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:32.400]  militarily into the Ukraine that's it it's my analysis that this is going to be
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.760]  a festering thing that's going to go on for several years and will build into a
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.200]  crescendo that will spread into the Georgia and Belarus and other countries
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.760]  that will eventually justify a Russian intervention in the same sense over in
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.880]  the Far East China is really getting some hot rhetoric at the Davos International
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:58.720]  Economic Conference even they really went head-to-head with Japanese Prime
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.680]  Minister Abe and you know threats and counter threats and the trouble is the
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.560]  Eastern mentality is one of saving face and they get up there and pound the
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:12.120]  pulp but it makes threats to one another is very difficult for Oriental's to
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:18.040]  back down and save face especially the Chinese nevertheless they too aren't
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.240]  ready to take on the world we are going to see them continue to test the waters
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.800]  but you agree that at any time with China saying they might invade and take
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.320]  Philippine islands they might take Japanese to speeded islands I mean if
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:34.720]  that happens if Japan of the US doesn't stand down it will be a confrontation or
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.800]  is China really that willing to saber-rattle because you know as you said
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.520]  the whole Asian cultural historical military mindset they don't usually
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.320]  threaten something unless they're planning to carry it out right that's
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.480]  right and as I say they don't want to lose face and I think they're going to
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.440]  test the waters by taking control militarily of some of these islands and
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.640]  I think the US gonna let them get away with it and I think that's going to be
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:05.800]  a big time to China yep we're on a roll just like we did with the Japanese in
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:10.400]  the 30s exactly we let them get away we let them invade China we didn't stop
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:16.520]  them and it only gave them more you know enthusiasm for the fight and so I think
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.000]  that's what you're gonna see I think you're gonna see them take the Philippine
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.120]  islands first or they might take the ones done by Vietnam which are disputed
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.280]  as well they're probably leaving the Senkakos to last because Japan does have
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.880]  a fairly formidable defense force that could put up a fight but I think you're
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.840]  gonna see a little domino effect going on here and you're gonna see the US show
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:46.440]  it's a conciliatory paper tiger nature and we know what they're up to the
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:55.320]  globalist like Admiral Locklear charge of the Sink Compact is it's clearly out
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.600]  to pacify the Chinese they know it the Obama administration put him in that
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.480]  position to pacify and it's gonna create war someday these people are playing
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:11.360]  soft in order to you know invite this attack I mean China and Russia know that
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.680]  the West is a formidable enemy and that's why they're aching for more
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.480]  disarmament and them and they want more time so we're gonna see these things you
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:24.480]  know play out over time but I still think it's too early their weapons
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:28.680]  systems are not online they are rushing things though you know Alex they talk
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:33.480]  about the four new aircraft carrier groups that they're trying to put it in
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.760]  or they're actually in construction the keels are being laid they're not
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.360]  supposed to according to report six months ago be ready and operational to
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:48.240]  2022 to 24 and the latest report coming out the Chinese said they want
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.200]  them operational by 2020 that indicates that they're accelerating their
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:57.640]  timeline or attempting to and as I pointed out my world affairs briefed
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.400]  last week the closer they get to operational readiness for war with the
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:08.480]  West the easier it is for them to go early by taking advantage of an
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.520]  opportunity that may present itself sure sure that could happen anytime then
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.720]  and expanding on this you know that the Chinese are more than the Russians when
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.400]  I've seen are sending up satellite killers a lot of the satellites that are
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.960]  going down it looks like there's some covert stuff going on undoubtedly the
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.360]  West is probably sabotaging satellites and other space-based platforms there's
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.320]  a whole bunch of stuff up there that's at least 30 years in advance of what we
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.440]  know Bob Bowman and others confirmed that so that's another issue if this war
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:42.000]  kicks off what will it look like if it starts in a regional deal dominoes gets
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.120]  out of control like World War one or other events we're going to see some
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:51.800]  space war aren't we we are but only after I think we absorb a nuclear first
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.880]  try here's how I think it's going to come down Alex it's going to the trigger
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:01.400]  event has to be North Korea North Korea is the most rogue element in the world
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:05.660]  and yet it's being given a pass by the US we don't do anything to stop its
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:11.300]  nuclear progress unlike Iran and Iran is being set up by the way for a failure of
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:16.280]  this current agreement so that the US can attack that was put out in a brookly
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:21.680]  new institution peace in 2009 where they said you know what the US needs to do
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.840]  is bend over backwards to give them a peace deal haven't violated so that it
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:30.440]  appears as if we didn't want this war but Iran really slapped us in the face
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:34.400]  over this I think that's what Iran speaks that I agree that will that will
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.920]  not turn into World War three because Russia and China it's too early they
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.720]  aren't ready to go through World War over Iran that would be done to
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:48.680]  consolidate Israel's hegemony over the Middle East and the hatred of both the
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.120]  US and Israel will increase dramatically which feeds the excuse that
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.320]  Russia and China need eventually to take down the bully the world but the
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.600]  trigger event I believe will be North Korea when you see a North Korean
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:06.320]  launched against the South and they have to do some main minor military attack
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.160]  every year so you've got to be careful not to confuse those with the major
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:16.000]  artillery barragements sold if that ever starts you know your days away from
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.080]  nuclear war people ought to get out of the cities that are made to nuclear
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:25.240]  targets like Seattle Washington DC when we come back tell us tell us how the
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:28.280]  war games is not just your analysis this is what a lot of the big think tanks
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.160]  had meant that's why the main force is to Asia how it will play out within two
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.360]  days how big the nuclear attack will be and of course the film strategic

[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:27.840]  that's really bombshell I mean we already knew it was happening but it gives
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:30.720]  you an idea of the secret police networks the airports other areas to be
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:35.080]  internal checkpoints to target constitutional peace officers and
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:39.280]  things like that I mean we know how this takeover is going to look and you
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:43.400]  know the government could do a false flag to go after liberty movement at
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:46.760]  any time or they could wait the point is is that we know this is being geared up
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:49.760]  but we shouldn't even be afraid of it we should be afraid of not speaking out
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:55.000]  against it and stopping and exposing it I get frustrated people ask why I get
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.920]  mad at football well they they just obsess over the family of one quarterback
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.280]  and the other quarterbacks family and what they eat for dinner and what they're
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:08.840]  into and it's all the military mind of man being projected on to something that
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.880]  doesn't matter like we're studying thermal nuclear war we're studying geo
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:16.600]  politics we're studying the stock market we're studying the mindset of the elite
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.800]  we're studying what's in the vaccines we're studying people think that's weird
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.600]  like studying real things even though in the real world you can make a lot of
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.400]  money just in business knowing this stuff this is how the elite think this
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:32.480]  except it's from their perspective and then we try to spend time learning how
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.520]  the real world works and it's weird that's why I get very upset about the
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:40.200]  things of a child it'd be one thing if you went to a ballgame because your kids
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.920]  in it or you like to sports team but when it becomes God it becomes a Romanesque
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:48.880]  gladiatorial evil and that's what makes me sick we got four minutes left Joel
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:53.560]  Scousen thank you so much for the time you've got the floor breakdown why you
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:58.760]  say Korea is the trigger most other big analysts agree with that by the way you
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.040]  know if it ever kicks off with China how that would unfold and why we we've
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:09.560]  pivoted to the Pacific and where where that's going well in the first place the
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:13.120]  pivot to the Pacific is really only about a 10% increase in assets it's not
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:17.680]  enough to deter China it's just a mere facade it's a little bit of political
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.320]  theater there has to be a reason why North Korea has been preserved that's
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:27.120]  why I say it's got to be the trigger in other words Iran they've fumed they've
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.080]  threatened they've the military options on the table they want regime change we
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:35.480]  infiltrate we use corporate operations we do none of that with North Korea in
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:39.960]  fact we've guaranteed them no regime change and no military options on the
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:45.680]  table why they're the most awful god awful regime in the world and yet we do
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.920]  nothing and that's only because it could only be because the globalists know
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:55.240]  that they are the puppet of China and that they will be the trigger here's how
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:00.040]  I think it's going down I think that will be an attack against South Korea the
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.640]  the North Koreans have over two million troops 20,000 artillery tubes they can
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:10.120]  level soul in a matter of three or four days the only way the US can stop that
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:15.280]  attack from taking over the South is using tactical nuclear weapons and that
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.360]  would give China the excuse then to nuke the United States US the guilty of
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.400]  first use US is the bully the world Russian Chinese unite to launch against
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:30.280]  US military targets not civilian targets per se it will be about 12 to 15
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.120]  cities that are inextricably connected with the military that we're going to get
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:37.400]  like I've mentioned in strategic relocation you don't want to be in
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:42.760]  those cities when this attack comes you may have two days notice when that attack
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:47.320]  in Korea starts before China launches on the United States and if you ever see
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:53.040]  everything blackout because both Russian channel use a preemptive nuclear or EMP
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:57.360]  strike electromagnetic pulse strike to take down the grid before the nukes
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:03.760]  actually fall anytime you see all electricity out and no news nothing at
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.400]  all that's the time you need to be getting out of those cities before the
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:12.840]  panic hits now I think our globalists come out of their bunkers then they'll
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.080]  survive the attack they'll say the Russians and Chinese see this we need to
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:22.240]  establish a global military because our military has been taken down no one to
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.960]  protect as we need a global military for that's when the big World War three
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:31.480]  starts that's right that's when it starts only then Alex does the US bring out
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.680]  the space-based weapons to stop Russian China from hitting any more targets
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:41.040]  I'll order to find more on this than David Knight's coming in
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:49.040]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:08.120]  covered that earlier Joel we got about five minutes left here I want you to
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:12.480]  finish up with the scenario we cover it in the film strategic relocation it's
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:17.080]  in your book they're both available the film exclusively an info war store.com
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:22.680]  and it's just invaluable film to watch invaluable book to have and when you've
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:26.800]  studied the country in the world it's incredible how much you've traveled this
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:30.160]  is something everybody should be thinking about in this insane world but
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:35.600]  but finishing up with a scenario of the super weapons then being rolled out
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:39.680]  that's right in other words there are secret black budget weapons that the
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:43.000]  US has been developing for years and they have not revealed to the American
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.760]  people and will not be used to defend us against this nuclear first right PDD
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.600]  60 was signed by President Clinton which instructed our nuclear forces to be
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:58.320]  prepared to retaliate only after absorbing a nuclear first strike
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:02.200]  general butch needle the Marine Corps that retaliate with what after you've
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.840]  absorbed it and that's exactly what the globalists want now our missile forces
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:10.240]  still intend and still think they're going to get the orders to launch on
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.960]  morning and launch in warning the very important tactic it means that the one
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:20.560]  who launches first actually his missiles because the ballistic end up attacking
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:26.280]  silos that are empty if we've launched before their missiles arrive on our soil
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.480]  we launch our missiles then the one who launches second is the one who gets the
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:35.040]  most damage done to the other side but if we absorb that nuclear first strike
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.840]  all of our missiles and the silos will be hit we won't have anything to
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.480]  retaliate with except half of our nuclear submarines which are being
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:50.360]  downgraded from 20 missiles now to 14 they are dismantling disarming even
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:54.640]  without even as the Russians are building new seven you can see the total set up
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:00.560]  taking place on every front and what do you make of 36 of the silo commanders
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.480]  fired almost all the top brass over the missiles I mean and I was told by a
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.840]  high-level source about missing nukes should die as that's a real story I mean
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:14.360]  what does all that mean well you know the nuclear this stuff has actually been
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:19.720]  going on for a long time and there's nuclear missile forces been a disarray
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:24.240]  and there's been a lot of disgruntled officers that stand watch for days at a
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:28.720]  time I mean it's not a decent assignment anymore so there has been cheating on
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.800]  their exams there has been some drug use and other things it's only being brought
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.520]  out now because the press is getting ready to make a major push against we
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:43.840]  don't need all these nuclear missiles and to degrade and to you know sell more
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:48.480]  disarmament as I say it's disingenuous when you don't include red China you
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:52.920]  only have deals with Russia and red China still out there I mean this it
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.640]  shows that at the sham that we're simply well obviously we're almost down to
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:59.920]  nothing now we don't need to give him any more any weapons but meanwhile the
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:03.360]  government wants to obsess on veterans and gun owners all day homeland security
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.760]  says we're the main threat while they fund Al Qaeda and then Russia and China
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:10.320]  are arming to the teeth and the West is doing every provocation to give them the
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.920]  moral high ground it's the same old British Intel model that we saw with
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:18.320]  Pearl Harbor and the rest of it get your enemy to attack you so you have the
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.360]  moral high ground let me finish with my scenario how I think this war is going
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:26.600]  to play out I think you know there's going to be a major destruction of these
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:30.800]  12 to 15 cities the Russians and Chinese will try to blackmail the US and
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:36.520]  Western Europe into submission our leaders will not succumb to the blackmail
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:41.800]  that come out and create a new holy war against Russia and China and bring out
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.560]  those space bases and other secret weapon systems to stop Russian China from
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.840]  any more damage while we regroup and if we based upon NATO which probably won't
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:57.440]  be hit in the initial strike and they'll go ahead and start to attack Russia
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.440]  primarily I'll have to have you back about this we're out of time great job

[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:10.640]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around

[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:19.360]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:24.800]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:30.480]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ

[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:18.560]  GCN radio network
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:25.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm finishing out the
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:29.280]  show today and I'm gonna have at the bottom of the hour the police chief who
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.320]  was fired because he went to a constitutional sheriff's and police and
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:37.520]  peace officers association meeting he was singled out by the TSA we interviewed
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:41.960]  him on prison planet TV last night on the nightly news and if you didn't see
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:44.440]  that interview we're going to have excerpts from that we're going to have
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.480]  an update from him live at the bottom of the hour as to what his current status
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:53.800]  is but what they did was they shut down an entire police force small town
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:59.080]  police force but they shut down the entire force because of a TSA agent who
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.960]  had a vendetta with him now this is something that is much wider than that
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:07.920]  but what we're seeing here is the arbitrary exercise of power this is
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:11.080]  something that we see happening with the president with his executive orders
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:15.600]  and it permeates the entire government it's systemic it goes all the way down
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:19.720]  to local law enforcement in many cases as we've seen with the police but
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:24.240]  certainly the TSA is a large part of it and it's not just that it's not just
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:29.320]  their petty vindictiveness this is part of a total surveillance grid with the
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:33.480]  NSA we've interviewed William Benny before not too long ago we interviewed him
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:38.400]  on this radio program and he was a former global technical director of the
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.600]  NSA so unlike a lot of these billionaire critics of critics who are
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.280]  opposing the NSA they say there's nothing to worry about why is everybody
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:50.440]  getting so upset people like Mark Andreessen who founded Netscape they're
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.920]  pushing back on this and say we just don't understand the technical issues
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:55.840]  well you know who does understand the technical issues the guy who worked for
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.400]  them for over three decades who was the technical director of the NSA globally
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:05.360]  he resigned became a whistleblower because he saw the criminal actions that
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:08.880]  were taking place and he knows fully well what their capabilities are and
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:12.600]  when I talked to him one of the things that he told me was that he had
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:18.560]  monitored for years the Soviet Union as well as East Germany he knows how this
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.520]  tyranny rolls out he's seeing the exactly the same things happening now
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.800]  only much more sophisticated much more technologically sophisticated he knows
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.040]  exactly how that's playing out and he had said not too long ago that we are
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:34.920]  this far from a police state holding his fingers very close to each other and
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:38.640]  then recently just before the interview he said we now have a police
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:42.960]  state well how does this police state work well guess what it turns on the
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.720]  police themselves in many cases just like this police chief here in a small
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:53.280]  town in New Mexico had been pretty much insulated against the the police state
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:56.880]  effects that many of us feel as citizens and he had purposely avoided flying
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.520]  just for that type of reason he knew what was there he wasn't totally naive
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:04.480]  he was going to a constitutional sheriff's and peace officers association so
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:08.760]  he had he knew what was going on this is a guy of integrity but it is his first
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.280]  instinct as you'll hear in this interview was to cooperate as all of our
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:16.240]  instincts are but after a while you realize that the government is so far
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:20.200]  over the edge they keep pushing pushing pushing that at one point you assert
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:23.520]  your constitutional rights listen to this interview this is how he laid it out
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.720]  last night on the nightly news self and retired sheriff or neighborhood who was
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:34.120]  at that time serving as the deputy chief for my agency we were in route to
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:39.160]  the tennis conference in Las Vegas and due to former investigation that I've
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:43.800]  been involved in very high-profile case my name was changed legally through the
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:48.360]  courts and it was sealed under record and so I have two different names I haven't
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:52.880]  flown in years by choice because of the conduct of PSA but for this particular
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:57.000]  event I had really had no choice and so I told the sheriff for better let's go
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.960]  talk to a TSA supervisor explain you know our circumstances because my biggest
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:06.240]  concern was regarding my driver's license the expiration date had just
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.360]  expired so we go upstairs and we speak to a supervisor she was very cordial we
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:15.480]  explained to our circumstances and she said not a problem it's within one year
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:19.720]  of expiration so you can fly there's no issue I said you know thank you so much
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.840]  we go downstairs we go to the ticket counter present identification again
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:27.360]  we're present we're you know provided with our tickets on boarding passes we
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.040]  book in our luggage and then here comes a young officer from the Albuquerque
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:37.600]  aviation police and he's being quite stern in his demeanor and so forth he
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.680]  said I need to speak with you guys okay so myself and sure for better goes off
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:44.360]  to the side with this individual and another officer and we speak with him
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:51.400]  he demands to see identification we provide him with identification and he
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.840]  starts questioning us and you know what's going on he says well you were
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:58.880]  you were named as a suspicious person I said really I said you know what is so
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:03.400]  suspicious about me he said did you go upstairs and I said yeah I did I spoke
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:07.480]  with the TSA person up there but what were you discussing with him as I had a
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:11.440]  question about my flight itinerary and any problems that may arise from an
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:14.880]  expiration date and so forth I don't recall the exact verbiage I used but
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:19.280]  that was a gist of the conversation and so ultimately I finally said you know
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.320]  I'm not being charged with something am I free to go he gave us our information
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:29.480]  back and we were sent on our way and we go upstairs through the TSA screening
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:34.480]  Sheriff Rivera was allowed right right through when I approached the lady asked
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:39.800]  me where I was going I told her that I was going to Las Vegas and she then
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:44.640]  asked what was my business there I made the statement that that's private and I
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:50.520]  kept walking so then I get up to the scanner I put all my stuff in the
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  scanner I went through the metal detector and I was forced to go through it
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:59.360]  three times I didn't have any metal on me you know that I was aware of but it
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:04.000]  kept going off nonetheless I get through the thing get all my stuff back and I
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.800]  start walking towards the turnstile and I'm approached by a man in a dark suit
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:12.160]  who flaps open a wallet and shuts it and puts it back in his pocket I don't
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:16.200]  know who he was with he didn't ever it showed me a card or nothing like that I
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:20.240]  don't have anything from him he was not wearing a uniform but he claimed to be a
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:25.400]  federal investigator those were his words and so he won't demand to see
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:28.040]  identification and I tell him you know we've already been through this I've
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:33.400]  already presented my identification at least three times to various officials
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:37.760]  what's going on and told me that I was a person of interest that I was listed as
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:45.600]  being suspicious so I comply I give him my credentials and he really just sort
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:48.880]  of belabored the point and I finally just asserted my First Amendment rights
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:53.160]  my Fourth Amendment rights and it really upset him you could see it in his
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:57.160]  demeanor ultimately I gave him a scenario I said you know sir the way
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:01.000]  you're treating me I said how would you like it if I were to treat you that way
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.480]  and I said just for example you come to my jurisdiction I don't have probable
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:09.080]  cause I don't have reasonable suspicion there's nothing suspicious about you but
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:13.920]  I just pull you over and say I stopped you because you're suspicious and you
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.360]  asked me well what's suspicious about me and I went through this whole scenario
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:20.800]  and I said you wouldn't appreciate that very much would you you said I'm paid to
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:25.200]  be suspicious I said really you're paid to be suspicious of law enforcement
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.720]  officers I said I will remember that the next time I pull over a TSA agent that
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:35.480]  they are paid to be suspicious of me a cop in other words I was pointing out the
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:39.680]  idiosyncrasy of what are you saying they're paid to treat everyone as if we
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.360]  are guilty they're trained to treat us all as terrorists even though as we just
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:47.600]  reported they allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to get a VIP pass when they
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.880]  came here so you're your al-Qaeda you're suspicious just because you're an
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:57.200]  American but but go ahead tell us what happened then after you did anything
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.160]  happen or we at that point you were allowed to get on to the plane well he
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.000]  starts closing distance on me becoming increasingly hostile making statements
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.880]  that you don't cop an attitude with me do you understand speaking to the chief
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:16.080]  of police as though I am I'm a convicted felon on the street who is in the
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:20.440]  process of committing some crime and ultimately the aviation police sort of
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:26.040]  got between us and allowed us to be on our way and we did we got we've stopped
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:30.400]  off at our gate we got a judge of orange juice was just getting some
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:34.120]  refreshments and a person in plainclothes walks up and takes our
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:40.400]  picture and walks off that is that is just so odd so we get on our plane I
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:45.280]  had no carry on once we land we get our baggage my baggage had been searched
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.000]  they turned on my laptop computer attempted to access my laptop computer
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  and you know I thought that was suspicious and so we go to this then I
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.200]  didn't know what I was getting into when I went to this constitutional sheriff's
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.440]  and peace officer association meeting and they're very little about it but once
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:06.720]  I got there my eyes were opened I saw a group of men and women law enforcement
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:11.240]  decorated law enforcement officers from all over the country painstakingly
[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:17.640]  constructing documents to help preserve our American way of life and then grown
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:22.360]  men with tears rolling down their face grieving over what was happening to our
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:27.160]  country and I realized I'm on to something here this is bigger than all of
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:32.600]  us this is about our God-given rights and so I signed on I got on board whole
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:37.160]  heartedly the moment I got on the ground and turned on my my cell phone my
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:41.560]  department issued cell phone I had a message from the Sandoval County Sheriff's
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:45.760]  Department I made contact with Lieutenant Lanelli who stated that my law
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:49.840]  enforcement credentials with the sheriff's department were being revoked so
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:53.800]  I'm cross-commissioned I'm I have dual authority so that dual authority was
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:18:00.120]  being revoked by the sheriff and it was really no reason as to why now if I
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:04.000]  didn't already state this I'm going to restate it if I did while in the
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.600]  airport in Albuquerque and in having this confrontation with this unethical
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.600]  unconstitutional TS agent he made the statement to me I know people in your
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.360]  district and I'm gonna make some phone calls well he lived up to his word he
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:20.480]  contacted Sheriff Doug Wood of the Sandoval County Sheriff's Department
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:25.920]  major's allegations now the key thing remember is you're not Sandoval County
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:29.600]  has nothing to do with Bernalillo County which is where the airport is housed so
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.280]  this this in a jurisdiction over this issue it was unethical for a lot of
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:39.200]  reasons but Sheriff Wood then made a complaint to my agency and I was called
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:43.280]  in on my day off placed on administrative leave ordered to collect all
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:47.960]  handguns badges commissioned large uniforms equipment for my officers and
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:53.400]  then to report for a town hall meeting tonight at six o'clock now we're gonna
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.840]  have him at the bottom of the hour with an update at what happened at that town
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:02.200]  hall meeting this is really amazing this is a man of integrity who just one
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:06.760]  week less than a week earlier prior to this happening he'd received a
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:11.920]  meritorious commendation from the mayor now he was fired by a combination of the
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:17.160]  mayor and the sheriff of the county where he is a police chief and he told me
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:20.240]  when I spoke to him last night that in this small town there was only about
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:25.600]  150 people 125 of them had signed a petition to keep him so we're gonna
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:29.760]  find out what happened about that but I want you to pay attention to what was in
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:34.240]  the article and what he said that he was approached by a federal agent who
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:38.960]  told him that he was a person of interest and when he was fired the sheriff
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:44.320]  of Sandoval County said that he was being his entire police department was
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:47.680]  being disbanded because of political affiliations and we're going to talk
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:51.440]  about what those dangerous political affiliations are right after the break
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:54.520]  we're going to have an excerpt from our interview with Sheriff Mack over this
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.640]  very issue stay tuned

[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:13.560]  welcome back to The Alex Jones Show I'm David Knight and we were just playing a
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:18.280]  clip from our interview last night with police chief Harger now he's the New
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:23.600]  Mexico police chief who was suspended as actually the correct term he's placed
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:28.480]  on leave but his entire police force was disbanded now there was a meeting last
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:31.400]  night to see whether his employment would be continued and what the
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:34.440]  conditions of that are going to be we're gonna have him at the bottom of the
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:37.680]  hour live to give us an update I might have said that he was fired earlier
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:41.360]  that's not true he was not fired he was placed on leave but his entire police
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:45.800]  department was disbanded they had to turn in their badges turn in their guns
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:51.840]  and understand how dangerous this is this is politically motivated the reason
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:56.400]  that the sheriff who took this action gave was he had to disband his entire
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:00.960]  police department due to his quote political affiliations he was approached
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:04.520]  at the airport by a man identifying himself as a federal agent and said
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:08.960]  that he was a person of interest what had he done well he was on his way to a
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:12.960]  constitutional sheriff's and peace officer's association meeting these are
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:17.240]  law enforcement officers who swear to uphold the Constitution unlike the
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:20.680]  people that we met in San Antonio who went down there for the open carry
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:24.600]  rally we talked to the San Antonio police chief and others with him they
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.120]  would not verify that they would refuse an order to confiscate guns if given
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.160]  that order they would not say that they were going to obey the Constitution that
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:37.320]  they swore to take an oath to these peace officers and sheriffs would as a
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:41.960]  very important scenario it is not a hypothetical scenario as he said well
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:44.840]  of course all scenarios are hypothetical but whether you're going to obey the
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:49.560]  Constitution or not is not a hypothetical it's fundamental we talked to
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:52.720]  sheriff Mack last night let's hear what he had to say about this specific
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:59.480]  incident in New Mexico the TSA getting hold of a sheriff a buddy going behind
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:09.120]  his back a backroom backdoor deal firing a good honest Christian constitutional
[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:13.960]  chief of police who was it the only thing he did wrong during the time he
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:18.800]  left town to the time he got back was to attend a constitutional convention with
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:25.160]  the CSP LA and this is the reason you had this meeting was one to establish a
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:29.400]  resolution to put the federal government on notice but they're not going to do
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:34.040]  anything like this in our areas we now have a resolution you've got to post
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:38.320]  this on the board we have it we have eight things that these sheriffs we
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:43.640]  have 41 public officials now 42 and it's counting we get more every day but
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:47.880]  after this conference the sheriffs and chiefs of police and peace officers and
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:52.760]  county commissioners and everybody who attended this are about 75 people all
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.000]  agreed that this was the right thing to do that we were going to put the IRS on
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.920]  notice we're going to put the federal government on notice that they're not
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:03.840]  going to be able to commit crimes in our jurisdictions anymore yes now we get
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:08.480]  this blowback and this this happening to one of our officers we've been praying
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:13.040]  and praying and fighting and praying and fighting and praying so that these
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:16.360]  sheriffs and this kind of chief of police would stand for principles of
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:20.760]  freedom stand for their oath of office we now have this happening it's starting
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:25.240]  and this is a peaceful resolution it's a peaceful solution and we've got to
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.360]  have everybody on board but we're not going to make it now sheriff max said
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:32.840]  this is a peaceful revolution it is something that you can be a part of you
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:37.440]  can support this action just as people supported the sheriff in Florida who was
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.480]  fired because he would not enforce unconstitutional gun regulations on
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:46.720]  someone there he was reinstated we have to fight this we have to fight this
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:50.360]  collectively and this is something that Alex has been saying for a long time
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:55.480]  that the police are not going to be immune from these kind of power-tripping
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:00.440]  illegal actions that we see the TSA and other federal agencies doing this is
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:06.040]  something that is going to be a pervasive systemic corruption and oppression
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:10.400]  and we're starting to see this now if they can disband whether it's because
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:13.920]  they had identified that he's going to this convention or whether it's because
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:17.440]  he said at one point I'm going to stand on my first amendment and my fourth
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:20.720]  amendment rights that's all I'm going to give you whether that annoyed them and
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:24.880]  they disbanded the police department this is the kind of power they should not
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:28.600]  have we look at this situation with the Super Bowl they're going to have to go
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:34.080]  two hours early and Arctic weather to go through security I mean people that are
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.040]  going to the Super Bowl like Jakari Jackson and Josh they're going to be
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.200]  setting out there in this Arctic weather for six and a half hours just because
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:46.280]  of well two hours of it is going to be because of these useless procedures any
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:50.360]  security expert will tell you that what they're doing is creating a very dangerous
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:54.920]  situation by bunching everybody up outside of a security zone and even if
[02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:59.120]  it were effective are you willing to give up your freedom and your liberty
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:04.480]  your God-given rights for the promise of that security there is no trade-off you
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:08.880]  cannot trade it off you're either free or you're a slave you're not
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:14.040]  partially free remember that what they call a maximum security area is a prison
[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.880]  and if they can't stop drug abuse if they can't stop drugs in federal prisons
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:23.120]  because we have a lot of people who are dying in federal prisons of drug
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:27.080]  overdoses every year if they can't stop it inside of a prison they can't stop
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:31.880]  drugs inside of a prison and they cannot stop terrorist attacks by these kind of
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:36.200]  nonsensical oppressive measures now stay tuned we're going to be talking to
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:39.880]  this police chief we're going to get an update on what happened so stay tuned

[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:56.680]  had police chief Harger as well as Sheriff Mack we interviewed them talked
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:02.200]  about this amazing situation where the police chief was placed on leave and his
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:08.000]  police force was disbanded after he was singled out on his way to go to a
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.120]  constitutional sheriff's and peace officers association meeting he was
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:16.080]  singled out by the TSA he was told he was a person of interest and he was also
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.800]  told by the sheriff that disbanded them that he was it was because of his
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:24.880]  political affiliations police chief Harger thank you for joining us
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:30.160]  thanks for having me now last night you had a meeting to find out what the
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:34.720]  status your status is going to be can you give us an update on what it is right
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:40.600]  now well I'm as a result of last night's meeting I was placed on probation
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:46.120]  their disciplinary action taken against me I was not instructed as to why
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:51.520]  disciplinary action was taken against me this was an open forum they said it
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:56.200]  would be a 14-day probationary period with conditions and they did not state
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:36:00.680]  what those conditions were they being in the town council the the people of our
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:04.480]  village were somewhat set back by that and it was very vocal about it you know
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:09.120]  what conditions are you talking about in probation for what and so that's kind
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:13.440]  of where we stand from an employment standpoint but the issues that are
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:17.520]  they're transpiring with TSA I've had quite a bit of information come across
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:21.040]  my plate I'm looking into it still trying to make heads or tails of this
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:25.600]  whole situation well they say very close mouthed about everything I we've had
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:30.920]  situations with a fellow who had been just cleared by the TSA to work on
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:35.120]  shipping areas and he was traveling to Japan stopped in Hawaii it was a
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:38.360]  military flight his wife was in the military they took him off the plane
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:42.560]  in Hawaii said he was on the no-fly list and he was stranded in Hawaii for
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.080]  quite some time could never get any information about why he was put on the
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:50.600]  no-fly list eventually through pressure inside the military we believe we don't
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.760]  know for sure because they're so clothed mouthed and secretive about
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:58.080]  everything he was allowed to fly again but he still was never able to get any
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:02.880]  information from the government as to why he was put on the list or if he was
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:07.000]  still on the list this is what's really concerning to everyone is that we now
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.280]  have these secret FISA courts that are meeting in secret claiming that they are
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:14.400]  having these and they're not even courts they don't have anybody arguing in the
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:18.040]  other side there's no jury there's just a single judge who basically rubber
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:21.360]  stamps whatever the government wants to do these court decisions are secretive
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:24.760]  we're never allowed to see them the public isn't and yet they maintain that
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:28.160]  they are modifying our Constitution it's a very dangerous thing when the
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:33.840]  government is turning to these kind of star chamber procedures isn't it it is
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.200]  and the Constitution is not subject to interpretation at the at the document
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:42.400]  that there's a living document and no one can change it yes we had a
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:46.880]  discussion as I mentioned earlier we went to San Antonio we pointedly Alex
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:51.040]  Jones and Anthony Gutiarty pointedly asked the police chief if he would
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.480]  confiscate guns if told to do so and he says well I'm not going to give you an
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:58.880]  answer that's a hypothetical and Anthony said your oath to the Constitution is
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.280]  not a hypothetical and they train for these scenarios all the time that was
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:06.520]  the very first thing as a matter of fact on this list that everybody signed at
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:09.560]  the Constitutional Sheriff's and Peace Officers Association the very first
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.720]  thing that was on the list was that they well the first thing was registration
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:16.000]  of personal firearms under any circumstances and then of course the
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.880]  number two thing was confiscation of firearms without probable cause and due
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:23.440]  process that that you would not support that because of course registration
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:28.080]  always precedes confiscation as something we're very concerned about and
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:32.680]  we've been talking about this quite some time and I guess maybe for you your
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:37.280]  initial response was to be cooperative just like our response is typically to
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:42.120]  be cooperative but you were surprised at how intrusive this was and how they
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:46.320]  kept at you and eventually you pushed back on this right well absolutely I
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.480]  mean for example I pull over a vehicle for a minor speeding offense there there
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:55.240]  are plenty of times that when I make contact with the driver they're not
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:59.520]  pleased that I have them pulled over but they're still compliant they do what I
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:03.800]  asked but they're not happy about the circumstances and you know what that's
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:09.240]  okay this is America there's nothing wrong with expressing yourself if you
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:11.920]  have this pleasure in a particular situation you feel you've been wrong
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:16.480]  there's due process and that's all this was I was being harassed in my opinion
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:21.760]  and I think the facts support that also what I made I made the point that you
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:25.880]  know I didn't appreciate it I wanted to be allowed to travel freely and I was
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.360]  not allowed to do that a time and time again I was stopped and harassed and
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:34.880]  annoyed and in question like this is Nazi Germany you know papers please
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:41.080]  prove who you are and what made this mortgages and jurors to me is I'm a
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:47.560]  US citizen I obviously not a foreign national dissent you know blonde hair
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:53.440]  blue eyes and a country accent I mean I'm from here I was born and raised here
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:58.480]  my grandfather fought in Korea my father fought in Vietnam he was a military
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:02.760]  police officer he served as a municipal police officer and here I have served on
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.720]  and off since 1998 in some law enforcement capacity or another currently
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:10.120]  serving as chief of police they knew this that I was serving as chief of police
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:16.120]  and treated me as though my name was Osama bin Laden appreciated and there was
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:20.960]  there was dramatic repercussions for for vocalizing the fact that didn't
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.880]  appreciate being treated that way well if you'd been a member of the bin Laden
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:26.640]  family with they would have given you the VIP treatment just like they gave the
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:29.920]  Muslim Brotherhood just like they did give the bin Laden family right after
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:34.040]  September 11th they're really coming after American citizens that's the
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:38.280]  target and it's constitutional sheriffs it's American citizens who haven't done
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:42.320]  anything they have declared us as the enemy in their internal documents and I
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:46.720]  think that that is the thing that I find most interesting about this is the
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:50.080]  political affiliations that's what the sheriff told you that it was because of
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:52.920]  political affiliations whether it's because of political affiliations or
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:58.440]  whether it's because this TSA agent got annoyed that you stood on your rights
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:02.640]  either way we're looking at a very corrupt situation like that where a
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:06.120]  police department can be disbanded can you tell us what they did to your police
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:09.720]  department well you know let me clarify something real quickly as far as the
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:14.040]  sheriff was concerned he did not tell me specifically directly that this was
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:19.120]  because of my political affiliation but based upon statements that he made it
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.440]  was certainly of a political nature one could only derive that conclusion but
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:27.920]  that having been said when I get back from from my trip to the constitutional
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:31.320]  sheriff's the peace officer association I'm immediately told that I'm being
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:34.280]  placed on this administrative duty administrative leave whatever I'm
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:39.000]  relieved of my my chief's position basically in essence I'm stuck behind a
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.480]  desk and I was ordered to take all equipment and uniforms badges etc from
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:47.160]  all of my officers and they claim it's only an inventory when you tell an
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:51.880]  officer turn in your badging done as a law enforcement officer it's not just
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:56.520]  what you do it's who you are you know I want to make something funny clear I I'm
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:00.360]  a public servant yes I have a title of chief of police but I'm a public
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:05.400]  servant I am a servant and my officers chaired in that mythology we're here to
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:09.280]  serve the people and we treated our people with dignity and respect but we
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:12.960]  didn't get that same dignity respect from our own village government no
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:16.960]  explanation to my officer as to what was going on just turning your stuff as a
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:20.600]  result regardless of what decisions the village makes from here on out they
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:26.200]  refuse to come back and so we have no police department and you know it's
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:31.280]  very discouraging it hurts my feelings it's wrong on a lot of levels people are
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:34.600]  backpedaling on some situations you know when you try to hold people speak to the
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:37.960]  fire for their actions and hold them accountable that's truly what we're
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:41.800]  talking about here is transparency and accountability if someone messed up
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:45.520]  let's just let's just admit to it hey this was a mistake this was handled
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:49.600]  inappropriately what should we do better next time and let's just move forward but
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:54.480]  they're not doing that well we're all very concerned because I tell you what I
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:59.080]  see here from our perspective because we're covering this day after day after
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:04.800]  day this is a very deliberate country-wide experiment in behavior
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:08.760]  modification my wife when she was taking her master's degree she had a book from
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.680]  BF Skinner was called Beyond Freedom and Dignity and when I saw it I said well
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:15.480]  it's about time somebody complained about the schools she said no no you
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:19.200]  don't understand I had not been introduced to the to the work of BF
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:23.520]  Skinner before basically he's a behaviorist and when they do things like put
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:27.560]  their hands on you and then if you are a good person and you do everything that
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:31.800]  they say you let them touch you any way that they want do anything to you that
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.400]  they want they will reward you with letting you get into the Super Bowl or
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:40.080]  letting you travel on a plane this is positive operant conditioning straight
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:45.360]  out of BF Skinner they were training teachers to do this to their pupils this
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:50.560]  is a massive experiment that we're all a part of the Constitution is being pushed
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.280]  aside the law is being pushed aside we have a massive behavioral experiment
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:59.280]  going on here and what we need to do is just tell them so long and thanks for
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:04.000]  all the fish I'm not going to be your dolphin anymore we have basic rights and
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.400]  we need to stand up for these rights and I really appreciate you standing up for
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.320]  those rights I really appreciate you standing up for our rights as a
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:14.880]  constitutional sheriff and going to this you had some very moving words about
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:21.520]  that meeting that you went to I had the pleasure the distinct pleasure of
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:25.200]  sitting in a room full of people dignitaries if you would that don't
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:29.880]  view themselves as such they view themselves as servants and they were
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:35.920]  dedicating their time and resources and energy into constructing a resolution
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:41.400]  that would reaffirm the inevitable the pre-existing document the US
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:45.680]  Constitution to build rights and all they were doing is coming together in a
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.800]  unified effort to say we're we're public servants we have a flock to protect
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:53.600]  we're going to protect our sheep we're going to protect our people and our
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:58.920]  citizens our fellow Americans and we're not going to allow the federal
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:03.720]  government any entity foreign domestic to trample the rights of our people
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:07.600]  people have the right to travel freely the right to be left alone and so I
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:11.400]  looked at the eyes of each and every one of these people in this room and I saw
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:14.960]  the sincerity I believe the eyes of the window to the soul and they're in there
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:18.920]  you know working away at this and they're they're bouncing ideas off of one
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:23.680]  another and the one after the next they're sharing their their thoughts on
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:27.640]  this and ultimately a document was reached and it occurred to me at that
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:33.480]  point this is a this is a rerun you know almost in my mind's eye I could
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:38.880]  almost see the old you know uniforms that our forefathers were wearing at the
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:43.240]  time when they were constructing the Constitution United States yes yes as
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:48.440]  very moving you know this is the only opportunity I think that we have to roll
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:52.320]  this back peacefully we can look at what happened in East Germany and again I
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:55.800]  mentioned at the beginning of this hour how William Benny who was the global
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:59.480]  technical head of the NSA before he resigned because of the illegal
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:04.160]  activity he said he didn't want to be an accessory to criminal acts he knew that
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:07.240]  it was against the law to spy on Americans to do this kind of blanket
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:10.760]  surveillance he knew they were recording everything and he resigned rather than be
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:15.320]  a part of that and he drew parallels to East Germany and you know it was in East
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:19.840]  Germany after decades of oppression from the police there shooting people who
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:25.360]  would try to climb over the fence to freedom there was a pushback people got
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:29.880]  together at a church they had a peaceful march and the police refused to enforce
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:34.320]  these criminal acts anymore they stood down they refused to be a part of that
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:38.440]  and that's what needs to happen Oath Keepers constitutional sheriff's and
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:43.280]  peace officer association police chiefs and and sheriff's said like you Chief
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:48.120]  Barger Barger that this is what we need to see happen we need to see those who
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:52.960]  have the legitimate authority use it legitimately we don't see hard
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:58.400]  congressmen standing up and and impeaching Obama for his criminal
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:03.440]  actions or holding Eric Holder to the fire for his criminal actions we need
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:08.560]  to see people in legitimate authority stand up and exercise that in legitimate
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:14.680]  authority I concur hold hardly you know it's it's the only way I think they're
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.160]  going to roll this back well you mentioned that one of the key things that
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:21.840]  people could do for you would be to pray for you and you certainly do have our
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:25.360]  prayers if people want to support you they can go to the constitutional shares
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:30.680]  and peace officer association it's cspoa.org there's a legal defense that's
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:36.080]  being set up for you there and is there anything else that we can do for you you
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.480]  know I would say again just to reiterate to each and every person that's
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:44.960]  listening that it's our individual responsibility to stand up and support
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:49.240]  and defend the Constitution as a citizen of the United States it's our it's our
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:52.680]  individual responsibility and so I would encourage each and every listener to do
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:58.120]  exactly that yes yes absolutely well thank you so much for talking to us
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:01.560]  keep us informed we would like to know what happens if this police department
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:05.920]  is going to be put back together again we'd like to know exactly what they do
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.680]  to you since you're kind of on some kind of animal house double secret
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:13.080]  probation they won't tell you what the charges are they're acting exactly like
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:17.720]  the TSA with their no fly lists they they know that they don't really have
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:22.400]  any reason to do this to you so they're making all of the actions secretive and
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.840]  not giving any explanations that's a true key and I plan on flying out to the
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:30.840]  next cspoa meeting so we'll see if I'm on a no fly list okay all right well
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:33.600]  thank you very much thank you for standing on the Constitution police
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  chief Shane Harger thank you well you know there's also some we never know
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:43.680]  how this is going to really turn out you know he's going through an ordeal here
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:49.240]  and I just want him to know that he's not alone you know we don't really know
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:52.760]  how these types of things are going to turn out we don't know why many times
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:56.920]  God puts us whether it's an individual or puts us as a country into these kind
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:01.200]  of situations I'm reminded of the old him God moves in mysterious ways his
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:05.360]  wonders to perform he plants his footsteps in the sea and he rides upon
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:08.840]  the storm you know we go through some tough times sometimes and we don't really
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:13.480]  know what's behind it but this is something that we just had a Christian
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:19.320]  film that was nominated in the Academy Awards for Best Song and they promptly
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:24.160]  removed it this is a very unusual thing to see this happen but we're gonna play
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:29.400]  you a little bit of an excerpt from that when we come back but when they they
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:32.440]  talked about this this was something was on the drudge report the fellow who
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:38.040]  wrote the song said that he indulged in the simplest grassroots campaign and he
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:40.720]  said it went against me when the song started getting attention I got taken
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:45.000]  down by competition that had months of promotion and advertising behind them I
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.560]  simply asked people to find the song and to consider it now what really happened
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:54.040]  here is that first his competition complained to the motion picture
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:58.760]  Academy they complained that it wasn't advertised enough and they said no it
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.480]  would played in LA and they advertise that it was in playing in LA so that's
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:06.480]  sufficient to give notice so first they advertise that it wasn't promoted enough
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:10.360]  and then they ever then they complained that he put it promoted it too much when
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:16.480]  the large studios will rent entire pages and variety magazine promoting their
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:21.760]  Oscar nominations all he did was send around a few emails to tell people hey
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:25.120]  I got nominated I'd like for you to listen to it and consider it he did a
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:30.600]  grassroots email campaign so is this a pushback against Christian films you
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:34.680]  know it would be kind of a we're gonna play right after we come back we're
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:38.320]  gonna play a little bit of this song for you I don't really think that it would
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:41.480]  go very well with the kind of award ceremonies that we've been seeing at
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:45.660]  the Grammys at the Super Bowl you know if they've got some kind of satanic
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:51.720]  Illuminati service going on this might be a real wet blanket so stay tuned
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:55.680]  right after the break we're gonna play a little bit of that for you
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:07.680]  what if you could shift into a parallel universe right now and be the solution

[02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:13.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and as we were going to
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:18.000]  commercial break I was telling you about the song that was nominated for as one
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  of the best song entries in the Academy Awards the Oscars it was from an
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:27.120]  independent Christian film has now been removed because first it was not
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:31.240]  promoted enough and then it was promoted too much it's from a film called
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:36.160]  alone yet not alone now I want to I want you to hear this song and there's a
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.280]  little prelude to the beginning of it this is the person singing it is Joni
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:45.880]  Erickson Tata she's a quadriplegic she had to have her husband press on her
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:49.800]  abdomen in order to get the high notes and so she starts us out with a prayer
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:54.040]  I want you to hear this because this is something we all need to look at and we
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:57.600]  all need to consider that we are alone yet we are not alone as we fight this
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:02.240]  tyranny I want you to hear this song we are the ones who run to you when we are
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:07.560]  weak and you know this body you form this body this is a quadriplegic body
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:12.920]  that is broken my lungs are limited but there's this fine balance between
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:19.520]  presenting to you all of my weakness and thinking that it can't be done I don't
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:25.800]  want to think that it can't be done and so father I pray that you will mitigate
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:32.680]  any crackiness in my voice any age in my voice any tiredness in my voice and
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:38.920]  please give me your strength these words talk about in your strength I find my
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:43.920]  own and so make that my prayer I make that my prayer
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:56:01.640]  I'm alone yet not alone God's the light that will guide me home with his love
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:19.000]  and tenderness leading through the wilderness and where I may wrong I'm
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:35.400]  alone yet not alone this is a song that was nominated for the Academy Awards as
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:50.840]  best song I know is near in history I find my own by his faithfulness he's
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:57:07.320]  shown that so my he is his shield his love is now revealed when my steps are
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:23.200]  lost desperate for I can feel his touch soothing presence
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:42.560]  I'm alone yet not alone not forsaken when all my own I can meet
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:48.640]  well I can see how this song would be a real downer for any kind of illuminati
