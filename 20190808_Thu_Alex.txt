[00:00.000 --> 00:17.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:30.000 --> 00:41.680]  Rex Jones here pointing for action 7 news now the Democrats are really going at it
[00:41.680 --> 00:44.680]  in the primary right now they're calling Trump a racist they're calling you a
[00:44.680 --> 00:47.040]  racist they're calling your grandma a racist hell they're calling your
[00:47.040 --> 00:50.960]  Pomeranian dog a racist Jesus Christ of course he's racist now you may have
[00:50.960 --> 00:54.480]  remember when he lost his Senate race to Ted Cruz despite the 10 to 1 funding he
[00:54.480 --> 01:10.560]  had and you may remember when my dad came out here and looked at his mural
[01:10.560 --> 01:15.680]  that's not what I said now I want you to pay close attention and really admire
[01:15.680 --> 01:21.040]  the beautiful artwork that is the Beto mural funeral piece it really is a
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.800]  monument to his short and bittersweet political career after failing against
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.720]  Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate election he went on to fail in the general
[01:29.720 --> 01:34.960]  Democratic primaries he's now pulling at under 1% now before the horrific El
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.280]  Paso shootings this weekend I would have put Beto's chances of losing the
[01:39.280 --> 01:44.720]  Democratic primary at around 99% now I think it's safe to say and pulling data
[01:44.720 --> 01:48.640]  backs me up on this it's around a hundred there is no chance that man can
[01:48.640 --> 01:54.040]  win he laughed about the victims of the mass shooting I'm incredibly saddened and
[01:54.040 --> 02:02.400]  it is very hard to think about this not a good look Beto not a good look
[02:02.400 --> 02:13.120]  moi mal I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this now you
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.680]  may be asking why did I bring flowers to this well it's no longer a monument to
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.960]  a short and bittersweet political career it's a political tombstone I will now
[02:22.960 --> 02:27.000]  lay these flowers here as a memorial to his political career and to symbolize
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.120]  that he is truly deader than someone who has damning information on Hillary
[02:30.120 --> 02:38.280]  Clinton Beto you had a good run and now it's time for the honorary moment of
[02:38.280 --> 02:42.400]  silence to celebrate Robert Francis O'Rourke the world's fakest Hispanic
[02:42.400 --> 03:04.520]  man's political career
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.360]  Rex Jones reporting for Action 7 News at the site of Beto's political tombstone
[03:09.360 --> 03:35.400]  okay I'm not trying to build this up because I can't even do it I'm mentally
[03:35.400 --> 03:42.280]  exhausted I think I need to just make that statement right now just one story
[03:42.280 --> 03:52.760]  that we have that's exclusive is so big that the only way to describe it is to
[03:52.760 --> 03:56.920]  describe my own mental processes so the people can understand the magnitude from
[03:56.920 --> 04:02.880]  my perspective I think you'll agree with me I've gotten so focused in the last
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.680]  three days on the incredible developments between the US and China and
[04:06.680 --> 04:11.000]  the proxy war in cashmere that you now see all the news they're admitting is
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.840]  the greatest threat of thermal nuclear war ever I mean again I knew that was a
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.280]  giant issue anybody would know it's a giant issue it was so huge they didn't
[04:20.280 --> 04:26.520]  know what to do for a couple days but while I've been distracted with that and
[04:26.520 --> 04:32.040]  it is a central issue and it is boiling over and it's bad and war could break
[04:32.040 --> 04:40.440]  out any minute there is a massive issue sitting right in front of everybody and
[04:40.440 --> 04:44.600]  the fact that we have the inside baseball I really should be talking about

[06:33.640 --> 06:37.600]  to some of this Christian hymn

[06:54.960 --> 07:04.880]  you see God controls the angel of death and Christ has the keys to death and
[07:04.880 --> 07:12.400]  hell remember that Satanist okay here's my thinking process and it's the only
[07:12.400 --> 07:15.880]  way I can describe this because stuff hits me like a ton of bricks all the
[07:15.880 --> 07:23.080]  time that I got so focused on the whole situation with India and how that could
[07:23.080 --> 07:27.160]  cause a massive global war and the fact that we had to do it because the
[07:27.160 --> 07:33.320]  Chinese were rolling in there and taking part of India and that the West is
[07:33.320 --> 07:38.120]  standing up to the globalist and the chai cops and they're having top Senate
[07:38.120 --> 07:41.320]  and House Intelligence Committee hearings about okay the Chinese
[07:41.320 --> 07:45.080]  government runs mainstream media owns Hollywood we're in deep trouble we're
[07:45.080 --> 07:48.000]  probably gonna have to arrest all these people I mean you wonder why they're on
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.360]  the news race war death everyone's a Nazi America's evil saying America's bad
[07:52.360 --> 07:56.000]  take down American flags major universities 9th Circuit Court of
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.120]  Appeals they're globalists therefore the team that wants to get rid of the
[08:01.120 --> 08:05.040]  country and a lot of folks are coming to that conclusion having to admit it and
[08:05.040 --> 08:10.440]  going well what are we gonna do this is insane exactly it's totally insane it's
[08:10.440 --> 08:14.400]  enough to make you get upset and yelling scream on air it's enough to make you
[08:14.400 --> 08:19.640]  build a media operation to resist it and boy 20 years ago I talked about the
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.320]  chai comms and 15 years ago and I made them front and center issue people
[08:23.320 --> 08:27.440]  thought I was crazy 10 years ago 15 years ago and I said they own Hollywood
[08:27.440 --> 08:34.000]  now and now it's all admitted they own our debt they own it all but I got so
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.800]  focused on that and it's still totally central that I didn't get to well what I
[08:42.800 --> 08:48.640]  said two weeks ago and what I said a month ago and when I said a month and a
[08:48.640 --> 08:56.360]  half ago when I was in DC I talked to three different people two of them had
[08:56.360 --> 09:01.640]  met with the president the other talked to the president over the phone and I
[09:01.640 --> 09:04.640]  guess I talked to a fourth who'd also talked to another prominent person that
[09:04.640 --> 09:12.520]  had met with the president and Trump said I'm going after big tech and how do
[09:12.520 --> 09:16.800]  you think we should do it and I came on air and I said he's going to go after
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.400]  big tech now here's the problem he's got a bunch of advisors around him that are
[09:21.400 --> 09:25.240]  two-faced and so they bragged it oh he'll try to sign an order and we'll just
[09:25.240 --> 09:30.120]  hide it and hope he forgets so Trump has to now have a notebook reportedly and
[09:30.120 --> 09:32.960]  write everything down and go back and make sure they're doing what he tells
[09:32.960 --> 09:37.280]  him he's never really experienced that as an executive usually have people
[09:37.280 --> 09:40.560]  wanting to do what he said so they would move up the chain in Trump
[09:40.560 --> 09:43.800]  organization but no these folks are trying to move up the chain in the
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.280]  globalist organization and they've been hedging their bets believing that
[09:48.280 --> 09:52.960]  Trump's gonna lose and fail and then they'll be in good with the NWO but as
[09:52.960 --> 09:56.560]  it becomes clear the globalist aren't winning and their whole system is
[09:56.560 --> 10:01.400]  falling apart and everything they touch is disintegrating
[10:03.280 --> 10:07.840]  Trump's winning and people are now moving over the Trump camp very fast
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.600]  and that's why the shrillness of the MSM on the Chai-Com and globalist payroll
[10:12.600 --> 10:20.080]  is just screeching squawking foaming at the mouth blow the US up blow Israel up
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.640]  blow the UK up you know anybody that isn't part of this bigger Chai-Com run
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.160]  New World Order they've got the right wing saying it the left wing and they've
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.520]  got all these controlled people that are freaking out that are on the globalist
[10:33.520 --> 10:37.960]  payroll because a lot of their money's drying up and it's been the Chai-Coms
[10:37.960 --> 10:40.600]  that have been the sugar daddy the whole time and that's starting to dry up
[10:40.600 --> 10:48.280]  because these folks can't deliver victory so here's the big announcement and I
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.440]  was sitting here ten minutes for the show looking at all this incredible news
[10:52.440 --> 10:58.040]  and I was saying to myself what is it that is the top story and I was like
[10:58.040 --> 11:06.080]  well it's obviously White House taking executive action on big tech censorship
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.360]  and then I was reading the Politico whitewash article about it but I saw
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.760]  something key in the Politico article yesterday when I first read it again
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.400]  this morning I was re-looking at it and that's when they say oh well there's a
[11:17.400 --> 11:21.280]  bunch of drafts and a big fight over what's going to be done well obviously
[11:21.280 --> 11:26.360]  Soran and his forces are in there doing everything they can like gremlins to
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.480]  make sure the effective stuff isn't done this would have been done months ago but
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.920]  Trump has gotten the most resistance to this to anything not even taking on
[11:34.920 --> 11:39.600]  China has gotten as much resistance and they obviously wanted me off the air a
[11:39.600 --> 11:45.440]  year ago so that I would stop bringing up the Chai-Coms down Google and Apple
[11:45.440 --> 11:50.080]  moved to China and how they gave the codes to Google and Apple to the Chai-Coms
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.520]  I mean Tim Cook called a meeting and said we got to shut this guy up you know
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.160]  Obama signed the deal for us to sell America out we've made an agreement the
[12:00.160 --> 12:04.040]  powers that be said this but Trump's not doing that now and this Jones guy will
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.040]  not shut up and I know there were discussions about trying to set me up
[12:09.040 --> 12:12.240]  put me in prison kill me I mean that's the stuff that's been going on I've
[12:12.240 --> 12:15.320]  had some high-powered folks call me and they go you know there's discussions
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.960]  about killing your ass right now these are people that are my friends but
[12:19.960 --> 12:24.880]  suddenly tell me I better watch it better shut up I'm not gonna shut up so
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.440]  that's the end of it you know I'm on my course it's set that's it that's all the
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.240]  power I have is turning it over to God and committing and then doesn't matter
[12:35.240 --> 12:43.760]  anymore I'm not here to serve your system so I'm sitting here this morning and
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.640]  I'm about to go live and it just goes being a big old light bulb and I went
[12:49.640 --> 12:55.920]  wait I know from all my sources and reports we've gotten to the president
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.240]  and because Matt drudge has gotten stuff for the president by putting it on
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.320]  drudge report at other ways and Trump security people that Trump's seeing all
[13:04.320 --> 13:09.040]  this and I'm like I'm kind of sitting it out here while I'm focused on India and
[13:09.040 --> 13:16.440]  China and the trade war while this is the final swirling drafts going on and I
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.600]  know right up to a week ago what's in the different drafts because with law
[13:21.600 --> 13:27.440]  firms in DC some of the top ones we wrote them when I got those of Trump
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.800]  again a little more than a year ago that's when all the crapping themselves
[13:32.800 --> 13:38.080]  began because I hired three law firms and if you're a lawyer their household
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.880]  names and I I had my ideas I checked we worked reports so it would be given to
[13:42.880 --> 13:48.560]  the president we also publish those on info wars.com and it's not like I'm
[13:48.560 --> 13:53.640]  even that special we just were willing to you know maybe get assassinated and you
[13:53.640 --> 13:55.960]  know they're trying to plant child porn on us I mean these people don't play
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.520]  games hey that's fine whatever I'm not a devil works for like you so I'm on
[14:00.520 --> 14:03.640]  God's side that's the only team I want to be on when the angel of death comes
[14:03.640 --> 14:10.200]  through town I don't fear you I fear the big guy and everybody else just wants
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.160]  to grovel and fear to the system that's coming to an end big changes are here
[14:14.160 --> 14:18.600]  folks doesn't mean there's some utopia either know that this is gonna be a
[14:18.600 --> 14:25.560]  hard fight AI globalism it's all still there but humanity is awakening so I
[14:25.560 --> 14:28.720]  was thinking ten minutes for the show when I was figuring this out I'm like
[14:28.720 --> 14:33.360]  wait a minute the big fights now you're busy looking at the trade wars and
[14:33.360 --> 14:36.880]  stuff that have already been set in motion and the proxy wars which are
[14:36.880 --> 14:40.440]  important but the listeners need to know how important they are you need to
[14:40.440 --> 14:42.960]  know how important you are we all need to know how important we are and you
[14:42.960 --> 14:46.840]  need to be directing your crew who you I just kind of let them do whatever they
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.600]  want because I respect you know David Knight and I was Troyer and others that
[14:50.600 --> 14:53.120]  they just kind of go on their own because that they have good instincts but
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.080]  let me tell you I'm gonna tell the whole crew and everybody we need to get on
[14:57.080 --> 15:02.080]  lobbying calling the White House letters calling into C-span you know
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.920]  sending messages to Tucker Carlson everybody I mean I'm not just gonna be
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.160]  on air today I'm when I get off the show I'm gonna call 20 people because we
[15:12.160 --> 15:15.680]  kind of started this fight but then we've moved on to other projects but now
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.640]  it's come full circle the planets have aligned and now the action against big
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.800]  tech is on the table and it is the main thing on the drawing board right now
[15:25.800 --> 15:30.120]  and so the architects of deciding whether we're gonna be a free society and
[15:30.120 --> 15:35.960]  not be run by China and the globalist is he's being drawn up right now and we
[15:35.960 --> 15:39.320]  know what went into that and we know what's on the table and we know what's
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.000]  in those different graphs but then that's ten minutes for the show I can
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.560]  prepare for a month trying to come up here and tell you what is in the graphs
[15:46.560 --> 15:51.400]  and and and then how I think we should lobby for our future but I'll do the

[19:26.440 --> 19:29.880]  designed that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar design it
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.640]  is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.080]  leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt let it say you'll battle tattered flag
[19:39.080 --> 19:42.080]  like the one that flew over Fort Sumter and again on the back it says

[19:57.800 --> 20:01.360]  banned broadcast in the world
[20:01.360 --> 20:08.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:31.360 --> 20:41.840]  so the American people taken action they lobbied the president drudge last
[20:41.840 --> 20:47.160]  Monday about 10 days ago posted that article in that video my emergency
[20:47.160 --> 20:56.480]  message the president asking why are you committing suicide 200 million users in
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.560]  three days were deleted from Trump accounts on Instagram and Facebook that's
[21:01.560 --> 21:07.400]  200 million Mr. President and they're doing it every day all day just
[21:07.400 --> 21:11.880]  devastating devastating devastating killing communities that communicate
[21:11.880 --> 21:17.040]  with each other one account had 43 million followers another count 30
[21:17.040 --> 21:23.280]  something million all total 200 million in three days gone gone gone gone gone
[21:23.280 --> 21:31.600]  gone gone because they amplified the voice of the president did you see what
[21:31.600 --> 21:36.200]  happened yesterday because I went check the news they barely covered in the
[21:36.200 --> 21:45.800]  entire corporate news Trump in Dayton Trump in El Paso where the shootings took
[21:45.800 --> 21:49.920]  place and bringing people together and saying I don't blame the Democrats I
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.960]  blame mental illness and evil a few MSNBC shows would go out and try to get
[21:56.960 --> 21:59.640]  folks to attack Trump and they'd say no we love him we appreciate him coming
[21:59.640 --> 22:06.400]  wasn't his fault and so they don't know what to do but that's a microcosm that's
[22:06.400 --> 22:13.280]  an example right there of how they're dampening and blocking where the
[22:13.280 --> 22:20.080]  president was not even on the news except for a few minutes here and there when
[22:20.080 --> 22:25.960]  he goes to a massacre site used to they'd carry large pieces of his rallies
[22:25.960 --> 22:30.680]  notice they don't do that anymore this is all part of the strangling the
[22:30.680 --> 22:36.480]  governing the damning off the the walling off I mean here's an example
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.040]  Mitch McConnell had psychotics come to his house and said we're gonna stab you
[22:40.040 --> 22:44.880]  with a snake knife or with a butcher knife because you're the murderer
[22:44.880 --> 22:51.280]  turtle and they had little children going f you murder turtle f you murder
[22:51.280 --> 22:58.040]  turtle Mitch McConnell's official Twitter and his campaign site even though
[22:58.040 --> 23:02.120]  he's retiring they put out on their Twitters
[23:02.120 --> 23:07.280]  Tucker Carlson and others saying it was wrong and they just locked their Twitter
[23:07.280 --> 23:13.360]  down and said you delete it or we're gonna delete your account and of course
[23:13.360 --> 23:17.360]  what are they supposed to do I love how like a communist system they make you
[23:17.360 --> 23:22.440]  cut your own finger off they make you sit there and beat yourself with a bull
[23:22.440 --> 23:29.480]  whip and they do it over and over again you delete these tweets you delete
[23:29.480 --> 23:32.880]  those tweets oh you said something nice about someone we don't like you're
[23:32.880 --> 23:37.560]  deleted if you say something nice about Alex Jones on Facebook or Instagram you
[23:37.560 --> 23:41.120]  are banned you're warned once next time you're banned and then it's in fours and
[23:41.120 --> 23:45.880]  now it's the NRA and now oh it's Trump they haven't made an announcement but if
[23:45.880 --> 23:49.280]  you say something nice about the NRA you get a warning you say something nice
[23:49.280 --> 23:52.520]  but the president you get a warning and they just say you violated our terms but
[23:52.520 --> 23:56.160]  people are taking screenshots of this where they'll post a picture or a meme
[23:56.160 --> 23:59.680]  about Trump just something nice and wholesome and they're blocked so the
[23:59.680 --> 24:05.720]  leader of the Senate when people come to his house saying we're gonna stab you
[24:05.720 --> 24:09.400]  with a butcher knife while he's there and why he doesn't have a fence around
[24:09.400 --> 24:14.000]  his house that's crazy that's the leader of the Senate most powerful country in
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.800]  the world like third in line to be the president of the United States the fourth
[24:19.800 --> 24:26.080]  in line and all that's going on and there's people in his house saying we're
[24:26.080 --> 24:32.920]  going to kill you and they're left on Twitter but Mitch McConnell can't be on
[24:32.920 --> 24:37.680]  Twitter now you think in a free country the government should put up with that
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.200]  because it's checks and balances these corporations have become bigger than
[24:42.200 --> 24:46.960]  countries oh and it's happening they're now announcing what I warned you about
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.160]  members CNN a couple months ago when Facebook said don't say nice things about
[24:51.160 --> 24:56.840]  me or you'll get banned they had CNN reporter on they're going well I call
[24:56.840 --> 25:04.880]  I've reached out to them Oliver Darcy goes I've reached out to Twitter and I've
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.080]  reached out to Facebook because I'm finding out if he's got a WhatsApp on
[25:08.080 --> 25:12.440]  because Facebook owns that a private messenger because we want to find out if
[25:12.440 --> 25:18.600]  he's using instant messages to people one-on-one messages and now it's all
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.000]  being announced oh Microsoft's gonna control your messaging systems and read
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.520]  what you say and not let you say certain things and ban you if they don't
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.520]  like what you're saying in private conversations because we've already put
[25:31.520 --> 25:37.080]  up with all this why not so that's in the news today that they're listening to
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.080]  all your phone calls oh not the NSA I mean they're doing it but they don't
[25:42.080 --> 25:47.160]  even know how to basically they privatized it all with big tech so you
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.160]  would sign a form opting in for your television to watch you and you're
[25:52.160 --> 25:56.480]  Alexa to listen to you have sex in fact it's if they're all programmed when
[25:56.480 --> 26:01.760]  you're having sex particularly to turn on and send a message back so humans
[26:01.760 --> 26:07.160]  can listen or if you're talking about drugs or guns or anything it's listening
[26:07.160 --> 26:11.000]  a little robot just like your cell phone in your house and I'm gonna get into
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.040]  what's inside of the different drafts and the big bombshell news but I've
[26:17.040 --> 26:19.600]  really got to think back over all these conversations and articles we've written
[26:19.600 --> 26:21.920]  where we've already talked about the drafts the drafts that we wrote and
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.440]  sent to the White House I mean again I this just kind of light bulb ten minutes
[26:25.440 --> 26:29.120]  for I went on air but I will get it all that exclusive stuff in the last
[26:29.120 --> 26:33.800]  segment of this hour but there is a lot I mean I know what's on the table I know
[26:33.800 --> 26:39.960]  what Trump's looking at doing I know what some of his advisors are telling him
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.360]  and I know the fights that are going on but I want the president's been saying
[26:44.360 --> 26:52.480]  he's gonna do but you read Politico they go the president claims there's
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.760]  conservatives being censored ha ha ha he claims that the sun is yellow and
[26:56.760 --> 27:01.280]  grass is green and buries tweet and fly in the sky
[27:01.400 --> 27:07.680]  well he claims MSM lies ha ha ha never heard of that before and so we're looking
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.960]  at all of that we're gonna be covering all of it and I've just I've got to sit
[27:11.960 --> 27:15.280]  here over a couple breaks and write notes because there's so much and then we
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.600]  really do have the inside baseball and we never build ourselves up like media
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.120]  does with fake leaks or fake intel and pontificate all the big giant story it's
[27:23.120 --> 27:28.520]  a little tiny fragment of something we're we're gonna lay out the big giant
[27:28.520 --> 27:39.680]  ultramassive inch a lot of for everybody and boy man there is a lot there is a

[28:07.560 --> 28:15.760]  hand-delivered information and again I got told that I'm lucky I'm alive by

[30:05.320 --> 30:10.680]  the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil
[30:10.680 --> 30:15.760]  war borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged the
[30:15.760 --> 30:21.760]  world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those

[30:55.680 --> 31:01.440]  freedom by buying from info wars store.com before I started working at
[31:01.440 --> 31:06.440]  info wars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and info wars.com but also the
[31:06.440 --> 31:10.360]  products at info wars store.com and there's one product that's offered at
[31:10.360 --> 31:15.040]  info wars store.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force
[31:15.040 --> 31:18.280]  Plus now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some
[31:18.280 --> 31:23.600]  of his special guests telomeres and telomere support with your DNA so I
[31:23.600 --> 31:28.000]  started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.360]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres so I started
[31:32.360 --> 31:37.240]  looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite
[31:37.240 --> 31:41.360]  supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming up with
[31:41.360 --> 31:45.800]  competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but
[31:45.800 --> 31:51.200]  DNA Force Plus is still there it is the elite supplement I get excited when
[31:51.200 --> 31:55.240]  DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should take
[31:55.240 --> 32:00.080]  advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at info wars store.com
[32:00.080 --> 32:04.320]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become? Big tech are big babies that have become
[32:04.320 --> 32:07.520]  big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of
[32:07.520 --> 32:10.880]  social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[32:10.880 --> 32:14.360]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the
[32:14.360 --> 32:17.240]  members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[32:17.240 --> 32:20.200]  members of the public in the audience that care about this have to bring real
[32:20.200 --> 32:23.880]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[32:23.880 --> 32:27.400]  will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[32:27.400 --> 32:30.800]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American
[32:30.800 --> 32:34.120]  economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great
[32:34.120 --> 32:38.080]  Depression the inforores audience is the fuel that flames the the light of
[32:38.080 --> 32:42.360]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to
[32:42.360 --> 32:46.120]  make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is
[32:46.120 --> 32:49.520]  big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to
[32:49.520 --> 32:53.040]  meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of
[32:53.040 --> 32:55.960]  telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[32:55.960 --> 32:59.640]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just
[32:59.640 --> 33:01.760]  saw

[33:31.560 --> 33:37.000]  space and eternity come on remember that article it's awesome whoo we're live
[33:37.000 --> 33:49.120]  broadcasting worldwide in defiance of the globalist tyrants here's what I'm
[33:49.120 --> 33:56.440]  gonna do next segment I'm gonna get into the mechanics of why Trump's got
[33:56.440 --> 34:01.400]  issues with fighting the censorship is it so complex these are just some of the
[34:01.400 --> 34:05.000]  notes I wrote during the last break I've got a right couple more pages of notes
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.320]  from my contacts our advisement what we've been told is in the drafts what
[34:10.320 --> 34:13.960]  Trump has told people that I've met and talked with it directly met with the
[34:13.960 --> 34:20.440]  president this isn't like fake New York Times leaks where they sit there and
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.040]  just make stuff up and say they have sources or Comey uses his proximity to
[34:24.040 --> 34:29.800]  the president but then make up fake memos no this is really what is about to
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.280]  happen and it would have happened months ago Trump already gave them the orders
[34:34.280 --> 34:42.160]  six months ago to come up with a plan to stop this and to fight it and if they
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.880]  don't back down to really get draconian like Trump's done with China and others
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.320]  and he said to remove people move people around to try to get some straight
[34:52.320 --> 34:58.120]  answers and now they are down to the final drawing board right now notice
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.240]  just a few months ago the Huffington Post and Politico and all these
[35:02.240 --> 35:07.120]  sorrows groups were all arrogant oh he'll never get around to it he can't get
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.040]  anything done you know his people know he's an idiot so they never carry out
[35:11.040 --> 35:21.280]  his orders and I remember the neocons particularly over at the Atlantic and I
[35:21.280 --> 35:24.560]  sent that some just to someone that I know that talks to the president every
[35:24.560 --> 35:29.160]  day the president calls the president absolutely loves and I said you know what
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.040]  to do with this and he's like yeah those are some arrogant bastards this will be
[35:33.040 --> 35:37.920]  very helpful with the president their headline Trump's not gonna do anything to
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.840]  big tech what was the original headline don't worry Google Trump's all talk and
[35:42.840 --> 35:47.520]  his staff won't carry out what he says six hours later because obviously all
[35:47.520 --> 35:50.440]  our phones are being listened to and watched they're obsessed with the fact
[35:50.440 --> 35:54.880]  we can talk to the president they had changed the headline and rewritten the
[35:54.880 --> 35:59.680]  article in Atlantic monthly not shooting their fat mouths off I am gonna go to my
[35:59.680 --> 36:04.600]  why is Trump committing suicide message from 10 days ago cue that up please but
[36:04.600 --> 36:11.920]  what I'm getting in here is this is so big that I'm just having trouble even
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.320]  processing it and I know they are too because it's a big deal to go up against
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.920]  big tech because big tech is the deep state it's the national security system
[36:20.920 --> 36:28.440]  it's the 18 agencies it's full of Obama people and it's the big holdout if you
[36:28.440 --> 36:33.600]  think the Justice Department's full of Obama people no going after big tech you
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.240]  could say is jumping with shark I mean if Trump does this it in a meaningful way
[36:37.240 --> 36:43.960]  it is the Grand Kehone Award you know Owen did his joke award in here for most
[36:43.960 --> 36:48.280]  banned person a few days ago on the anniversary of my platforming but we
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.760]  should have an award with just big giant brash balls and give it to President
[36:52.760 --> 36:56.640]  Trump if he does this I mean he already deserves it but I mean I'm talking a huge
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.760]  trophy made of real bronze you can't even pick up got away like 500 pounds some
[37:01.760 --> 37:07.720]  giant kettlebells or something because let me tell you here's the thing Trump
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.400]  knows he's damned if he does he's damned if he doesn't there's no way to play
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.120]  games with this the thing is Chai come run with a bunch of foaming at the
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.880]  mouth leftist that bought their own propaganda that was meant to divide the
[37:21.880 --> 37:26.560]  country the executives actually hate the country their emails have leaked they
[37:26.560 --> 37:35.840]  actually smoke the dope the Chai come in globalist Tabasco Institute dope by the
[37:35.840 --> 37:38.480]  way there's more than one way to skin a cat you know the Tabasco Institute I'm
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.200]  told having some big problems internally and a lot of other things are
[37:42.200 --> 37:47.080]  happening to them right now you want to have a system to kill humanity and teach
[37:47.080 --> 37:50.880]  us not to have children and sterilize ourselves who actually want to make
[37:50.880 --> 37:57.720]  maybe a world reality well there's more than one way to skin a cat or to pull
[37:57.720 --> 38:06.000]  the feathers out of a goose so humanity is roaring back like a fire
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.840]  breathing engine and it's going to be very very interesting that's all I can
[38:12.840 --> 38:16.720]  tell you is that the fights on for every action is an equal and opposite
[38:16.720 --> 38:25.880]  reaction and the Satanist thought while we slept like a dormant or sleeping
[38:25.880 --> 38:30.760]  volcano they heard a few rumbles and I think oh nothing's gonna happen oh I'll
[38:30.760 --> 38:37.840]  never like I don't know they see smoke and now red fire shooting up they're
[38:37.840 --> 38:47.000]  going oh wow is there time to evacuate you think about a volcano is it's a
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.160]  tidal tectonic tightness force it's a force of nature it's natural law and
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.840]  we're going to explode politically on you and all your intimidation isn't
[38:57.840 --> 39:03.240]  gonna work like Castro that when they he couldn't allow them to even say the
[39:03.240 --> 39:06.700]  sacrament of women killing babies for the Satanist but even better is just
[39:06.700 --> 39:11.080]  getting men to sterilize themselves because that stops babies too so he
[39:11.080 --> 39:19.040]  said don't let women have the purview of the sacrament of abortion trans men
[39:19.040 --> 39:25.080]  that become women men can have abortions just as an assault on reality
[39:25.080 --> 39:29.280]  which is what's that's how you know it's Satan when it's just a total up is down
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.520]  down is up black as white there is no natural law there is no common sense
[39:33.520 --> 39:39.360]  there is no give and take there is no tidal forces it's all just one way
[39:39.360 --> 39:47.360]  mindless garbage rebelling against God's laws that's Satanism and so he said he
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.360]  wanted to intimidate people and let them know that we're coming after you and
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.280]  that's what they're all saying oh we got to get dirty we got to show them we got
[39:55.280 --> 40:01.680]  to scare them haze and Donnie Deutz and all of them we ought to put a whole
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.840]  compilation of others the last month of the threats you know not just we're
[40:05.840 --> 40:08.760]  coming to your house we're coming to your don't want to meet their dinners hey
[40:08.760 --> 40:11.880]  great you yell at me but when I meet my dinner I come over and scream at you and

[40:19.200 --> 40:26.360]  taco deli or at a sub shop or at a restaurant or at a fried chicken place

[40:32.880 --> 40:35.920]  and threatened me three times then I come over to you because you're in the
[40:35.920 --> 40:41.360]  way and then I may get you thrown out see because I love it I've let myself go

[40:56.320 --> 41:01.440]  it works now you left us when I go to the restaurants keep your mouth shut
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.200]  because you know it's not gonna be some one-way deal where you chase me out of

[41:17.200 --> 41:21.280]  remember there are some people that can tear people's hands off with their bare
[41:21.280 --> 41:27.480]  hands and I'm one of them scumbag you want to fight you little devil bastards

[41:49.960 --> 41:57.360]  Satan is absolutely in rage because he knows he's a loser he's always been a
[41:57.360 --> 42:03.880]  loser and he just wants to take as many children with him that means simple
[42:03.880 --> 42:09.040]  lines as well and it's up to us to not let that loser pull these people with
[42:09.040 --> 42:14.480]  him into that black hole and that's what hell is man the globalists know
[42:14.480 --> 42:18.000]  where they're going I like all the allegories the comic books the phantom
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.120]  zone that's it well guess what I don't want to go to the phantom zone with a
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.640]  bunch of you people can you imagine being an eternal spirit that we are
[42:27.640 --> 42:35.720]  locked with these people forever that love to hurt children and prance around
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.520]  all day worshiping evil and wearing black and celebrating their weakness and
[42:39.520 --> 42:44.840]  their self loathing they project on dust I love myself I'm proud of who I am I

[43:03.000 --> 43:06.680]  they are technocrats they are control freaks in their own words and they
[43:06.680 --> 43:10.120]  believe allowing you to live your own life make your own decisions it's in the
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.600]  way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods and we're fighting them hard
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.320]  in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but
[43:18.320 --> 43:21.920]  one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.000]  lot of control in our lives is our bodies if I wasn't taking the highest
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.320]  quality supplements for the forest live calm I couldn't do it that's why we
[43:30.320 --> 43:34.560]  decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality metal

[45:32.200 --> 45:37.040]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[45:37.040 --> 45:40.200]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say
[45:40.200 --> 45:43.920]  you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system
[45:43.920 --> 45:46.920]  trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different

[47:02.280 --> 47:07.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:07.640 --> 47:17.640]  I can feel the energy
[47:37.640 --> 47:50.320]  let yourself go stop submitting these devil worshippers you think they have
[47:50.320 --> 47:56.200]  the fury they try to imitate God's fury we have the real power they couldn't
[47:56.200 --> 48:04.520]  even imagine all right I'm not doing this as a cliffhanger but I'm gonna have
[48:04.520 --> 48:07.720]  to six after because I was busy during the break and I've got to write more
[48:07.720 --> 48:14.160]  notes I've got a brainstorm because again all this fake news goes around in
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.800]  manufacturer stories and they don't even know how to get sources no one trusts
[48:18.800 --> 48:25.120]  them so they don't get sources and I've not been perfect I got about a 98 when
[48:25.120 --> 48:29.080]  it comes to not hurting sources a few times I won't lie sometimes over the
[48:29.080 --> 48:31.760]  years late at night or whatever I've had a few drinks and say things I shouldn't
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.560]  on air that's why I pretty much stopped that but definitely on air I'm even
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.080]  drinking the champagne I'm brought in here I'd like one sip of it but these
[48:41.080 --> 48:46.080]  people just burn each other all day they lie constantly I couldn't imagine being
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.000]  that dishonorable just living where you constantly lie constantly betray people
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.760]  and constantly screw people over because they're cut off from God if you're
[48:53.760 --> 48:57.680]  connected to God that's what God's fearing is people don't even understand
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.480]  what that means it means you feel God pulling away from you because you're
[49:01.480 --> 49:05.480]  moving away from God because God is perfect and so when you're doing bad
[49:05.480 --> 49:13.040]  things you're moving yourself away from God and so it's like in a car that has
[49:13.040 --> 49:16.480]  you know the alert systems when somebody gets too close or you're about to
[49:16.480 --> 49:21.920]  rear-end somebody goes these people don't have any of those they have no
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.000]  sixth sense they have no connection they have no intuition oh women's intuition
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.680]  that's women's psychic power and everything we're taught is to not go
[49:32.680 --> 49:40.440]  with our instincts even our instincts know and so people like Castro says I
[49:40.440 --> 49:44.840]  want to intimidate people I want to teach him not to get the Trump let me a
[49:44.840 --> 49:47.800]  little prediction it's already happening Trump's bringing in more money than he
[49:47.800 --> 49:55.080]  ever did you dumb idiot like you must think Texans are slaves that you dox
[49:55.080 --> 50:00.200]  thousands of people so they get harassed because they gave money to Trump and you
[50:00.200 --> 50:05.360]  were so dumb a whole bunch of them had donated to you as well a lot of folks
[50:05.360 --> 50:08.560]  just do that for business purposes and now they say they're gonna just like I
[50:08.560 --> 50:13.040]  thought increase to Trump and nothing to you or any Democrats see you thought a
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.160]  bunch of self-made business people are gonna back away from Trump because you
[50:18.160 --> 50:22.320]  say where they live you know Castro there's some people out there that don't
[50:22.320 --> 50:28.520]  put up with stuff like that I'm not threatening you you're an idiot I wouldn't
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.880]  dock somebody unless they docked me that's called chivalry you don't fight it
[50:32.880 --> 50:37.440]  people's houses you don't go to somebody's home unless they've been
[50:37.440 --> 50:40.760]  assaulting people's homes and let me tell you this Antifa and people like him
[50:40.760 --> 50:45.240]  hey Castro we're coming to your house not to hurt you not to threaten to stab you
[50:45.240 --> 50:48.640]  with a butcher knife like your supporters due to Mitch McConnell but we're
[50:48.640 --> 50:57.520]  coming to your house oh that's another thing about chivalry when I'm coming to
[50:57.520 --> 51:04.600]  somebody's house I tell him I'm coming so you cross the line here buddy boy you
[51:04.600 --> 51:07.800]  cross the line by the way everybody comes to my house to hurt me and my
[51:07.800 --> 51:12.280]  family you come to die that's another little message I want to give everybody
[51:12.280 --> 51:16.400]  I'm not into killing I'm on the deck but if people want to go down that road
[51:16.400 --> 51:21.360]  you know what I just so happen to know how to do all that I know how to do it
[51:21.360 --> 51:26.540]  real good like it's second nature like it's breathing or something it's so
[51:26.540 --> 51:30.520]  easy to hurt people you know what's hard is to be good and try to build things
[51:30.520 --> 51:33.800]  and build people up but that's what's fulfilling that's what's rewarding I'm
[51:33.800 --> 51:38.000]  really just a farmer Castro I really just want to build a civilization and
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.440]  happy people but you know what you won't get off my back Castro and the rest of
[51:42.440 --> 51:50.560]  you people won't get off our backs so the some things are gonna happen I don't
[51:50.560 --> 51:57.600]  want anything violent to happen to Castro or Antifa but when you see him out
[51:57.600 --> 52:01.520]  or you see him out doing stuff you will get in that coward's face because he
[52:01.520 --> 52:06.560]  thinks he intimidated us he's drawing first blood over and over and over again
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.680]  and he needs to know that his intimidation isn't gonna work so I said
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.400]  next hour I said this segment now next hour I'm gonna write some notes but to
[52:15.400 --> 52:20.880]  write some notes again how this happened if you just tuned in I've been at the
[52:20.880 --> 52:25.280]  heart with this audience all of you have been at the heart and Matt drudge has
[52:25.280 --> 52:29.160]  been at the heart even more than we have almost I'm gonna say that and get the
[52:29.160 --> 52:32.280]  guy in trouble but he already know how instrumental drudge is just trying to
[52:32.280 --> 52:36.160]  keep this country free at trying to get information the president and Don
[52:36.160 --> 52:43.000]  Jr. and others and it's happening but the president's getting ready with these
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.880]  executive orders it's a big deal and they still got the drafts together so
[52:47.880 --> 52:51.320]  right now they're kind of all in the boardrooms deciding and this is the
[52:51.320 --> 52:56.080]  maximum time to make this the big issue as they report that Trump is set and that
[52:56.080 --> 53:01.480]  is accurate issue an executive order on big tech censorship very very soon but
[53:01.480 --> 53:05.600]  I want to give you the intel of the discussions I've been made privy to the
[53:05.600 --> 53:09.480]  intel that we've given the president and how they're trying to block the more
[53:09.480 --> 53:12.800]  effective plans but then when I even try to think about what is the most
[53:12.800 --> 53:17.440]  effective plan they're really thinking about that too it's very weighty
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.120]  heady stuff and it's why I haven't really got to it yet because even though I
[53:22.120 --> 53:24.640]  thought about it this a lot and everything when you come down to the
[53:24.640 --> 53:28.880]  moment it's like giving you the space shuttle controls and saying well okay
[53:28.880 --> 53:33.600]  what we do with the space shuttle here and the truth is nobody's been in these
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.840]  waters so no one is able to do this perfectly it just has to be done and
[53:37.840 --> 53:47.240]  so we're here and it's big and it's not like I'm even choking to talk about it
[53:47.240 --> 53:55.960]  it's just that it's so important that we're up to this moment now we should
[53:55.960 --> 53:58.600]  probably open the phones up the next few days and see what listeners think too
[53:58.600 --> 54:02.960]  this is just a big deal this is a big deal and I don't want to go off half
[54:02.960 --> 54:05.920]  cocked but we're at this moment and we know how they're trying to get him
[54:05.920 --> 54:09.320]  derailed so whatever we're gonna lay out and the fights we're gonna talk about
[54:09.320 --> 54:15.760]  and what we know the president's doing will definitely get traction is what I'm
[54:15.760 --> 54:18.800]  saying because we're in the final days of this is already gonna happen before
[54:18.800 --> 54:22.520]  but it wasn't gonna be a strong but they screwed the pooch with all their
[54:22.520 --> 54:27.560]  arrogance and lying to his face and all the stuff now it's gonna be draconian
[54:27.560 --> 54:31.760]  just like with China it's gonna be draconian I mean Trump's not backing
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.560]  down he's really trying to fix this peacefully because you know if North
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.200]  Korea keeps playing games I mean it's good this could get serious too
[54:39.200 --> 54:44.360]  Trump didn't hang around that little vampire bat demon for nothing that guy's
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.280]  a chai-com puppet and it's scared of the chai-coms the chai-coms have kept the
[54:48.280 --> 54:53.000]  Koreans poor the North Koreans Trump's really trying to say hey come on in the
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.920]  water's nice come on come on no no stop you can rule over all this wealth just
[54:57.920 --> 55:03.200]  free your people but the chai-coms are all surrounding him and so it's just an
[55:03.200 --> 55:06.600]  amazing down to be alive folks this is a crossroads of humanity here's a few
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.560]  minutes of the report the drugs linked to that of the White House got to Trump
[55:10.560 --> 55:13.760]  in my emergency message the president asking why are you committing suicide
[55:13.760 --> 55:20.000]  and demanding quick action here this president Trump I am here to respectfully
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.160]  tell you that if you don't wake the fuck up and take action right now you're
[55:25.160 --> 55:29.240]  not gonna get re-elected in 2020 in fact the globalists are gonna steal that
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.400]  election and then fully overthrow this nation as you know well I'm about to
[55:34.400 --> 55:38.560]  give you a briefing on the in-game of censorship and the fact that you must act
[55:38.560 --> 55:41.080]  now
[55:45.400 --> 55:51.160]  mr. president we're able to get this report to you I beg you for yourself
[55:51.160 --> 55:55.480]  your family my family in the whole world to understand that your blind spot
[55:55.480 --> 56:00.360]  your Achilles heel is your confidence that you can overpower the sensors and
[56:00.360 --> 56:06.160]  overpower the manipulation that we saw in 2016 that was intense but nothing
[56:06.160 --> 56:09.520]  compared to what the Democrats the deep state are doing this time they have
[56:09.520 --> 56:15.480]  pulled out all the stops in just the last three days mr. president we have
[56:15.480 --> 56:23.280]  seen over 200 million followers to scores of popular Instagram and Facebook
[56:23.280 --> 56:30.480]  accounts deleted and the accounts removed some of these accounts had 43
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.480]  million followers a piece others had over 30 million if you combine just the
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.600]  top two accounts that got deleted for no reason other than they were politically
[56:39.600 --> 56:43.920]  popular and shared your information that's more followers than you have on
[56:43.920 --> 56:50.040]  Twitter the Democrats admit the EU admits the big tech giants admit that
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.200]  memes are more powerful than all so that's part of the eight minute report
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.240]  that drudge linked to that we got to the president thank God for Matt drudge and
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.040]  and a lot of people like to fire it from sass when he's out on the road he keeps
[57:02.040 --> 57:04.800]  giving orders they keep not coming up with plans well he's been cracking the
[57:04.800 --> 57:08.680]  whip it's very close so we need to talk about what's on the table coming up and
[57:08.680 --> 57:11.280]  then we'll get into other issues today there's so much news to cover but this
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.520]  is really the big enchilada in your voice and your lobbying isn't penultimate
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.160]  it's paramount it's humoral Nuno everybody says that the penultimate goal

[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.840]  okay next segment I've still got to do some more brainstorming I'm gonna give
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.120]  you my best thinking on what's currently happening and our inside scoops on what
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.400]  Trump is planning to do to big tech and how they're planning to counter strike
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.000]  I mean this is just this is the war of our time when this is all said and done
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.520]  you could have encyclopedic volumes written about how crazy all of this is
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.720]  but remember the backdrop remember the operating system I only mentioned this
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:41.880]  yesterday MSM Boy Scouts have a pedophile epidemic and are hiding
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:47.680]  hundreds in its ranks Boy Scouts to provide condoms at upcoming world
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.440]  jamboree the five-year-olds yeah pedophiles rule the world that it's
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.640]  changing here's a report on it Epstein pleaded not guilty to federal charges
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.120]  he's accused of recruiting a network of young girls he sexually abused at his
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.280]  mansions in Florida and New York no mention of this island but authorities
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.200]  say he declared it his primary residence with a massive main house
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:18.360]  eccentric statues and manicured lines of palm trees for over a hundred years
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.000]  Western intelligence agencies themselves infiltrated by secret societies out of
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.520]  Britain used sex operatives to compromise targets who weren't just
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:38.360]  agents of foreign governments but who were in outside power structures that
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:44.800]  this group didn't control but was seeking to get control Cecil Rhodes wrote
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.840]  about this in several books on his plan for world government he had the main
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.320]  British Empire behind him and supporting him they set up roundtable groups
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.920]  across the world like the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 in New York to
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.920]  take over our governments using payoffs using sex operatives and more they found
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.680]  quickly that if you tried to set somebody up or blackmail them over
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.960]  cheating on their wife it wouldn't work but if you could induce them to have
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.440]  sex with an underage person or a child you had them by the short hairs for the
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.200]  rest of their lives Epstein could have faced life in prison but only ended up
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:34.920]  with 13 months behind bars do we know why he got such a favorable deal well he
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.440]  was very politically connected he has some of his closest friends were world
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.480]  leaders ex-presidents royalty actors actresses people in philanthropy
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:53.120]  philanthropy and business he used those connections as well as his financial
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.360]  means to hire some of the best attorneys in the country Jeffrey Epstein was
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:04.720]  recruited by these systems in New York City more than 30 years ago to begin
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.640]  recruiting little girls as a pimp on the industrial scale he reportedly had
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.320]  recruited hundreds and hundreds and hundreds a year that's thousands over
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:19.480]  the years to go out and then set up other people and bring them under his
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.360]  control Epstein owns a sprawling ranch in the state complete with airplane
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  hangar and landing strip where the Attorney General says some of the
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.440]  abuse took place this is a very large residence in a very isolated part of
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.560]  New Mexico there was clearly a cover-up by the FBI at the highest levels because
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.520]  again he was going out on a mass scale on an industrial scale recruiting
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:50.840]  sometimes hundreds of young women and girls a month to frame people to dial
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.320]  them in to compromise them and that's just phase one he has been doing
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.000]  construction on Great St. James up until very very recently we're told that this
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  white shed was built only a few months ago the work being done right up until
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.280]  his arrest bringing new attention to this tropical hideaway and raising new
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.680]  questions about what may have happened here then as people get deeper into the
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.400]  cult they start getting them into religious rituals they become more and
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:27.000]  more dark more and more satanic then the children get younger and through that
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.320]  process it's based in trauma-based mind control of the children and the adults
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:38.120]  the cult finds out who is truly twisted and dark and who will carry out certain
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.120]  operations no matter how horrible
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.880]  all right Trump's getting ready to take action against big tech still all on the

[01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:00.480]  anger I could feel their despair because they know the time is short and they
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:07.360]  know that they will fail in the end and be cast to that black hole from which
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:16.600]  they came shadows taller than our souls measurement doesn't add up
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:27.880]  Adam's own let's get into it right now and get serious there's not just my
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:33.600]  broadcast that's here weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. is also the day-to-night show
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:40.240]  8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and we kick off and then of course the war room with Owen
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.120]  Sawyer and these are really informative shows Owen's is fast-moving a lot of
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:50.280]  gas a lot of clips David's is a very cerebral I mean Owen's is a lot of
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.800]  smart stuff too they're just great broadcasts and we've got new shows that
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:03.240]  are about to be appearing in around September 1st so there you go dates
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.920]  and lawsuits and around that time against the globalists as well we've got a
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.440]  lot of things that we've been lining up preparing we got to get the money in to
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:14.360]  do all this and you've really been helping out folks with your purchases of
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.480]  the products because you hear the you hear the network sponsors and you hear
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.520]  the radio station sponsors it's important to support them particularly local
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.840]  sponsors of radio stations and stations themselves but when it comes to
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:34.920]  supporting us our funding is info wars store.com now we've gotten some
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:40.920]  partners three or four that are big-name high-quality product lines who wanted to
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:47.040]  be sponsors during this last year under our attack and I said let's just have
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.920]  our cake and eat it too. Let's create private labels of your already best
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.120]  selling products build whole new sites that you have whole new systems so you
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.520]  get all the benefit of being our sponsor but none of the problems and that's been
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.640]  done and I've been so busy that we've got three of those built a couple more
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.120]  ready to go we got so much going on I've been actually too ambitious because
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.240]  it's just we got a lot of a lot of ships to take a naval battle allegory or
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:23.400]  analogy or parallel or parable or comparison but you get the point we got
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.000]  a bunch of ships we built we got a crew of them we got a launch and we got to do
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.720]  all that so I don't say I've bitten on more than I could chew but we've been
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:37.040]  busy little beavers so in case I get whacked or put in prison or whatever that
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.120]  a lot of stuff is going to continue on because that's really all that matters
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:46.520]  at the end of the day my old hide in this earth suits not worth a nickel but
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.840]  this mission is worth the whole shooting match and more so again in four
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:58.000]  store.com in four years live.com or triple eight two five three three one three
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.480]  nine and we've got a lot of best-selling you know great products they're on the
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:06.160]  site the best air filtration best water filtration best rated great prices on it
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.840]  50% off all the storeable food store-wide free shipping 50-60% off all
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.040]  the supplements that's as good a deal as we ever do the last time we did that was
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:21.000]  last Christmas and we've got double Patriot points all that and we've just
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  got the money in to launch some of these covert programs that you'll see and
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.560]  you'll hear about and will have a huge effect but you'll never see us take
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:37.960]  credit for and again that's an example I didn't have law firms and top lawyers
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:43.360]  write up reports for the president in in in two of the three cases these famous
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.160]  lawyers would not put their names on it they're so scared because I'll kill you
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.120]  for this I mean they come out your family you name it I mean they've been
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.600]  intimidated all the Trump supporters so I knew hey none of these lawyers are
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.520]  gonna come to him there's no lobby for free speech there's just a lobby for the
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.000]  globalist and big tech to take over they've already moved to China so I said
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  I went to like five law firms two wouldn't even do it I had relationships
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.800]  or some of these others and they got together and they wrote briefs to the
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.720]  president and we got him delivered to him and we posted some of them to the
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.720]  site that that's another reason you know I say I'm gonna get up here on air and
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.800]  I'm gonna cover all this and I'm not mad at the crew but this all hit me 10
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.040]  months for the show that Trump's going after big tech he's announced he is the
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.120]  executive orders are imminent the globalists are scared and then I'm trying
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.960]  to think okay let me pull together all we've done and present it to you but I'm
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.400]  busy on air so have to be later because I gotta go during the break and not just
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.920]  write notes I gotta go find the articles and and and some of the public
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.160]  messages we sent to the president to just show you I'm a lot of you will
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:56.600]  remember that but I guess there was no success which is okay I'll find it of the
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.800]  emergency messages to the president
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.600]  Trump battle plans to take on big tech released you know that was some of the
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.160]  headlines because again this is a big job you know just one lobbyist would
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.000]  spend all their time say fighting for big tech against us hundreds of millions
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.920]  of dollars so I'll I'll get it because again I'm not building this up and
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.880]  building this up and maybe I should just do it tomorrow because I'm gonna I'm
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.440]  gonna need some time to go because I paid the law firms and I I get me Tim
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.160]  Frosier he's got to get my email and I'll just go from the law firm stuff we
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.280]  said the president if we can't find it on doors get me Tim Frosier over here
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.760]  because I'm not I'm not even throwing a fit right now it's not anybody's fault
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.000]  these are published things the president was given but 30 year ago that's like
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.440]  85 trillion years ago and then I've got to come up with the exact headline to
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.480]  punch it in because I'm blocked on Google or you don't even get it but
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.520]  regardless I have a tendency to get OCD about little factoids and things and
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:08.040]  show you and go over the points that were in that because I specifically need
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.040]  to show you what the law firm sent so that when you see it come out on the
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.040]  news and the president do it you understand how real Trump is and how
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:23.240]  real lobbying by the people is what he listens to that's why that's so key so
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.960]  I'll call Tim because he needs to get my email and I need yeah I'll have to talk
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.160]  to him during the break I'll handle it myself I'll get out of my email that's
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:36.760]  what I do it so this is this is big medicine folks this is big stuff going
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.960]  on this is important and just a symbol every writer I've got I'll give them
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.800]  basic headlines to pull me to stuff just they can assemble them right there
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.600]  during the break I'll get it so again nobody's fault you can get ready for
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.880]  weeks for a little speech you give I'm here trying to assemble the fact that
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.440]  we've gotten the key in to all the president and so everybody can know
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.360]  the debate that's going on and what's happening internally or maybe I should
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.800]  just get into what everybody told me that's been meeting with the president
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.200]  you know that's really important too maybe I should talk about India and
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.160]  Kashmir or maybe I should talk about how the Boy Scouts of America is a giant
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.520]  pedophile called how it's all admitted now maybe I should get into how Antifa
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.400]  saying they're gonna come to your house and kill you I mean there is a lot here
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.960]  to cover ladies and gentlemen maybe I should go to rebroadcast for the rest
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.960]  of the day so that while I still have energy I can get this prepared and I can
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.240]  give you a real presentation because again I'm not just here telling you oh
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.200]  we're giving you the inside scoop on what Trump's planning to do with big tech
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.960]  it's not been decided yet and we need to explain what the president needs to do
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.720]  instead of them sabotaging it and it's kind of snuck up on us because now
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.160]  Trump's about to execute he's the executive and we need to be in battle
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:53.560]  mode getting the right advisement points out again to the president so that when
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.680]  they're sitting there trying to deceive him we have point-by-point reactions to
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:04.040]  each point so maybe I should just go off air run rerod rebroadcast focus for a
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.080]  few hours shoot a 10-minute report I get directly to the president again that
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.280]  actually lays this out so we change history and defeat the globalist see how
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.920]  that works because for all the king's horses and all the king's men I can get
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.720]  reports the president but I can't get them back in my hand again so we're
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:28.360]  gonna do all of this coming up today and and and I'm gonna really really really
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.400]  really really really really because I'm in brainstorming mode right now and I'm
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.520]  and I'm going to lay it all out but I'm writing all these notes from memory I'm
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.920]  like why don't I just get the reports we got to the president and that's the
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:45.180]  answer so I'm gonna try my darned this during the break to do that and when as
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:51.080]  soon as I'm ready I'll try to give this report but we're definitely powering up
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.760]  here stay with us

[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.720]  other thing that's unique about infowars is it isn't the only network of this
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.720]  reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.280]  not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.160]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school American
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.800]  1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.160]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.080]  country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.240]  this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.640]  live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.280]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.800]  it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the infowars audience
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.880]  has broken through that they are the bridge from the of founding to the
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.120]  modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.360]  an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.560]  libel targeting you
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:26.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:36.120]  in Los Angeles
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.800]  Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns Mao took the guns that El Castro
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:47.640]  took the guns you go saw this took the guns 1776 will commence again if you
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:53.560]  try to take our firearms the Republic will rise again when you attempt to take
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:21:06.120]  our guns
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.620]  the answer to ready to take on the new world order.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.120]  Can you imagine?
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.120]  Imagine grabbing a sword right in the glove.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:26.120]  Give me some more.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.120]  High on life, baby.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.120]  That's all about it.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.120]  Alright, here's what happened today.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:37.120]  I saw another key point to take down the globalist.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.120]  And we've done that with 9-11.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.120]  Exposing that as a globalist operation.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120]  And I knew it with Trump and I had that feeling.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.120]  And I just had, it doesn't happen very often.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.120]  But when I, the problem is I have an epiphany.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.120]  And the epiphanies are so big.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.120]  And there's so many angles and fractals and information to it
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:03.120]  from my brain that explodes with all the thousands of data points.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.120]  And then I overload like a race car and blow my engine.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.120]  So I'm not building up all day that I'm going to tell you what Trump's planning to do.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.120]  Literally, I can feel the energy that this is being decided right now.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:18.120]  And it's so pivotal to the future of humanity.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:23.120]  And there's so many angles to it that it's not even a form of choking.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.120]  It's kind of like false starting in a race.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:29.120]  So I'm sorry the crew that I'm running around like a Tasmanian devil during the break.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.120]  I'm doing it on air.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:38.120]  And I just, there's a total global crossroads right now.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.120]  Not just with big tech, it's everything.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.120]  There might be a nuclear war today or something.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.120]  I don't know, man.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.120]  The energy level is just off the charts.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:50.120]  I don't think I've ever felt this much energy on the planet before.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.120]  I don't want to get all new agey.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.120]  I think everybody can feel it right now, folks.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.120]  I mean, this is explosive.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.120]  And something big is going on.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.120]  I tell you, that's it.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.120]  It's not even this tech thing.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.120]  I don't know if I can do a show anymore.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.120]  And then you see the left.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.120]  All they've got is division.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.120]  All they've got is a turn us against each other.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.120]  All they've got is this racism, white supremism crap.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.120]  When I have a whole news report, in fact, that's what we'll play.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.120]  Where there's modern slavery in Africa.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.120]  And I know I've harped on this and harped on this and harped on this,
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:26.120]  but it's the West that ended slavery, empowered women,
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.120]  and didn't kill homosexuals.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:35.120]  I won't use the term gay because they order me to.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120]  Oh, don't use mother and father now.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.120]  Oh, go get one.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]  Any other words?
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.120]  Yeah, don't say American flag.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.120]  And what's the newest thing?
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:47.120]  They're saying when we call the left clowns, that clowns is a white supremist.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:52.120]  So they're banging the word clown and honk, honk on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120]  Oh, yeah, you want to get banned?
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.120]  Just say Hong Kong.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.120]  When someone's acting like a clown.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.120]  You see, they're insane.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:10.120]  And they're psychically trying to push their insanity on us when Castro says men can have abortions.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:14.120]  We need to pay for men's abortions.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.120]  Well, obviously, if you're a biological woman that says she's a man,
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.120]  you get pregnant, happens all the time with these lunatics,
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.120]  you can then have an abortion.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.120]  But he just, it's all about what?
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120]  Men have abortions.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.120]  It's all about assaulting our minds.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.120]  And I will not have their spirit dominate me.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.120]  I will not be broken by them.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.120]  And the truth is, we're breaking them right now.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:43.120]  And I'm high as a kite right now.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.120]  I am.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.120]  I walked in this morning and Pat Riley worked.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.120]  So he goes, what?
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.120]  What are you?
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.120]  What's going on with you?
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.120]  So what do you mean?
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120]  He goes, look, you're here to kill somebody.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.120]  What's consciousness?
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.120]  Man, I don't know.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.120]  I feel the energy today.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.120]  And then it was just like, I don't know, man.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.120]  I tell you, everybody knows this too.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120]  Like mice and stuff know before there's a big earthquake.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]  That is going to be a big earthquake or something.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.120]  I just, we show up the phones up and ask folks if they can feel all this energy.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.120]  I'm sure people do.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.120]  You know, sometimes you'll be like in your house,
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.120]  your wife and the kids are all acting crazy and she's acting crazy and you're acting crazy.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120]  You go, what's going on?
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120]  You walk outside.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.120]  There's a giant full moon and then a buck runs right in front of your yard,
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.120]  right out into traffic and a car hits it.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.120]  You're just like, yeah, the universe is crazy.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.120]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.120]  It's like, it's that electricity that everybody feels, everybody sees.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:33.120]  And then I get OCD about, well, I can just have that one of those legal reports.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.120]  We sent the president and I can just go off that with the top advisement of what he should do.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:44.120]  And instead, I just kind of go off the rails about it, but I'm going to stop now.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:53.120]  I'm going to stop now and I'm going to come back and I'm going to be a good boy.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  And I'm going in the next segment to cover what they're telling the president
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.120]  and what he's looking to do and what the different pieces are
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.120]  and what the different angles are and how big,
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.120]  I mean, he'll lose 2020 if he doesn't do this.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.120]  I think that's why we're all bouncing off the walls.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.120]  And the cashmere situation, we're on the edge of World War Four.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.120]  The Democrats are trying to cause a civil war
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.120]  and they're pulling all sorts of stops out to have that happen.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:29.120]  And I just sense and I see that humanity's not buying it.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  No one I know, no matter what color they are, buys this crap anymore.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.120]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.120]  The globalists are going to go crazy and they're going to start a war.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.120]  They're going to do something bad to try to turn the chessboard over
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  and make us submit to them.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:50.120]  And that's what this is all about is being dominated by these powerless,
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.120]  pathetic globalists that don't have any inherent power or spark.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.120]  And that's why they're always seeking power.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.120]  And then those of us who already have inherent power from the universe, from God,
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120]  never seek power because we already have it,
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.120]  but we only rise up when they're trying to enslave us.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.120]  And that's always explosive.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120]  Yeah, there's Salon.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.120]  Yes, Democrats need a civil war, believe it or not,
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.120]  it's the only real path back to power.
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.120]  And if you go, that's Salon right now, that's the mouth of the globalist.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.120]  And if you go into all the Netflix shows,
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  there's like two new Netflix shows about kidnapping and killing white people
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  because they're Trump supporters, but whites are doing it.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.120]  It's like the whites are going, oh, minorities, will you start killing white people with me?
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.120]  I mean, how criminal are these people?
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.120]  And then both these guys, I've gone and looked at their records.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.120]  They're both antifa.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120]  Both of them.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.120]  I mean, I took one look at both of them on that Saturday and I called up crew and I said,
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.120]  they're background families that are psychologists working for the Pentagon and some psych warfare
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  and devil worshipers.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.120]  And by the way, they're trying to cover it up with El Paso guy, same MO.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.120]  They did it to blame the right wingers.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.120]  It's so obvious.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.120]  And they just activate demonically.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.120]  There's no need for mind control.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.120]  It's spiritual.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.120]  They just do it.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.120]  They just go out.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.120]  You take one look at these dudes and you say, that's a creep.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.120]  That's somebody that knows they're never going to get a woman, never going to have children.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120]  They're ending.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120]  And that's fine.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120]  People don't want to have kids.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.120]  I think this is this particular type.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.120]  And they're going to take some people with them because they're devils.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.120]  And what's the devil want to do?
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:35.120]  The devil wants to take you down with him.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120]  Well, guess what?
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:40.120]  You found the right guy then because I'm Captain Ahab and Moby Dick, baby.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.120]  I'm coming after your ass.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120]  And we're going to see what happens in the end.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.120]  So I asked, who's with me?
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.120]  I'm not going to nail that gold piece to the mast.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  I'm just here to tell you.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:57.120]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away from this because they can feel the energy.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.120]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.120]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.120]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.120]  I can help you too.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.120]  No taxes you can't pay. Don't wait another day.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.120]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:45.120]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:30:02.120]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana,
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:06.120]  if you want to bet on not being run by the Chi Coms with Senate and House hearings now
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:11.120]  on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.120]  It's all coming out.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.120]  Democrats aren't going to stop.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.120]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.120]  Like we're starting to get some purchase.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.120]  Trying to start a fire?
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.120]  They got some fire going.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.120]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ICE facilities getting attacked,
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.120]  dead people everywhere. It's on, folks.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.120]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.120]  So now, more than you've ever done for yourself, for me, for everybody.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.120]  Spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.120]  Tell folks about infoworks.com.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:40.120]  But that said, I want to fight hard and I need you to buy the products at infoworksstore.com.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:44.120]  Huge sale, the one-year anniversary, banning sale, the banniversary sale.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.120]  Fifty-sixty percent off, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:50.120]  Get all the great products you need and know you are funding.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:55.120]  Not just the Second American Revolution, but a pro-human future against the devil-worshipping,
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.120]  Satanist, and their off-world controllers.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.120]  Alex.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.120]  Yes.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.120]  I got a plug for the Patriot points.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.120]  Oh, thanks.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:05.120]  I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.120]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.120]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.120]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120]  And I'm getting quality products.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.120]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.120]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me. I've lost weight.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.120]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:29.120]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.120]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.120]  I want a good price.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.120]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:40.120]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.120]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.120]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:48.120]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.120]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:57.120]  And then you do something like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay.
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.120]  Thanks for the support.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:04.120]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:08.120]  And so it used to, it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still loved our country
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.120]  and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.120]  But now they're trying to take it out of schools.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.120]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:21.120]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.120]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:29.120]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:34.120]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:41.120]  And particularly when it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.120]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face,
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.120]  all over not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever,
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:33:05.120]  the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.120]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.120]  Where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit,
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:59.120]  you now have senses and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and selecting your submachine.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.120]  How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.120]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.120]  They will be held accountable.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:14.120]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.120]  I know why you did it.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.120]  I know you were afraid. Who would you be?
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.120]  War, terror, disease?
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:28.120]  There were a myriad of problems which inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.120]  Fear got the best of you.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.120]  And in your panic, you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.120]  He promised you order. He promised you peace.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:47.120]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.120]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.120]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.120]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:03.120]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.120]  We have the globalists. They strangle hope.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.120]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:16.120]  Come again now, baby, like a darkened dream.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.120]  Tell us, meet by the plan, but now, baby, I'd like to touch the sea.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:29.120]  Now, I've been smoking for so long, you know I'm here to save.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:41.120]  I got you in a strangle, oh, baby, you're bestie out of the way.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.120]  It was Thursday, August 8, 2019, Global Transmission.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:54.120]  Now, I will stop pontificating and get into my report to the American people,
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:04.120]  to the President, my report to anyone that is concerned about the fate of humanity.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120]  You guys can do a Dr. McCam shut on this, please.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:12.120]  This is one of the three reports that I know were hand-delivered into the President of the United States,
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:19.120]  hand, along with appendix.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.120]  Now, we also published this.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:26.120]  You see this right here? Federal action.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.120]  You see that?
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.120]  You see when this report was sent to the President?
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.120]  About a month after my de-platforming.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.120]  There were other reports sent before it, but we didn't send a report as draconian as this one
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.120]  until we were confirmed that the de-platforming came.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.120]  The previous reports warned that the de-platforming was coming, a Chinese social score,
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.120]  and laid out how it would operate and how the President would lose the election.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120]  You think he paid attention when it all came through?
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.120]  Yeah, I think he did.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:07.120]  So, the reason this is important is they are currently meeting the President himself up to two hours a day on this.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.120]  We've got a lot of other important things going on.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:15.120]  Proxy wars, trade wars, the border collapse, the attempt for the private Federal Reserve to derail the economy.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:22.120]  I mean, he's like an octopus. He's got so many arms. That's good.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.120]  Like the joke of a mom that has like six kids and she's just juggling it all.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.120]  Well, Trump's got that to the next level.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:34.120]  And so, people see the President say things like, hey, we need millions of people here. Just come legal.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:40.120]  Well, we do need millions of people that have good records and are coming here.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.120]  Just not illegally.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:47.120]  I mean, because the media has the rhetoric that he hates all immigrants when he doesn't and never did,
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.120]  and they're trying to create hate and division.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.120]  He says, no, we love immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.120]  Just like Ellis Island, you've got to get vetted.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.120]  And some of the right wing actually goes, oh my God, he's going back on promises.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:00.120]  Well, I guess you really don't like immigrants.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.120]  We've got a lot of people here that weren't born in this country that do a good job.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.120]  They're not criminals. They came illegally.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:12.120]  Oh, yes. They was going, oh, look, Trump's got his own hotels and golf courses,
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.120]  and a lot of people are staffed with workers that come in six months out of the year.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.120]  Well, yeah, and they're good workers and they're hard workers,
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.120]  and then they rotate out to the other part of the world and they come back.
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.120]  That's the lifestyle they like. They're saving money.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:31.120]  They're from Eastern Europe. They're from Africa. They're from Latin America. They're from everywhere.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.120]  Trump's never been a hypocrite about any of this.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.120]  But I digress.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:40.120]  They say, oh, Trump's saying he wants background checks.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.120]  That's always been his weakness. He's not a gun owner.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:47.120]  His sons are, dad, you're wrong. He gets like, you just get one of those without the background?
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.120]  He doesn't, no, no, no, no, sir, can grandpa give their grandson a rival?
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.120]  Oh, of course. Oh, and then he'll, then he'll be against it.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:59.120]  He just, he's not a gun guy. He's a golf guy.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:02.120]  He grew up in New York City, folks.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:06.120]  But that part doesn't matter. None of that's going to happen.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.120]  Because the NRA's warned him.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:13.120]  And when the rubber meets the road, I've talked to folks that have met with the president that are NRA board members,
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.120]  not just Ted Nugent.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.120]  And Trump knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:23.120]  And they know his trick now, so I can let you know.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.120]  But he just says, oh, sure, we'll do whatever you want if we can get it passed.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:31.120]  What do you want? Ban all guns. They're done right then.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.120]  But there's redreport.com. Top link.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:39.120]  Red flag. NRA warns Trump.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.120]  Because the red flag is for the due process.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:49.120]  That's an Orwellian term.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  But on this internet thing,
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.120]  Trump is being told
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:03.120]  that if he goes after big tech, it'll plunge the economy.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.120]  And you notice that when he went after China,
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:11.120]  big tech is what brought the stock market down to 950 points.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  Well, they just did that to themselves to CC.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.120]  Because he really cares about the economy.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.120]  He really wants you to be successful.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.120]  He really wants to be the guy that turned America around.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120]  Why wouldn't you want to be?
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:26.120]  You want to be a Liakoka on 20 levels bigger.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:33.120]  Here's the thing, the Trump name either succeeds or it will become like mud.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:38.120]  The CIA FBI guy that says he wants to kill Trump turns out his great-great-great-great-great grandfather
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:46.120]  was the surgeon doctor that was the only other person convicted of the assassination of Lincoln.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.120]  History doesn't just rhyme, folks, it repeats.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:52.540]  And let's hope they're unsuccessful.
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:57.480]  But Trump's name will be mud.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:05.320]  And so just during the break, I got one of the reports I wanted because, again, I wasn't
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.960]  intending to come in and do this today, and then it clicked.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.600]  Wow, they're having this big debate, they're having this big fight.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.600]  So a lot of times I do a message to the president, I get a pair prepared for like three or four
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.760]  hours, try to be quick and succinct, and then I really focus, and it's successful because
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:25.800]  I put the right energy into it, I pray about it, I commit to it, and that's why for over
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:32.440]  an hour and a half now, I've been spinning wheels here because I'm doing research during
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.360]  breaks trying to get it just right.
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.160]  Because this isn't like a golf game where you're trying to drive it all the way down
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.080]  the field, or you're going to lose $100.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.880]  If Trump doesn't make the right decision on big tech and doesn't behave in a strong manner
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:51.320]  and doesn't really cut the head off the snake, we can see into the futures that are coming
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:52.600]  and it's going to be very, very bad.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.080]  This is the clear move that needs to happen, and there's clear things that need to be executed.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:06.040]  And again, we've been instrumental because no one else would do it.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.960]  It's like there's a big ruby up in the big idol's head, like out of some Robert E. Howard
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.800]  Conan book.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.960]  Like you're going to the temple and go and get the ruby because it's abandoned, except
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.080]  booby traps get you when you go do it.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.360]  So what I did is not that special.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.960]  I just toddled in, though, and look, here's the thing, we got the ruby, folks.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:31.760]  I got a few carry darts in me and I'm kind of limping along, I might not make it, but
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.000]  we got out of the temple, we've got the ruby.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.840]  The question is, what do we do with the ruby now?
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:38.840]  Think about that.

[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.760]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.960]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.400]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.400]  over two decades.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:12.800]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.080]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.360]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.360]  to their course of conduct.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.240]  Otherwise, they will never change and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.160]  to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.600]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:37.760]  The Infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.480]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480]  free press.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.920]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:49.960]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:52.920]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.720]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.760]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.

[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:30.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:39.400]  In that great film gladiator, Russell Crowe asked, are you not entertained?
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:48.400]  But I ask you now, are you not on the fire, fire of liberty?
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.400]  Woo!
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.640]  Let me tell you, big stuff's happening across the world.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:59.680]  Major decisions are being made, but my gut tells me that humanity has made critical decisions
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:05.040]  into the future that prove what the Bible told us about victory against Satan and the
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.040]  devil.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:09.720]  And we knew it was foretold, we knew it was going to happen, but it's happening.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:14.220]  Doesn't mean a bunch of bad stuff is not going to happen in between then, but I can literally
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:21.840]  feel the interdimensional historic chain electrifying into the future, and I just feel the tumblers
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.200]  clicking into place of humanity's survival.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:32.760]  At a fundamental, intergalactic, spiritual level, multidimensional, I just really feel
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.000]  good today.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.240]  Massive things are happening.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:42.560]  And a lot of bad stuff's happening too, but I've learned to go with my gut, it's never
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.240]  wrong, and it's my North Star, my connection to God, and it's massive.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.360]  Let me get into it right now.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.200]  Here is the report.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:49:01.520]  Back in August and before that July of last year, I sent, as I told you, three reports
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:10.040]  put together by law firms with different strategies and stratagems to stop Big Tech from their
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.760]  clear, uh, plan to the platform, everyone, that they were obviously warming up and getting
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.760]  ready.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:21.000]  And I wanted Trump to be advised on what was coming and what was going to happen so that
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.760]  he would pay particular attention to the next reports I sent him, which I've done, both
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.680]  publicly and privately.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:37.200]  But here's the article, exclusive Trump planning, multi-pronged response to tech censorship
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:43.240]  of conservatives, but then we knew that he was looking at our previous reports and hoping
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:50.800]  he would take action, and you can read those reports that law firms sent him.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.160]  And I also asked Mike Adams, because he was so smart when I was interviewing him and talking
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.760]  to him, and he's a programmer and engineer, and I said, well, you please write a detailed
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760]  report.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.040]  He wrote an even bigger report that I know got on the president's desk as well, the
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.800]  censorship master plan decoded.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:10.960]  Now, Trump did make rumblings, he did make statements, he did do an executive order on
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.120]  the university censoring, and they've now been having to back off and let folks have
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.120]  more free speech there.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.720]  So, so that is a good beta test to show it's the right thing to do.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:24.960]  But within that report, you can read one of the law firms reports that we sent to the
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:32.360]  president's social media platforming federal action, and they gave a spectrum of actions
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:41.360]  here that I intended to have some that were the best action, some that the system thought
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:45.680]  they could take control of the process, and so knowing Trump would take action, they would
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:49.040]  give him some things that they thought they could control.
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:53.840]  And sure enough, they're going with the Blue Ribbon Commission to discover if there is
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:59.240]  censorship or discover if the ocean's blue and the sky's blue, and again, birds flying
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:02.960]  in the sky and grass is green, and you know, mommy's milk is delicious when you're a little
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.080]  baby.
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:17.160]  And so now I'll just say that that we specifically put traps in here to then have lesser of two
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:22.120]  evils for the power structure so that they would try to steer Trump into the Blue Ribbon
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.120]  Commission.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:27.040]  We do not want the Blue Ribbon Commission.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:31.840]  But there are immediate actions in here that will devastate Big Tech's criminal activity
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.840]  instantly.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.000]  There's a lot of way to skin a cat, too.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.200]  You can just go after him for espionage, work with the Chai comms right away, and I know
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.520]  Trump's kind of saying, yeah, let's just go after him for that.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:44.440]  I mean, they literally moved to China, helped round up people, moved the code keys, the national
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440]  security over there.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.520]  Obama gave the opposite personnel management, every federal employee, every CIA person,
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.760]  that was given to the Chai comms.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.080]  And notice that's in Senate and House reports this week.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.640]  I mean, we have been so Pearl Harbored, it's like a 10,000 Pearl Harbors.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:05.440]  I mean, what the globalists, the Chai comms did, is just biblical.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:09.680]  But if you read this, Attorney General can direct Acting Assistant Attorney General for
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:16.400]  civil rights, John Gore, Assistant Attorney General for any trust, Mackin to act, and
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.920]  a suit can be based on two grounds.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:25.440]  First on the denial of First Amendment rights, the Supreme Court, it's got all the rulings.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:30.320]  And the foreclosed access to social media altogether is to prevent the users from engaging
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:36.840]  in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment, Packingham v. North Carolina, Democrats opposing
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:41.160]  use of Packingham, a case that goes through all that, Senator Mark Warner's white paper
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.520]  entitled Regulation of Social Media with proposals that would financially ruin the social media
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.360]  companies within release of just a few days.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.960]  This is all the nuclear option.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.960]  We have a huge appendix to them on this.
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:58.800]  But first, social media took steps to platform right of center news sites.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:02.680]  Senator Chris Murphy stated in a tweet that these companies must do more to take down
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:03.680]  the website.
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:07.400]  Survival of democracy depends on what that shows us, political direction and election
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.400]  meddling.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:09.400]  So that's criminal.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.600]  As Trump said, what Twitter is doing is criminal.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:19.800]  Senator Ron Wyden announced August 22, 2018 in an interview with Cara Swisher of Recode
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:23.240]  that there should be consequences for social media platforms that do not.
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:29.280]  So that's the Democrats threatening consequences, so that means Trump is not coming into the
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.280]  vacuum.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:34.880]  He's leaving them to threaten and control and censor going, oh, we don't control what
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.800]  social media does, but you let the Democrats and the chai comms come into the vacuum and
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:39.800]  do that.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:45.680]  And then they go through different things they can do with actions on the Sherman anti-trust
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:48.520]  act, section two, and the real teeth of all that.
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:51.920]  And then a presidential commission, the president didn't want to do this one, but we don't want
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.920]  the commission.
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:57.240]  It's an immediate action because the commission just sets up a bunch of potentates who will
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.400]  then try to rule over the carving up of it, and there'll be limited agreements by big
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.400]  tech, which they always violate.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.520]  I mean, they lie right to Trump's face, which is what really angers him.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:13.360]  So let's get back to the actual notes from all my sources and the White House, what's
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.600]  going on.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.600]  Clearly opening up an anti-trust investigation, which has been opened up, that was announced
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.880]  a month ago, is a good move.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.920]  But you've got to accelerate that.
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:28.320]  They're also going to tell Trump that, oh, you're hurting the economy by doing this,
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.200]  but there's no election, there's no future America.
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:36.040]  They won't even let Trump deal in a trade war with China if he is in office.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:43.920]  So the real threat is not having the new launch of America, instead this globalist plan is
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:47.160]  amethetical to our very existence, so you can't even allow that.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.960]  So all these claims are just terrorism.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.400]  Do what I say or I'm going to kill the hostage.
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.960]  Well you're going to kill the hostage anyways, so we need to step up and say no and use the
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.720]  president's bully pulpit against all this propaganda to tell them you're not going to
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:04.480]  do this and we're not going to go along with it, we're going to hold you responsible.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:10.560]  They don't respect the president, they think he has inaction, they've engaged in so many
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:17.840]  lies to Congress, so much perjury, so much censorship, and they've been caught so much,
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:23.240]  they think the president is weak.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:28.800]  Now here's really why Trump doesn't know what to do, because big tech was really set up
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:34.880]  by DARPA and was set up by US intelligence, but it was set up then to have heads of it
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:39.360]  like chief science officer or the globalist Bill Gates, where they would follow through
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.280]  with a plan and invest the money where they were told to and they weren't really these
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:50.440]  big rich people you heard, they were just the functional heads of this into the future.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:55.160]  That of course was betrayed, it was always a set up, the globalists, the Obama bots,
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:00.320]  the Bush bots, the Clinton bots, they're all the heads of these companies, they've all
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:06.600]  made tens of millions of dollars on average and they've used it to spy and oppress and
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:11.160]  do all of this, so they totally betrayed that and of course they would betray power like
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:14.320]  that is always abuse to the hilt.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:20.440]  And so Trump is trying to understand all these stay behind networks and how most of these
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:27.880]  agencies and most of these groups are basically private officers of an NSA system that dwarfs
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:33.560]  the NSA where they trick us to opt into it and Trump's being told, sir, it's an AI war
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:37.760]  in the future, it's how we defeat China and others, is that we built this infrastructure,
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:40.120]  it looked like it was private, everyone adopted it.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:43.960]  If you come out and take it over and admit all this, our enemies will know, the enemies
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:45.560]  already know all that.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:52.960]  They already know that Apple and Google think we're so weak that as soon as you got elected
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:58.000]  they officially announced they moved to China for tax exemption and have given again the
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.520]  entire infrastructure to them as a checkmate against you to say, look, bitch, we got all
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:05.520]  your codes.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:11.320]  Good, we'll take all those executives that did this and you know what's going to happen
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:12.320]  to them.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.440]  There's not time for Blue Ribbon Commissions, there's not time to play games.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:21.600]  We've let an authoritarian regime that's killed 115 million people, get all the codes to everything,
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:22.600]  okay?
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.600]  We let somebody worse than Hitler in control.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:30.880]  So you can't play patty cake, it's arrogant and doesn't respect us because it's got its
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.240]  arm up our ass.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:34.240]  It's going to be painful.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:39.400]  You got to pull the arm out because it's going to jerk our guts out if we don't.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.840]  It's embarrassing too to have China's arm up our ass, but it's got to come out.
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.760]  I'm sorry to be gross, that's what's happening.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.200]  Last night I'm on infowars.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:58.840]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, a Betsy Ross but also another just classic
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:04.920]  American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden Snake superimposed over it and on the back,
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.920]  America's back infowars.com.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:09.800]  But what's better than just an American flag about a don't tread on me under the flag,
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:12.080]  say don't tread on the American flag, it's a perfect combo.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.080]  So great minds think alike.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:16.880]  I mean whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar design.
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:22.160]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:26.920]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt, but it's a battle tattered flag like the one that flew
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:27.920]  over Fort Sumter.
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:35.400]  And again on the back, it says America's back infowars.com, 4,000 of these babies and that's
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.400]  it.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:40.600]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowars.com, be
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.760]  imprinted in the USA right now infowars.com, we'll be right back, the most banned broadcast
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:48.560]  in the world.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:55.280]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:01.320]  heritage, together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:02.320]  America.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:08.240]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.640]  know is right and what they know is true.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:19.040]  As long as we stay true to our cause, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:26.320]  as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:53.880]  can not do.
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:15.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.840]  So our open society got infiltrated, we got taken over, but in the eleventh hour, the
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.880]  instincts kicked in, we elected Trump and now the fight's on.
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:31.080]  And I don't use gross analogies to be crude or rude.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:35.480]  The truth is, the globalist are, they got their arm down our throat with their heart
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:41.760]  in their hand, and they're trying to squeeze it, and we got to get it out.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:48.920]  It's going to hurt worse if we let them keep going, that's simple.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:55.040]  So Trump can use antitrust, that's a good thing to do, but it takes too long.
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:00.920]  The better way to skin the cat is to go after Google and Apple for espionage and violating
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.800]  privacy rights and national security violation.
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:08.160]  And just being honest, saying, hey, there were agreements, these were U.S. government
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:14.080]  agency partnerships, they betrayed it, yes, we had it hooked into the NSA to find out
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:17.160]  if there were terrorists and things, it was used against you.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:21.080]  We apologize, we're going to stop doing that and we'll have a commission on that.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.960]  That's what we have the commission on.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:29.000]  And then bold actions, bold attacks means bold response.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:37.120]  Arrest Tim Cook, arrest Sundar Pichai, arrest Eric Schmidt.
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:40.480]  These people are criminals.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:46.480]  They literally sided with somebody that killed five times with Hitler did, and they prance
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.280]  around all day with propaganda trying to teach young boys to castrate it when they're three
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:53.280]  years old.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.280]  Screw these people.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:59.080]  And by the way, they're all murdering people worth $100 billion.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  Like Eric Schmidt.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:06.160]  You're like, my God, Eric Schmidt can kill you, do it then.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:09.160]  Somebody's got to tell the truth, somebody's got to not back down.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:11.480]  It's not because I have some death wish.
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:15.760]  I'm not going to sit here two years ago and read about, oh, it's so liberal, they're
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:21.160]  handing out condoms to the Boy Scouts of their world jamboree and encouraging everyone to
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.840]  have gay sex.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:36.280]  Everything that goes on, everything that happens used to demoralize us and collapse us.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.040]  And now a few years later, Boy Scouts have a pedophile epidemic and are hiding hundreds
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:44.840]  in its ranks, MSM, hundreds in its ranks.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.520]  It's not the Catholic church that's bad.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.960]  It's not the Boy Scouts that are bad.
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.800]  It's not Penn State that's bad.
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:58.720]  This is a cult that gets a few people in positions of power that then recruits people and gets
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:06.760]  them corrupted and then tells them, hey, you defiled children, it's how you join the club.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:13.240]  It's a satanic initiation to satanic ritual.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:18.360]  And I didn't believe it's 25 years ago.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:27.640]  And then I talked to the former heads of Department of Defense branches and heads of FBI offices,
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.000]  and they were all telling, no matter who it was, they all tell the same thing, right?
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.200]  Well, the initiation is sex with children, and then down the road they torture them,
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.080]  and they're like, what?
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:42.480]  And then later you learn it's all true because at 25 years old, I couldn't believe that was
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.480]  going on.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:47.600]  Can you?
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.600]  But it's true.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:56.280]  So just because it's horrible, and just because we aren't into it, that means it's not going
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:57.280]  on.
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.840]  And it is going on.
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:04.120]  So I'm going to hit some other subjects, get some other things.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.920]  I've gone kind of wild today.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:10.760]  It's a big deal that Trump is about to pull the trigger, he needs to pull the trigger
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:17.440]  hard, big tech doesn't respect Trump, they're full of Obama, globalist, check-home operatives,
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.000]  and President Trump has to take action.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.400]  Or they are going to steal the election from him, and they are going to cause massive race
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  riots in this country.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.280]  And the alternative is just, by the way, even if you let the globalists stay in control,
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:31.720]  they're just going to take over faster now and make it worse.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:36.760]  We don't have any choice but total commitment.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  Okay.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:46.400]  So the harshest course, the most vicious course, I mean, the proper response to this
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.440]  is to arrest the entire leadership of big tech, but we know that would be a public relationship
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:51.440]  problem.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.040]  So you know what to do, Mr. President, execute order number 66.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:00.240]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:01.240]  They are technocrats.
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:05.080]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:09.600]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.600]  with AI gods.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.800]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:16.440]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:21.720]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:27.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the forestlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.320]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:37.040]  methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:41.960]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:42.960]  to find anywhere.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:43.960]  It is amazing.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:49.320]  Experience pure methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:06:17.920]  the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:26.320]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:39.040]  Yeah, on my tombstone, as you say, Alex Jones is alive, alive in my actions, alive in my
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:46.880]  energy, alive in the universe, not subserving myself to satanic forces, but exploding with
[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:49.640]  energy and life force.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:54.040]  And I know you feel the same way and I salute you.
[02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:58.640]  You know, I didn't try to pontificate.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:02.360]  Somebody could spend a year trying to write a report to the president.
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:05.840]  Somebody could sit there and think about what action should be taken.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:06.840]  I just know this.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:10.080]  We have drastic tyranny going on.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:13.160]  We have incredible corruption unfolding.
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:18.400]  We have amazing pissing in the face of the American people, where the American flag's
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:23.440]  bad and Christians are bad and white people are inherently evil.
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:30.080]  This super venomous Hollywood crap, and it's all funded by the globalist and the chai comms,
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:34.480]  and there's Senate reports now going, we've seen a tenfold increase in Chinese government
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:39.040]  funding of propaganda that's undermining and demoralizing American people and attempting
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.640]  to create cultural crises.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:46.160]  That means race war, and we're just supposed to sit there and go, oh, well, we're an open
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:51.320]  free society, we don't arrest the heads of big tech or anything, because that'd be a
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:52.320]  police state.
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:57.680]  No, a police state's letting the chai comms sit here and run our country, and I've gotten
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.400]  to enjoy the stuff they do.
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:03.840]  I've gotten to enjoy the death threats and the being followed and the lies and the dirty
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:08.840]  tricks and all their billions of money just poured in to destroy me.
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:15.080]  Oh, but we're a free country, we're American, so we're not going to do anything to them,
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:22.200]  oh, no, we're going to sit there and take it, because we don't fight like that.
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:25.480]  And they get up there on TV and they say, it's time to be dirty, it's time to go off
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.520]  to their families, it's time to, that's what they say, oh, you know what, I don't want
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:35.680]  to fight dirty, I want to fight, and you know, if I was a guy that had made whatever his
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:39.400]  sundars only got like $10 million, I think I looked him up, he's just a little front
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:44.800]  guy for Schmidt, he's worth like, you know, $60 billion or whatever, you know, if I was
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:50.640]  set up by the NSA to build this giant thing to supposedly predict the future and to supposedly
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:56.760]  have good stimuli to the public and use the power of humans that can create, stimulate
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:03.280]  us with positivity to build a next world system, that's the lie they told people, because all
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.360]  the nice folks at DARPA are like, we want to build the next human level and go off world
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:11.760]  and find life extension for everyone, well, that's good, we're going to neural network
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:16.040]  all humans together with an AI computer with machine learning, we're going to build this
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.720]  utopia, but you weren't planning that, you're building a system of a post human world because
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:23.440]  you're greedy demons.
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:28.720]  And then if they signed up with the chai comms that have killed 100 to 15 million people,
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:36.320]  to round up their own population of Christians and Buddhists and Muslims, everybody else,
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:45.360]  I mean, I would expect it, I would expect it, people speak out against me, people legally
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:55.680]  come after me, I would expect people faced with something that evil to take action, because
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:00.680]  you notice all these mass shootings they stage, they're winding these up with the culture
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:04.680]  of the media, there was a big study out yesterday, big procedure study, it was in my stack, it's
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:09.440]  right here, somebody reprinted it, I was trying to find it earlier, that the media hyping
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:15.880]  mass shootings is causing them, see, that's mind control, but see, it's always a Wal-Martens
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:22.000]  and working class folks, it's always some poor black people at some church or some
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.760]  poor white people at some church, nobody ever goes to Eric Schmidt's house, nobody ever
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:30.840]  goes to Sundar Pachai's house, nobody ever goes to Bill Clinton's house, nobody ever
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:38.640]  goes to Representative Castro's house, he says come to our houses, and I'm not wishing
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:43.880]  any violence upon them, I'm just saying one on one of the synthetic garbage is it targets
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:57.560]  the general public to scare them, and what is Joaquin Castro say, he says I doxxed Trump
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:05.160]  supporters to make them think twice, oh, oh, to scare, oh, oh, Mr. Castro, I'm not scared
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:14.240]  of you, I'm scared of me, because you're going down a road, son, and you're mouse writing
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:20.440]  checks you cannot cash, you start sending people to folks' houses, what happens when
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:33.520]  one of your nut bags kills somebody's family, Castro, see, you take our restraint as weakness,
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:40.280]  you're scared of ourselves, Mr. Castro, we're scared of once you start this, what's going
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:50.480]  to happen, because we don't want a bunch of people to die, and a lot of people will die,
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:12:00.200]  there's a civil war in this country, 20 million people, 30 million people are going to die,
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:09.120]  maybe more, you really want your name on that, Mr. Castro, you think going out and punching
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:16.240]  a ball in the nose is going to scare it, you're really a dumb piece of crap, see, America
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:22.080]  is a big bull, it's mean, it's tough, it's old too, and you'd be smart if you made this
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:26.240]  mad and tried to stab us in the heart, but you're not even doing that, you're out there
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:32.000]  like a matador with your chest all out, but blindfold on, you're so confident, and you're
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:39.760]  going to get run over, here's the problem, Castro, in the process a lot of innocent people
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:45.160]  are going to get run over, and see, I don't want to trespass on their lives, I don't want
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:48.800]  to trespass on their destiny, I don't want to run their lives, I don't want to intimidate
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:55.840]  them, I want to inspire them, I don't want to bully people, I want to lead them, and
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:01.080]  guess what, I am leading people, which is common sense, you're not a leader, you're
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:07.080]  a thug, you're a punk, now we were able to get Mike Adams on very short notice because
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:14.400]  I've had kind of a berserker conniption fit, if you just tuned in the last few hours, because
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:20.520]  I got hit like a ton of bricks, 10 minutes for the show, and I'm like, whoa, Trump's
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.120]  about to do the executive order, I confirmed that's the truth, he's got all these plans
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.080]  on the drawing board, they're all trying to not have him do something meaningful, and
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.960]  I know the reports, we had lawyers put together, and I know Mike Adams' report, that I asked
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:37.280]  him to write, that he stayed up four days to put together, got to the president, just
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:43.640]  like Matt Dredge last week, got our video out, and got to the president, and so I thought
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:49.760]  just one segment with him, he's busy, he's an engineer, runs his own operations, to
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:55.840]  talk about what he thinks Trump should do, and the fact that they are, again, down to
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:02.560]  the wire right now, on what's going to happen, and how serious this is, and how they're
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:07.680]  trying to divert off with a presidential commission or something, they'll just become a bunch
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:12.000]  of politicos that just want to be seated in the power discussion, to kind of debate and
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.400]  carve up the spoils, no, we need immediate action, and what does Mike Adams think that
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.520]  immediate action with the president is, because the immediate action is coming.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.760]  Trump's people have blocked him, they've sabotaged him, his lawyers tell him they're going to
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:30.320]  do it, they refuse it, they put it into a process, like he's a client, they're milking,
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:34.760]  to extend it out as long as possible, but Trump is now, on so many fronts, really taking
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:39.160]  action, so, and he understands they're going to try a civil war, they're not going to back
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:44.560]  down, no matter how much dirt he's got on them for Clinton and the files, they're still
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:50.520]  going to try to remove the president, and then come after everybody because they want
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.640]  a violent revolution, because they know culturally and spiritually they're losing, so we'll go
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:00.320]  to him after this break, please don't forget that if you want to win and you want this
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:05.080]  critical information out, it takes money to fund this operation, we make it easy, we don't
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:09.000]  just say, hey, give us donations, we do that, that's great, because we get 95% of it, that
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.880]  really helps, but we have products, we have a big sale running right now, but it takes
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.440]  a lot of product to be sold at these sales prices to fund this operation, so if you believe
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:22.920]  in this operation, you want to see more of it, it's very simple, don't hesitate, take
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:30.920]  action, 50% off to 60% off, things like Ultra 12, Ultimate Krill formula, all the storeable
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:38.880]  foods, X2, X3, Rainforest Plus, 60% off Real Red Pill Plus, you did look into that, at
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:45.760]  Apple or store.com or triple 825-33139, but what is Mike Adams' message to the President
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.320]  as they're on the operating table at the White House right now, looking at all the options
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:54.640]  and about to take action, you can feel the fork in the road we've now come to?

[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:01.640]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:06.200]  but also the products at InfoWarsstore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:11.640]  InfoWarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:15.640]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:19.400]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA.
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:24.320]  So I started to look into the science and what Telomere's were and how it can improve
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.880]  your health and longevity when you protect your Telomere's.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.280]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.280]  Why?
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:36.680]  Because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:41.720]  up with competitive supplements for Telomere's support and they came and they went.
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:44.720]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:46.200]  It is the elite supplement.
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:51.000]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:58.840]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsstore.com.
[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:25.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:31.640]  He worked closely with me getting reports to the president a year ago on battle plans.
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:36.200]  He wrote a blueprint, a lengthy blueprint we'll put on screen in a few minutes.
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:40.640]  The kid Daniels has reposted to InfoWars.com as a flashback.
[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:44.680]  It's in that article with actions the president should take.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:55.640]  So Politico and others are reporting right now that Trump is planning to take action
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:21:00.080]  in the next week or two, has a whole bunch of different battle plans in front of him.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:04.040]  They're trying to push him towards a commission that will just stall this out after the election.
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:09.480]  When it's so naked, they're doing this election meddling and we even had Mitch McConnell when
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:13.200]  they come to his house a few days ago saying they're going to stab him and kill him.
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:19.000]  Well his own Twitter then posted it saying it was wrong so they blocked and froze his
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  Twitter.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.040]  So the leader of the Senate isn't even allowed to defend himself from people coming to his
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:26.880]  house saying they're going to kill him.
[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:28.440]  That's how crazy this has gotten.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:32.640]  So Mike Adams, I appreciate you being at the heart of this and working with us on this.
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:36.080]  What do you want to talk about at this point and hopefully get listeners and everybody
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:41.640]  else in the White House to put pressure on right now while this is all being looked at
[02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:44.760]  in the final stages of what the president's going to do?
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:47.320]  Well, happy to join you today.
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:51.120]  It's important for I think President Trump and his administration to understand that
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:56.480]  whatever executive orders are issued, the tech giants will willfully ignore those orders
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:02.560]  and they will find left-wing judges to deem those orders to be unconstitutional.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:08.320]  These are the same judges that refuse to allow Trump to protect our national border, the
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:13.680]  judges that shoot down the ban on Islamic extremists entering the country and so on,
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:15.760]  you know, the Muslim travel ban and so on.
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:21.280]  So Trump is going to have to realize that this, in order to back this up, you have to
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:28.200]  be willing to take it to the next step, which is to at some point, you have to invoke the
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:29.880]  Insurrection Act.
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:36.480]  You have to declare these tech giants to be quite literally enemy combatants who are
[02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:40.680]  the way you were the first to say that almost two years ago on this show.
[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:44.160]  Now the president's even talking about that because they're the ones that are trying to
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.280]  be dictators.
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:46.960]  They're the ones on Chai Khan funding.
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:48.200]  They're the ones overriding it.
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.480]  They're the ones that do whatever they want.
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.480]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:53.480]  Yeah.
[02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:58.800]  And realize that they cannot coexist with a freedom-based economy.
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:02.440]  They, the tech giants, they, you cannot reason with them.
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:05.420]  They will follow no rules and they do not act in good faith.
[02:23:05.420 --> 02:23:06.920]  This is crucial to understand.
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:08.560]  They're not acting in good faith.
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:13.760]  They continue to deny the fact that they are banning channels and deplatforming and demonetizing
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:15.520]  based on political targeting.
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:18.680]  They are actively interfering in the 2020 election.
[02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:24.040]  We already know that they stole much of the outcome of the 2018 midterms.
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:31.360]  And remember, it was Robert Mueller who charged Russian companies with conspiracy to defraud
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.880]  the United States of America.
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.200]  That's a charge that he leveled against Russian companies in order to create the propaganda
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:41.640]  that something was happening with Russia in the 2016 election.
[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:42.900]  Well, guess what?
[02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:47.120]  There are companies that are conspiring to defraud the United States of America.
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:52.440]  Those companies are named Google, Apple, Twitter, you know, I was about to say, I think the
[02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:56.160]  best advice is go out for them for espionage, for election meddling.
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.200]  They moved to China.
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:58.520]  They gave the code keys.
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:23:59.840]  We've got them.
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:03.440]  But we know that again, Trump is surrounded by these intelligence agencies that are aware
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.760]  of this and who are not following his orders.
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:09.800]  So what does he do when they're trying to cause a civil war, a race war, when they're
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:11.600]  totally ignoring him blatantly?
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:16.440]  I mean, here's an article on m4s.com just came out, Ben Warren, Instagram trusted partner
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:18.800]  caught harvesting millions of user data.
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:22.280]  I mean, these are lawless groups that have gotten away with so much.
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:23.560]  They're just mad dogs.
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:25.480]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:32.400]  These tech giants are in fact celebrating and allowing speech that calls for death camps
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:33.960]  for Trump supporters.
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:39.320]  They are allowing speech that calls for the doxing of Trump donors, which is basically
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:44.320]  a veiled threat for radical leftists to go out and commit violence or threats of violence
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.640]  against Trump supporters.
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:52.320]  These tech giants are, in my view, enemy combatants in a civil war that is being waged right now
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:55.200]  against the people of the United States of America.
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:00.600]  And it's time, I think, for Trump to fully embrace the fact that we are in a war.
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:05.560]  This is an info war as your name comes from your, your site's name.
[02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:10.840]  The info war is here and we have to realize we're in a war and take action to stop the
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:11.840]  enemies of America.
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:12.840]  Exactly.
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:13.960]  They're attacking us.
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:15.680]  They're calling for race war.
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:17.880]  They're spewing the most vile stuff.
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:19.480]  They're engaging in criminal activity.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:22.840]  They're all over the news now saying, let's get violent, not just saying, confront us at
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:25.000]  gas stations or at the shopping mall.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:34.200]  Like, you know, the Democrat Harpy said last year, they're now saying, come after everybody.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.720]  Twitter just banned the channel, or at least temporarily, of Mitch McConnell for exposing
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:41.480]  the violence of the radical left wing mobs.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:47.480]  And by the way, if anybody needs an argument of why you need standard capacity magazines
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.240]  for a rifle and why you need multiple magazines and why you need rapid fire, just look at
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:55.280]  the liberal mobs threatening people like Tucker Carlson.
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:26:00.800]  If Tucker Carlson, if his home is invaded by a liberal mob, the hashtag was trending,
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:03.720]  they allowed it, saying burn his house down last night.
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:04.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:09.680]  You know, the question is, does Tucker Carlson's wife have the right to have an AR-15 rifle
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.960]  with rapid fire to defend herself against the violent lunatic left wing mob?
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:14.960]  Absolutely she does.
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:18.080]  And Tucker Carlson himself has that right, as all of us do.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:22.800]  So there's your argument right there for why we need effective firearms to defend ourselves
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:27.440]  against these lunatic mobs that are being whipped up into their hatred by the tech giants
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:28.720]  in the left wing media.
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:31.960]  Look, there is a war being waged in this country.
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:36.120]  The radical left, both the journal terrorists and the media, as well as the left wing tech
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:41.600]  giants, are trying to get the radical left wing lunatics, these Antifa mobs and other
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.360]  leftists, to become incredibly violent and to start viciously attacking-
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:50.760]  Well look at both the shooters now, one is totally anti, the other has Antifa connections.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:54.480]  These are just among the foot soldiers that went out and did this atrocity, they're finally
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:56.760]  getting smart to blame us.
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:57.760]  Absolutely.
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:01.560]  Now what President Trump needs to know, I believe, and he may not know this, is that
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:06.920]  the American people and especially veterans all across this country are ready to rise
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:09.320]  up in defense of this nation.
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:14.400]  If President Trump issued an executive order and the tech giants said no, and if President
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.680]  Trump were to, let's say, arrest the tech giant CEOs with military-
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:22.000]  By the way, which is totally normal, I mean, they literally moved to China and gave the
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:28.080]  code keys to all our iPhones, they literally, this is like World War II, but if all the
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:32.120]  US companies were with Hitler, I mean, we wouldn't put up with that.
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:37.000]  No, and if the radical left rose up and tried to have violence in the streets, all Trump
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:42.720]  would have to do is say, veterans, active duty soldiers, everyone who has sworn an
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:46.800]  oath to defend this Constitution, you are now activated to defend this nation.
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:48.880]  But that's why they're cutting all those communications off.
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:52.400]  If you notice you don't see the speeches on TV or almost anymore, you didn't see him
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:56.440]  go to El Paso or to Dayton, they're already, man, they're making their move.
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:00.680]  Well, but I also, I happen to know because I speak to so many of these people and I
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:02.440]  actually train with so many people.
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.160]  No, I know the entire police and military, everybody hates the globalists, I don't, yeah.
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.040]  No, I mean, that's why the left's so crazy.
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:11.120]  They're never gonna execute, even if they kill Trump, they're gonna get it.
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:12.120]  They're gonna lose.
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.120]  They just need to give up.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:14.120]  Yeah.
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:18.920]  Look, if they kill Trump, there will be a spontaneous activation without orders from
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:23.160]  headquarters of veterans all across America who will take action to defend this nation.
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:24.160]  End of story.
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:25.160]  That will happen.
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:27.280]  And we're not gonna be like Andy for that goes and harasses innocent people.
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:34.200]  All these globalists are obviously literally sticking their head to guillotine right now
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:35.960]  and asking for it.
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:37.960]  Mike Adams, really, really great points.
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:39.440]  This is all coming to a head.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.960]  It's an incredible time to be alive.

[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.840]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:04.600]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:07.760]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:11.200]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:13.760]  I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:17.080]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:18.080]  shut us down.
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:20.440]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:21.440]  wonderful they were.
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:23.240]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:28.400]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements know under federal
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:33.880]  law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:37.480]  no jurisdiction and won't look at it, but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:41.960]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:42.960]  it and do different things.
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:44.240]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:48.200]  They have side effects, not with mother nature, but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:54.400]  God's medicine chest info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:55.400]  three, nine.
[02:30:55.400 --> 02:31:04.320]  The most banned network in the world viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:05.320]  for you.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:09.200]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:13.440]  a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:17.560]  you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:20.440]  you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:24.960]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:25.960]  my heart.
[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:28.840]  I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've
[02:31:28.840 --> 02:31:32.840]  done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed
[02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:35.320]  to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:39.320]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:40.320]  what's important.
[02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:41.560]  The enemy could win.
[02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:43.680]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:44.920]  We're being used by God.
[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:46.120]  You're being used by God.
[02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:47.120]  This is Providence.
[02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:51.640]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:56.920]  For Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:56.920 --> 02:32:01.480]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on
[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:05.680]  not being run by the chai comms with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally
[02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:09.200]  fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:10.200]  It's all coming out.
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:11.200]  Democrats aren't going to stop.
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:12.680]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:14.840]  Like they're starting to get some purchase, trying to start a fire.
[02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:15.840]  They got some fire going.
[02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:19.960]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities hitting attack, dead people
[02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:20.960]  everywhere.
[02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:25.200]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane.
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:28.720]  So now more than you've ever done for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about
[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:33.040]  this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV, tell folks about info wars.com, four slash
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:34.040]  show.
[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:37.480]  But that said, I want to fight hard and I need you to buy the products at info wars store
[02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:38.480]  dot com.
[02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:43.760]  Huge sale, the one year anniversary, banning sale, the banniversary sale, 56% off, store
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:47.360]  line free shipping, double patriot points, get all the great products you need and no,
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.920]  you are funding not just the second American revolution, but a pro human future against
[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:59.840]  the devil worshiping Satanist and their off world controllers.
[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:12.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:17.120]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:26.480]  Alex Jones, you know, people always ask me, how do you have so much energy?
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:27.480]  Are you on drugs?
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:29.920]  No, I had half a cup of coffee this morning.
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:30.920]  My stomach was hurting.
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:31.920]  It's the smell of that.
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:32.920]  I usually love coffee.
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:36.360]  I just, you know, your stomach's upset, you can't drink coffee, but I'm bouncing off the
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:37.360]  walls.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:39.360]  People say, are you, are you on cocaine?
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:40.360]  No.
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:41.360]  I hate cocaine.
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:43.880]  They're like twice in high school, horrible.
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.880]  And the hangover.
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:46.920]  Good God, the depression the next day.
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:47.920]  No way.
[02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:48.920]  I don't need that.
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:50.520]  I'm high on life.
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:52.280]  I'm high on the energy in the universe.
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:58.040]  I'm high on freedom and the contest of freedom against evil.
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:01.480]  You only power up when you stand against evil.
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.320]  You only get strong when you put yourself at risk.
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:11.400]  And I was just thinking during the break out, I'm not going to apologize for being a maniac
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.400]  today.
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:19.680]  I mean, we're on a planet in space with seven and a half million people and criminals in
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:24.400]  our government allied themselves with the most oppressive, evil people on the planet
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:31.480]  and they're trying to take us over and I'm attacking back.
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:37.320]  And again, a Chihuahua's not a very tough dog, but it'll bite you back.
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:40.320]  And I guarantee you if you try to grab a Chihuahua and break its neck, it's going to bite you
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:41.320]  in the process.
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:44.280]  It's going to bite you back.
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:49.760]  How do they train people to just sit here and when they're under attack, not fight back?
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:57.160]  I see these videos where people get attacked by mobs, by Islamic mobs mainly, white folks
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:00.360]  by racist blacks that have been programmed to do it.
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.640]  And I see these white guys, they just kind of go, they just fall down hoping someone
[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.360]  stops hitting them.
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:11.520]  And they're not knocked out at first, they are knocked out later.
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:17.280]  And I just, yeah, all these videos are coming out of the Islamics torturing the Europeans
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.840]  because the Europeans have been trained.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:27.080]  Their whole identity is just laying down, laying down, laying down because the Islamists
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:33.920]  tried to dominate these very Swedish Vikings a thousand years ago and got their ass kicked.
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:39.880]  Let's see, the media conquered them, the media taught them that they were bad, that they
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:43.240]  were evil, that they had to lay down.
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:47.160]  And we sit back and we watch all this going on, it's ridiculous.
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:53.480]  Imagine watching a black person beat up like this and kicked and tortured.
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:56.760]  You'd be angry, not about their skin color.
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:00.800]  But they put us into a tribalism, it was like seven, eight years ago, a black woman
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:07.640]  ran up to a military checkpoint to drill in DC and she ran from the police.
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:13.200]  That was all during the Trayvon Martin thing, the media happened up race for it with Obama.
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:18.720]  And when I was defending her before and after they came out, she was black.
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:24.720]  When the cop overreacted and shot her for no reason, that was a real case of, you know,
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:31.120]  the police, a woman panicked with a baby in the back and they kill her.
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:35.660]  And the outpouring of black support, oh, we know you're good now, you know what happened
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:39.560]  to Trayvon's wrong too, because you stood up for a black woman that got killed.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.720]  I don't care what color she is.
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:42.720]  I mean, I'm against that.
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:46.840]  I don't care what color a baby is, let's not abort them, let's not kill a masterborn
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:49.960]  for sure.
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.360]  But it really hit me just how tribal people are, everybody's tribal.
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:58.760]  We have that from our ancient past, but the egalitarian Christian model is to get rid
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:05.400]  of that tribalism and have Christianity as the unifier and to come together around ideas
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:09.080]  what Martin Luther King talked about, but that whole thing is being thrown away right
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:13.320]  now.
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:19.080]  And when you pull back and you look at this and you realize there are powerful forces
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:25.760]  that know all of this and instead of trying to get people to work together, that we never
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:30.120]  played Tucker Carlson's clip from yesterday, can we cue that up where he says white supremism
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:32.320]  is like one of the rarest things in this country.
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:33.600]  It's not the crisis.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:40.400]  The crisis is thousands of suicides a week, 24 veteran suicides a day.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:45.040]  The real crisis is opioids and deindustrialization.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:48.520]  That's affecting millions a year.
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:51.560]  The real crisis is hopelessness and what does the media give us?
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:57.040]  More hopelessness, more chips on our shoulder, more, more because they're the enemy, they're
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:58.040]  the corporatist.
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:04.240]  The only way to bring this country down would be to do it from within.
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:07.480]  And they know what they've done.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:08.480]  They're aware of what they've done.
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:11.480]  Do we have the Tucker Carlson?
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.760]  Okay, it doesn't matter, I don't need it.
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:27.600]  That's what all of this has come down to and it's just a real shame that people put up
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:31.560]  with it because most people see through this, they just tune out of it.
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:35.520]  And so as folks tune out of mainstream media, they just get more shrill and it's in movies
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:40.560]  and it's in cartoons and it's just, it's everywhere where even if you're trying to get away from
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:44.040]  all the lies, they just keep feeding them and feeding them and feeding them and feeding
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:45.040]  them.
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:50.280]  And the Tucker Carlson says, we should come together like President Trump's saying and
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:53.920]  their answer is, well, let's set him on fire.
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:57.920]  They've already been to his house, they've already been to Mitch McConnell's house.
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.320]  And how dare Mitch McConnell when 30 people showed up and said, we're going to stab you
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:08.920]  to death, murdering turtle, see they projected, you're a murderer, we're going to kill you.
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:14.360]  Their answer at Twitter is take Mitch McConnell's Twitter, freeze his Twitter because he's
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:15.360]  already put up with it.
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:16.360]  He's a leader of the Senate.
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.920]  Hey, listen, old man, we came over to your house and said, we're going to kill you and
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:22.880]  you're not going to show it.
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:25.680]  We're going to let those sites that posted it stay up.
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:27.680]  We're going to let them keep calling for your death.
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:32.480]  But you ain't going to fight back, bitch, because she, oh, these are the downtrodden
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:40.880]  people fighting the big evil man with his little modest house in Kentucky that he was
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:51.120]  in, little four bedroom little shack house read about Bill Gates moved out of his 30,000
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:56.280]  square foot house into a 3000 square foot house.
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:05.280]  Yeah, but again, ladies and gentlemen, this is all out of control and they're trying to
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:09.080]  foment the revolution and Twitter and Facebook think they're going to start a revolution
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:11.360]  by encouraging people, but they're not going to get in trouble.
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:17.520]  I assure Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai and Eric Schmidt and all the rest of you guys,
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:20.960]  you will pay for what you're doing.
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.040]  You're already in a lot of trouble.
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:26.640]  You need to stop and come out with your hands up right now.
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:33.120]  Seriously, because this is not, we're not going to give in Raul Castro's life.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:34.760]  We got to intimidate him more.
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.160]  Remember last week I played Chris A's, he goes, it's time to really intimidate him
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:42.120]  and ruin their lives and destroy these Trump supporters.
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:45.040]  All you're going to get your ass destroyed with your stupid glasses.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:49.080]  They don't even have lenses in them.
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:51.400]  I mean, you're sitting there starting to fight, son.
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.800]  You've never been in a fight.
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:41:02.080]  All you've done is creep around all day with a bunch of pedophiles confronted and destroyed.
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:05.920]  Hey, dude, look out when you're trying to destroy people, what you find, you just dug
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  a hole for yourself.
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:08.920]  You're going to jump in there, jump it in it, you really want me to put the dirt on
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:09.920]  your head?
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:13.560]  Because let me tell you something, Mr. Hayes, you go around looking for death, you're going
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:15.960]  to find it, son.
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:20.240]  Those that live by the sword die by the sword, my boy, and you don't even know how to use
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:24.560]  the sword, but you want to run around with one all day telling other people to use one.
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:29.480]  Don't you get that the captains or who everybody shoots for in a smart army?
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:32.280]  You think we're going to fight with your little meth heads?
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:36.400]  Your meth heads kill somebody, you're going to get it.
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:37.600]  And I'm not going to be the one that does it.
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:41.640]  I'm telling you, Chris Hayes, how the universe works, son.
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:45.000]  See, we're not stupid like you.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.160]  We don't go out and fight low-level people.
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:50.120]  You start this fight, boy.
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:51.640]  It's going to be you.
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:53.840]  We've got to go to break.
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:42:00.040]  We don't even know we have time for the clip, but we mentioned it here at us.
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:02.280]  But the whole thing is a lie.
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.920]  If you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns or problems this country faces,
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  where would white supremacy be on the list?
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:12.000]  Right up there with Russia, probably.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.840]  It's actually not a real problem in America.
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:18.760]  The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country, were they able
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:20.920]  to fit inside a college football stadium?
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:26.760]  I mean, seriously, this is a country where the average person is getting poorer, where
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:29.320]  the suicide rate is spiking.
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:30.720]  White supremacy, that's the problem.
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:31.720]  This is a hoax.
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:37.160]  Just like the Russia hoax, it's a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:38.280]  a hold on power.
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:39.720]  It's exactly what's going on.
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:44.600]  You know, I get tears in my eyes because I can't believe they've gotten so many people
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:48.920]  to push this evil and try to cause a true civil war.
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:51.520]  And none of the dumbasses doing it know how much danger they're in.
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:54.240]  I mean, you guys are in a lot of danger, man.
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:55.240]  I mean, woo!
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:00.080]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:01.080]  act.
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:04.760]  And so, it used to, it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:08.320]  loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:11.280]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:13.640]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:17.240]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.040]  up Mexican flags.
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:21.880]  This is the bizarreness of the America-hating we're seeing.
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.440]  So now, it is a revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:32.120]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:38.000]  when it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.560]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies'

[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:17.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:19.320]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:22.160]  Well, I'm actually proud of Trump.
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:25.680]  Not on his gun rhetoric, which has been to take the wind out of their sails, does it
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:29.240]  very effectively, completely shuts them down.
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:34.760]  I get it, it's still Machiavelli, it's not my tactic.
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:43.200]  But on the subject of borders and sovereignty, Trump, when he announced five years ago to
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:50.920]  run for president, four and a half years ago, he said, my hotels, my casinos, my golf courses
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:54.440]  have a lot of great people from overseas, they come here legally, some decide to stay,
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:59.040]  they go to the process, I'm not the best at Trump imitations.
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:04.160]  And then the media said he hates Mexicans, he says they're all criminals, he never said
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:10.240]  that, he said, you better be here legally, just like Mexico deports your ass fast if
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:12.120]  you stay there when you're not supposed to.
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:15.600]  Because any country can't stand if it doesn't have borders.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.840]  So I got a lot of emails, a lot of calls saying, oh my gosh, Trump's betraying us, he's saying
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:22.120]  we need millions more.
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:27.160]  I get what he said last year or this year, we're full with the processing and the welfare
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:33.120]  and the illegals being promoted to be able to vote without being citizens.
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:36.000]  The Democrats are promoting that and they're doing it.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.840]  So I get people that say, hey, we're full, we got to process what we got.
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:43.640]  No, he's going to deport people that are here illegally.
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:48.320]  The big, big thousands of arrests a day are taking place, record numbers, 600 here, 500
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.120]  there, I mean, it's going on.
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:53.640]  But Trump has the courts against him like Mike Adams said.
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:59.160]  And he's got the whole system raining hell down and thousands of lawsuits against the
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:04.360]  border patrol being filed by Democrats, wanting $3 million each case.
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:07.800]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:14.680]  So Trump is trying to create unity while they're trying to create a civil war race war.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.280]  I didn't even get to these videos the last two days, they're up on infowars.com.
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:24.760]  Netflix shows, you name it, where Trump supporters are arrested, put in death camps and killed.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:30.080]  And you see signs up all over New York saying put Trump supporters in death camps, fredgerport.com
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:32.720]  linked to it yesterday.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.560]  This is the division they're trying and Drudge has also been linked to our story.
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:44.040]  Actress Roseanne Arquette apologizes for being born white, kneels in front of American flags
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:46.000]  saying she'll never stand for it again.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:47.680]  She doesn't get the archetype.
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:49.240]  She's actually kneeling in front of it.
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:51.240]  She's so scared of it.
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:53.960]  She doesn't even get that.
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:58.440]  And says because of this white supremacist supposedly did this, that she's guilty.
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:00.680]  How un-Martin Luther King is that?
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:04.120]  To say that if a white person does something wrong, she's guilty.
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:05.120]  What?
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  There's white people in the town I live in every day committing crimes.
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:10.000]  How the hell am I guilty?
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:15.840]  If a black person commits a crime and you're black, how does that mean you dare or a black
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:19.040]  person does something, you're white, does that mean you're guilty?
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:21.960]  That's crazy talk.
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:24.240]  I'm sorry I was born white and privileged.
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:27.520]  It disgusts me and I feel so much shame.
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:32.280]  Well, I just feel shame that you're such a race-bater and think you're going to get attention
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:34.040]  doing that.
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:39.640]  A washed up Hollywood chicken neck tag.
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:43.520]  So in La La Land out there that she doesn't even know what planet she's on.
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:49.200]  But there's President Trump.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:50.200]  Trump takes high ground.
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:52.400]  I don't blame Democrats.
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:51:03.240]  While they say he's a white supremacist and he killed these people, Trump says, I don't
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:04.240]  blame Democrats.
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:05.240]  I blame mental illness.
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:06.240]  Here it is.
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:11.640]  No, I don't blame Elizabeth Warren and I don't blame Bernie Sanders in the case of Ohio
[02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:14.360]  and I don't blame anybody.
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:20.920]  I blame these are sick people, these are people that are really mentally ill, mentally disturbed.
[02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:23.680]  So that's just a common sense thing.
[02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:27.840]  Three hundred and forty million people, probably three hundred and sixty if you count the illegals.
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:29.160]  And okay, twenty people died.
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:30.660]  It's terrible.
[02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:31.660]  Like my grandma died.
[02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:32.660]  It's terrible.
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:35.000]  But it's not even a drop in the bucket.
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:36.560]  You know, I think I'm going to do a whole piece on this.
[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:38.840]  You know what's killing Hispanics?
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:44.240]  I'm drinking a LaCroix, Lumen was probably not good for me, but that doesn't have any
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:45.240]  sweet in it.
[02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:46.240]  So that's not killing me.
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:48.400]  But I almost brought a Coca-Cola up here, a Pepsi.
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:53.840]  I mean, you understand like Hispanics genetics on average can't drink corn syrup or a lot
[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:54.840]  of sweets.
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:55.840]  You get diabetes.
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:52:00.600]  I drive down the road at the bus stops all over Austin and like every bus stop almost
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:04.400]  has a poor Hispanic man or one with her legs cut off.
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:11.040]  You know what's killing Mexicans is sweets, because genetically we're all similar, but
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:12.040]  we're all different.
[02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:16.040]  Kind of like white people can't handle to be out in the sun every day, they get skin
[02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:17.040]  cancer.
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:22.680]  Well, Hispanics can't handle a bunch of sugar for whatever reason, genetically kills millions
[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:23.680]  a year in America.
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:27.400]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, they're not a big story about that because they don't care about
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:28.400]  you.
[02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:35.360]  Yeah, there's a Hispanics is proportionally affected by diabetes, but oh, they're not
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:36.880]  telling you about that.
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:39.640]  No, no, no, it's all Hispanics.
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:41.000]  Trump came and killed 20 of you.
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:42.440]  He wants to kill you.
[02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:44.080]  He wants to murder you.
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:50.240]  And meanwhile he's hiling Hitler because he's going to lower the flags on 88.
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:53.800]  I barely knew 88 was a Hitler thing.
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:54.880]  That's so mentally ill.
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:53:00.800]  They're just introducing 88 of the like you symbol, but this, you know, I never got to
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:03.400]  this piece and we have a guest house taken over Matt Bracken, but I'm going to do two
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:04.400]  segments of it.
[02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:07.480]  He'll be here 15 after Paul Watson did a great report.
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:08.480]  Tucker Carlson did it.
[02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:11.440]  My mom came over for her 70th birthday of the day and she brought it up.
[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:12.440]  She said, why?
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:13.440]  She said, have you covered this?
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:15.280]  And I said, no, I got too busy with cashmere.
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.040]  And that's a situation.
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:22.480]  But Monday I meant to, we wrote a big story about it, that Paul actually broke it on Sunday
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:24.480]  before it got big.
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:25.480]  That's how it kind of works.
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:26.480]  We were always breaking stuff.
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:32.080]  They're not actually covering it when it gets big, but you had the world socialist, national
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:38.200]  socialist meeting and it was just, I watched hours of it, just mental illness on display,
[02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:43.120]  all fighting with each other, none of them able to get anything done just because that's
[02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:44.960]  psychic warfare.
[02:53:44.960 --> 02:53:46.920]  That's brainwashing.
[02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:48.320]  That sabotage people.
[02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:49.320]  That's what they want.
[02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:53.200]  Like you hear about colleges where if someone gets upset, they give them Play-Doh and basket
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:55.600]  weaving and Crayolas, you think, okay, that's a joke.
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:57.120]  No, there's undercover video.
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:02.480]  We've played it where someone sees a pocket constitution where the libertarians are allowed
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:03.480]  on campus.
[02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:09.760]  And they run, they go, I'm so scared, I saw the Constitution.
[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:16.200]  And the professor goes, it's okay, I know it's painful here, come and play with Play-Doh.
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:22.920]  You think, this is like not even real, it is because they're all, and now the new trend
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:28.960]  is liberals wear diapers, look this up, hundreds of thousands of liberals wear diapers and
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:31.000]  poop on themselves.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.640]  They identify as babies or they put their eyes out, they identify as blind because you're
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:40.640]  not, it's not training anymore to just cut your genitals off or, you know, whatever.
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:42.320]  And so there's a big trend.
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:47.640]  It's been around in the quote, gay community for 30 years, Mexico actually legalizes it.
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:48.640]  Mexico's very liberal.
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:54.880]  So there's a big colony down in Southern Mexico where men want to be helpless so they have
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:57.080]  their arms and legs amputated.
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:54:58.080]  And Mexico will do it.
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:01.520]  I saw a documentary in South by Southwest about 15 years ago on it.
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:02.520]  They call them nuggets.
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:03.520]  Is it nuggets?
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:07.240]  It's nuggets, nugget porn.
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:13.040]  And so you have your arms and legs cut off and then you live in a box and then you're
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:17.880]  dependent on the man and then people come and torture you.
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:22.040]  So like 50 men have sex with you, you have no arms and legs and then you just love it
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:25.640]  because, I mean, I mean, what type of folks I'm not joking and I don't want to tell you
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:29.080]  this type of stuff because your brain hasn't been assaulted by it, but I'm forced to research
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:30.080]  this.
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:31.080]  Okay.
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:36.440]  And I was just given an all pass as media like 15 year and I like, what's this, I walked
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:37.440]  out of it.
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:40.800]  It was like them having their arms and legs cut off part of the documentary started with
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:44.240]  people shooting each other with guns and Dallas.
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:48.200]  And again, it was gay guys because it's so liberal to have the wounds and so he goes,
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  I love you.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:50.200]  Because I love you too.
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:54.960]  Shooting with like a 357 Magnum under the arm, blood blast out, he goes, I have sex
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:55.960]  with me.
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:56.960]  It's so awesome.
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:55:57.960]  It's so liberal.
[02:55:57.960 --> 02:56:02.480]  I mean, they're like shooting each other, chopping arms and legs off of meat, flavors.
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:06.240]  I mean, it's like hellraiser just pulling your eyeballs out.
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:09.440]  Never seen a vent horizon where they go into a black hole in its hell and they see film
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:13.240]  with a crew once they enter hell and they're just pulling their eyeballs out.
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:14.240]  The Aztecs did that.
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:17.160]  The priest would do that to themselves.
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:19.760]  They'd finally get to the point where they would just rip their eyeballs out, chop their
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:24.000]  genitals off and just start stabbing themselves going, wing it, serve it, kill me, I'll say
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.920]  time now.
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:27.920]  And that's it.
[02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:33.600]  Just shoving guns under their arms, I'm liberal, just give us your children, give us access
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  to your children.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:35.600]  Think I'm joking?
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:38.320]  You've seen the video.
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:39.920]  We're coming to groom your children.
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:46.680]  Now, the Bad Queen Tory time, the children ride horsey on the men's bulging pants and
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:49.200]  the mothers go, hmm, because it's so demonic.
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:53.800]  They're like, oh, it's so pleasing to give my two-year-old to a man in a clown outfit
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:58.840]  for them to ride their crotch.
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:00.240]  See how it works?
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:01.920]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:04.800]  That's exactly it.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:05.800]  And so that's it.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:07.480]  That's where we're going.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:12.080]  They put all this in movies because these Satanists are really doing this and they want to show
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:14.080]  you what they're doing.
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:15.080]  You understand?
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:16.080]  Now you understand.
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:17.080]  See how it works?
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:18.080]  The skin, girl.
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:19.080]  The skin.
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:20.080]  You really want to be part of that?
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:21.080]  You want to be with these guys forever?
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:22.080]  No, thanks.
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:23.080]  I'll go with the big guy.
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:35.080]  I like family and children and space bases and building new worlds.
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.080]  I want to go there.
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:38.280]  I want to sit around and be an honorable piece of person.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:41.880]  I don't want to rip my eyeballs out and chop my genitals off the meat cleaver.
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:46.240]  But it's liberal for children, maybe.
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:53.600]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:58.000]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:07.240]  To say the name, Alex Jones, are infowars.com.
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:08.940]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:10.160]  This is racketeering.
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:11.160]  This is cartels.
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:13.640]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:15.560]  We need it now.
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:17.200]  You can take on big tech.
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:24.640]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:26.160]  populist organization.
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:30.880]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:33.920]  off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:39.080]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:40.920]  of freedom and free speech.
[02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:44.840]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:45.840]  Alex.
[02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:46.840]  Yes.
[02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:49.280]  I got a plug for the Patriot points.
[02:58:49.280 --> 02:58:50.280]  Oh, thanks.
[02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:53.600]  I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:56.800]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:59.480]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:00.480]  believe in.
[02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:02.760]  So I'd rather give that money to you and then get a quality product.
[02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:05.200]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:07.520]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:08.520]  I've lost weight.
[02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:10.040]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:11.840]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:16.040]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it
[02:59:16.040 --> 02:59:17.040]  gets rid of his sore throat.
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:19.040]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:20.560]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:21.560]  I want a good price.
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:25.760]  But I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:28.160]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:31.800]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:32.800]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:36.760]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:40.720]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing
[02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:41.720]  50% off.
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:44.680]  And then you do something like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money, but
[02:59:44.680 --> 02:59:45.680]  that's okay.
[02:59:45.680 --> 02:59:49.280]  Thanks for the support.
[02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:54.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:54.280 --> 03:00:07.320]  Okay, I want to hit the next segment.
[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:12.560]  It's been a really important subject I'll get to in a moment, but first, I like Joe
[03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:18.000]  Rogan, you know, I didn't like the fact that he was caving into the censorship, so I got
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.200]  mad at him, I went after him, but he did the right thing and we had to come to Jesus moment
[03:00:22.200 --> 03:00:23.200]  and that's good.
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:27.760]  And you know, if you count up all the videos that he's done, I'm the biggest podcast he
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:29.400]  ever did.
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:31.760]  Just the one version on YouTube has 15 million views.
[03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:37.480]  It was the biggest thing he ever did on the site for iTunes.
[03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:40.120]  I may even suppressed it and wouldn't let people share it, but it was still number one
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:41.120]  there.
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:43.280]  And you had all the derivatives of that on his own site.
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:52.560]  It's at about 60 million views and that means that the second biggest podcast is Elon Musk
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:54.120]  at about 40 million.
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:55.960]  So, see, people want the truth.
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:04.400]  They want wide open, no governor tell it like it is, but he had burning tenders on, unlistable,
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:09.400]  but because of the hype of it, it happened a couple of days ago, it's gotten four million
[03:01:09.400 --> 03:01:10.400]  views.
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:15.400]  When I was on his show, then they put a governor on it and 15 million on YouTube, but it just
[03:01:15.400 --> 03:01:18.120]  shows how, and I'm glad Joe had him on.
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:19.120]  That's great.
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:23.240]  Bernie Sanders offering all this free stuff and telling everybody, but Joe brought up
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:24.240]  minimum wage.
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:25.240]  Sanders brought up minimum wage.
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:30.240]  Sanders wasn't giving his own employees minimum wage this year until they bitched.
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:33.280]  And when he did get minimum wage, he had to let some go and cut their hours, which is
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:34.280]  free market happening.
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:40.240]  So, I kind of wish Joe would have brought that up, but here it is.
[03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:43.800]  Very exciting video, as you can see.
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:45.320]  Let's go with the minimum wage thing.
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:49.320]  Now, the argument that I've heard about the minimum wage being raised to $15 an hour is
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:53.320]  that they're entry level positions for high school kids, for people that are just getting
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:57.400]  their feet wet in the marketplace, they're learning how to work, they're making some
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:02:05.240]  money after school, that if you charge, or if businesses have to pay $15 an hour to people
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:10.440]  like that, to entry level people, that they won't be able to stay open.
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:14.360]  Well first of all, they will be competing against, you know, if you're a business and
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:19.680]  I'm a business, and both of us have to raise our wages at the same level, we both have
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:20.680]  the same burden.
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:23.320]  So, it's spread across.
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:26.920]  That is what my conservative colleagues will tell you.
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:30.400]  The truth is, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, that while it certainly is
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:34.720]  true that young people do work at McDonald's and minimum wage jobs.
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:39.680]  They're a significant, and a majority of them are not.
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:40.680]  I swindled the university, it closed.
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:41.680]  Often, and I'd met them at McDonald's.
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:47.440]  I have three million dollar homes, and a hundred and eighty thousand dollar cars themselves.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:51.680]  When we worked very hard to raise the minimum wage, my first paycheck was at forty.
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:55.480]  And at Disney, we put pressure on both of those companies and they did the right thing.
[03:02:55.480 --> 03:03:00.440]  And when you talk to the people at Amazon who got that raise, these are not kids.
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:01.880]  These are people in their thirties.
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:02.880]  These are not kids.
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:07.400]  These are ordinary adults who cannot make it on twelve or thirteen bucks an hour.
[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:08.400]  So, I think the argument...
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:09.400]  I can't hear any more of it.
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:10.400]  Just shut it down.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:15.760]  Again, this is a guy who wasn't paying his own crew members, fifty dollars an hour.
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:20.040]  He was paying them thirteen, and then once he did, he had to let a bunch go.
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:21.680]  It's all lies, folks.
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:23.360]  The big corporations don't even pay taxes.
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:25.360]  They're the ones pushing all this crap.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:30.440]  Here's Joe talking about the podcast, my second podcast, because oh, I forgot to tell you.
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:35.640]  I am Joe's first and third biggest podcast ever.
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:38.200]  The second biggest is Elon Musk, but imagine.
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:39.720]  Being number one means you're banned.
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:40.720]  Here it is.
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:43.440]  It becomes like a game of shooting ducks.
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:44.440]  People get excited about it.
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:47.240]  They like taking people out, whether it makes sense or not.
[03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:50.320]  And I think there's a lot of that going on where people are calling for people to be
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:53.640]  deep platform just because they disagree with them.
[03:03:53.640 --> 03:03:59.680]  And so far, these big tech companies have resisted some of it, but not enough of it
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:01.680]  for my taste.
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:02.680]  Yeah.
[03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:03.680]  Yeah.
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:08.520]  You know, my boy Alex Jones, they got him out of here.
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:14.400]  I think, you know, if I was Alex, my ego would be so huge after getting deep platformed.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:17.840]  Well, when we did a podcast together after he was deep platformed, it was one of the
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:19.320]  biggest podcasts of all time.
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:20.320]  Yeah.
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:22.960]  But again, like sixteen million YouTube videos or something.
[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:23.960]  That's your highest one.
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:24.960]  Yeah.
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:26.840]  Meanwhile, YouTube did not demonetize that one.
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:28.080]  We let them know in advance.
[03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:29.080]  Just heads up.
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:30.080]  Yeah.
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:31.080]  Alex Jones is coming on.
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:32.080]  Yeah.
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:33.080]  And they just took that money.
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:37.080]  A little bit bigger than that, Joe.
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:38.080]  They don't want to piss you off.
[03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:40.200]  They've done a psychological profile on you.
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:41.360]  They know that they push you.
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:43.640]  You'll stand up and be a leader you are.
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:46.120]  That's why I messed with you was to get you to be that leader.
[03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:48.840]  And now Trump is clear to fire.
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:50.840]  The Death Star is in orbit.
[03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:54.800]  And he's getting ready to find those executive orders.
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:58.760]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:03.240]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[03:05:03.240 --> 03:05:06.480]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:08.240]  That's not backed by some billionaire.
[03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:10.600]  That's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:12.320]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:05:12.320 --> 03:05:18.040]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:19.040]  and freedom of speech.
[03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:22.600]  That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they
[03:05:22.600 --> 03:05:27.280]  actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of
[03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:28.280]  press they wanted.
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:32.320]  But ultimately, we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:36.640]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:41.160]  the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken
[03:05:41.160 --> 03:05:42.160]  through that.
[03:05:42.160 --> 03:05:46.720]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:47.720]  freedom.
[03:05:47.720 --> 03:05:51.440]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:58.440]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[02:49:34.380 --> 03:06:27.000]  which is now blowing up, but the Democratic Socialists of America had an event stories
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:34.800]  again upon Info Wars dot com headline, watch Democratic Socialists destroy themselves.
[03:06:34.800 --> 03:06:38.400]  I mean, they invite so bad, they can't communicate.
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:43.760]  So now five days after we put it out, I'm going to finally get to it because Paul Watson
[03:06:43.760 --> 03:06:51.240]  did a report, but you have to understand these are literally people assaulting reality assaulting
[03:06:51.240 --> 03:06:55.960]  normal behavior and trying to claim control over all language and what you can say and
[03:06:55.960 --> 03:06:56.960]  do.
[03:06:56.960 --> 03:06:57.960]  That's a cult.
[03:06:57.960 --> 03:07:00.760]  Quentin Tarantino, who's put out some good movies.
[03:07:00.760 --> 03:07:03.040]  I think he's put out a bunch of crap movies lately.
[03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:09.960]  I went and saw true once upon a time in Hollywood, which is an alternate reality, kind of like
[03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:12.360]  a David Lynch film, and it's very well done.
[03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:17.320]  And for the period piece and going back to 1969, which I agree with him, that was the
[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:20.240]  end of the golden age, not the fifties.
[03:07:20.240 --> 03:07:23.000]  Give me a lot more respect for Quentin Tarantino.
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:29.600]  They're calling him a racist and sexist for making it like the period really was.
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:38.600]  It's like the BBC is creating period pieces where the Romans are half black.
[03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:40.920]  There were a handful of Roman citizens that were black.
[03:07:40.920 --> 03:07:41.920]  It's not against black people.
[03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:48.520]  They've made a movie about ancient Africa or Shaka Zulu, Shaka Zulu is not going to be
[03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:49.520]  white.
[03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:50.520]  It's green.
[03:07:50.520 --> 03:07:54.040]  007 is a man.
[03:07:54.040 --> 03:07:57.760]  Make it 008 or something and be in a hot check.
[03:07:57.760 --> 03:08:04.160]  But it's all about overriding everything and history, and it's insane.
[03:08:04.160 --> 03:08:06.840]  I love to go see a movie with black people in it.
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:16.240]  It's a good movie, but I mean, a James Bond movie where 007 is a woman just to do it as
[03:08:16.240 --> 03:08:17.240]  a gimmick.
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:22.040]  People just done as a gimmick, and Hollywood got ordered just like Amergate a decade ago.
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:23.040]  Every hero is a woman.
[03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:24.040]  Men are heroes.
[03:08:24.040 --> 03:08:28.120]  Kind of like married with children where every father is an idiot.
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:29.120]  There's an agenda here.
[03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:33.400]  It's not about empowering women, it's about making women delusional like they're Navy
[03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:34.400]  Seals.
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:35.400]  They think they're invincible.
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:36.400]  The Navy Seals aren't invincible.
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:40.360]  It's a lot of Navy Seals killed because they teach them you're invincible.
[03:08:40.360 --> 03:08:43.200]  If you don't buy into that, you're not in the club.
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:47.320]  They Hitler taught the SS they were invincible, you're not.
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:50.680]  Not batch of Navy Seals, it's just well known.
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:54.800]  So this is the type of mental illness that's being pushed, and of course just like Ghostbusters
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:58.920]  being all women, and it failed because the women they got weren't even good.
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:02.040]  They're like, oh, look at a bunch of women, it'll be popular because it's women.
[03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:07.280]  Well, if you'd have got four awesome cast like you did in Ghostbusters of women, yeah,
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:08.280]  it'd be good.
[03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:10.640]  The actresses you got sucked on top of it.
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:14.160]  So there's also this crutch like, well, if it's politically correct, it won't matter
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:15.160]  if it's quality.
[03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:18.360]  Everyone will watch it because it's politically correct because you're just worried about
[03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:25.040]  making it politically correct and rewriting reality, so they're just making it good.
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:26.240]  That's mental illness, folks.
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:28.920]  That's what they're trying to project and control people.
[03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:33.920]  So here's Paul Joseph Watson's report on the sabotage of civilization because you think
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:34.920]  these people are a joke.
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:35.920]  They're raising your kids.
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:39.040]  They're going to teach your kids college you pay all the money for.
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:44.880]  This is the crutches, the brainwashing, the sabotage of civilization, that the globalists
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:46.120]  and the chycoms are funding.
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:49.840]  This is weaponization and this is what it turns people into.
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:51.840]  Here it is.
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:55.640]  Bear in mind as you watch this, that it isn't a comedy sketch.
[03:09:55.640 --> 03:09:56.640]  This is real life.
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:09:58.520]  Is this real life?
[03:09:58.520 --> 03:09:59.520]  Yes.
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:04.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Democratic Socialists of America Convention.
[03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:09.160]  If we want to defeat capitalism, we are going to need a party that will organize working
[03:10:09.160 --> 03:10:13.280]  people to fight for the demands that we want and to win socialism.
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:14.280]  Thank you so much.
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:15.280]  Great.
[03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:16.280]  Quick point of privilege.
[03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:17.280]  Quick point of personal privilege.
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:18.280]  Yes.
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:22.880]  Guys, first of all, James Jackson, Sacramento, he, him, I just want to say, can we please
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:24.120]  keep the chatter to a minimum?
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:27.680]  I'm one of the people who's very, very prone to sensory overload.
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:29.320]  There's a lot of whispering and chatter going on.
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:31.760]  It's making it very difficult for me to focus.
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:35.280]  Can we just, I know it's raw fresh and ready to go, but can we please just keep the chatter
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:36.280]  to a minimum?
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:37.480]  It's affecting my ability to focus.
[03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:38.480]  Thank you.
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:39.480]  Thank you, comrades.
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:40.480]  Sensory overload.
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:43.560]  Yeah, because communist revolutions are notoriously peaceful and quiet.
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:46.480]  What's this weird thing they're doing with their hands?
[03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:48.080]  And to win socialism.
[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:49.760]  It's called jazz hands.
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:50.760]  Jazz hands.
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:55.360]  First used in early 2015 at a feminist NUS conference in the UK.
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:11:00.080]  It's a replacement for clapping because clapping causes anxiety.
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:02.400]  It is also triggering to my anxiety.
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:08.840]  These people are literally afraid of this, but they're totally going to lead a revolution
[03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:12.000]  to overthrow the entire global capitalist system.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  Triggering to my anxiety.
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  Quick point of privilege.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:19.480]  Once again, hi, James Jackson, Sacramento, DSA, he, him, I've already asked people to
[03:11:19.480 --> 03:11:24.360]  be mindful of the chatter of their comrades who are sensitive to sensory overload.
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:27.480]  And that goes double for the heckling and the hissing.
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:30.360]  It is also triggering to my anxiety.
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:33.920]  Like the be comradely doesn't just, isn't just for like, you know, let's keep things
[03:11:33.920 --> 03:11:34.920]  simple.
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:37.480]  It's so that people aren't going to get some economy.
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:40.280]  And so that it doesn't affect their performance as a delegate.
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:41.280]  Okay.
[03:11:41.280 --> 03:11:44.680]  Your need to express yourself is important, but your need to express yourself should
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:55.200]  not drop your bullies, triggering to my anxiety, sensory overload.
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:56.200]  So please don't clap.
[03:11:56.200 --> 03:11:57.200]  Shoot up these.
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:02.520]  There are a lot of disabled comrades and a lot of those are invisible disabilities.
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:06.920]  You mean like the disability of being unable to handle everyday noises without having a
[03:12:06.920 --> 03:12:07.920]  nervous breakdown?
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:08.920]  Yeah.
[03:12:08.920 --> 03:12:10.800]  That's not a disability.
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:13.120]  Don't really talk to anybody.
[03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:15.040]  Don't talk to cops.
[03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:16.960]  Don't talk to MAGA.
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:20.280]  Don't talk to anyone with testosterone levels higher than an amoeba.
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:21.960]  You might have a panic attack.
[03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:23.160]  Triggering to my anxiety.
[03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:32.600]  Take a deep breath, Trump.
[03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:34.320]  We have quiet rooms that are available.
[03:12:34.320 --> 03:12:36.160]  There's a range of options of these, right?
[03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:39.880]  Please don't go into that space with anything that's like an aggressive scent.
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:44.280]  You mean like the stench of the 90 million victims of communism?
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:45.280]  An aggressive scent.
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:46.280]  Point of privilege.
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:50.840]  I'm a Tourette's victim with B.I. when an irrational fear of jazz hands bigots.
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:52.760]  We are safe and we are strong.
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:56.120]  Don't someone forgets to state their pronouns or whispers too loudly.
[03:12:56.120 --> 03:12:58.760]  Then you go cry in the quiet room.
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:12:59.760]  Triggering to my anxiety.
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:00.760]  Jesus Christ.
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:04.320]  For someone who suffers from sensory overload, you sure do shout a lot.
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:05.320]  Triggering to my anxiety.
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:06.800]  Point of personal privilege.
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:07.800]  Yes.
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:12.640]  Please do not use gendered language to address everyone.
[03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:13.640]  Okay.
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:22.280]  You know it is, it's ma'am, six foot four, two hundred and ninety pounds, please do not
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:23.280]  use ma'am.
[03:13:23.280 --> 03:13:24.280]  Oh my God.
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:25.280]  Look, it's not.
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:26.280]  It can't be.
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:27.280]  It's Frankenstein.
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:28.280]  Is it?
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:29.280]  It is ma'am.
[03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:30.280]  And if you're wondering what triggered him.
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:31.720]  Please do not use gendered language.
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:33.880]  The sensory overload, dude.
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:35.280]  Use the word.
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:36.280]  Guys.
[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:37.280]  Guys.
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:40.680]  First of all, James Jackson, Sacramento, he, him.
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:45.520]  I just want to, guys, first of all, James Jackson, Sacramento, he, him.
[03:13:45.520 --> 03:13:47.480]  I just want to, guys.
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:49.960]  Please do not use gendered language.
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:50.960]  It is ma'am.
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:51.960]  Guys.
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:53.240]  Make a deep breath.
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:56.740]  It's an insane asylum.
[03:13:56.740 --> 03:13:58.140]  Point of personal privilege.
[03:13:58.140 --> 03:14:01.400]  How in the holy f**k do you even get through a normal day?
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:02.960]  It's an open air insane asylum.
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:07.240]  Leave your house, operate in society and get back without emotionally liquefying.
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:12.140]  How are you going to even host a convention when you spend the entire first day getting
[03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:15.120]  triggered by each other's words and mannerisms?
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:16.120]  Triggering to my anxiety.
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:20.460]  I've seen less neurotic people at a bipolar incels anonymous meetup.
[03:14:20.460 --> 03:14:31.260]  up DSA. Sensory overload. Oh, we're almost there. Just this. But thank you. Triggering
[03:14:31.260 --> 03:14:36.780]  to my anxiety. It must be something in the water. Joy. Oh yeah, I love how Linda Sorser
[03:14:36.780 --> 03:14:46.020]  is there. What a bunch of low energy weirdos. I know vegans find it hard to muster up energy,
[03:14:46.020 --> 03:14:51.260]  but I've seen more enthusiasm at a Joe Biden retirement home visit. But Biden better buck
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:56.260]  up his ideas because these people are taking over the Democratic Party. These are the people
[03:14:56.260 --> 03:15:03.860]  Democrats increasingly have to pander to 2020 really is going to be an absolute show. Triggering
[03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:11.020]  to my anxiety. All right, as a Paul Joseph Watson report, ladies and gentlemen, Matt
[03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:16.580]  Bracken is going to be taken over and covering it all on the other side. But what a crazy
[03:15:16.580 --> 03:15:25.060]  day. Trump is set to take action against big tech that is very, very exciting. And we've
[03:15:25.060 --> 03:15:28.100]  given you a lot of the inside baseball on what's on the table, what they're trying to
[03:15:28.100 --> 03:15:33.380]  get the president to do. But what we think is going to be coming out of this, but regardless,
[03:15:33.380 --> 03:15:37.500]  China underestimated America and Trump, big tech underestimated all of you and beautiful
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:40.620]  things are happening. Please don't forget your financial support makes it all possible.
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:46.060]  I want to thank you for that mega sales going to end soon in four store.com will be right

[03:17:22.460 --> 03:17:26.540]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[03:17:26.540 --> 03:17:31.100]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[03:17:31.100 --> 03:17:35.140]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[03:17:35.140 --> 03:17:39.140]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you
[03:17:39.140 --> 03:17:43.420]  owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax

[03:17:51.540 --> 03:17:56.820]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:17:56.820 --> 03:18:00.860]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot
[03:18:00.860 --> 03:18:04.980]  of people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody
[03:18:04.980 --> 03:18:09.380]  agrees with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go
[03:18:09.380 --> 03:18:13.420]  to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the
[03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:15.940]  eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[03:18:15.940 --> 03:18:19.020]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's
[03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:22.300]  the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be
[03:18:22.300 --> 03:18:23.300]  praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:26.340]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:31.020]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you on air
[03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:34.540]  until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.540 --> 03:18:39.420]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles
[03:18:39.420 --> 03:18:43.620]  and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.620 --> 03:18:46.860]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to
[03:18:46.860 --> 03:18:52.060]  you or your show, no first act that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:54.820]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:54.820 --> 03:19:00.180]  Last night I'm on info wars.com and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[03:19:00.180 --> 03:19:05.900]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned a Betsy Ross, but also another just classic
[03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:11.980]  American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake superimposed over. And on the back,
[03:19:11.980 --> 03:19:15.380]  America's back info wars.com. But what's better than just an American flag about a
[03:19:15.380 --> 03:19:19.100]  don't tread on me under the flag, say don't trail the American flag. It's a perfect combo.
[03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:22.100]  So great minds think alike. I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up
[03:19:22.100 --> 03:19:27.220]  with the exact same similar design. It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt
[03:19:27.220 --> 03:19:32.460]  inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt. But it's a battle
[03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:36.500]  tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter. And again, on the back, it says
[03:19:36.500 --> 03:19:43.420]  America's back info wars.com. 4,000 of these babies. And that's it. So we've got the Betsy
[03:19:43.420 --> 03:19:48.900]  Ross version and the American flag version at info or store.com. You printed the USA
[03:19:48.900 --> 03:19:57.340]  right now info or store.com will be right back. The most banned broadcast in the world.
[03:19:57.340 --> 03:20:23.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken.
[03:20:23.980 --> 03:20:36.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Okay, you've got me for the rest of the hour. And
[03:20:36.140 --> 03:20:42.420]  this is a kind of going to be a starting with a history lesson, then talking about current
[03:20:42.420 --> 03:20:48.540]  events. And then I'm going to push it into the future, get up my crystal ball and shine
[03:20:48.540 --> 03:20:58.020]  it up. You know, the reason that I wrote my first novel shortly after, after 9 11 was
[03:20:58.020 --> 03:21:05.500]  I could see these, these trends already in play. And I wanted to get enough of a reputation
[03:21:05.500 --> 03:21:11.660]  for predicting things way in advance that when this fourth turning or whatever you want
[03:21:11.660 --> 03:21:19.100]  to call it when these this current situation began to unfold, I'd have some credibility.
[03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:25.220]  And I suppose that to a certain extent, you can say that that it worked. I'm one, I'm
[03:21:25.220 --> 03:21:30.780]  one info wars, I'm on the Alex Jones show. And I've got an audience. And that's why I
[03:21:30.780 --> 03:21:37.020]  wrote the books. So that that people could read these novels, and then say, you know,
[03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:41.540]  10, 15 years ago, well, that could never happen, you could never have, you know, corrupt
[03:21:41.540 --> 03:21:48.980]  federal law enforcement officers running false flag operations. Yeah, you could. It was called
[03:21:48.980 --> 03:21:56.700]  fast and furious. And it was intended to result in in hundreds of dead Mexicans to be blamed
[03:21:56.700 --> 03:22:02.860]  on the Second Amendment. And going back to that period, with with that, if you remember
[03:22:02.860 --> 03:22:09.500]  at that time, the Attorney General was was Lynch. The Secretary of State was Hillary
[03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:18.060]  Clinton. And President Obama, they were constantly talking about 80% of the guns found in Mexican
[03:22:18.060 --> 03:22:25.220]  crime scenes at murder scenes came from America or even 90%. This was all part of a plan to
[03:22:25.220 --> 03:22:30.620]  discredit the Second Amendment. Why am I going back to old history fast and furious? The
[03:22:30.620 --> 03:22:39.420]  Second Amendment to the left is the holy grail of conservatism. It's the it's the bulwark.
[03:22:39.420 --> 03:22:46.740]  It's the barrier that they have to smash before they can ever take full power in this country.
[03:22:46.740 --> 03:22:53.900]  As long as Americans are armed, they are in a in a checkmate situation where they can't
[03:22:53.900 --> 03:23:01.180]  sweep the board, clear the board and force their socialist utopia down their throat.
[03:23:01.180 --> 03:23:09.940]  And these the the leftists will use every method possible, because the goal is a forced
[03:23:09.940 --> 03:23:17.140]  socialism. First, destroy the Second Amendment. How do you do that? Well, a lot of it is is
[03:23:17.140 --> 03:23:23.940]  psychological preparation. You know, you have you have movie after movie, plus the video
[03:23:23.940 --> 03:23:32.100]  games, everything else, lowering the bar for people who are or mentally labile to just
[03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:36.180]  go out and take a gun and do something for kicks. If you remember the movie, Natural
[03:23:36.180 --> 03:23:42.620]  Born Killers, very sick film. It's almost as if they were they were saying, look, the
[03:23:42.620 --> 03:23:47.780]  left is saying, look, before we can get rid of the Second Amendment, we have to just totally
[03:23:47.780 --> 03:23:54.420]  turn guns from a from a good wholesome thing into just an evil spurge of society. And to
[03:23:54.420 --> 03:23:59.940]  do that, we're going to need not only widespread rampant crime in our inner cities, which of
[03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:06.660]  course we see with with, you know, practically mass murders every weekend in Chicago. Nobody
[03:24:06.660 --> 03:24:12.060]  cares. It doesn't get the press. It doesn't suit the narrative. But what they really want
[03:24:12.060 --> 03:24:20.180]  is to trigger a right wing and left wing into committing massacres with guns. This is this
[03:24:20.180 --> 03:24:27.380]  is all to turn Americans against guns in general. Even here in conservative Florida, there's
[03:24:27.380 --> 03:24:31.980]  a there's a referendum that they're passing around the petitions. Now they want to get
[03:24:31.980 --> 03:24:40.620]  an assault weapons ban on the on the ballot for 2020. That will, among other things, force
[03:24:40.620 --> 03:24:46.080]  people who currently own so called assault weapons, these are, you know, semi automatic
[03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:54.660]  rifles, people who currently own them to register them. Now the the more naive on the left think
[03:24:54.660 --> 03:24:58.540]  that this at a first level of thinking, they think, well, you know, people will register
[03:24:58.540 --> 03:25:04.220]  them then we'll know who has them. But at the second or third level of thinking, they know
[03:25:04.220 --> 03:25:11.060]  that conservatives won't register them. This will turn tens of thousands of Floridians,
[03:25:11.060 --> 03:25:18.740]  if this wall passes into felons, who will be at the mercy, for example, of an ex girlfriend
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:25.660]  calling the red flag hotline and saying, I know my boyfriend's got an AR 15. I'm wondering
[03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:31.580]  if he registered it. This is a way to just set society against itself, you know, tearing
[03:25:31.580 --> 03:25:36.900]  into itself. Will you will you trust that your ex wife or ex girlfriend or or other
[03:25:36.900 --> 03:25:41.820]  family member, liberal family member that doesn't like your politics, won't drop a dime
[03:25:41.820 --> 03:25:48.700]  on you to the red flag law after this kind of law passes? You know, the red flag laws
[03:25:48.700 --> 03:25:55.180]  in general, they sound good. It's going to be an easier sell, you know, President Trump
[03:25:55.180 --> 03:26:00.660]  he seems to be going for it'll be an easier sell than another assault weapons ban. But
[03:26:00.660 --> 03:26:05.460]  we can see from history what happens with this kind of well intentioned law.
[03:26:05.460 --> 03:26:12.620]  2025 years ago, they passed asset forfeiture laws to go after the narco traffickers, you
[03:26:12.620 --> 03:26:18.780]  know, the the Colombian, the huge the big importers that were buying entire buildings
[03:26:18.780 --> 03:26:24.140]  in Miami, they said, we'll have to just attack their assets. Don't worry. It's just for these
[03:26:24.140 --> 03:26:31.260]  big kingpins. And that that went completely widespread to the point where people just
[03:26:31.260 --> 03:26:37.220]  driving in a car get pulled over, they find cash that you can't account for, they just
[03:26:37.220 --> 03:26:44.940]  take the cash, or they take your vehicle even. So we can see with the asset forfeiture laws,
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:50.380]  how this is going to go. Once the red flag laws are in place, and you have a liberal
[03:26:50.380 --> 03:26:56.580]  town or a liberal county, the people on the red flag panels are going to be people who
[03:26:56.580 --> 03:27:01.820]  hate the Second Amendment and hate guns. Do you think they're ever going to deny a red
[03:27:01.820 --> 03:27:07.940]  flag request? Everybody that comes to them and says so and so is dangerous and has guns.
[03:27:07.940 --> 03:27:13.260]  It's going to be a rubber stamp. It reminds me of the FISA court. We were told, oh, this
[03:27:13.260 --> 03:27:18.740]  will only be used in exceptional circumstances. We need it to protect ourselves from foreign
[03:27:18.740 --> 03:27:23.940]  terrorists and spies. And these judges, they'll be very professional. Well, it turned into
[03:27:23.940 --> 03:27:31.220]  a total rubber stamp. The FISA court approved something like 99% of all of the warrants
[03:27:31.220 --> 03:27:39.140]  to completely spy on Americans. 99% automatic rubber stamp. In fact, Peter Strzok had a
[03:27:39.140 --> 03:27:45.020]  friend on the FISA court. So we can see an example of very likely corruption at the highest
[03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:51.900]  levels. So as these red flag laws work their way through the courts, you can just assume
[03:27:51.900 --> 03:27:58.660]  that they're not going to be put under any kind of a check because the liberal social
[03:27:58.660 --> 03:28:06.820]  justice warrior judges who see their part of this entire plan to be the judicial rubber
[03:28:06.820 --> 03:28:15.460]  stamp on any leftist law or plan, they're going to approve every red flag, confiscation,
[03:28:15.460 --> 03:28:21.940]  raid. We've already seen them lead to deaths where the police roll up. Somebody doesn't
[03:28:21.940 --> 03:28:26.460]  know what's going on. There's a shootout and the homeowner is killed. That already has
[03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:34.180]  happened. So this is another method of turning Americans against Americans, leading to more
[03:28:34.180 --> 03:28:41.500]  violence, more calls for security crackdowns. And this is going to all be timed so that
[03:28:41.500 --> 03:28:48.020]  as we roll into 2020, Americans are going to look at conservatives as crazed gun nuts.
[03:28:48.020 --> 03:28:51.820]  And we have to get, you know, we have to vote in the Democrats. I'll continue this on the
[03:28:51.820 --> 03:28:53.860]  other side.

[03:30:53.900 --> 03:30:59.260]  Before I started working at info wars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowarstore.com
[03:30:59.260 --> 03:31:03.860]  but also the products at infowarstore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[03:31:03.860 --> 03:31:09.260]  infowarstore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA force plus. Now
[03:31:09.260 --> 03:31:13.220]  I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[03:31:13.220 --> 03:31:18.460]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA. And so I started to look into the science
[03:31:18.460 --> 03:31:24.700]  and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[03:31:24.700 --> 03:31:29.380]  your telomeres. So I started looking into DNA force plus but it's expensive. Why? Because
[03:31:29.380 --> 03:31:35.380]  it is an elite supplement. And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[03:31:35.380 --> 03:31:40.860]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went. But DNA force plus is
[03:31:40.860 --> 03:31:46.060]  still there. It is the elite supplement. I get excited when DNA force plus is on sale
[03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:52.060]  because I know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA force plus at

[03:16:27.080 --> 03:33:35.980]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken. You know, just following
[03:33:35.980 --> 03:33:41.820]  the news over the last couple of years, I feel like a lot of what's been happening in
[03:33:41.820 --> 03:33:47.940]  my novels, it's just, it's like turning the pages. I'm not trying to brag, but I mean,
[03:33:47.940 --> 03:33:54.100]  I've been projecting this and predicting this for more than 15 years now. And when I see
[03:33:54.100 --> 03:33:59.820]  things like the Las Vegas massacre, still very mysterious, the motives and, you know,
[03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:06.420]  the people behind it. That's it. That guy was an adult, a professional, had a pilot's
[03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:13.900]  license, an entrepreneur. Yet somehow he found himself up in that building firing down one
[03:34:13.900 --> 03:34:22.980]  a packed crowd. Then we see things like Parkland, where the kid was obviously crazy and people
[03:34:22.980 --> 03:34:29.500]  had been calling the local police, the FBI. Nothing was ever done. He was searched every
[03:34:29.500 --> 03:34:36.020]  day when he went to school. He was considered so crazy, but nothing was ever done. It's
[03:34:36.020 --> 03:34:43.260]  almost seems like a pattern where these emotionally disturbed individuals are being messaged by
[03:34:43.260 --> 03:34:51.860]  the media to try and go out and beat the score. I have to think that that the Dayton Ohio shooter,
[03:34:51.860 --> 03:34:58.980]  he had the, his, it's an AM pistol, like an AR shorty pistol, you know, with a very short
[03:34:58.980 --> 03:35:05.420]  stock so qualifies as a pistol. He killed his sister and almost killed his best friend
[03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:12.500]  and his, and his killed his sister's boyfriend. He had the, the weapon in his car and he had
[03:35:12.500 --> 03:35:19.020]  probably in a duffle bag. So he went to that with them to this bar, went into the bar scouting
[03:35:19.020 --> 03:35:24.500]  it out, wearing a regular t-shirt, left the bar, went and retrieved the weapons. And
[03:35:24.500 --> 03:35:29.620]  I think that he had probably been planning something like this for a long time. But why
[03:35:29.620 --> 03:35:36.220]  did he do it when he did it? I think that, that the El Paso event triggered him into
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:41.700]  acting immediately. And I think that his goal, well, obviously he was trying to get inside
[03:35:41.700 --> 03:35:47.780]  the Ned Pepper's bar, where he could have had something even worse than the Orlando
[03:35:47.780 --> 03:35:53.700]  Pulse nightclub shooting. He was, thank goodness, the police were so fast running towards the
[03:35:53.700 --> 03:35:59.780]  firing instead of away, like all the civilians. The police put him down like the mad dog he
[03:35:59.780 --> 03:36:05.700]  was. But if he had gotten inside of Ned Pepper's and he was close, he collapsed right there
[03:36:05.700 --> 03:36:11.540]  at the, at the doorstep of the, of the nightclub. If he had gotten into a, a killing pen like
[03:36:11.540 --> 03:36:16.620]  that, he might have killed a hundred people or more. He had hundreds of rounds of ammo
[03:36:16.620 --> 03:36:23.940]  in those, and that looks like a Betamax double drum. He was out to set a record. You know,
[03:36:23.940 --> 03:36:31.020]  the El Paso, you could say right winger in terms of the motivation and anti-immigration.
[03:36:31.020 --> 03:36:36.560]  Certainly the El Paso shooter was in many ways no conservative. You know, he's for universal
[03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:43.100]  basic income and, and a lot of socialist schemes. But the Dayton shooter seems to have wanted
[03:36:43.100 --> 03:36:49.620]  to counter and one up him. So you can see we're now into a very dangerous period where these
[03:36:49.620 --> 03:36:55.940]  emotional wrecks with weapons that they already possess, they've never been institutionalized.
[03:36:55.940 --> 03:36:59.620]  They don't have a criminal record. So they've got a clean background check. They're going
[03:36:59.620 --> 03:37:07.140]  to get the weapons. This is all filling in like part of a pattern, which is, which is
[03:37:07.140 --> 03:37:14.060]  buttressing the liberal argument that firearms are just too dangerous. These high capacity
[03:37:14.060 --> 03:37:19.620]  magazines, these so-called assault rifles, they're just too dangerous. And it's a constant
[03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:25.500]  sell in the mainstream media, even in conservative media. It's difficult to make the argument
[03:37:25.500 --> 03:37:30.060]  against it. But you have to go and go back in history and look at the big picture of
[03:37:30.060 --> 03:37:38.020]  what's going on. You know, when these mass shooters do their terrible thing, they kill
[03:37:38.020 --> 03:37:46.620]  10 or 20 or in Las Vegas dozens. But when socialists take power and disarm their people,
[03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:50.620]  always in the name of public safety, they never say, we're going to disarm you so that
[03:37:50.620 --> 03:37:56.860]  we can wipe out our enemies. When socialists take power and disarm their people, they can
[03:37:56.860 --> 03:38:04.020]  then kill by the millions. This was done in Armenia under Ataturk, who is called a Turkish
[03:38:04.020 --> 03:38:11.020]  socialist in Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin, communism, union of Soviet socialist
[03:38:11.020 --> 03:38:16.620]  republics. It was done in Germany, national socialism. It was done in China, the People's
[03:38:16.620 --> 03:38:23.060]  Republic of China, communist country that was done in Cambodia. But in every case, the people
[03:38:23.060 --> 03:38:28.340]  are disarmed first. Well, they can't just come out and say, look, we're going to do fast
[03:38:28.340 --> 03:38:33.100]  and furious or we're going to trigger these insane people into mass murders because we
[03:38:33.100 --> 03:38:40.500]  want to disarm you so that we can force socialism on you. They just couch it purely in terms
[03:38:40.500 --> 03:38:47.180]  of public safety. And that's an easy way to sell it. But in every case, every case of
[03:38:47.180 --> 03:38:54.540]  these genocides, first, they have to disarm the population. Every time it's without fail.
[03:38:54.540 --> 03:38:59.140]  And in fact, the Second Amendment, thank God for our founding fathers and their wisdom,
[03:38:59.140 --> 03:39:06.580]  the Second Amendment is the big bulwark against this, this what would be a genocide. And this,
[03:39:06.580 --> 03:39:13.780]  this is how it works. And you can go through history. Every case. Socialists take power.
[03:39:13.780 --> 03:39:21.620]  They have utopian schemes. I was just watching that clip in the last segment where Bernie
[03:39:21.620 --> 03:39:29.100]  Sanders is talking to Joe Rogan about the $15 minimum wage. How can Joe Rogan not laugh
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:34.300]  in his face and say, dude, three years ago, you were saying Venezuela is showing the world
[03:39:34.300 --> 03:39:40.700]  the way to social justice and prosperity. How are we in the, how in the world can any sane
[03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:47.340]  individual listen to somebody who thinks that Venezuela is the path forward. You know,
[03:39:47.340 --> 03:39:52.380]  you should be laughed off the stage anywhere you go. Everything you've done is failed.
[03:39:52.380 --> 03:39:57.900]  So let's assume that socialists, when they come into power, they've got these utopian
[03:39:57.900 --> 03:40:03.700]  economic schemes dreamed up in a faculty lounge. They're going to then wreck the economy.
[03:40:03.700 --> 03:40:09.780]  They'll wreck it. They'll say, okay, the $25 minimum wage, whatever it takes, and everybody
[03:40:09.780 --> 03:40:16.220]  has to have, you know, the board of directors on down has to exactly reflect society. This
[03:40:16.220 --> 03:40:22.300]  many albino transsexual midgets, you have to have it or you can't get a business license.
[03:40:22.300 --> 03:40:27.900]  So the economy will be wrecked. And this is, you think, well, geez, why would the socialists
[03:40:27.900 --> 03:40:34.140]  do that? Are they just completely stupid every time? No, when they wreck the economy, phase
[03:40:34.140 --> 03:40:39.500]  two comes into play. They'll never go on television and say, you know what, my socialist
[03:40:39.500 --> 03:40:45.820]  schemes were doomed to failure from the start. They never say that. They say those conservative
[03:40:45.820 --> 03:40:52.940]  reactionary capitalists are sabotaging our perfect, wonderful five year plan. We gave
[03:40:52.940 --> 03:40:58.060]  orders to the factory directors, and they're not obeying. We told them what to produce.
[03:40:58.060 --> 03:41:02.860]  We told them how to load the bread trucks and distribute it for free at the food center,
[03:41:02.860 --> 03:41:08.900]  and they're just refusing. So they use the wrecked economy as an excuse to target their
[03:41:08.900 --> 03:41:15.980]  class enemies, either class or racial or both enemies or religious. And then there's so
[03:41:15.980 --> 03:41:21.620]  much anger in the society because of, you know, food lines, food riots, that it's an
[03:41:21.620 --> 03:41:27.580]  easy sell that we've got to go take out our class enemies. So every genocide follows
[03:41:27.580 --> 03:41:37.060]  this pattern, wreck an economy, blame a target group, whether it's the Kulaks in Russia,
[03:41:37.060 --> 03:41:43.940]  the Kulak class meeting, somebody that had two cows, or the Jews in Germany, the tenant
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:52.260]  landowners in China. In every case, they wreck the economy, use that as an excuse to target
[03:41:52.260 --> 03:41:58.380]  their enemies, and then wipe them out. Once their enemies are wiped out, like in Cuba,
[03:41:58.380 --> 03:42:04.940]  for example, there's no chance of a counterrevolution because everybody that might have even thought
[03:42:04.940 --> 03:42:10.860]  about fomenting a counterrevolution against this communist socialist takeover, they're
[03:42:10.860 --> 03:42:16.780]  dead. They're in the ground. This is how it works. If you want to make a communist revolution
[03:42:16.780 --> 03:42:22.700]  possible, you have to disarm the people, then you wreck the economy, then you blame the
[03:42:22.700 --> 03:42:28.700]  wrecked economy on your class enemies, and then you wipe them out. After that, it doesn't
[03:42:28.700 --> 03:42:35.660]  matter if the economy is wrecked, because as the communist overlords, you'll be in charge.
[03:42:35.660 --> 03:42:41.380]  Even in North Korea, starving North Korea, the bosses live like kings, and that's the
[03:42:41.380 --> 03:42:48.180]  point of it. It's all just a sigh up in the scam. The cell socialism put the elites into
[03:42:48.180 --> 03:42:55.380]  permanent power. We'll be back after the break and Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[03:42:55.380 --> 03:42:58.820]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because
[03:42:58.820 --> 03:43:03.260]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political, or legal for their illicit activities
[03:43:03.260 --> 03:43:07.180]  over two decades. And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the
[03:43:07.180 --> 03:43:10.500]  members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the
[03:43:10.500 --> 03:43:14.420]  public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic
[03:43:14.420 --> 03:43:18.220]  consequence to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change, and they will become
[03:43:18.220 --> 03:43:21.980]  the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran
[03:43:21.980 --> 03:43:25.820]  American politics and ran American economy, almost into the ground until we were able
[03:43:25.820 --> 03:43:29.740]  to recover after the Great Depression. The informer's audience is the fuel that flames
[03:43:29.740 --> 03:43:34.500]  the light of liberty across the world, to make real the actions of independent free
[03:43:34.500 --> 03:43:38.760]  speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:42.780]  is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other, to try to meddle
[03:43:42.780 --> 03:43:46.500]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts. And then the whopper of telling us the whole
[03:43:46.500 --> 03:43:50.420]  time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't
[03:43:50.420 --> 03:43:53.420]  what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[03:43:53.420 --> 03:43:59.940]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[03:43:59.940 --> 03:44:05.500]  are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being
[03:44:05.500 --> 03:44:11.940]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change. And how it
[03:44:11.940 --> 03:44:17.500]  changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system
[03:44:17.500 --> 03:44:24.860]  fails. The system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant. And grocery stores
[03:44:24.860 --> 03:44:31.100]  could be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will
[03:44:31.100 --> 03:44:36.140]  give you a fighting chance in the next level. And being without puts you at the mercy of
[03:44:36.140 --> 03:44:42.940]  others or makes you a slave to a dying system. Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity

[03:44:55.140 --> 03:44:59.060]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[03:44:59.060 --> 03:45:02.780]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements. And that if you go back five, six years ago
[03:45:02.780 --> 03:45:06.100]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk
[03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:09.580]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were. And I'd have
[03:45:09.580 --> 03:45:13.140]  doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good. And instead the last few years,
[03:45:13.140 --> 03:45:16.420]  I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us. Or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing
[03:45:16.420 --> 03:45:19.020]  people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful
[03:45:19.020 --> 03:45:24.260]  they work. And the left always has headlines everywhere. Jones sells unapproved supplements
[03:45:24.260 --> 03:45:29.740]  that he claims are supplements. No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that
[03:45:29.740 --> 03:45:33.300]  a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look
[03:45:33.300 --> 03:45:36.940]  at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them. And all drugs
[03:45:36.940 --> 03:45:40.900]  are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different
[03:45:40.900 --> 03:45:44.380]  things. And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with mother nature,
[03:45:44.380 --> 03:45:49.740]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest info or store.com or
[03:45:49.740 --> 03:45:56.860]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. If you want to bet on your future,
[03:45:56.860 --> 03:46:01.020]  if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the chai comms
[03:46:01.020 --> 03:46:05.220]  with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM
[03:46:05.220 --> 03:46:09.100]  and CNN, the Chinese government does. It's all coming out. Democrats aren't gonna stop.
[03:46:09.100 --> 03:46:11.980]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now. Like we're starting to get some purchase
[03:46:11.980 --> 03:46:15.540]  trying to start a fire. They got some fire going all the physical attacks, shootings,
[03:46:15.540 --> 03:46:19.740]  bombings, ice facilities, getting attacked, dead people everywhere. It's on folks. And
[03:46:19.740 --> 03:46:23.220]  if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane. So
[03:46:23.220 --> 03:46:26.700]  now more than you've ever done yourself for me, for everybody, spread the word about
[03:46:26.700 --> 03:46:31.020]  this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV, tell folks about info wars.com, four slash
[03:46:31.020 --> 03:46:36.260]  show. But that said, I want to fight hard and I need you to buy the products at infoworkstore.com,

[03:46:49.940 --> 03:46:57.820]  the devil worshiping, Satanist and their off world controllers.
[03:46:57.820 --> 03:47:18.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[03:47:18.820 --> 03:47:28.700]  Alex Jones and now your host, Matt Bracken. Yeah, I've been, I've been writing and blogging
[03:47:28.700 --> 03:47:35.060]  about this for years now. And it certainly seems like we're going to the coming to a
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:42.420]  climax here, because for sure. And I just call them communists. Let's, let's be frank.
[03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:47.620]  The globalists are communists, you know, the hammer and sickle isn't a good sell right
[03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:53.180]  now because people will bring up the you know, 100 million plus murdered in the 20th century.
[03:47:53.180 --> 03:48:00.620]  But they've never quit. They just morph into another disguise. And today the disguise is
[03:48:00.620 --> 03:48:07.460]  globalism. So when you see anybody on television, whether they call themselves a Democrat politician
[03:48:07.460 --> 03:48:14.580]  or a non governmental organization, a charity person, if they are for open borders, they
[03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:24.460]  are a communist. Because they see America as the last holdout, the citadel against globalism
[03:48:24.460 --> 03:48:32.980]  being victorious. And Trump is really to them the worst, the anti Christ against globalism
[03:48:32.980 --> 03:48:39.420]  is Trump. Because not only as did he defeat Hillary that he thought was that the globalist
[03:48:39.420 --> 03:48:44.940]  communists thought were a shoe in not only did he defeat Hillary, but he's been he's
[03:48:44.940 --> 03:48:50.380]  led to a nationalist resurgence in much of the rest of the world. You know, we know
[03:48:50.380 --> 03:48:56.700]  that this has happened in Italy with Salvini stopping the NGO human trafficking ships coming
[03:48:56.700 --> 03:49:03.100]  to Italy. We've seen it with Orban and Hungary. We've even seen it in India. Americans don't
[03:49:03.100 --> 03:49:10.140]  follow this too much. But the cashmere situation is an Indian nationalist who is not taking
[03:49:10.140 --> 03:49:17.260]  the crap from the Islamists. And he's being very strong on cashmere and saying, look,
[03:49:17.260 --> 03:49:22.180]  it's part of India, there's going to be no special rules. So we're seeing a pushback
[03:49:22.180 --> 03:49:29.500]  against the globalists and Islamists across the world. And this is causing the globalist
[03:49:29.500 --> 03:49:37.020]  communists, the Democrats to panic because they they see 2020 as an absolute wood or
[03:49:37.020 --> 03:49:44.980]  new watershed moment. They will do absolutely anything to win in 2020. They thought that
[03:49:44.980 --> 03:49:50.780]  they had it in the bag in 2016, that their level of fraud was going to be sufficient.
[03:49:50.780 --> 03:49:55.900]  And they still lost the electoral college, bigly. But they're not going to make that
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:50:02.900]  same mistake in 2020. If, for example, in Broward County, Florida, they had 60,000 fake
[03:50:02.900 --> 03:50:09.780]  votes stashed away in, you know, trunks, they missed by 15,000. You can bet that all of
[03:50:09.780 --> 03:50:15.780]  these counties will have 200,000 fake votes ready to go, plus the vote harvesting and
[03:50:15.780 --> 03:50:25.020]  everything else. So the left is going to absolutely see nothing that they won't do in terms of
[03:50:25.020 --> 03:50:32.180]  vote fraud, knowing that the judges, who are their comrades wearing a black robe, but they
[03:50:32.180 --> 03:50:38.420]  underneath they've got the hammer and sickle in their heart. The judges are absolute shills.
[03:50:38.420 --> 03:50:45.140]  They're just communists. The mainstream media, they're the propaganda arm of the globalist
[03:50:45.140 --> 03:50:51.620]  communists. You know, they would love to destroy conservative media, alternative media. That's
[03:50:51.620 --> 03:50:57.660]  what we're seeing with the, you know, with the de-platforming from social media and the
[03:50:57.660 --> 03:51:05.580]  algorithm bias and stacking at Google, which is completely happy, as Alex says, completely
[03:51:05.580 --> 03:51:11.700]  happy to work with the Chinese regime, which slaughtered 100 million of its own people.
[03:51:11.700 --> 03:51:19.420]  Because to these globalists slash communists, the ends justify the means. Chairman Mao said
[03:51:19.420 --> 03:51:24.420]  you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs or maybe 100 million human eggs.
[03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:31.340]  But that's how it goes. Because to utopians, us deplorables, we're just an impediment to
[03:51:31.340 --> 03:51:37.380]  get out of the way. Unfortunately, from their perspective, us deplorables have this nasty
[03:51:37.380 --> 03:51:43.580]  habit of collecting and training with firearms. And that's like the, that's the bell on the
[03:51:43.580 --> 03:51:47.940]  cat. They just, you know, if we could only put the bell on the cat, but how can we put
[03:51:47.940 --> 03:51:55.060]  the bell on the cat? We can't. The cat will eat us, you know, Democrat rats. So it's,
[03:51:55.060 --> 03:51:59.740]  how do we get rid of the assault rifles, the semi-automatics, which would include eventually
[03:51:59.740 --> 03:52:06.500]  pistols, you know, anything with a detachable magazine? That's their problem. How do we
[03:52:06.500 --> 03:52:14.420]  get rid of it? Well, we get rid of it by associating in the mass mind the slaughter of innocents
[03:52:14.420 --> 03:52:19.140]  with guns. In fact, Hollywood, and you can see that, see it rolling right now. There's
[03:52:19.140 --> 03:52:26.460]  a film coming out in the fall called The Hunt, where elite billionaires, Gulfstream jet-flying
[03:52:26.460 --> 03:52:33.540]  billionaires are going to kidnap deplorables, you know, country folk from Mississippi or
[03:52:33.540 --> 03:52:39.700]  Montana, and then use them for hunting. They say, oh, it's just, it's just a parody, it's
[03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:45.460]  sarcasm, it's a joke. Can you imagine them making a film where blacks were caught and
[03:52:45.460 --> 03:52:52.820]  released and hunted as a joke? This is all part of psychological battle space preparation.
[03:52:52.820 --> 03:52:57.980]  You can extend it back to natural born killers and all the way through where they're lowering
[03:52:57.980 --> 03:53:04.140]  the bar on the mentally labelled to think this is a cool way to affirm my existence
[03:53:04.140 --> 03:53:10.660]  on this planet. I have no friends, I have no contacts. Everybody that comes in contact
[03:53:10.660 --> 03:53:16.260]  with me breaks off contact. Well, I'll force the world to pay attention. And my goal is
[03:53:16.260 --> 03:53:21.660]  to beat the score. How many did the Parkland shooter get? How many did the Orlando shooter
[03:53:21.660 --> 03:53:29.020]  get? When I go into Ned Peppers with a double beta drum magazine and 500 rounds of ammo,
[03:53:29.020 --> 03:53:34.940]  I'm going to set the record. And the media stokes this. They do this intentionally. And
[03:53:34.940 --> 03:53:42.900]  the reason is to psychologically associate in the minds of Americans guns with evil criminal
[03:53:42.900 --> 03:53:50.580]  acts, not with guns as a safeguard against ultimate socialist takeover and genocide.
[03:53:50.580 --> 03:53:57.740]  You know, things were even changing in Switzerland. But until recently, every adult male in Switzerland
[03:53:57.740 --> 03:54:03.620]  does a short period of military service. And then as a reservist, inactive reservist for
[03:54:03.620 --> 03:54:10.860]  the rest of their life, they keep a fully automatic battle rifle and ammunition at home. No massacres.
[03:54:10.860 --> 03:54:16.860]  Well, something that people often say, you know, Switzerland, it's never been invaded.
[03:54:16.860 --> 03:54:23.700]  It's never been conquered since they've had this ethos of defending the country, of people
[03:54:23.700 --> 03:54:29.140]  having the weapons at home. But something that people don't consider is at the same
[03:54:29.140 --> 03:54:36.940]  time in Switzerland, there has never been tyrant. There has never been a dictator ever. You
[03:54:36.940 --> 03:54:43.820]  look across Europe, dictators come frequently every century. From French Revolution onward,
[03:54:43.820 --> 03:54:49.780]  you see dictators, Napoleon Hitler, not in Switzerland, because the people are armed
[03:54:49.780 --> 03:54:56.940]  and they recognize the small chance of somebody misusing firearms where a dozen or 20 might
[03:54:56.940 --> 03:55:06.660]  die is like a small insurance payment against being disarmed, which opens you up to socialist
[03:55:06.660 --> 03:55:18.220]  tyrants slaughtering by the millions. Now, this is my first book, wrote it 2002, 2003.
[03:55:18.220 --> 03:55:22.260]  It's free on Kindle today and tomorrow just because I want people to read it, get the
[03:55:22.260 --> 03:55:31.260]  idea in your head. Not every massacre is necessarily what you might be led to believe. I have
[03:55:31.260 --> 03:55:35.940]  grave doubts about the manifesto written by the El Paso shooter. People that know him
[03:55:35.940 --> 03:55:41.860]  say there's no way he wrote that. He could have been a weaponized artist, you know, set
[03:55:41.860 --> 03:55:48.500]  out lured in essence into committing this. One of the short stories that I wrote, it's
[03:55:48.500 --> 03:55:55.740]  called Professor Raoul X and it's about an evil college professor who seeks these people
[03:55:55.740 --> 03:56:02.860]  out and mentors them and twists their minds and turns them into human weapons. I'm not
[03:56:02.860 --> 03:56:07.660]  saying that this has happened in any of these cases. Maybe it's just media, social media
[03:56:07.660 --> 03:56:15.420]  interaction that's doing it. But in this climate, I totally expect more of these shootings.
[03:56:15.420 --> 03:56:23.540]  It'll be part of a symphony that's orchestrated to change the climate in this country to where
[03:56:23.540 --> 03:56:30.260]  the housewives who are kind of neutral on guns turn hard against the guns. And if that
[03:56:30.260 --> 03:56:36.140]  means voting for Democrats, that's what they'll do. That's at least their plan. I hope that
[03:56:36.140 --> 03:56:42.220]  it doesn't work. But even in Florida, we're going to see a law on the ballot banning assault
[03:56:42.220 --> 03:56:48.420]  weapons and at the very least forcing you to register them, you know, lest you become
[03:56:48.420 --> 03:56:55.980]  a felon. So we're in a very dangerous climate. You know, this massive doxing by the representative
[03:56:55.980 --> 03:57:03.180]  Castro, this is going to lead to action reaction. These mobs going to people's houses at night.
[03:57:03.180 --> 03:57:08.580]  Somebody's going to throw a Molotov cocktail, and somebody's going to light off an AR-15.
[03:57:08.580 --> 03:57:13.260]  And then somebody's going to target, say, a representative Castro's family, and it's
[03:57:13.260 --> 03:57:20.100]  going to be game on. And this is all leading to something called anarcho tyranny. It's
[03:57:20.100 --> 03:57:25.260]  sort of like wrecking the economy so that you can blame an enemy. In this way, you wreck
[03:57:25.260 --> 03:57:31.380]  the society, then you can use that as an excuse to turn it into a dictatorship citing the
[03:57:31.380 --> 03:57:37.940]  security concerns. Anyway, get my book. You can get it from me signed, or just get it
[03:57:37.940 --> 03:58:02.900]  on Kindle Free today. And I'll see you next week.
