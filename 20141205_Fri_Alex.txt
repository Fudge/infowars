[00:00.000 --> 00:14.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.080 --> 00:25.480]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones
[00:25.480 --> 00:30.560]  on this Friday December 5th 2014 I'm David and I'll be your host today I'll be joined
[00:30.560 --> 00:33.960]  in the next segment with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK and we're going to have back on
[00:33.960 --> 00:39.560]  the show Lionel we talked to him yesterday he's a New York talk New York based talk show
[00:39.560 --> 00:44.080]  host and of course he's a former prosecutor defense attorney we talked to him about these
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.560]  grand jury indictments and we want to talk to him a little bit more is very good discussion
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.920]  there and I think really kind of the theme today is are we going to be a nation of laws
[00:52.920 --> 00:59.440]  or are we going to be a nuclear banana Republic because we've got Jerome Corsi coming on
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.280]  later in the show and he's going to be talking about Obama's amnesty order that was bad enough
[01:05.280 --> 01:10.080]  that he did an executive order just bypassing Congress and of course he admitted to it we
[01:10.080 --> 01:13.960]  talked about that yesterday how they tried to walk back his comments when he was being
[01:13.960 --> 01:22.520]  protested by some illegal aliens who were criticizing him for not going farther and he said I changed
[01:22.520 --> 01:30.000]  the law for you I changed the law for you well executive orders are not about changing
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.040]  the law shouldn't be if we're going to have democracy it's laws originate of course in
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.440]  Congress if we're going to have a nation that is run according to the rules according
[01:39.440 --> 01:43.280]  to the Constitution that they swear to but Jerome Corsi did a little bit of digging
[01:43.280 --> 01:48.440]  and he found out something very interesting he found that Obama had not even signed his
[01:48.440 --> 01:54.040]  executive order so we've had Obama signing remember when he signed the NDAA on New Year's
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.240]  Eve and then when everybody he said he wasn't going to sign it then he did sign it then
[01:58.240 --> 02:04.240]  he says don't worry I'm not going to enforce indefinite detention by the military without
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.880]  trial without due process remember due process remember when he said that do you really trust
[02:09.880 --> 02:15.880]  if you trust Obama to do that if you're a Democrat wholly swallowed up into this false
[02:15.880 --> 02:19.720]  paradigm they got and you're such a team player that you believe that Barack Obama would
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.960]  never do this do you really trust the next president who's probably going to be a Republican
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.800]  do you really trust that guy not to enforce that we've just had the Republican House go
[02:28.800 --> 02:34.840]  in and do what Ron Paul calls a declaration of war basically passing a resolution criticizing
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.600]  Russia as being aggressive when clearly I think we were behind a lot of the aggression
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.880]  a lot of the changes that are going on in the Ukraine very very reckless provocative
[02:46.880 --> 02:52.520]  measure there by the House but of course we have a dictator who basically thinks that
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.840]  he doesn't even need to sign his dictates of course a dictator somebody who the law
[02:57.840 --> 03:03.320]  comes out of their mouth so why would he have to bother to even go through the process of
[03:03.320 --> 03:09.280]  even bothering to sign his executive orders that's the deep contempt that he has for the
[03:09.280 --> 03:15.800]  rule of law and of course we've also got the UN arms trade treaty an article on New American
[03:15.800 --> 03:21.240]  today says that looks like they're going to declare that that's in effect December 25th
[03:21.240 --> 03:25.600]  that'd be a great day for them do well nobody's paying attention they enact the NDA on New
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.760]  Year's Eve and they enact absolute total gun control over all small arms all ammunition
[03:31.760 --> 03:37.280]  all gun parts totally embargo that require that the national government have control
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.840]  over all weapons set up a national gun control registry hey that's a great idea isn't it
[03:42.840 --> 03:46.560]  let me tell you something when you look at all of these police brutality incidents when
[03:46.560 --> 03:50.840]  you look at people who are being gunned down in the street over and over again on these
[03:50.840 --> 03:57.040]  videos who are unarmed do you really think do you really think it's a good idea to give
[03:57.040 --> 04:03.200]  the police a monopoly on the use of force do you really think so I don't think so and
[04:03.200 --> 04:06.400]  the bottom line is the police aren't even going to have that monopoly on the use of
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.320]  force it's going to be the UN UN is already talking about disarming our own police so
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.840]  that's where the whole thing is headed I want to cover a couple of quick news articles
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.040]  before we go on these are just kind of some side things there's a Utah order this is from
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.520]  box.com Utah the state of Utah is ordering startups to raise their prices so competitors
[04:24.520 --> 04:29.240]  are treated fairly now listen to the rationale they say that it's illegal for an insurance
[04:29.240 --> 04:34.320]  company to use their website to induce people to purchase insurance I guess you need to
[04:34.320 --> 04:40.200]  coerce them in order to get insurance that's the the idea so they say that they're giving
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.800]  unfair that what they're doing is unfair to their competition because they're giving
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.160]  information to their customers see it's supposed to be kept quiet you're supposed to be forced
[04:49.160 --> 04:52.800]  by that insurance and if you aren't they're going to make you do that we'll be right back
[04:52.800 --> 05:02.240]  with Paul Joseph Watson stay with us the average person's life is filled with unexpected

[08:28.240 --> 08:32.240]  david night i'll be your host today but joining me right now is paul joseph watson from the
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.200]  uk as i also point out we're going to be talking today about the un arms trade treaty there's
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.680]  an article up on new american saying that they are the un is saying that they're going to
[08:41.680 --> 08:46.960]  activate the treaty on december the 25th there you go that's your christmas present they're
[08:46.960 --> 08:53.680]  going to assert control over all weapons all over all small arms over ammunition over parts
[08:53.680 --> 09:00.080]  and they want a gun control registry in every country and of course as alex has pointed out
[09:00.080 --> 09:04.240]  they're also looking to even disarm the police isn't a good idea with all the police brutality
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.280]  that we've seen though to have a monopoly with government regardless of which government is
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.200]  whether it's our federal government or local government or the un should any of them have
[09:13.200 --> 09:19.680]  a monopoly on force that's why we recognize the right of citizens to defend themselves
[09:19.680 --> 09:25.040]  against criminals against criminal governments that is a god given right recognized in our
[09:25.040 --> 09:28.480]  constitution but they don't really pay too much attention to the constitution we've got
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.560]  gerome course he's going to be joining us in the show today later in the third hour
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.880]  he realized with his research he's a researcher that goes down and looks at the original
[09:38.880 --> 09:45.440]  documents and the details writing for wnd he noticed that this executive amnesty order that
[09:45.440 --> 09:51.120]  obama put out there that bypassed congress that just granted amnesty according to the
[09:51.120 --> 09:54.080]  what they're saying five million people we don't know how many people are going to be getting
[09:54.080 --> 09:59.120]  amnesty because of course it's essentially an entitlement program as well as an inducement
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.760]  for people to come into this country illegally but this executive amnesty order from obama
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.840]  was put out without his signature and he's talked and verified with the national archives
[10:11.840 --> 10:16.160]  that they have not received any such order with a signature on it so we're going to talk in depth
[10:16.160 --> 10:23.280]  about that with gerome coursey and we've got linel coming back at the next segment joining us
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.080]  paul joseph wasen wanted to ask him some questions i pretty much dominated the questions
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.800]  yesterday with linel who is a talk show host out of new york he's there at the scene seeing
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.360]  what's happening as well as he has a very important legal background as a former prosecutor and
[10:37.360 --> 10:42.400]  defense attorney so we want to talk to him about the legal process and paul joseph wasen has some
[10:42.400 --> 10:48.080]  questions for him and paul you were contacted i understand by somebody that's a relative of
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.600]  michael brown did you want to comment on that yeah this just happened about 30 minutes ago this is
[10:53.600 --> 11:00.000]  ty pruit who is michael brown's older cousin he contacted me gave me his phone number and in fact
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.760]  he's happy to appear on the show so we can set that up and this was in response to a rant that
[11:05.760 --> 11:12.000]  i posted on facebook basically it was off the cuff i was out jogging decided to do a rant on my
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.960]  iphone about what we talked about yesterday which was not making the michael brown the eric carna
[11:18.960 --> 11:26.080]  eric garner cases all about race making them about being focused on police brutality and the
[11:26.080 --> 11:32.080]  point i made was that we have a problem with violence violence is the issue not race within
[11:32.080 --> 11:38.480]  the police community the increased militarization of police forces treating the american people as
[11:38.480 --> 11:44.400]  the enemy has created this environment where violence is acceptable and as you see police
[11:44.400 --> 11:50.400]  officers being exonerated for their violence it only encourages them more i also made the point
[11:50.400 --> 11:56.560]  that there's a problem with violence within the black community because fbi crime statistics show
[11:56.560 --> 12:03.200]  that black people commit almost the same number of homicides as whites and hispanics combined
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.440]  even though they only make up 13 of the population and again is that because of their skin color no
[12:09.440 --> 12:15.520]  it's because of numerous different factors socio-economic as well as cultural uh one of which
[12:15.520 --> 12:21.200]  i pointed out in the video is the fact that we have this rap hip hop culture which glamourizes
[12:21.200 --> 12:29.120]  violence which of course is promoted predominantly by white owned entertainment companies sony prime
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.680]  amongst them we just saw the big hack of sony it emerged that as expected some ridiculous figure in
[12:35.680 --> 12:42.480]  the high 90 percent of their owners the highest paid people in sony are white males caucasians
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.800]  and of course they're prime amongst the entertainment companies the music companies
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.880]  pushing this thug life culture which glamourizes violence so i made all those points in a two
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.000]  minute facebook video ran it was i didn't even post it on the websites but it got something
[12:58.000 --> 13:06.320]  ridiculous like 150 000 views 5000 shares and ty pruit mike brown's cousin saw this and sent
[13:06.320 --> 13:12.720]  me a message about half an hour ago saying hey brother this is ty pruit mike brown's older cousin
[13:12.720 --> 13:17.760]  and i've confirmed it to him he's given other interviews to cnn i've been saying the same thing
[13:17.760 --> 13:23.600]  in my interviews and again we haven't seen this the dominant factor that has emerged out of this is
[13:23.600 --> 13:30.560]  white privilege that was the top hashtag twitter trend yesterday um crimeing wild whites it was
[13:30.560 --> 13:37.120]  basically white people confessing their guilt having escaped police retribution for committing
[13:37.120 --> 13:44.560]  minor infractions so this was all made about race there were actual segregations of white people
[13:44.560 --> 13:50.480]  white people not being allowed to take part in the protests in canada and in new york they were
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.360]  pushed to the edges of the protest by these protest leaders because of their skin color
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.240]  even though we're all on the same side or should be in opposing police brutality yeah that's real
[14:00.240 --> 14:06.720]  racism and that's manufactured racism isn't it exactly and ty pruit mike brown's older cousin
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.320]  contacted me and said i've been saying the same thing in my interviews i'm working on waking black
[14:12.320 --> 14:19.680]  people up to the fact of that subject great rant it's not about race but keeping us apart gives them
[14:19.680 --> 14:26.720]  all the power yeah so basically he's agreeing with me that by making it about race we basically turn
[14:26.720 --> 14:33.520]  off half the population of the united states which is put off by this race baiting uh which has been
[14:33.520 --> 14:39.680]  the dominant theme pushed by the media in the aftermath of ferguson and eric garner so we're
[14:39.680 --> 14:43.840]  going to get him on the show and that's going to be a good interview and of course making it about
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.640]  race they're doing that by design because they don't want to have a discussion about excessive
[14:48.640 --> 14:53.760]  your force by the police they don't want to have a discussion about the militarization of the police
[14:53.760 --> 14:57.760]  because it's the government that has been doing that it's the government that's been equipping the
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.320]  police training the police to behave this way and so they don't want to have a discussion
[15:02.320 --> 15:06.720]  about that core issue they want to have a discussion about race paul i wanted to bring up
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.680]  this headline we have here on info wars dot com is a story from the new york daily news this was at
[15:11.680 --> 15:17.440]  the funeral of the 12 year old boy who died this last weekend he had been shot twice in the chest
[15:17.440 --> 15:25.200]  he had a BB gun and at the funeral the mother said police officers are public servants not
[15:25.200 --> 15:31.440]  james bond with a license to kill and that really nailed it i'm so sad to see that and
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.680]  one of the things that really bothers me about both this shooting and the one in walmart we had the
[15:37.680 --> 15:42.800]  man with the uh a young man with a BB gun that he was going to buy from walmart he'd picked up
[15:42.800 --> 15:48.240]  their merchandise in his hand and you had somebody call the police and say we got a guy in the store
[15:48.240 --> 15:53.280]  with a with a gun pointing at people and so the police show up and treat it as if it's an active
[15:53.280 --> 15:59.520]  shooter but they don't assess the situation they're professionals if somebody calls you up with a
[15:59.520 --> 16:04.960]  false report are you going to be their killer for them i mean we're going to have people who
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.840]  basically call in lies about people they don't like so they can have the cops kill them for them
[16:09.840 --> 16:15.280]  or the cops going to be trained professionals who come in and assess the situation instead of just
[16:15.280 --> 16:18.960]  coming in and shooting the guy and as you can see that the guy runs around the corner and just shoots
[16:18.960 --> 16:22.880]  him and he's not pointing the gun at anybody and they don't tell him to drop the gun either they
[16:22.880 --> 16:28.000]  just shoot first and so when we see something like that happen when we see something like what
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.760]  happened with this young boy we've had a lot of people come back and say you know the problem is
[16:31.760 --> 16:37.040]  we need to ban toy guns that's not the problem racism is not the problem toy guns aren't the
[16:37.040 --> 16:41.680]  problem and they're trying to ban guns for everybody now uh with the shoe and arms trade
[16:41.680 --> 16:47.600]  treaty but that isn't the issue it's the force you know even if our police don't have guns themselves
[16:47.600 --> 16:53.520]  they can still choke people to death as we saw with eric garner well exactly i mean we've seen
[16:53.520 --> 16:59.200]  a spate of these incidents more like a flood you know kids with nerf guns water pistols they shut
[16:59.200 --> 17:05.520]  down entire schools in these ridiculous stunts and you mentioned again that the violence the
[17:05.520 --> 17:12.240]  militarization if you if you go on youtube and search police training two of the top two videos
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.520]  that come up will illustrate this perfectly and i'm going to make a video about this one's out of
[17:17.520 --> 17:23.360]  austin one's out of rhodeland and it illustrates perfectly what we said yesterday these police
[17:23.360 --> 17:29.040]  are literally being given military training it shows them being lined up screamed out by the
[17:29.040 --> 17:35.680]  police chief basically they're going on frog marches in military parades they're being trained to
[17:35.680 --> 17:41.120]  beat people up that's the primary focus of the training and obviously you know i would support
[17:41.120 --> 17:47.440]  police being physically active keeping fit and learning self defense obviously it's a dangerous
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.840]  job but all this training is about beating people up and from what you see on these videos very little
[17:53.840 --> 17:59.360]  of it is about knowing the actual law which then relates to this other story we've got an info wars
[17:59.360 --> 18:06.240]  dot com man arrested for video recording on private property video recording a cop yeah and again
[18:07.120 --> 18:14.240]  what we were talking about yesterday the immediate rush to escalate the situation this clip is 48
[18:14.240 --> 18:20.080]  seconds long because the cop in this instance this is on private property he's video recording
[18:20.080 --> 18:26.000]  the cop for his own safety he's not being aggressive he's kept well back and yet instantly
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.320]  the cop rushes over to him and arrests him yet in every single case where people get arrested for
[18:32.320 --> 18:38.320]  video recording police it's thrown out even the nypd came out a few months ago and had to remind
[18:38.320 --> 18:44.880]  everybody that it's completely legal to film police officers and that it's not an arrestable
[18:44.880 --> 18:50.080]  offense yet they say over and over again and they've lost in court over and over and over again they
[18:50.080 --> 18:55.040]  tried to send a guy in illinois to jail for like 75 years because he had recorded something
[18:55.920 --> 18:59.280]  they keep losing and yet they do this under color of law and that's what we're going to be talking
[18:59.280 --> 19:04.000]  about later in the show we're going to be talking about how obama not only does he bypass congress
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.400]  but of course he doesn't even bother to sign his executive orders and he got congress uh saying
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.640]  they passed the new ndaa and somebody asked a democrat did you read it and he goes are you
[19:14.640 --> 19:21.360]  kidding me i mean they don't read the bills they sign he doesn't sign his edicts and we are a lawless
[19:21.360 --> 19:26.080]  society who have police officers who don't know or don't care what the law is and they're being
[19:26.080 --> 19:29.920]  hyper militarized with this training we're about to go to break but i want to tell everybody if
[19:29.920 --> 19:34.080]  you didn't see the nightly news last night dare mcbreen addressed this black and white issue

[23:56.480 --> 24:13.760]  welcome to the Alex Jones show i'm david item this friday december 5th 2014 Paul Joseph Watson
[24:13.760 --> 24:18.640]  is joining me from the uk and we're joined this segment with Lionel yesterday we had him on we
[24:18.640 --> 24:23.200]  had a very good discussion if you didn't see that that's available now on youtube and archives as
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.720]  well as on our archives at prison planet tv for our subscribers if you want to see that that's
[24:28.720 --> 24:33.040]  really good we're talking a lot about grand juries but paul wanted to talk to Lionel i kind of
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.680]  dominated the discussion i guess and didn't give paul enough chance to uh to talk to Lionel so he
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.960]  had some questions for Lionel so uh paul you there yeah hey i think we've got line do we have
[24:42.960 --> 24:48.480]  Lionel guys on the line yes good okay we got him online go for it paul yeah i just wanted to get
[24:48.480 --> 24:55.760]  Lionel's take on how the media reacted to the ferguson riots because i was thinking of situation
[24:55.760 --> 25:03.360]  you know imagine if back in april clive and bundy had been shot by cops during that standoff
[25:03.360 --> 25:10.960]  and white people or clive and bundy supporters in general had reacted by looting and burning
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.680]  down buildings bearing in mind we had obama meeting with the ferguson leaders we've got an
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.360]  article on info wars dot com right now ferguson activists who met obama faces assault charges
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.960]  he basically assaulted a security guard as he tried to get into city hall in st louis
[25:28.960 --> 25:36.400]  so he had obama meeting with these people we had time magazine legitimizing the riots the looting
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.200]  the burning down of buildings now i don't think the media reaction would have been uh in the same
[25:43.200 --> 25:48.560]  context if that situation was reversed and somebody like clive and bundy had been shot
[25:48.560 --> 25:54.400]  and his supporters had reacted in the same way that some of the people in ferguson did so
[25:54.400 --> 25:59.280]  lionel i mean you're you're a prosecutor but obviously you also study media narratives so
[25:59.280 --> 26:06.800]  what's your take on what i just said there well i'm have been in the media and paul let me just
[26:06.800 --> 26:15.120]  say something to you sir how dare you how dare you bring up discrepancies and disparities in
[26:15.120 --> 26:23.280]  the way the media and society and the law deal with black and white issue don't you understand
[26:23.280 --> 26:29.040]  that we can talk about black issues but not black and white issues unless the white issue
[26:29.040 --> 26:37.520]  is an indictment how dare you that's the reaction you know paul you and david but paul in particular
[26:37.520 --> 26:45.680]  i believe brought up the notion of there is an inherent systemic problem with this mentality
[26:45.680 --> 26:52.640]  of a lot of police departments that push this militarization let me give you an example imagine
[26:52.640 --> 27:00.480]  a new couple goes to a child rearing class brand new parents and the first thing under the instructor's
[27:00.480 --> 27:06.080]  mouth is how to discipline a child how to spank a child and not leave a mark when spanking is
[27:06.080 --> 27:15.040]  appropriate how to spank guess what those parents are going to do spank it's it's this mentality
[27:15.040 --> 27:24.880]  of the police department it's this idea that civilians are the enemy i submit that's the
[27:24.880 --> 27:33.680]  problem not that black defendants are i forget this crimey wild white so there is this inherent
[27:33.680 --> 27:44.320]  tutorial that's part of it but paul don't you understand when you post these reviews these
[27:44.320 --> 27:51.040]  scholarly approaches pointing out the discrepancies and how black violence versus white really isn't
[27:51.040 --> 27:58.080]  true you're actually a crypto racist now i've got death threats over it
[28:01.440 --> 28:08.240]  because you told the truth listen gentlemen let me see if i can break this down people
[28:08.240 --> 28:19.200]  are stupid they're not smart they're dense you have to be able to handle nuance you have to
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.920]  be able to handle years ago there was a guy on ed Sullivan this guy with a stick who was
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.880]  spinning the plate and another plate and another plate and he had four or five plates going at
[28:28.880 --> 28:38.720]  the same time we can't do that this is the american discussion hands up or i can't breathe or
[28:40.000 --> 28:47.600]  something along those lines that is it focused microscopic don't look at any other issues
[28:48.160 --> 28:54.640]  we're not interested in critical thinking no no no no it's just one aspect i let me tell you what
[28:54.640 --> 29:04.640]  it was like last night in new york i have never ever seen anything like this i'm not talking about
[29:04.640 --> 29:12.960]  a pocket full of protesters here west side highway brooklyn bridge grand central and i don't mean a
[29:12.960 --> 29:23.680]  couple of stragglers time square it was huge big organize i hear the music yes hang on we're gonna be

[29:37.520 --> 29:41.040]  with this red herring of racism stay with us we'll be right back

[33:48.080 --> 33:52.240]  there's a lot of different elements involved in it so we were only able to touch on a couple
[33:52.240 --> 33:57.840]  yesterday but i want to tell you before we go back we have our cyber week specials still up

[34:52.320 --> 34:57.440]  look at that you can see parts of that up on youtube but if you have a subscription you can see it
[34:57.440 --> 35:02.800]  when it happens every night every week night at seven central eight p.m eastern let's go back
[35:02.800 --> 35:08.000]  to this discussion as we were talking about how they're using racism to throw people off the
[35:08.000 --> 35:15.440]  track i think it's really excuse me very much like a red herring and of course paul can correct me
[35:15.440 --> 35:21.040]  if i'm wrong but back in the uk they they banned i believe fox hunting now but before they did that
[35:21.040 --> 35:27.840]  the people who didn't like fox hunting would throw the dogs off of the trail by taking a particularly
[35:27.840 --> 35:35.280]  smelly fish a red herring and dragging it behind the direct behind the trail of the fox so once the
[35:35.280 --> 35:41.360]  dogs hit that spot that was it they were done and so now we've got this particularly stinky thing
[35:41.360 --> 35:47.120]  that we've got a long history about racism and they trot that out every time to get us off of the
[35:47.120 --> 35:53.840]  trail of the real fox which is excessive use of force the way they're training the police the rules
[35:53.840 --> 35:57.680]  of engagement that they're giving them even having them call us civilians and of course that's
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.400]  something that's been programmed for a very long time even going back to a dirty hairy movie that's
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.360]  first time i noticed it was in a dirty hairy movie when i was a kid calling people civilians i thought
[36:07.360 --> 36:12.000]  that's kind of funny but it's not funny anymore i'm not laughing now uh gentlemen go ahead i'll
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.080]  let you uh ask any follow-up questions paul yeah i was just gonna ask obviously yesterday we covered
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.560]  the garner case mainly which you know i saw as a travesty of justice i was called a cop hater for
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.320]  that you know lost friends over that lost friends over support in the grand jury decision in the
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.920]  brown case got death threats over it uh because i looked at the evidence that was publicly available
[36:35.920 --> 36:42.000]  the three autopsies the eyewitness reports the eyewitnesses that changed their statements after
[36:42.000 --> 36:49.360]  the autopsies came out which i thought was crucial and the threatening behavior towards eyewitnesses
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.240]  before the grand jury investigation even began that came out in the police reports so i just want
[36:54.240 --> 37:01.440]  a lineal from his legal perspective to break down from the evidence that's available um and ask him
[37:01.440 --> 37:06.080]  if he agreed with the conclusion of the grand jury in the michael brown case let me ask you
[37:06.080 --> 37:12.800]  something paul do you believe racism exists anywhere on the planet yes absolutely good if you
[37:12.800 --> 37:22.080]  answered no to that that's a problem number two do you think the case of espionage would make sense
[37:22.080 --> 37:28.240]  in the michael brown case or in the eric garter case espionage charging the officers garen wilson
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.160]  and pantalio with espionage do you think that charge makes sense doesn't make sense to me you're a
[37:34.160 --> 37:39.920]  racist you're a racist you see you say espionage people would say oh that's ridiculous because
[37:40.720 --> 37:47.440]  there's no evidence of espionage that's not the right charge that's what this is about so what
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.760]  you're doing is you're saying i'm not saying there's no racism i'm not saying the michael brown case
[37:51.760 --> 38:01.200]  was handled correctly now let's change forums paul let's have a civil case a civil jury now
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.880]  we're looking at whether money damages should be awarded to the michael brown family or the
[38:06.880 --> 38:14.880]  eric garter family based upon police negligence what would you say about that i would say that's
[38:14.880 --> 38:21.280]  more reasonable but given the fact that this civil case in the trevon martin example remains open and
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.880]  seems to be going nowhere it seems the federal government isn't that interested in pursuing it
[38:26.880 --> 38:32.880]  either in the trevon martin case or the brown case now the civil case in our system as you know for
[38:32.880 --> 38:41.440]  example in this case you have a number of different tribunals let's say eric garter one the state of
[38:41.440 --> 38:49.840]  new york in statin island richmond county can bring a criminal case people of the state of new york
[38:49.840 --> 38:58.640]  versus uh officer pandaleo okay that's a criminal charge that's a first forum another possibility is
[38:59.280 --> 39:07.440]  the family remember the state of new york versus in a civil case it's the family of eric garter
[39:08.080 --> 39:15.920]  versus officer pandaleo the city of new york the state of new york whatever for money damages
[39:15.920 --> 39:21.680]  the plaintiff is the family seeking money damages in the criminal case the plaintiff in essence
[39:21.680 --> 39:29.840]  is the state seeking justice or incarceration third tribunal third possibility an administrative
[39:29.840 --> 39:36.720]  hearing which we don't hear about officer pandaleo in the eric garter case may be bounced from the
[39:36.720 --> 39:42.720]  roles of the new york city police department because he violated a rule and a an administrative
[39:42.720 --> 39:48.240]  rule they had about quote choke holds which i submit it wasn't and i guess i'm a racist too
[39:49.120 --> 39:58.480]  next tribunal the united states government the people of the united states versus officer
[39:58.480 --> 40:09.280]  pandaleo for denying eric garners civil rights that's really tough because it would have to be
[40:09.280 --> 40:18.240]  evidence that officer pandaleo showed or indicated a racial animus if he said for example i'm going
[40:18.240 --> 40:26.560]  to choke that whatever that may help so do we understand for perhaps different tribunals same
[40:26.560 --> 40:36.080]  death for separate ways of handling it in the criminal case paul and david let me ask you this
[40:36.080 --> 40:44.880]  what should officer pandaleo have done this is eric garner in a case where he has been people
[40:44.880 --> 40:51.200]  of statin island called the police and said listen this guy eric garner and by the way have you
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.160]  noticed that whenever you talk about eric garner you always have to say it's a tragedy it's a
[40:56.160 --> 41:04.240]  tragedy sorry that he died as though you have to say this incantation of course it's a tragedy but
[41:04.240 --> 41:12.720]  but people called the cops and said hey i'm a taxpayer this guy's back peddling cigarettes
[41:13.280 --> 41:21.040]  it's not the crime of the century get rid of him nypd do your job all right david paul we're
[41:21.040 --> 41:29.200]  all in the police car we're summoned what do we do no tell those shop owners this is chicken uh
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.720]  stuff that's not an important charge we're not interested even though he's been arrested i don't
[41:34.720 --> 41:39.520]  know how many times in the past and even though store owners are saying this guy's intimidating
[41:39.520 --> 41:48.400]  people okay so we show up in this scenario paul goes over to eric garner this hulking behemoth
[41:48.400 --> 41:56.080]  and says all right that's it you're under arrest david and i are your partners i look at david and
[41:56.080 --> 42:02.720]  i say i don't think i'm going to help paul out in this one he's on his own and this eric garner
[42:02.720 --> 42:10.240]  very large man says i'm not gonna no no no i'm not i'm not going or i want to talk about this or
[42:10.240 --> 42:19.600]  whatever every rule in the police department in the police academy says we have to protect you
[42:19.600 --> 42:27.520]  you officer paul partner associate we've got to contain this situation we don't let arrestees
[42:27.520 --> 42:34.960]  negotiate we don't do that and if you don't like that you're living in another world that's the way
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.080]  it's been since time immemorial there's an old expression and i talk about it on my twitter at
[42:40.080 --> 42:45.520]  lionel media i've said this a million times you can beat the rap but you can't beat the ride
[42:45.520 --> 42:54.720]  why gentlemen what should this officer have done not helped out not try to bring this man down
[42:55.920 --> 43:02.720]  convince him what well i think the issue i think the issue is not that they arrested him over a
[43:02.720 --> 43:08.160]  trivial nonsense law that i don't agree with but nevertheless he was breaking the law they had the
[43:08.160 --> 43:14.080]  duty to arrest him they had the duty to protect the fellow officers but when they have him down
[43:14.080 --> 43:19.120]  on the ground it doesn't appear that their life is in danger and he's telling them he can't breathe
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.280]  and they're standing on his head to me that looks like what they did to kelly thomas where they beat
[43:23.280 --> 43:27.840]  him to death over a long period of time he might have been somebody that needed to be arrested
[43:27.840 --> 43:34.000]  because he was a mental case but uh to do that to somebody that says there's something else going
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.840]  on when somebody breaks into my house i can shoot them if they're coming at me but if they're running
[43:37.840 --> 43:43.360]  away i don't have the right to shoot them in the back kelly thomas the schizophrenic homeless man
[43:43.360 --> 43:47.280]  who was beaten is different because they weren't beating him now in this case
[43:47.280 --> 43:53.840]  we look at this video by the way jump cuts and edited parts removed if we look at this i might say
[43:53.840 --> 44:02.240]  you know what boy that is not good policing let's all agree members of the jury great next question
[44:02.240 --> 44:11.120]  is this murder is this homicide negligent homicide culpable negligence let's assume that officer
[44:11.120 --> 44:19.360]  pantaleo because remember the facts are what dictate this not racism in the history of the
[44:19.360 --> 44:27.680]  but the facts of the case in this grand jury whether it was loaded whether it was it was fixed
[44:27.680 --> 44:37.360]  whatever officer pantaleo stated i either didn't hear or didn't intend to kill i was trying perhaps
[44:37.360 --> 44:46.480]  on the world's worst restrainer he's bigger than i am i suck at this i never intended to kill
[44:46.480 --> 44:52.880]  whereas when you beat somebody repeatedly until they're in a coma it'd be hard for us to say
[44:52.880 --> 44:59.120]  that was an accident or if you shoot somebody like gill collar or dylan taylor or go down or
[44:59.120 --> 45:06.640]  george uh uh michael brown yet they all got off even when they they kept beating kelly thomas
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.160]  they still got off they still you know and there were no riots so what i'm saying is is that i would
[45:12.160 --> 45:21.360]  say ladies and gentlemen we have exhausted tribunal number one criminal now let's go to
[45:21.360 --> 45:30.160]  the second one a lawsuit for 75 million dollars i call as my first witness i represent the family
[45:30.160 --> 45:38.400]  now i call as my first witness paul joseph watson police training expert mr watson
[45:38.400 --> 45:44.640]  based upon your experience and your observation of the officer did you form an opinion as to
[45:44.640 --> 45:53.520]  whether he was negligent did he violate the accepted standard of care in policing absolutely
[45:53.520 --> 46:02.400]  what is your opinion mr watson this is the most negligent the worst fine that's it because we have
[46:02.400 --> 46:11.600]  just overcome the slight preponderance of the evidence burden and we have just won 75 million
[46:11.600 --> 46:19.120]  dollars that's not criminal that's civil so depending upon which forum and i hate to keep
[46:19.120 --> 46:26.080]  being i don't want to sound pedantic here but there were wrong doings now let me ask you paul
[46:26.080 --> 46:34.960]  and david did you see anything that indicated that mr garner was the topic or the subject
[46:34.960 --> 46:41.120]  or the target of prosecution because he was black do we know if any maybe there was and we
[46:41.120 --> 46:49.440]  don't know this were any racial statements made sir anything to indicate that his civil rights
[46:49.440 --> 46:55.440]  specifically not that he was arrested or arrested poorly but that he was targeted
[46:55.440 --> 47:00.960]  because of his rights do we have anything no i don't think so i think he was targeted because
[47:00.960 --> 47:07.200]  he was uh doing something that uh you're not going to find uh most people who were not poor i think
[47:07.200 --> 47:10.560]  it was really more of an issue of him being poor and thinking he's going to do something that's
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.640]  in a black market area to try to do this but you know when you're talking about the civil suits
[47:14.640 --> 47:22.400]  let me ask you this line oh there doesn't seem to be any penalty involved for the police individuals
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.720]  in these cases certainly not for the police department you know this is good if they went
[47:26.720 --> 47:32.720]  a 75 million dollar lawsuit as you pointed out that gets passed along to the taxpayers just like
[47:32.720 --> 47:37.920]  you said yesterday i in in some states there's an automatic indictment for some crimes uh
[47:37.920 --> 47:41.920]  if it's a felony they don't even need to have a grand jury they're going to have a trial i think
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.400]  that was a great idea i think that's something that would be a good reform that uh we immediately
[47:46.400 --> 47:52.080]  if there's a death involved with police and and it's it it ought to automatically go to a trial
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.960]  but when we have a civil case and there's money taken out it seems to me if we're going to try
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.320]  to achieve some kind of systemic reform there has to be a penalty that the system pays that the
[48:02.320 --> 48:07.920]  police department has something taken out of their budget at least a huge percentage of that
[48:07.920 --> 48:11.280]  fine that's going to come out comes out of the police department budget or something like that
[48:11.280 --> 48:16.000]  to try to make them reform put some pressure on them that now that would be interesting if you said
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.880]  for example okay uh members of the of the garner family what would you like 75 million dollars
[48:22.880 --> 48:33.680]  from the public treasury no i want 75 percent of the overtime budget to be you know that would
[48:33.680 --> 48:40.080]  get people's attention that's a that's a different one yes um it's very interesting but in this case
[48:40.080 --> 48:46.800]  though let's go back there was a police officer years ago officer frances levody who did federal
[48:46.800 --> 48:53.040]  time because he basically went and choked out this guy who gave him some lip and it wasn't an arrest
[48:53.040 --> 48:59.920]  it was i mean it happens so what i'm saying right now is once this meme gets started once we look
[48:59.920 --> 49:07.200]  at this case people will say this will have to be our case our case and we're going to
[49:08.320 --> 49:14.480]  make all the changes on i i i kind of alluded to something last night i've never heard or seen
[49:14.480 --> 49:21.600]  the amount of helicopters and drones i i don't know if i'm seeing things but we saw some stuff flying
[49:21.600 --> 49:30.720]  around that was most unique now tonight is going to be probably the last night uh before the weekend
[49:31.280 --> 49:37.200]  and the police knock on something have been very good and not losing it you know and and the
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.640]  and the protesters as well but here is my also my question and paul i'm going to tell you right
[49:42.640 --> 49:50.080]  now i might be a racist as well for what i'm going to suggest in the 60s when you saw dr king and when
[49:50.080 --> 49:57.920]  you saw uh uh jesse jackson the younger and and others get together they made specific plans they
[49:57.920 --> 50:07.040]  had an agenda they had goals while we see people showing protests all over the country what is your
[50:07.040 --> 50:15.200]  goal what do you want don't say stop killing unarmed people that's generic what do you want
[50:15.200 --> 50:21.760]  the first thing that we must very simply do all of us write this on your and i mentioned this at
[50:21.760 --> 50:32.080]  Lionel media on twitter i mentioned this wonderful hashtags mandate a special prosecutor every time
[50:32.080 --> 50:38.720]  there is a cop killing of a civilian yeah a prosecutor from someplace else who can do this
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.160]  without fear of reprisal excellent idea i think that's the key people get frustrated with this
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.120]  if they don't have any goals when they protest they just get even more frustrated and then of
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.720]  course you're going to have some people who use it as an opportunity to go kick the cat we're
[50:52.720 --> 51:00.960]  going to be right back with Lionel and Paul Joseph Watson stay with us this hour of gcn brought to you

[54:08.000 --> 54:12.720]  I'm David Knight in Austin we have Paul Joseph Watson in the UK joining us in this last segment
[54:12.720 --> 54:18.240]  and also Lionel in New York and i've had several people hand this come through and hand this to
[54:18.240 --> 54:23.600]  me so i need to point this out uh there's an article that's up on info wars.com the entire
[54:23.600 --> 54:27.760]  racism narrative that we've been talking about how they've spun this away from what really needs
[54:27.760 --> 54:32.880]  to be talked about which is how do we reform the way the police are conducting themselves
[54:32.880 --> 54:37.840]  towards the public that entire racism narrative is put in to stop that discussion but that falls
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.280]  apart when you look at the fact that what happened to Eric Garner was supervised by an African-American
[54:43.280 --> 54:49.120]  female New York City police department sergeant had no problem with that happening so
[54:49.680 --> 54:55.440]  Obama's solutions of cameras to record everything that's not going to change anything Obama's
[54:55.440 --> 55:01.280]  solution of having uh racial quotas and police departments that are mandated or controlled
[55:01.280 --> 55:04.400]  from Washington that's not going to change anything but i want to go back to Lionel while
[55:04.400 --> 55:08.880]  we've got him Lionel there was also another police shooting just this last weekend of course the
[55:08.880 --> 55:14.640]  Mr. Gurley who was killed in the projects he there were two cops a veteran cop and a rookie cop
[55:15.200 --> 55:20.960]  doing a top down patrol in a project building the rookie cop had his gun out as Mr. Gurley and
[55:20.960 --> 55:25.680]  his girlfriend entered the stairwell they got tired of waiting for the elevator the rookie cop
[55:25.680 --> 55:31.760]  shot him from testimony that's come out so far without warning shot him in the chest and it sounds
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.440]  like they left without calling for emergency help so there was a lot there were some protests on
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.760]  Monday we had some people who threw some fake blood on the police commissioner i'm sure that's a
[55:41.760 --> 55:47.120]  factor in these demonstrations that are going on new york now as well yes in fact it was also
[55:47.120 --> 55:52.480]  today's daily news had a piece in which they suggested that one of the police officers or the
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.720]  shooter perhaps again alleged shooters allegedly did this but might have been on the phone texting
[55:58.720 --> 56:04.160]  his union rep prior rather than calling for emergency backup wow now now that's also
[56:04.160 --> 56:10.560]  so this goes to show you so is that racism is that incompetence you know one of the problems i have
[56:10.560 --> 56:20.320]  to understand is you know paul and david when you are assigned to a particular area as a police
[56:20.320 --> 56:29.520]  officer where there are more drugs there is more crime there is more robbery now hear me out in an
[56:29.520 --> 56:36.400]  area a sector i don't know what you call it in the uk paul but a precinct or a city or a unit area
[56:36.400 --> 56:44.160]  what a particular locale and we're going to go in there and i tell you by the way we're going
[56:44.160 --> 56:50.000]  into this new place it's in Kensington i don't even know and there's more robberies and rapes
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.320]  and drugs and whatever what can you tell me about that place is that going to be an affluent place
[56:56.320 --> 57:01.680]  based upon the number of crimes reported or is there going to be a poor place what do you think
[57:01.680 --> 57:09.360]  based upon the statistics without even stepping foot in that area what would you guess go ahead paul
[57:09.360 --> 57:15.600]  well i mean that's the point that many prominent black speakers have made that the 911 calls are
[57:15.600 --> 57:20.640]  coming from the crime ridden areas obviously so that's where police need to go that's where they're
[57:20.640 --> 57:27.840]  called out that's where they're going to go so why do you think and let's assume they're poor people
[57:27.840 --> 57:36.560]  of color african-americans latino not park avenue not you know whatever holly beberly hills or whatever
[57:36.560 --> 57:45.040]  the particular now if that's the truth so isn't the issue well why are black people or poor people
[57:45.040 --> 57:53.680]  or latino people living in such areas why is there so much crime there to begin with before the police
[57:53.680 --> 58:00.400]  even enter this why is that so i i hate to believe at the point but but this goes back into second
[58:00.400 --> 58:09.680]  your argument if we are tonight going to patrol new york or austin or london or whatever it is
[58:09.680 --> 58:15.200]  the majority of our calls i guarantee you are going to go and come from the place where there's
[58:15.200 --> 58:22.080]  most crime and they tend to be poorer so that means that our interaction with the poor by
[58:22.080 --> 58:27.600]  definition is going to be greater than our interaction with the high and mighty does that
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.000]  mean we're racist we're going to have to leave it with that rhetorical question linel thank you so
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.680]  much for joining us from new york and paul joseph Watson from london stay with us we're

[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today on this righty december 4
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.720]  2014 now in the next segment we're going to be joined by writer joe wolverton from the new american
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:41.120]  talking about the un arms trade treaty that they say they're going to put into effect on christmas
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.480]  eve so we're going to have a discussion with him about that what's behind that how we should
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:53.440]  react to that because of course a treaty that violates the constitution should not be a treaty
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:59.520]  that is in effect we don't have dictators who have authority over the constitution they swear
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.360]  allegiance to the constitution the constitution if you will is the king the law is the king that
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:11.280]  particular law is the king they are merely stewards who come and go so they do not have the right to
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.560]  appoint another king when they do that's a treasonous act but of course we see them do things under
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.160]  color of law all of the time and so it's very worrying i mean of course so we've got obama who
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:29.120]  does a blanket amnesty on immigration and says that he's going to do things in the environmental
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:35.200]  area and republicans aren't going to be able to stop him even with their bigger majorities so he
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.360]  is intimidated that intimidating them and and intimating that he is going to pursue executive
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.320]  orders in many areas in these last two years where he doesn't have to stand for reelection
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:53.600]  so that brings up a big question and what is it what are the laws based on how are we going to
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.680]  pull these guys back who are acting criminally who are acting outside of the law and of course
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.200]  we've got Jerome Corsi joining us in the third hour looking at obama's executive order and finding
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.320]  out that he didn't even bother to sign it not only did he bypass congress but he creates this edict
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:16.000]  and doesn't even bother to sign it that's how contemptuous he is of any legal process we truly
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.880]  do have a dictator and a banana republic with nuclear weapons it's a very dangerous situation
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.840]  and that kind of corruption has found its way that kind of lawlessness has found its way all the way
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:34.800]  down into the excessive use of force the rules of engagement if you will the militarization of the
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:42.080]  police the fact that they don't care whether or not you have a right to record them in public
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:47.920]  they have over and over again continue to arrest people even though it has been held up in court
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.800]  after court that yes of course we do have the right to film and public there's no expectation
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.480]  they watch everything we do now speaking of watching everything we do we have a kit daniel's
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.520]  article up about google julian assange who watches them very closely watches what's happening on the
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.800]  internet he believes that google is going to back hillary clinton for president in 2016 that's an
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.080]  article up on info wars dot com right now from kit daniels and it's interesting to look at some
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:25.440]  of the politics here that's going on hillary clinton had this video of a cowboy singing they're
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.080]  portraying this as if she's trying to go for the male vote i mean this is like a country western
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:38.160]  video with all the clues in there the pickup trucks the rural setting this guy with a beard
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.920]  and a cowboy hat and singing and talking about you know this is a one of her commercials that
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.200]  they're putting out there and as a point out it's kind of kind of cringe worthy and i'm thinking
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.160]  is that really going to get her support among men i mean they can't really be that clueless
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.600]  and as i started to think about it i thought i don't think that's really targeted towards men
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:06.480]  i think that's really targeted still towards her feminist base i think she's putting something
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.560]  out there that these these urban liberal feminists really want a cowboy boy toy i think that's uh
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.560]  my bottom line on this so let's see what you guys think about that because we'll take some of your
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.800]  calls on third hour also we've got a runoff coming up in louisiana uh senator marylandrew is uh the
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.360]  senator there looks like she's not going to win as the new york times puts it very well i think
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:34.800]  her democrat base has eroded like a cheap levy yeah i see that happening but we're going to be
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.440]  right back after the break we're going to be talking to joe wolverton from the new american
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.640]  about this un arms trade treaty this is something that's being developed a long time this is very

[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:15.280]  alex jones on the gcn radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:20.400]  today at the bottom of the hour we're going to be joined with the with joe wolverton from the new
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.480]  american we're going to be talking about the un arms trade treaty we're going to be talking about
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:30.800]  not only the scope of it but also the legality of it what we can do to push back against it
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.840]  and this is something that's been developed for a long time they've been trying to sneak this in i
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:42.800]  was involved with a a gun rights group that was and i was there in july of 2012 when they were
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:49.840]  trying to push this through and of course in the lead up to that we had the aurora shooting and
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.280]  that just had false flag all over it i mean when you've got a guy who has basically been
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.960]  deeply embedded in psychological studies funded by the u.s. government and somehow all of a sudden
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:07.760]  the guy with no experience whatsoever with weapons has rigged his house like a navy seal
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.200]  they find him after the shooting and kind of this spaced out state next to his car
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:20.160]  and he tells him my places rigged his booby trapped or whatever if he was going to do that why would
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.400]  he warn them about that and of course the shooter or as we heard some people believe there were
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.560]  multiple shooters got into a side door that was kind of jacked open into the theater there was
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:36.000]  just so many suspicious things about that and you know what that narrative wasn't working when i was
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.960]  there in july the un knew they were not going to be able to get this passed they couldn't sell this
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.640]  to the public there was a huge pushback people were even more adamant that even if they were going
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.320]  to buy this narrative that was being sold to them about this lone wolf crazy shooter they wanted
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.680]  guns to protect themselves so it wasn't working they said we're going to wait until after the
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:06.480]  american elections that november 4th they came back and said as soon as it was evident that the
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:13.120]  democrats had picked up seats in the senate they came back and said we're going to revisit this
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:20.720]  next year after the new senators are seated which in fact they did they still did not get it passed
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:28.800]  but they had john carrey secretary of state sign it now what difference does that make a treaty has
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:36.480]  to be ratified by the senate and a treaty cannot conflict with the constitution or with our fundamental
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.120]  god-given rights and i think that's one of the points that uh joe wilburton is going to talk
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.720]  about we're going to talk about the scope of this what it's going to mean if we allow this to go
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.760]  through and of course we're going to be talking in the third hour to jerome coursey because he
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:57.520]  discovered the amnesty edict that came from our dictator obama was not even signed that's why i say
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.360]  he's a dictator you understand that dictator comes from the latin to speak right in other words the
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.040]  law is in his mouth the law is whatever he says he doesn't need a congress he doesn't even need to
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.320]  sign his executive order he just makes the pronouncement and lets people implement it and of course
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:20.640]  there's some discussion as to what's his motivation behind that is he trying to uh distance himself
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.760]  from impeachment allow j johnson at the department of homeland security to take the heat for this
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.720]  illegal action well i don't know we'll talk to uh jerome coursey we'll get his take on it
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.320]  looking at some of the news today as i mentioned we've got a story up from kit daniels julien
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.360]  assange believes that hillary clinton is going to be backed by google he points out that google has
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.240]  very strong ties to clinton and of course these are people who have looked at a lot of emails i
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.160]  really would like to see who um who gucifer thinks is going to be the next president because he's the
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:58.720]  guy that's been reading their private email going back and forth and he's had some interesting
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.480]  takes that have come out of that as i mentioned in the first hour there was an interesting story
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:07.760]  and i got to it right at the end of the uh segment as we're going to break didn't have much time to
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:13.520]  talk about it the state of utah has ordered an insurance company startup to raise their prices
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.400]  because their competitors are not being treated fairly in other words they've got competitive
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.880]  prices out there and the insurance that they're putting out there i thought that was a whole
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:26.000]  point of the affordable health care right another whole point you know we were told when hillary
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.200]  clinton was trying to shove health care down our throats as an unelected first lady she said
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.080]  you know the problem with uh rising prices is we've got too much competition we need to have a
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.480]  single payer system to get the price down now that's exactly works exactly the opposite doesn't it
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.480]  well now here's the rationale that utah has they say that a utah regulator says that offering free
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.840]  access to the website of this insurance company violates state insurance laws which makes it legal
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:59.280]  illegal for companies to offer inducements to purchase insurance they they never really wanted
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.280]  you to look at the obama care website the affordable health care website they never wanted you to
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.920]  look at that they don't want you to understand what's going on groober's made that apparently
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:17.440]  evidently clear as i said before we ought to make it a verb to groober something to torture the data
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.760]  so that you can deceive we ought to call that groobering we can use that in a lot of different
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.640]  ways make the guy a verb but here you've got a situation where state legislators are saying no
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.360]  no no don't give people to your website give free access to your website they could actually shop
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:37.840]  and and look and and you're offering lower prices than your competitors see this was never designed
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:45.200]  to get us affordable health care this was designed to mandate that the public buy insurance that they
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.360]  don't i can't afford and don't need from the insurance companies this was a handoff to the
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.400]  insurance companies this was never for you and one of the things that points us out i think is in
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:02.640]  this you think they say you cannot offer inducements to purchase insurance you can't let people look at
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:08.640]  the insurance rates so regulators say that zenefits that's the company is giving away access to
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.880]  its website and that's unfair to other insurance brokers and they're also offering lower prices
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.560]  we can't have that happen and that that completely see they're trying to make health care unaffordable
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.280]  they're trying to make profits for the corporate insurance companies that's why they don't want
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:27.840]  you to be able to look at the insurance prices on the website that they put out there that's why
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.480]  they don't want you to look at it in utah it's the state it's also the feds and then of course
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.120]  there's this quote from sableus out here americans don't like obama care because their financial
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.920]  literacy is low no gruber was telling us that he was taking advantage of people's financial
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:49.200]  illiteracy he was saying they don't understand that if we tax the if we add fees at the corporate
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.600]  level they're not going to understand this stuff they were using people's financial ignorance to
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.640]  sell obama care that's what it was all about from the very beginning when you have hillary clinton
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.360]  making pronouncements like she did 20 years ago saying uh that you know we need to we can't have
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.120]  competition that's that's causing health care to be too expensive we can't have so many doctors
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.120]  out there because that raises the price of doctors look i don't get what it is whether it's widgets
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.000]  or whether it's brain surgeons if you've got more of them out there unless they organize themselves
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.280]  into some kind of a monopoly using the government that's how monopolies always operate they always
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.320]  get the government to come in and give them a monopoly here's another example of that we've
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:35.760]  got uh the small business uh administration that is supposed to help to level the playing field for
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.960]  small businesses versus the large competitors do you think that the american government is really
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:45.600]  going to do that do you think the small business administration is really interested in helping
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:52.560]  small businesses or they interested in helping the big businesses i've had uh in interviews on the
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.480]  nightly news i've talked to someone who's made this point who's filed lawsuits against them
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.080]  he's exposed this over and over again here's the stat from this article here from uh this is uh
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:11.920]  david stockman's website in 2010 2009 the top 10 lending institutions swallowed up roughly one quarter
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:20.480]  of all the sba loan guarantees you understand that the top 10 big banks got a quarter of all the
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.320]  loan guarantees and it's even worse than that it's not just that the big banks are getting all the
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.960]  money and then loaning it out they're always doing that they're getting interest-free loans to pay back
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.800]  not only the bailout money that they got but getting interest-free loans and then loaning it
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.000]  out to people on home loans and auto loans at four five six percent then loaning it out in credit
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:45.920]  cards at 20 30 40 50 percent but no the loans themselves are going to the biggest companies
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:51.840]  is not going to the small companies the vast majority of the loans are going to the very
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:58.160]  largest companies we see this happening all the time that's what the government always does it's
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:05.120]  called regulatory capture sometimes but it really is just crony capitalism it's corruption they use
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.160]  the government to shut down their competition the bank bailouts did that to shut down their
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.200]  competition look at how many small banks failed i remember a drudge report used to have you know
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.160]  every year another 150 banks or whatever went out of a business small banks went out and and it was
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.080]  a running total and it was going up on a yearly basis it's going down now because there's not
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:32.240]  that many more of them around to drive out of business of course if you want to look at how
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:37.520]  this plays out monsanto and the fda is a good example this we have an article up on info wars
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.520]  dot com today monsanto pulling illegal vote counters into the organ gmo recount remember
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:48.240]  when we had the election we talked about how it was unfortunate that the labeling law narrowly
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:56.960]  lost in oregon well actually it didn't okay uh there's it's right now there's only 812 votes
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:02.160]  between the no and the yes sides on the labeling debate in oregon so what are they doing what
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.960]  is monsanto doing well monsanto and the large corporations that want to keep you from knowing
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:17.520]  what's in your food have been bringing in people from out of state as observers as one of the many
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:24.080]  ways that they game the system and of course they have been paying play paying to play i should say
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.440]  donating four to five times the amount of money that the organizations who are trying to get labeling
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:36.400]  out there have and basically lying to the public and if they do it enough i think they've got it
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.360]  down to a science it looks like if they put out about four to five four to five times the amount
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.640]  that their opponents are able to spend they seem to be able to pretty regularly pull this off
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:52.720]  and uh they at the beginning when they were first fighting these labeling laws they weren't putting
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.040]  they were putting a lot of money in but then they pulled it back to just about four or five times
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.040]  and in oregon it went from an overwhelming majority of people who supported just honesty
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.320]  and knowing what's in your food can't i just know what's in my food we can have this discussion
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.840]  about what gmo actually means to my health but why are you hiding the fact that it's in there
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:19.120]  if it's something that isn't harmful for me we have labels about everything so they lie to them
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.120]  and they tell them that oh this is this is going to be horrible it's going to drive the cost of
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.760]  everything up look they redesign their labels all the time just for marketing decisions but
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.200]  they also point out in this article of course and we've talked about this right after the election
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.040]  the way they got shut down was by an educated electorate in hawaii even though they spent
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:44.000]  over eight million dollars in hawaii to try to do gmo farming there it didn't sell they weren't
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.440]  able to use their propaganda there because people understood the issue it really is an educational
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.800]  issue and it's a long-term issue that's where they've had success in the gmo shutdowns is where
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.280]  they stop the farming of gmo because the people know what's going on we'll be right back this hour

[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:25.840]  burn the ring of fire the ring of fire welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.040]  host today we're going to be joined in the next segment with uh joe wolverton writing for the new
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:39.280]  american talking about the un arms trade treaty a very comprehensive piece of gun control of course
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.560]  it was not ratified by the senate of course it conflicts with the second amendment but we have
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:51.520]  seen all kinds of crazy stuff being done by our government under color of law we've got obama
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:58.320]  announcing an executive order yet nothing was ever signed or filed that's research done by
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.760]  drum coursey he's going to be joining us in the next hour to talk about that and the meaning of
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:09.520]  that of course i think it clearly makes it uh obvious that we've got a dictator in office he
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:15.360]  doesn't think he even needs to put his orders in writing he just needs to speak them but of course
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.480]  it's a little bit more subtle than that uh that's one of the takeaways to come out with it but
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:25.520]  we've also got house lawmakers are going to reintroduce the bill to limit the nsa backdoor
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.920]  spying we'll see i don't know i don't see that they really want to do anything about this of course
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.400]  because we've got people violating the law from the nsa down to the police departments the department
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.160]  of justice is violating the law we've got the irs violating the law we've got a president who signs
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:51.200]  executive orders if you are so captured by this democrat republican false paradigm they put out
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:58.160]  there it ought to scare you to death to think about the other guys getting in charge except
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:04.160]  the thing is they're all on the same team as we point out over and over again we even had
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.800]  the bumper as we came in earlier in the show of uh the comedian pointing out you know what's the
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.080]  we got the puppet on the left we got the puppet on the right and look that's the same guy controlling
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.960]  both of them we got george bush this is a article that's up on dredgeport george bush says hillary
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:23.680]  clinton is like my sister-in-law he just called bill clinton his brother from another mother as
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.320]  alex has pointed out i don't know the genealogy as well as alex does but he's pointed out that's
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:34.160]  quite literally close to the truth so it's the same group of people where it looks like we're
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.080]  going to possibly have a jeb bush bush versus hillary clinton isn't that repulsive doesn't
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:45.040]  that make you just want to throw up i mean it makes me want to throw up it scares me too uh
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.000]  except it's not really going to be that different you know when we looked at the choice that we
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.960]  were given with barack obama and mit romney you realize of course that peter gruber was
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:01.600]  given a shout out by mit romney for helping him to push through romney care in massachusetts which
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.280]  was so identical to obama care that eventually came through and of course romney did that
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.400]  with the help of ted kennedy in massachusetts that should have been a warning for everybody
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:19.040]  that we were going to get the same thing regardless of who we elected it was just a different face
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.440]  you know do you like this young white guy do you like the captain underpants on the other side i
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.680]  mean what's your choice you like this uh dashing traditional uh you know uh what is it the fighting
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:35.040]  whitey's isn't that what a mit romney looked like but anyway you could you could pick the guy that
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:42.560]  that you thought matched your personal taste because we can't even really have a discussion
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.960]  about excessive use of police force or police violating the law without it being taken over by
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:58.480]  racism as we pointed out earlier it was a black female sergeant who oversaw the smothering or
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:05.440]  the heart attack that was induced on eric garner and had no problem with it you're not going to see
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:13.360]  this change by electing a woman or a black or a white guy it's what's behind it you have to look
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:19.440]  at their policies they're using that to throw you off of the trail now in the next segment we're
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.800]  going to be talking to uh joe wolverton about the unarms trade treaty we have an article up on info
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.040]  wars about another kind another approach to gun control 38 billion reasons the second amendment
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:38.080]  is crumbling and it's bloomberg's money the billionaire bloomberg lavishing money on these
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:45.920]  initiatives in the same way that mon santo and the big agra companies lavish money on these other
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.040]  initiatives to prevent people from knowing what's in their food they're trying to take our fundamental
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:56.320]  rights to protect ourselves individually from criminals and collectively against an unconstitutional
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.600]  government those are rights that supersede the constitution but of course bloomberg has a lot

[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:11.760]  personal funds in just the 2014 elections if you go back and you look at even david clark we've

[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.080]  people honestly i can't be there when something happens you need to be armed you need to be

[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.480]  if you want to call in and comment about some of the things that we've been talking about
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:13.600]  earlier our number is 800-259-9231 and we're going to definitely if we get in touch with him we're
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.280]  still going to be taking calls at the top of the hour but if you want to call in now we'll take
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:24.800]  your calls we're going to have in the third hour Jerome Corsi talking about obama's amnesty
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:31.520]  executive order that he didn't even bother to sign or file truly a true dictator now there's
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:38.320]  an article up on info wars.com right now DARPA is getting close to an iron man suit yeah that's
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.120]  everything that you look at that DARPA is doing really bothers me and as i look at this article
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.400]  you know i think they're actually getting closer to being hydra that's the thing that really scares
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.800]  me it isn't so much that they've got an iron man suit or they've got an exoskeleton suit or they got
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:59.040]  robots it's the character of the people who are running the military industrial complex and the
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.600]  fact that they try to sell this stuff as you know they come in peace this is for the benefit of
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.480]  mankind when they have the DARPA robot contests and everything it's like look you're not fooling
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:13.840]  anybody we understand what your mission statement here is it's about developing weapons and when
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:20.400]  i see them developing a robot they can run faster than any human being i don't believe that they're
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:27.280]  going to use it to go turn off the stuck valve on a nuclear reactor somewhere okay i wasn't born
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.560]  yesterday and most of our people aren't either they say the army doesn't have an iron man suit
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:37.520]  yet but the defense advanced research projects agency DARPA their warrior web program is a step
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:44.480]  closer to developing a soft low-powered exosuit that will augment the physical capabilities of
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:51.680]  soldiers and of course we've seen some crude examples of that in some other military organizations
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:58.240]  as well but they're going to go full on terminator and as i pointed out yesterday you know it's
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:05.040]  strange enough to see that they've got a terminator that looks like as everybody is getting concerned
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.320]  about the advances in ai we've got people like elon musk we've got steven hawkins all saying look
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.240]  ai could very easily get out of control and end the human race the terminator scenario i mean we
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.280]  see that coming true and then if that's not bad enough we see them even going to replicating
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.720]  pinky in the brain sticking human brain you know augmenting mice brains with human brain cells
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:32.240]  and increasing their intelligence i mean this is really getting absolutely crazy about as crazy as
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.520]  our government that operates by executive order and not even bothering to file the paperwork let's go
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:46.720]  to uh dan and fema let's see what was that six whatever dan go ahead hi thank you very much
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:53.840]  for taking my shell or call yeah i'm up here in uh region five um let's say what you're saying
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.800]  and uh kind of do for real quick to uh cap on what you're saying um some of us maybe i should
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:08.080]  say maybe i shouldn't um i was stationed at border when california my hobby desert eighty
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:19.280]  uh 88 to 92 now it's going back some time at that time uh plan mock wars uh there was a building
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:25.760]  that we called that we called up for we called the best star six days you know oh and we've seen
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.960]  these articles on uh on on dredger board how they they're working out for for laser weapons from
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:40.800]  space go ahead now now during that time period there were three satellites dedicated only two
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:48.880]  following says that the commanding generals of the the the blue for the people that we're training
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:57.600]  at that time would be for desert storm could watch a brigade level fake war go on yeah yeah
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.720]  they've got a lot of equipment that they're not telling us about just think about how rapidly
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.600]  they deployed the drone program after 9 11 when you stop back and think about that i mean
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.120]  they didn't want people to think about the fact that they could remotely control aircraft
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.600]  even though going back to the 60s they had operation north woods where they had proposed
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:25.040]  drone airplanes commercial airliners flying them into buildings staging other terrorist acts so
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:30.320]  they could use it as a pretext to go to war against Castro and Cuba but we're not told about that in
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:37.520]  the 60s in the 70s in the 80s in the 90s no when we have september 11th on 2001 nobody's thought about
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:43.440]  drone controlled planes being used as weapons or as a false flag but after 2001 guess why it didn't
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:48.720]  only take about a month for them to have this entire drone army that there are air force that
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:54.560]  they're using uh in afghanistan it just appeared out of nowhere isn't that interesting how these
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.040]  things just come up at a convenient time uh i'm going to hold the rest of your calls to the top
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.680]  of the hour because we just got a hold of joe wolverton with the new american a featured
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.760]  contributor there is articles on the constitution states rights india drone surveillance state
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.840]  have appeared in national international publications including lou rockwell dot com
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:18.160]  ron paul forums the tenth amendment center our site info wars guardian and business insider
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:23.040]  and of course he's got an article up today about the un arms trade treaty and something
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:28.640]  that i've been following for a long time uh thank you for joining us joe thank you thanks for having
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:34.240]  you on i appreciate it layout for people what the real problem with the un arms trade treaty is
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.480]  and then we can talk about uh how they're trying to push this on us and the constitutional issues
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.920]  but talk about the substance of it right now the substance of it is it requires the registration
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:52.640]  of all ammunition arms and component parts it gives control over those two regional uh
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:41:00.400]  departments of the united nations it requires uh member states meaning the united states included
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:09.840]  to keep a list of gun owners uh it empowers the united nations to send troops in to enforce
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.880]  disarmament should any member state find it difficult to disarm its citizens uh it requires
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:23.520]  tracking to the end user of the manufacturing by the manufacturer of any uh firearm ammunition
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.320]  or component part uh and at the end of the day it will lead to the complete disarmament of a
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:33.600]  civilian population yeah this is full spectrum gun control they're not looking at something and
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.120]  saying well you know we're gonna ban guns that we think looks we're gonna call them assault
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:42.560]  weapons and say that they look scary so you know if you've got a bayonet attachment on the end
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.280]  that we're gonna ban that no it's not piecemeal like that it is everything everything it guns
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.720]  denies the right to own guns taking out ammunition taking out spare parts as you point out creating
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.480]  this massive registry and demanding that no one can own anything associated with a firearm
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.080]  right and under article 16 of the arms trade treaty it does empower the secretary general
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:15.360]  to deploy uh peacekeepers to any to any nation whose leaders or uh legislative body finds it
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:23.040]  difficult to disarm so that's article 16 and it uh it will help it will help that leader or that
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:29.680]  nation with uh what it calls us the stockpile management disarmament and demobilization
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.720]  so you you can interpret that the way you think it should be interpreted well the way I interpret
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.560]  that is lexington and concord because they went after the stockpiles there and who's really what's
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.920]  that you're the first one you're the first one who's really caught on to that you know when
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.240]  when the bullet started flying at the war for independence it was because king george's troops
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:54.080]  were coming for the ammunition man yeah absolutely this is full spectrum now let's talk about how
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:00.400]  they have manipulated this thing from the very beginning because they had come up and and we
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:05.200]  know even the new york times pointed out that fast and furious was set up to blame the second
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.880]  amendment and of course a key part of fast and furious was to move guns across the border
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:17.440]  and so that's exactly what this purports to uh to take care of that that is the rationale for
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.360]  having to have a un arms trade treaty because it's not enough that we just have this problem as they
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.200]  perceive it in america where individuals can own guns no our guns are going across the border to
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:36.320]  other people so that was a set piece that was something that was set up to uh to basically get
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:41.920]  the the public afraid of this to to demonstrate the need for it and it blew up in their face i
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:47.280]  was there in july and new york uh at the united nations we were filming that we were reporting
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.880]  on that and they had uh the people there it had just blown up about this officer getting killed
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.720]  and people had realized what was going on with fast and furious so that blew up in their face
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:01.520]  and then of course they have the uh shooting that was perfectly timed just as they were about to
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:07.520]  have the uh the vote so they delayed all of that until after the election they said they didn't
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.840]  wait very long on the very day of the election as soon as they saw that the democrats going to be
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:15.280]  picking up seats they said we're going to revisit this back in the spring after the democrats are
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.640]  in congress and of course uh joe they didn't get that ratified by the senate nevertheless
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:27.040]  john carrey secretary of state signed it so talk to us about the constitutionality of all of that well
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:32.720]  i mean there the constitutionality is there is none there is the specifically the second
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:39.360]  amendment says as you know and all of your viewers know shall not be infringed not shall not be
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:44.560]  infringed unless there's armed violence shall not be infringed unless there's a mass shooting
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:50.160]  it's shall not be infringed and the thing that that most people most good well-intentioned
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:54.720]  constitutionalists and lovers of liberty don't understand is the second amendment has nothing
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.960]  to do with self-defense in the narrow way it has self-defense in the in the wider locky in way that
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:06.560]  is to say when the government becomes abusive of your rights it is your duty and your obligation
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:13.040]  and your right to throw off that government and at the end of the day our founding fathers understood
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.160]  that the second amendment had nothing to do with protecting yourself from burglars it has everything
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:24.800]  to do with protecting yourself from tyrants and the united nation no one no one is more tyrannical
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:31.040]  in its conception and in its operation than the united nation and they understand they have learned
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:37.040]  the lesson of history you know a gun without a bullet is just a club yes so go for go for the
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:43.600]  ammunition and i'll tell you the story of um i was invited by the ambassadors of mexico and spain to
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:49.840]  speak at the convention where they finally uh where they were drafting the arms trade treaty
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:57.200]  back in march by i think it was 2012 and i went to that and spoke there at their little meeting
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:04.320]  on behalf of the second amendment and these guys understood very well and made no uncertain terms
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:10.480]  that the goal of this ultimately is disarmament but the way to get there the best way to get there
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:15.440]  is to focus on the ammunition and yes they they they specifically something that most people
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.720]  don't know and i've written about but to my you know dismay it hasn't gotten enough traction
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:26.880]  which is the fact that it is the ammunition and at this meeting of the mexican and sponsored by
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:33.440]  spain and mexico they're at the un they mentioned specifically that they were working on in germany
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:38.000]  they were working on technology that was a a tiny chip that would be implanted in every round
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  and that chip would be required by international law to be used by every manufacturer of ammunition
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.720]  and that chip would cause the round of ammunition to self-destruct after it had been used one time
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.560]  meaning the end to all reloading of course and we're talking about reloading at the very beginning
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:03.920]  of the obama administration they've understood that this is that ammunition is the key thing as
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:08.960]  you pointed out a gun without ammunition is just a club at the very beginning of this they started
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:14.240]  out by not allowing the u.s. military to recycle the brass remember they pulled that back and then
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:19.120]  there was a couple senators who came back and fought against that and then a couple years later
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.760]  we uncovered some evidence that showed that they were still at a new york fort and i can't remember
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:29.120]  the name of it right now but they were still recycling this brass in terms of crushing it
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.680]  and selling it to china as scrap spending money to crush it selling it to china as scrap metal
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.160]  for far less than they could sell it back into the american market which is what the military
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:42.960]  has always done with their scrap brass so they they get rid of the brass they start making lead
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.880]  illegal in california they want to do that nationwide they want to outlaw lead ammunition
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:55.360]  so they understand not only as a full spectrum attack not just this un arms trade treaty but
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.440]  they want to get even to the components of ammunition and as you pointed out about the
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:04.160]  second amendment it's about it references infringement because i think they always
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.880]  visualize that this is going to be a gradual process and it has been a gradual process of
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:14.000]  infringement until now now they're getting very bold with this un arms trade treaty
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.680]  they're going for the whole enchilada as i said full spectrum gun control all components all aspects
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:25.200]  of it and and people don't realize you know everyone says well uh if the blue helmets come
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.680]  from my gun they'll be pried from my gold cold dead fingers what doesn't have anything to do with
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.080]  the blue helmets it'll be your local law enforcement that has been co-opted by the federal government
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.880]  yes i mean we we are seeing now that with the department of homeland security and
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.120]  with the department of defense giving grants and the homeland security creating fusion centers
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:48.240]  the local law enforcement is something that just doesn't exist anymore they're all simply outposts
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:54.560]  of the larger federal military uh law enforcement complex it's becoming a thing where it won't be a
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:02.160]  bluehead a blue helmeted u.n. soldier it'll be a the local deputy sheriff you know who has been
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.640]  armed to the teeth by homeland security in the department of defense you know they show up to
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.160]  serve bench warrants with a anti personnel vehicle and so that'll an armored personnel vehicle and
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:16.560]  that's how they'll show up to serve the warrant to you the notice to you that you haven't complied
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:22.160]  with the law requiring registration of firearms it's if you want to know exactly how it'll go down
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:28.080]  just uh read the history of the past 20 years or so of the united kingdom and australia and that'll
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.960]  tell you exactly how it'll go down you'll be it'll all be enforced by your local law enforcement
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:39.120]  acting on behalf of the uh the federal government and of course uh they may just kind of wait us
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.400]  out there was the fellow who did the war gaming scenario uh used to teach i still did teach at
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.600]  the military college uh in south carolina essentially talking about a revolution of tea
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.960]  partiers there and how that was going to play out in a scenario but one of the things that he
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:58.640]  controversially said was i will pry that out of your cold dead hands hopefully when you've died
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:04.320]  from natural causes we're just going to wait this out we're going to let us continually uh infringe
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:09.680]  on this until there's nothing left and then we're going to uh come for the little cleanup
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.680]  operations that we need to do elsewhere but one of the things i want to talk about at your article
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:19.520]  you pointed out the irony of this happening on christmas eve and you spend a lot of time talking
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:25.920]  about christians involvement and the understanding of where our rights come from that they transcend
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:31.200]  government they come directly from god and of course at the uh berlin wall when it fell down
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:39.280]  it was the christians who in mass went to the wall after having met for seven years and setting
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.480]  their churches up as a place where people could come and freely talk about politics openly and
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:49.120]  could come and pray for their country after seven years of that they marched on the wall
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:53.200]  almost like it was jericho so if it wasn't seven days it was seven years it's a long process
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:57.440]  it's a revival process i want to talk to joe wolberton about the transcendent issues when we

[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.760]  The arms trade treaty into effect on December 24th.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.760]  We've talked about the scope of this.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:35.760]  We've talked about how clever the government has become
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.760]  and their gun control efforts, how they have focused on ammunition.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.760]  And of course, we talked about how they early on stopped brass recycling from the military
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.760]  because of course the military makes their own ammunition.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.760]  They stopped that and then restarted it after senators protested that.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:58.760]  But then it appears we have information that looks like they may have continually stopped that
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  and are recycling that rather than putting it back into the market.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:06.760]  But of course, as Nico reminded me, the whole thing with the DHS that Paul Joseph Watson brokered
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.760]  and for wars, the fact that they are buying billions of rounds of ammunition
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:13.760]  and the ammunition shortages that they caused out of that,
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.760]  that was coming out of the general market because as I mentioned before,
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.760]  the military makes their own ammunition.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.760]  So they have understood that it's about ammunition.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:27.760]  They're working on infringing our basic rights but now this is coming for the entire thing.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:34.760]  This is full spectrum gun control, registration, ammunition, parts, everything.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:40.760]  Denying the right of individuals to own weapons and then also putting in an enforcement mechanism
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:45.760]  saying that they will enforce it with the UN although they may have the local police working for them.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.760]  I want to go back to Joe and Joe. One of the things that we didn't talk about in the last segment,
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.760]  of course, was the aspect of the transcendent right that we have.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:58.760]  The fact that the Constitution just merely recognizes those.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.760]  These are rights that we possess as human beings from our creator.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.760]  Going back to the Declaration of Independence, that understanding of our rights. Go ahead.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's important.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.760]  I tell people all the time when I've moved speeches that there are books
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  that say if you want to be part of what's going to happen,
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  if you want to be part of taking this country back to the place it needs to be,
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  the place it was destined to be,
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:25.760]  then you've got to read some of these books that the founders read that informed them
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.760]  and taught them from their cradle that we are endowed.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.760]  They did not create this idea.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.760]  Thomas Jefferson did not out of the blue decide that we were endowed by our creator
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.760]  with certain unalienable rights.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:40.760]  He discovered this from very little.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.760]  It's funny to understand that from the time that the federal government took control of education,
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  all of these people, all of their writings,
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:49.760]  people that most of your viewers probably haven't heard of,
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.760]  these people, Emmerich de Vaudel and Jean-Jacques Berlemachy and Samuel Pouffendorf
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.760]  and Alginon Sidney, these people that were all over the writings
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  and journals of our founding fathers were completely scrubbed from the notion of history,
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:08.760]  mainly to keep the idea out of our minds that we are endowed by our creator with certain rights.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.760]  And among those is the right to protect our life.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:17.760]  And Alexander Hamilton explained it very well in the Federalist Papers number 27 and 28
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.760]  that the purpose is to throw off tyranny.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.760]  John Locke, he learned it from John Locke as well.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  And John Locke learned it from those other guys.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  They could even go Joe to the Bible, couldn't they?
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:35.760]  And have a better revival to understand that we have to stand up for the defenseless
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.760]  for those who are being oppressed.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.760]  It was Jesus who overthrew the money changers, got angry about that.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.760]  Why is there no anger on the part of Christians when we see oppression?
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:50.760]  When we see oppression coming from our own government too often,
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:55.760]  I see Christians give government a cart block to do whatever they want to
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.760]  because of a misunderstanding of Romans.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.760]  And we've had pastors on to talk about this many times,
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:06.760]  but that's what I think it initially stems from is just a misunderstanding
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:10.760]  of the lines of authority and a lack of compassion for individuals.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:12.760]  I think you're exactly right.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:17.760]  I think Jesus in the Bible, as I mentioned in the article in Luke chapter 22,
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.760]  commanded his followers to purchase a sword.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:26.760]  I think Paul in his writings specifically said that it is our Christian duty
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:29.760]  to protect ourselves and protect our loved ones.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.760]  We're out of time. I wish we could go further, but we're out of time.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:34.760]  I know you can't continue. Thank you so much for joining us.

[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:09.760]  Mainstream media. Government cover-offs.

[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:16.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:26.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.760]  We're in Austin, of course, early in the program.
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:34.760]  We talked to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:38.760]  We talked to Lionel about the rules of engagement.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.760]  One aspect of the lawlessness that we see.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.760]  The lack of respect for the Constitution.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:47.760]  Of course, we just finished talking to Joe Wolverton from the New American
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.760]  about the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:53.760]  Brings up tremendous questions about what the real law of the land is.
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:57.760]  Are we going to allow these people under the pretense of following the law
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.760]  to do whatever they please?
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.760]  And essentially, I believe that's what the UN Arms Treaty represents.
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:07.760]  We've had John Kerry sign it, but we haven't had the Senate ratify it.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.760]  So it isn't even a real treaty as far as the American people go.
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:18.760]  But it is a very dangerous piece of legislation that is full spectrum gun control.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.760]  They may try to enforce it.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:24.760]  Obama has said that he's going to go through with his climate change agenda
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.760]  whether or not the Republicans like it.
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.760]  He has absolutely nothing but contempt for our legislative process for Congress.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.760]  And of course, Congress is aiding and abetting that by being passive.
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:40.760]  We know that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell have no problem with this kind of dictatorial power.
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.760]  They would like to see the Republicans in control of the levers of power.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:51.760]  So they're helping to create this monolithic megastate, hoping that they're going to have the levers one day.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:55.760]  But we're also going to be talking to Jerome Corsi at the bottom of the hour
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.760]  about the very executive order that many people have said Obama ought to clearly be impeached for.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:03.760]  You know, he said, I changed the law for you when he's talking to some demonstrators.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:05.760]  Then tried to walk that back.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.760]  And so I was just talking, speaking colloquially.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:10.760]  I didn't really mean I'd literally changed the law.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:14.760]  He really did, except that he didn't sign even his executive order.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:21.760]  Jerome Corsi looked at the executive order and he realized that it's never been filed with the archivists.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:23.760]  It was never signed. He's verified that.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.760]  That's up on the Drudge Report today.
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.760]  We're going to be talking to him at the bottom of the hour about his research.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:32.760]  Of course, we've got a dictator who doesn't even bother to sign his executive orders.
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.760]  But there may be more to it than that.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.760]  I want to go back to your calls.
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:43.760]  We're just talking about gun control, full-spectrum gun control, coming after not only the rights to own guns,
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:48.760]  but also coming after the guns, coming after the ammunition, coming after the parts, full registration,
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:54.760]  and then saying the UN reserves the right to come in as peacekeepers and take those guns away from you.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.760]  I want to go to Rich in Oregon.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:59.760]  You said you wanted to talk about guns, Rich. Go ahead.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.760]  Hey, David, how are you today?
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.760]  Doing fine. What's on your mind?
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.760]  My question is to you. I actually have two questions.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:16.760]  First of all, doesn't it say when the government in our Constitution becomes lawless that the people of the, let's say, of Americans,
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:23.760]  we do not follow the laws anymore as to what the government is breaking in my corrective manner?
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:30.760]  Yes. And I think there are a number of ways that haven't been tried legally and peacefully.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:35.760]  That's why I'm concerned about people who want to immediately go out and take direct action.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:41.760]  We see how people have reacted to the looters in Ferguson attaching that,
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:45.760]  even when they attach it to something that some people might support,
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.760]  an excessive case of police brutality or force.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.760]  They still don't support that because they don't understand what the problems are there.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:54.760]  I think there's a lot more education that needs to be done.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.760]  I want to see people standing up in juries and nullifying laws.
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.760]  That only takes one person to do that in a jury.
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:07.760]  If I don't see people doing that in juries, I don't think they're going to have my six if I want to come out and start using force.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.760]  I want to see people at the state level, sheriffs, state legislators.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:14.760]  I want to see them using the powers of nullification.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:19.760]  Joe Wilburton has talked quite a bit about that, the New American, talking about nullification.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:28.760]  That is a rightful remedy and we need to have some kind of, we need to have faithful people, people who are faithful to the principles this country was built upon,
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.760]  to be leaders, to have some kind of a power structure in there.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:33.760]  Hang on, we've got to come up to a break.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  I don't want to cut you off.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.760]  I want to let you have a chance to respond.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.760]  So hold on the phone there.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.760]  Rich in Oregon will be right back with your calls.
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:46.760]  We're going to have Jerome Corsi at the bottom of the hour talking about the contempt that Obama has for our rule of law.
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:50.760]  Not even bothering to sign his own dictates or file them.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:05:16.760]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:27.760]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:57.760]  We'll be right back.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:25.760]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:30.760]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:34.760]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:37.760]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:44.760]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently minded household.
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:47.760]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:54.760]  Go to infowarstore.com today to purchase your Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system.
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:07:18.760]  Or call 1-88-253-3139.
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:08:07.760]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:17.760]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:20.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:24.760]  I was taking some calls in the last segment and we ran out of time.
[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:27.760]  We had Rich from Oregon talking about gun control.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.760]  Of course, in the last hour we were talking to Joe Wilburton from the New American about the U.N.
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:37.760]  declaring that they're going to put into effect their arms trade treaty on December the 24th.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.760]  There's a lot of countries that have signed on to that treaty.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:44.760]  Actually, the U.S. hasn't. Only our Secretary of State has signed it.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:52.760]  That's not the way you ratify a treaty and you can't ratify a treaty that conflicts with our guaranteed constitutional rights.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:55.760]  But they do a lot of things under cover of law.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:59.760]  A lot of things illegally we've seen our government do and get away with it.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:03.760]  Because we've got a lot of people on both sides of the aisle that are complicit in this.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:10.760]  And of course, we're going to be talking at the bottom of the hour to Jerome Corsi about Obama's recent executive order bypassing Congress.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:14.760]  As he said, he changed the law and that's what he meant and that's what he really did.
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:18.760]  He did change the law, but he didn't even bother to sign his executive order.
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:22.760]  Jerome Corsi reported on that on WND and of course, Drudge Report picked it up.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.760]  We're going to talk to Jerome Corsi at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:30.760]  But right now, I want to go back to Rich in Oregon. Rich, we didn't have time for you to come back and finish your thoughts.
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:31.760]  Go ahead.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:36.760]  Well, the only thing I was thinking about, David, is first of all with the U.N. treaty,
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:42.760]  I don't know anything about the U.N. being part of the United States except for they'd like to be, I guess.
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:45.760]  I'm a U.S. citizen born and raised here.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.760]  However, I'm somebody that will not comply with anything such as gun control.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.760]  I just feel that it's an infringement upon my rights.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.760]  Number one, I know I'm not the only one to stem a loan on that file.
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:06.760]  But also two, how are they going to enforce that when over 200 million Americans are armed?
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:11.760]  Also, even when the police are out of control like that, I mean, you never know if you're going to get shot when you get stopped
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:14.760]  or if you're going to jail and you've never done nothing you like.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:22.760]  I understand, but I think Rich, the dangerous thing is they've gotten a lot more subtle and clever about the way they're approaching it.
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:24.760]  And that is they're focusing on ammunition.
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:28.760]  We've seen this with the massive purchases out of the civilian market with DHS.
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:32.760]  We've seen it with the dry up of the recycled brass out of the military.
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.760]  We've seen it with the lead bands.
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:35.760]  So that's what they're working on.
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.760]  They're working on, they may, I don't know if they'll be able, I don't think they're going to be able to push something like the UN Arms Trade Treaty through
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:44.760]  because it's too much at once.
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.760]  But they're coming at it from a process of infringement.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:52.760]  Our founders understood that they would not move against us all at once.
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:54.760]  They would typically come a little bit at a time.
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.760]  But who knows, they may get bold enough that they may try to just go for the whole enchilada all at once.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:03.760]  We'll see. I hope they don't do that because that's when, that's a lot of people's line in the sand.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.760]  Thank you so much, Rich and Oregon.
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:07.760]  Let's go to Aaron in Alaska.
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:09.760]  I think it's Alaska, right?
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.760]  You wanted to talk about the treaty?
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.760]  Yeah, it's actually Omaha.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.760]  Oh, okay.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:18.760]  It's great talking to you, David.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:28.760]  I just want to say that when my dad was my age, he was able to buy a fully automatic AK-47 with a hundred round clip.
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:31.760]  I mean, you're exactly right when they say that they're subtle.
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:34.760]  They are slowly coming at us.
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:38.760]  And the last car mentioned, you know, we have a lot of armed citizens.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:43.760]  Well, I mean, it's just, it's going to be piece by piece like it has been.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:52.760]  And you just said a lot of people's line in the sand a week ago when Alex was asking the question was that this treaty going through.
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:56.760]  And a lot of people don't believe that Agenda 21 isn't real.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:01.760]  The main critics, because it's not a ratified signed voting on law.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:04.760]  Well, I mean, they don't need that these days.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.760]  No, actually, Agenda 21 is just that it's an agenda.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:17.760]  What they do is they come up with these goals and processes and then they rely on a ran corporation process to enact that at the local level.
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:19.760]  And they actually even manipulate people.
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:27.760]  That's part of the ran process to manipulate the local population to believe that they actually had input on this, that this was actually their idea, that they signed onto it.
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:31.760]  And yet it's the same agenda that's being replicated in all these different areas.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:33.760]  So it's a very subtle thing.
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:37.760]  And we're seeing this, of course, with the gun control.
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:41.760]  It's also a very subtle, very gradual thing.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:45.760]  It's very concerning and people need to go back.
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:49.760]  And as Joe Wolverton was talking about, they need to understand their foundations.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.760]  They need to understand why this is there.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:56.760]  They need to understand the basis of our rights that our rights are not granted by government.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.760]  Government grants privileges that doesn't grant us rights.
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:03.760]  We have rights as human beings as creatures of our God.
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:06.760]  Going back to the Declaration of Independence is something that really resonates with people.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  When you explain it to them.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:12.760]  But of course, they're getting exactly the opposite information in the government schools.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:17.760]  That's why the government puts itself in control of education, puts itself in control of the schools.
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:19.760]  Thank you so much, Aaron.
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:22.760]  Let's go to Doug in Ohio.
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.760]  Doug, you said you had a nonviolent solution.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:28.760]  Absolutely. Hi, David. Good talking to you.
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:29.760]  Good talking to you.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:41.760]  I want to say thanks for you guys doing the great reporting you do and putting yourselves in jeopardy for all the things that could go wrong being an employee of Alex Jones because he's one of the greatest people ever.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:47.760]  One thing you need to understand is that we are all in jeopardy.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:50.760]  Everybody needs to understand they're being spied on.
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:53.760]  I mean, we know we're being spied on, but everybody needs to understand that.
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:58.760]  When they understand that, when they understand that it isn't black versus white, it isn't urban versus rural,
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  that's when things are going to change when people come together and realize this is a broad-based attack by a few people on the vast majority of us who just really want to live our lives and be left alone.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:09.760]  Go ahead.
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:11.760]  You want to talk about the nonviolent solution?
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:15.760]  And also, I had a couple other things on the guns, too.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:19.760]  But the nonviolent solution, you know, I'm an electrician and I do a lot of driving.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:30.760]  And, you know, I'm driving down the road, drag-dreaming, and I said, hey, what is the most powerful industry in the United States besides government?
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:31.760]  The trucking.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:32.760]  The trucking.
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.760]  And it's still ran by the people.
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:38.760]  My thing of it is, is we should be advertising, promoting.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:40.760]  We need to get the truckers on board.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:42.760]  They're going to shut this country down.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:44.760]  We're in deep, deep trouble.
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:45.760]  Talk is over.
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:52.760]  Let me tell you, as a trucker, you've got something on coming up in just, I would say, within the next five years, definitely within the next 10 years.
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:57.760]  They're going to go to self-driving cars and trucks are going to be one of the first places they're going to do it.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  It's going to be decimating to everybody that's in the transportation industry.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:12.760]  I mean, part of this fight that's going on with Uber and the taxi companies, I understand that for the longest time, taxi companies have used government control to shut out their competition.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:16.760]  They used it to shut down Jitney services at the very beginning of the existence of automobiles.
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.760]  They put minority businesses, minority taxi companies, independent companies are called Jitney taxis.
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:27.760]  They put them out of business, even though they didn't want to go to those areas because of the violence in those areas.
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:33.760]  You had small entrepreneurs who were black, for example, that would go into those areas, that would take the risk.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.760]  They wanted to serve those areas, but they outlawed it using the taxi system.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:44.760]  Now you've got this fight with Uber and the taxi companies, and you've got a lot of local governments that are pushing back against Uber.
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:51.760]  And I see a lot of conservatives and libertarians taking the side of Uber, not understanding where this is eventually going to go.
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:54.760]  They're not just going to put out the taxi companies.
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:57.760]  Uber has said they want to get rid of their own drivers.
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:02.760]  They're looking for drivers right now, but he has gone on record saying, you know what makes our service expensive?
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:05.760]  What makes taxis expensive? It's that other dude in the car.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:13.760]  Once we get rid of him, we become cheap, and we become so cheap that we make private ownership of cars go away.
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:19.760]  So it's not just your right to protect yourself, but it's your right to be able to move without government control,
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:22.760]  government monitoring of your computer-controlled car.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:30.760]  And I think that's something that's very concerning, but of course it's going to hit people in the transportation industry like you, the hardest, the earliest.
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:34.760]  Yeah, like I said, I'm not a trucker. I am an electrician.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:36.760]  Oh, okay. Okay. Sorry. Yes.
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:40.760]  Yeah, it's okay. Okay. But my thing of it is we need a Google bomb.
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:43.760]  We need to be on the CDs. We need to be in the truck stops.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:49.760]  We need to be advertising info wars on their media sites where the truckers go all the time.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:54.760]  We need to get the truckers involved because look, this country is going to be shut down. It's inevitable.
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  I say let's shut it down on our terms, David.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:59.760]  Yeah, yeah. I agree.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:09.760]  Let's shut this country down. We can bankrupt all these criminal corporate fees and we can tell our government we run this country, not you.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:13.760]  And we can put them in fear. And I just don't know. That's what I'm thinking.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:22.760]  And I could be right or wrong, but as of right now, it's the only industry in the U.S. that is ran by the people that has that much power.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:29.760]  It's probably more power than two country-standing armies, I believe the trucking industry has.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:34.760]  So that's my point on that. Also, I wanted to say that because I called in one other time.
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:37.760]  I'm not called in in 15 years. I've been listening forever.
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:42.760]  And I called in and I got 20 seconds and I went over the drug report.
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:53.760]  And I just want to say, and I need you guys, your reporters back there, to go to the, it's called the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  or you can Google how Matt Drudge and other Obamacare victims can escape the Liberty tax.
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:13.760]  You read that article and you scroll down under the Obamacare guidelines. It exempts for what they call, they are health care sharing ministries,
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:19.760]  which are exempt from Obamacare. And as you get insurance through them, you don't have to pay the fine.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:24.760]  Yes. American Ministries is one Medicare, MediShare, something like this.
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:32.760]  Another one, those are Christian ministries. And yeah, you can opt out taking the, taking the option of doing it on a religious basis.
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:36.760]  And those are great ministries. We belong to Samaritan Ministries.
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:44.760]  They essentially are helping each other by sending their premiums directly to the person who has a need each month.
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:50.760]  You pay a small annual, and it is a small annual fee to the administrative, to handle the administrative stuff of it.
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:56.760]  But most of your money is going directly to people that you know what their problem is. You can send them money.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:59.760]  They tell you what their problem is so you can pray for them. It's a great ministry.
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:05.760]  And it also gets you out of this Obamacare situation. Did you want to say anything else about that?
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:09.760]  Um, yeah, that you're, that's, I just wanted you guys to report on that.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:16.760]  That's all, just cover it and maybe explain it to people so maybe they could go there and avoid this because I'm a business owner too.
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:20.760]  But, um, also I got a question and then I got a statement.
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  One, the 22, the 22 ammo, it was like impossible to get.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:32.760]  Now 22 mags are impossible to get. You can get the 22 longs, you know, so you can go in your backyard and play around.
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:39.760]  I want to know why, why are, you can get in, you can get the 223, the 55 that, you know, you can get all the ammo.
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:41.760]  We're almost out of time. Make it quick.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:42.760]  I don't understand why.
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:50.760]  Why, why are you saying shortages and certain things like that? Yeah, well, I don't know except that I know they understand that they need to take away our ammunition.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:55.760]  We're going to be right back with more of your calls. We're going to have Jerome Corsi at the bottom of the hour. Thank you so much, Doug.
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:58.760]  He's going to talk about Obama not signing his order.

[02:22:56.760 --> 02:23:09.760]  It's very easy to be a criminal. All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool. A pair of scissors. If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:27.760]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness. The phone line. You shell out $1,500. Get locked into a long-term contract and think you're safe. But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip. And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:41.760]  Simply Safe Home Security is the smarter choice. Built by Harvard engineers, Simply Safe uses a wireless connection to call the cops. Scissors can't cut it. And that means your home stays safe. 24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:09.760]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:21.760]  I'm David Knight, your host today. In this next segment, we're going to try to get through as many calls as we can. And then joining us at the bottom of the hour is Dr. Jerome Corsi, a writer for WND.
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:38.760]  And of course, he has discovered that Obama did not sign his executive order. We're going to talk to him about what's behind that. But right now, I want to go back to your calls. Let's go to Dean in Florida. You had a comment about the executive order that we're going to be talking about in the next segment. Go ahead.
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:40.760]  How are you doing, Dave?
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:42.760]  Doing good.
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:25:04.760]  Yeah, I actually have a couple of points. But addressing the executive order, what it seems to me from what I understand about government and having lived 51 years, I really think that it's obviously not Obama who's doing this all on his own.
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:09.760]  I think it's important to recognize this is a conspiracy between all three branches of the government.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:11.760]  Oh, yes. Yes, they can easily stop it.
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:27.760]  What's going on here is the House and the Senate and the President are all bought and paid for. And they are doing the will of those who we do not see. I mean, the invisible or shadow type of government.
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:35.760]  So we're really an oligarchy. We're not what we appear to be. And it's quite unfortunate.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:47.760]  And let me interrupt you for a second there and say, I teased the interview last night. We're going to air it in full on Monday night. But I talked to Greg Morris, who's somebody that was involved with the SNL scandals from the very beginning.
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:26:02.760]  And he's made this exact point. He's done a lot of detailed research just as Dr. Corsi has on this executive order. He's done a lot of detailed research on exactly what happened and what created this mortgage crisis that we experienced beginning, noticed beginning in 2008.
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:18.760]  He's come up with some very specific documented claims. He's filed RICO statutes. He also explains in this interview how this is the largest case of tax evasion and security fraud we have ever seen in this country. And he has a freeway.
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:32.760]  If you want to stand up and be counted, as we said earlier when we were talking to Lionel, people who get frustrated sometimes they just get even more frustrated if they don't have a goal, if they don't have a course of action, if they just show up to protest.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:46.760]  He's got something to put it right in their face to expose us to the public, to get enough signatures behind the 15,000 pages of documents that he's produced to produce this and have some hearings and congressional hearings on this.
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:56.760]  Anyway, you need to listen to that interview. I won't plug that anymore, but go back to your point that you were making about this being a full spectrum process.
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:20.760]  Well, it was actually one of four quick points. I'll do this as fast as I can, but it's quite obvious that what's going on here is an absolute conspiracy and these congressmen, it doesn't matter who you vote for anymore.
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:34.760]  You can vote for any of these people. All of these people are doing and are going to do the bidding of those who truly control everything.
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:28:02.760]  Yeah, and the other, if I could go on to two other points real quick. I also wanted to say that one of the things that's very important for us to do and important for all the radio talk show hosts to do that are truly liberty minded is it's very important for us to publicly call on all law enforcement agencies
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:18.760]  to obey the constitution of the United States is put forth by the founders and to absolutely disregard, no matter what they're told, disregard any illegal orders that they are given.
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:36.760]  Even if it costs, even if it costs them their job. And we just had a story a couple of days ago about officers in normal Illinois filing lawsuits, several officers filing lawsuits saying that they've been given quotas, not only just for things like traffic tickets, but given felony quotas that they needed to file against people.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:48.760]  And I said, we're not going to do that. We're not going to make up charges against people just to meet your quotas to show that we're accomplishing something. So they filed these these rank and file officers have filed a lawsuit against their own police department.
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:55.760]  We need more people like that. And I think it's important to make that call out there to to support people when they do the right thing. Go ahead.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:15.760]  Yeah. And yeah, that's that's extremely important. And, you know, as as we see police are, you know, law enforcement's getting very, very tough on the population. And they really obviously they really need to be getting tough on the the ones who are really doing wrong, which
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:29.760]  is not going to do, which is the people on the top. The last point I wanted to make real quickly was in regards to reporting on protests, especially Ferguson and, and of course, one at a time. Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  The only thing I wanted to say was it's important to note that that's what's being shown when you see vandalism and stuff like that. Yeah, this may not be.
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:47.760]  Yes, absolutely. And of course, they turned the other way when it was vandalism because somebody was excited or upset about a sporting event. We're going to be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi. Stay with us.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:58.760]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:40.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we have joining us now Dr. Jerome Corsi but before I go to him I want to let you know that we have the cyber week specials at our site today.

[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  The best way you can wake people up I think is with these documentaries and of course keeping them awake as to what's happening on a nightly basis with the news.
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:01.760]  Now going to Dr. Corsi of course he is a senior staff writer for WorldNet Daily WND.
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:12.760]  He's also an investigative reporter emphasis on the investigative part because he went down and looked at the actual executive order to see if it was filed to see if it was signed.
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:21.760]  Guess what it wasn't what's behind that does Obama have so much contempt for the process that he doesn't even bother to sign his edicts anymore.
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:27.760]  Or is there something else there is he trying to distance himself from something that is impeachable.
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:30.760]  I want to get Dr. Corsi's take on that.
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:32.760]  Dr. Corsi thank you for joining us.
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:34.760]  Great pleasure to be with you. Thank you very much.
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:38.760]  This is a very interesting case and is picked up by the Drudge Report.
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:49.760]  You've been a couple of days with this and you verified with the National Archives Librarian Jeffrey Hartley that yes there has been no documentation filed about this executive order.
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:51.760]  Tell everybody about that.
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:36:09.760]  Well it started I got tipped off by a good friend on Wall Street who called me up yesterday very early in the day and said you know he couldn't find the executive order that Barack Obama signed implementing the speech on November 20th when Obama
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:25.760]  addressed the nation and said he was going to recommend this deferred prosecution for the basically the illegal immigrant kids who have come into the United States and to keep families together basically.
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:29.760]  And I said well let me look for it.
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:33.760]  I started looking around I said well you know I can't find it either.
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:45.760]  But you know about halfway through the day I realized that there was some sleight of hand being played here by the White House because what Obama had done was give the impression.
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:47.760]  The White House gave the impression.
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:50.760]  I mean I'm getting the press releases from the White House.
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:52.760]  The pool reports.
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:53.760]  I'm looking through those.
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:58.760]  The general impression is that there's going to be Obama executive order signed.
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.760]  He applies on the 21st to Vegas in the airplane.
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.760]  He signs two executive orders on immigration.
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:19.760]  And pool reporters are allowed to watch this but no print reporters or reporters would ask questions are allowed into the compartment of the air and Air Force One where President Obama is making the signatures.
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:33.760]  And so everybody just assumed that those were the executive orders implementing the deferred prosecution to allow these five million work authorization visas to be given to the parents of the dreamers.
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:34.760]  Yeah that's what everybody was talking about.
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:37.760]  It's like a massive expansion of the Dreamer Act.
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:39.760]  Everybody was talking about that.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:42.760]  Everybody's saying he signed this executive order and he's going back and forth saying that.
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:43.760]  Yeah go ahead.
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:49.760]  Well I mean it's interesting because the two we signed had nothing to do with this.
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.760]  One created a task force to study new immigrants coming in the United States.
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  The other said the Secretary of State and the Secretaries of DHS should get together and find ways to save money and make more efficient the issuing of immigrant non-immigrant visas.
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:14.760]  And I found both of those in the presidential executive orders on the White House website filed appropriately.
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:35.760]  And I found the only implementing order had been a memo written by the Department of Human Services J. Johnson had that was a memo instructing that they were going to do deferred prosecution on this class of dreamer parents for three years.
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:37.760]  Only three years.
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:39.760]  And there was nothing else that did it.
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  So I began really searching around and realized then that Johnson had signed this memo but had not filed it in the Federal Register which is another problem because federal agencies making new rules are supposed to file them for comment in the Federal Register.
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:15.760]  So kind of the final couple steps I took where I contacted the Attorney General's office in Texas, Greg Abbott's office because they had led the suit of 17 states filing against the Department of Homeland, against the Obama administration.
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:16.760]  Yes.
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:18.760]  And I decided I better figure out what that was about.
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:24.760]  And Abbott said well you know they too had concluded there was no executive order.
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:29.760]  It was all based on a memo that Johnson signed on his own authority.
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:36.760]  So we then contacted the National Archives and the National Archives confirmed that they too couldn't find an executive order.
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:38.760]  So this was all slayed ahead.
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  So as you point out, it's a head fake question, Mark.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:43.760]  Obama never signed an embassy order.
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:48.760]  It's a head fake like his swearing to the public constitution was a head fake, right?
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:40:00.760]  So I think I've got another piece coming out shortly that tries to put this all together but I think that the Obama people realize at the White House that they did not have the authority.
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.760]  Finally they figured it out.
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:15.760]  As Obama has been saying for years to change the law, which is what he wanted to do, so he kind of shuffled it off to J. Johnson and said you change the law.
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.760]  And I'll make like I'm changing the law.
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:20.760]  This is unbelievable.
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:24.760]  Here's a guy who, as we pointed out many times, he said 22 times I'm not a dictator.
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:27.760]  I can't just arbitrarily change the law.
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:29.760]  Then he says I changed the law.
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:31.760]  He talks about his executive amnesty that he's done.
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  And then when he's heckled by people who wanted him to do more, he says I changed the law for y'all.
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  And then he comes back and says this colloquial speech and yet he didn't even bother to sign or file any of this stuff that was all a head fake, right?
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:51.760]  And so I think there's some serious legal ramifications of this, which is what I'm writing about today.
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:41:01.760]  But I mean, first of all, in the context, when I wrote The Obama Nation, in 2008 about Obama, I said it was never experienced as an executive.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:09.760]  He's a radical leftist, Saul Alinsky trained community organizer and he'll tell you what you want to hear.
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:20.760]  And I think we're now living in the Gruber era after Jonathan Gruber, MIT professors, you know, come out and blathered about how much smarter he is than all the rest of us.
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:25.760]  And he's so smart that he can pull off lying to us for our own good.
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  Yeah, we need to change his name and make it a verb.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:29.760]  We say we grubbered the data.
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:32.760]  We tortured it in a purpose to lie and to deceive.
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:36.760]  And I guess we could say that Obama grubbered his executive order.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:38.760]  Obama grubbered amnesty.
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:41.760]  That's the story of Obama grubbering.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:43.760]  He didn't do any executive order.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:45.760]  All just a big head fake.
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:51.760]  I mean, thanks everybody for listening to the November 20th speech from the East Room of the Oval Office.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:53.760]  Nice big central hall behind them.
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:56.760]  It was really an impressive facade, you know.
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:57.760]  This is amazing.
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:03.760]  Now, they said at the Texas Attorney General's office, Governor like Greg Abbott said they were aware of this.
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:09.760]  I mean, what's the implication of this for the lawsuit that they filed?
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:11.760]  It's got some pretty serious implications.
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  I mean, one of the implications are that J. Johnson's out there on his own.
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:23.760]  And if anybody's going to be criminally prosecuted for spending money that wasn't authorized, you know,
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:25.760]  it'll be J. Johnson now.
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:28.760]  And Obama can say, well, you know, I don't know what he did.
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:29.760]  He did whatever he wanted to do.
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:31.760]  I didn't tell him to do that.
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:33.760]  J. Johnson changed the law.
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:35.760]  I didn't change the law.
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  I didn't build it.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:37.760]  He did it.
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:38.760]  He did it.
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:40.760]  It's the same thing Obama is saying about Lois Lerner.
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:41.760]  Yeah.
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:43.760]  Speaking after speech after speech.
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:44.760]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.760]  Saying how we've got a Tea Party in, you know, Citizens United and they're taking advantage
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:53.760]  of the tax deferred and Lois Lerner says, well, I'll fix that.
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:55.760]  I'll make sure none of them get through.
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:56.760]  Yeah.
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:01.760]  So if she creates an enemy's list and starts discriminating, which is against the law,
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:05.760]  against political applications on political basis for tax deferred status.
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:11.760]  Well, here, again, Obama gives out the message, this big speech, November 20th, and J. Johnson
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:13.760]  says, oh, don't worry about that, Mr. President.
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:14.760]  You don't have to sign anything.
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:16.760]  I'll go ahead and do an executive order for you.
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:17.760]  You have to do an executive order.
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  I'll do a memo.
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:26.760]  And so the next thing we're going to do is Obama say, I'm going to give you an executive
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:27.760]  order, not sign one.
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:29.760]  Put it in the drawer and say, I'll tell you what it means later on.
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:33.760]  Well, you know, this is very troubling on a lot of different issues because we really
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.760]  have hit into this Alice in Wonderland government that we've got here.
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:43.760]  Even my previous guest, Joe Wolverton, talking about the UN Arms Trade Treaty, they're saying
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:48.760]  they're going to declare that that's effective on December 24th.
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:54.760]  So we haven't ratified that in the Senate, and yet we've had John Kerry, Secretary of
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.760]  State, sign the UN ATT.
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:01.760]  And of course, it brings up a lot of questions about really what they're doing under color
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.760]  of law, things that they don't have legal authority to do, that they're just completely
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:12.760]  bypassing Congress, having department heads or having bureaucracies take action, and then
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:16.760]  knowing that the Department of Justice has got their back if anybody comes after them
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  in operations like we see with the IRS.
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:19.760]  Well, hey, exactly.
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:25.760]  I mean, the thing that really amazed me about the immigration, you know, the non-executive
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:31.760]  order, executive order, was that the White House took so many pains to cover this.
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:33.760]  First of all, we go back very carefully.
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:40.760]  They only said executive action, which means just, you know, a policy statement, not executive
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:41.760]  order.
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:42.760]  But nobody picked that up.
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:51.760]  Especially when Obama flew the next day to Las Vegas and made this big deal of signing
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:56.160]  two executive orders on immigration, letting them photograph all that.
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:03.760]  So of course, everybody thought he was signing the executive orders that implemented the
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:09.920]  dreamers' amnesty for the parents that he had promised the night before in the speech
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:11.280]  from the East Room.
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:12.880]  But that isn't what he did.
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:16.760]  He created a couple of task forces and told people to go study things.
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:17.760]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:19.280]  Well, look at this.
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:25.200]  It reminds me of these cases people are looking at of excessive police force, where they're
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:28.560]  looking at this and saying, wait a minute, we don't really have a prosecutor who's really
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:30.480]  interested in investigating this.
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:36.400]  You know, we've got Obama, who is essentially killing or has killed many segments of this
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.000]  economy, killed our legal system, is trying to kill our economy.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.380]  And of course, we got an apartment of justice prosecutor who's basically sitting on the
[02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:47.840]  sidelines and saying, I don't care if you use the IRS's against your political enemies.
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:48.840]  I don't care if you do this.
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.200]  I don't care if you do that.
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:51.720]  Basically giving him a pass.
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:57.320]  This is the entire country that's being killed with this kind of lawlessness done under color
[02:45:57.320 --> 02:45:58.320]  of law.
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:02.000]  And making it look like law procedures are being used.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.920]  That's what's so offensive about what Obama's done here.
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:09.480]  And it made me wonder, too, you know, I've also written about Vice President Biden has
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:13.840]  been to the Inter-American Bank and he said, we're going to give refugee status to the
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:17.800]  next wave of so-called unaccompanied minors coming from Central America.
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:20.840]  Well, refugee status is a term of the United Nations.
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:27.200]  And so I'm wondering if Obama's going to apply UN law and say these kids get into the United
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:33.760]  States with a real pass and a special route to citizenship because they're refugees under
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:34.760]  the UN.
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:40.640]  I mean, you could even start sending airplanes down to El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala,
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:45.000]  the expense of the federal government to pick these kids up as refugees to save them the
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.760]  indignity of coming across Mexico illegally crossed into the United States.
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:49.760]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.960]  I think some people have suggested that, you know, that's the thing is we cannot take and
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:56.560]  care for all of the poor of the world.
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:01.960]  We can try to and pass they have individuals have the government has tried to help people
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:07.280]  to get a leg up to get started on in their own economy, but basically no country can
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:12.800]  take on everybody as Obama wants to do unless you want to deliberately implode the economy
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:14.360]  in a clowered and piven strategy.
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:16.440]  And of course, that I believe is what is there.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:22.120]  So he's directly attacking our economy, attacking our energy industry going to China negotiating
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:27.280]  this deal with them saying that we're going to reduce our energy output by 25% over the
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:28.280]  next 11 years.
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:32.160]  China can continue to build these dirty power plants because this is all in the name of
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:35.880]  global warming yet global warming doesn't seem to be a problem when the Chinese are
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:36.880]  doing.
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:41.480]  They can continue to build their energy production for the next 16 years and then cap it no decline
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.080]  for them even after they've been building it for 16 years.
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:46.480]  So we see that he's trying to take down the economy.
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:48.760]  He's trying to take down our legal system.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:51.400]  And of course, the Republicans are playing ball with him, aren't they?
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:56.400]  Well, I mean, first of all, it also means you can't believe anything Obama says at the
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:58.840]  point I've been making from the beginning.
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.240]  This guy will tell you what you want to hear.
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:04.040]  He'll create an illusion that he's being illegal.
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:10.760]  One behind the scenes, he's got this slippery deal going on with Jay Johnson.
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:11.760]  Hey, wink, wink.
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:14.560]  I mean, two organized criminals couldn't have done it better.
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:15.560]  Let's go outside and talk.
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.200]  We don't want to talk this deal in here.
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.080]  Don't let it be you that made the deal.
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.880]  Boss, we'll let this guy down the road, make the deal.
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:25.000]  It's all the insulation.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:28.440]  Well, you know, Dr. Corsi, I didn't sign anything.
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:29.440]  Yeah.
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:34.760]  When I look at that, in a sense, I see a parallel to what our legislative branch has been doing
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.960]  for a long time with the regulatory agencies.
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:42.520]  I know Rand Paul has addressed this to some extent with a lot of reforms because they don't
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.880]  want to take the heat for a lot of unpopular things.
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.920]  So in many cases, what they'll do is they'll create an agency, give it broad mission strokes,
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:56.760]  but not write the actual laws and let the laws be written by these unelected bureaucrats.
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:01.000]  And then if they step over, the Congress can come in like knights on white horses and say,
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:05.040]  we're here to rescue you from this regulatory overreach.
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:09.920]  They've been putting this off to the regulatory agencies in the same way that Obama is putting
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:13.560]  this executive order off on Jay Johnson, haven't they?
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:14.560]  Well, and there's a comparability.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:20.960]  I mean, certainly the EPA and eliminating coal on the basis of clean air or clean water
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:21.960]  act.
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:22.960]  I mean, that's legislating.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:23.960]  Yes.
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:27.480]  And here you basically got to read, this is legislating.
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:33.440]  This is saying a class of people that should be deported, we're just not going to deport
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:34.440]  them.
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:37.680]  I mean, this is not prosecutorial discretion.
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:41.800]  Prosecutorial discretion to me means I'm the district attorney and I'm not going to bring
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:45.960]  this case to criminal trial because there's not good enough evidence.
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:50.080]  It doesn't mean that, hey, anybody who goes through a red light's okay with me because
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:52.440]  they don't have time to prosecute anybody.
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:53.440]  That's right.
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:55.240]  That's right.
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:56.400]  Absolute criminal behavior.
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:01.920]  But again, as I say, I think we see this also in the case of regulatory agencies and it's
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:04.520]  something that's been going back through several administrations.
[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:06.520]  This has become an established fact.
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:08.640]  I mean, we look at this situation.
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:13.520]  Obamacare, Obamacare is the same way, Obamacare, they passed a bill that was already humongous
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:16.800]  and then it gets expanded in the bureaucracy.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:24.080]  So a pile of paper, a six foot tall becomes a pile of paper, 26 feet tall after the regulators
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:25.360]  get finished with it.
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:26.360]  That's right.
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:27.360]  IRS is the same way.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:32.200]  Who could read the tax code anymore after you get finished with the IRS regulations?
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:36.720]  When Nancy Pelosi said, we have to pass it so we can find out what's in it, I don't think
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:39.280]  she was simply talking about what was in the regulations.
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:44.000]  I think she was talking about once they let this gigantic regulatory monster that they're
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.920]  going to create work at it for a while, then they're going to see what it looks like.
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:49.720]  But they're basically punting that off to them.
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:50.720]  We're going to take a break.
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:55.120]  We're going to be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi and then we'll take your calls and overdrive.
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:56.120]  Stay with us.

[02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:03.760]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes and surroundings without the right equipment.
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:05.480]  You'll never know it's there.
[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:10.000]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment and
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:15.080]  Mazur instruments are your best line of defense unlike lower cost products.
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:21.040]  Mazur instruments detects all forms of nuclear radiation including alpha, beta, gamma and
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:22.040]  X-rays.
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:27.520]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but Mazur instruments are
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:28.520]  different.
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:33.560]  They're designed to be always on, just like your smoke alarm, detecting, measuring and
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:35.880]  monitoring nuclear radiation.
[02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:36.880]  Made in America.
[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:42.800]  Mazur instruments are laboratory grade, EMP resistant and powered by common 9 volt batteries.
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:49.040]  Get the details at Mazurinstruments.com, spelled M-A-C-U-R instruments.com.
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:54.520]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared, but now you can
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:57.520]  be at Mazurinstruments.com.
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:01.520]  Big job, big job.
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:10.520]  Every morning at the mine you can see him arrive, he stood six foot six and waited 245
[02:54:10.520 --> 02:54:15.320]  kind of broad at the shoulder and narrowed the hip and everybody knew you didn't give
[02:54:15.320 --> 02:54:16.320]  no lip.
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:17.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:24.040]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Jerome Corsi of WND.com, investigative reporter
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:30.080]  as well as a senior staff writer, expert on political violence and terrorism.
[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:36.080]  He uncovered the fact that of course Obama's executive order for amnesty was really just
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:37.080]  a head fake.
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:43.200]  He never signed anything, never filed anything and of course Dr. Corsi, as you point out,
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  Jay Johnson has put something there, but he has not followed the procedures for new regulations
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:53.360]  in terms of a guidelines to have a comment period and that sort of thing.
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:55.080]  So where are we now with this?
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:55:01.160]  Now that Obama's been lying to everybody saying that he was changing the law, that he was
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:04.600]  doing an executive order for amnesty and then there isn't any executive order, there's
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:10.720]  just an order from Jay Johnson to say that they're not going to take action against people
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:12.200]  who are here.
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:19.520]  What does that say about this lawsuit that was filed by the 17 different states?
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:23.920]  Are they still focused on Obama or are they going to focus on Jay Johnson at DHS?
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:24.920]  What happens with this?
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:30.680]  Well, the lawsuit focuses on both and it's really asking for injunctive relief.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:37.000]  It's asking to have the U.S. District Court issue an order that just stops all this for
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.800]  a while, sort it out.
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:45.000]  I think that the- But then, of course, if they stop it, I mean, what their executive
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.880]  order is saying is that they're not going to do anything.
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:54.560]  So I mean, can we force them to obey and enforce the law when we do an injunction?
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:55.560]  Yes.
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.520]  The injunction by stopping the implementation of Jay Johnson's memo would mean that they
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:09.960]  could not start issuing these work authorizations or give insured non-deportation status to
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:14.640]  the parents of the dreamers for three years, which is what Johnson's memo said.
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:16.000]  So that all stops.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.560]  They can't hire a bureaucracy.
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:19.920]  They can't begin issuing these cards.
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:21.080]  They can't open offices.
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:24.560]  They can't process anything if the court just stops it.
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:29.720]  Now, a stopping motion kind of tries to prevent any more damage to be done.
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:33.120]  You could still have defunding action by the Congress.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:37.720]  You could have legal action that could be criminal investigations, whether Jay Johnson
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:42.400]  had authorized the spending of money that was not authorized by Congress.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.240]  That is a criminal violation under U.S. law.
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.320]  There are various actions that could be taken, but it depends.
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:57.760]  I think the political reality is that in the lame duck Congress, you're not going to get
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:56:58.760]  very much settled.
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:05.200]  In other words, this is going to be a past the buck experience until January.
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:13.280]  And if the 17 states did get an injunctive relief, then you couldn't get to January with
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.880]  the program already being implemented, it would be in an abeyance as the Congress would
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:19.640]  come in with Republican majorities.
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:26.080]  And I think the Tea Party and conservative voices within the Republican Party would
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:31.520]  have to steal a lot more of the leadership of Boehner and McConnell when they come back
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:38.160]  and realize that they have a larger number of Republicans in both House and Senate,
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:42.120]  and they were elected because Obama's policies were repudiated.
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:50.080]  So you might get a tougher GOP Congress in January, even Boehner and McConnell are counting
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:51.080]  on it.
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:55.360]  Oh, and of course, what's going to happen though is that even if they can block them
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:59.760]  from doing some of these positive actions, and I know they had printed up 34 million
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:04.280]  cards to give people and so forth, they can stop them from issuing that kind of thing.
[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:08.120]  Still, the message that he put out there, that who is able to get out there with his
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:14.360]  head fake, is an incentive for more illegal immigration, knowing that at some point they're
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:17.520]  going to work out the details and these people are going to get to stay here with subsidies
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:18.520]  and that sort of thing.
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:19.520]  I agree, it's a green light.
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:20.520]  Well, we're out of time.
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:23.960]  Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Corsi, and we're going to look forward to seeing
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:26.880]  what you uncover and seeing how this turns out an amazing story.
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:27.880]  Stay with us right after the break.
[02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:30.360]  We're going to take the people who are on the line right now, try to get through as
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:31.520]  many of those calls as we can.
[02:58:31.520 --> 02:59:00.520]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:00.520 --> 02:59:26.520]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:53.680]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:56.520 --> 03:00:24.200]  We'll be right back.
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:29.600]  All right, I'm David Knight and we're back to take some of your calls.
[03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:30.600]  I'm going to move through these quickly.
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:33.480]  We've had some people waiting on hold for quite some time.
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:35.480]  Let's go right away to Lisa in Illinois.
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:36.480]  Lisa?
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:42.240]  Yes, I'm calling because my son was pulled over for blowing a stop sign that we still
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:44.480]  can't find where it exists.
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:49.560]  They put him on probation for a year and told him he cannot.
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:52.560]  He has a firearm possession of a firearm.
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:55.320]  He has a firearms card and a gun.
[03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:56.320]  Wow.
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:00:58.760]  And I asked him, what do you want him to do with the gun?
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:03.560]  The court said, he has to give it to somebody who has a firearms card and I said, well,
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:05.560]  that would be me.
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:07.680]  And they said, well, do you live with him?
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:08.680]  I said, yes, I do.
[03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:10.680]  They said, you can't have it either.
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:11.680]  Wow.
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:16.360]  So they've instructed me to remove the gun from the house and I don't understand how
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:19.680]  a gun has anything to do with the traffic violation.
[03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:22.080]  Well, that's how they're expanding this.
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:28.040]  We heard in the wake of a lot of these shootings, conservatives who would normally be supportive
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:32.080]  of gun rights saying, well, we need to look at people for psychological evaluation and
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:36.200]  take that away, take their guns away from them if there's some issue about that.
[03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:38.600]  But of course, who gets to decide that?
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:40.000]  What kind of a due process do you have?
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.880]  And of course you say, it was for a stop sign violation?
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:45.880]  Well, they came after your son.
[03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:46.880]  They wouldn't arrest him.
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:47.880]  He told them, arrest me.
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:48.880]  Take me to jail.
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:50.360]  They said, no, we will not.
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:54.520]  He said, well, if you're taking my truck and you're not arresting me, how do I get home?
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:56.280]  They said, walk.
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:57.560]  They confiscated his car?
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:01:58.560]  Yes.
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:01:59.560]  For a stop sign violation.
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:02.000]  What part of Illinois are you in?
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  Is this a state?
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.480]  I'm in Joliet, city of Joliet.
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:05.480]  Wow.
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:06.480]  Wow, that's amazing.
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:09.640]  Do you have jury trials there for traffic courts?
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:18.640]  Yeah, he pleaded innocent and the public defender came up and said, this is what we want.
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:24.400]  You will pay $1,000 fine and you will do 100 hours of community service.
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:30.080]  You will remove your gun from your home and then he had to transfer the gun, which I did
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:31.080]  that for him.
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:34.560]  But this was over a stop sign violation?
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:36.240]  Like, oh, we have a transfer form here.
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:38.000]  Oh, officer, here you go.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:39.320]  Yeah, wait a minute.
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:44.160]  What was he found guilty of, is breaking a going through a stop sign?
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:45.160]  Yeah.
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:46.600]  And we can't find the stop sign.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:50.400]  We keep asking, where's the stop sign you claim is at this intersection, there's no stop
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:51.400]  sign there.
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:52.400]  Wow.
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:55.120]  They're like, oh, someone called it and they've seen him blow the stop sign at 11 o'clock
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:56.120]  at night.
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:57.120]  Wow.
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:02:59.840]  People are calling in, report blown stop signs at 11 o'clock at night.
[03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:00.840]  I don't think so.
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:03.200]  Yeah, there's definitely something else going on.
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:07.920]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that, you know, that just another illustration of how people can
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:08.920]  get railroaded.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:11.480]  And we talk about, we hear people all the time saying, well, you should take the guns
[03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:14.480]  of people who have been found guilty of a felony.
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:20.160]  You know, it's a felony in Florida to release a helium balloon on certain beaches at certain
[03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:21.240]  times of the year.
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:24.720]  They charge one man down there with four felonies for releasing four balloons.
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:26.520]  Should he have all of his guns confiscated?
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:28.440]  Should he be considered a felon?
[03:03:28.440 --> 03:03:29.880]  Should he lose his voting rights or whatever?
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:32.040]  I'm so sorry that happened to you, Lisa.
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:34.200]  Let's go to Ned in Oregon.
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:35.200]  Ned.
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:36.200]  Yeah, hi.
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:37.200]  Hey.
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:38.880]  A couple of things.
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:44.440]  One is that the UN has no power over the U.S. Constitution.
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:48.320]  I don't care what they sign or anything like that, it has no power over the U.S. Constitution.
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:52.160]  You know, it's a very sacred document in that regards.
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:57.880]  But the other issue too about guns that I think is ludicrous is that there are millions
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:01.800]  and millions of guns out there that aren't registered.
[03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:03.360]  And there's nothing that can be done about it.
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:04.360]  They don't know where they're at.
[03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:05.880]  They don't know who has them or anything.
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:12.760]  Of course, what they will do is they will strangle people by going after the spare parts,
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:16.960]  by going after the ammunition, whether they get that through with the UN arms trade treaty.
[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:20.040]  That's the direction that they're going to start heading with this gun control legislation.
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:22.080]  And of course, I agree with you.
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:27.600]  There is no way that they can legally enforce a UN treaty that hasn't been even ratified
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:29.840]  by the Senate that conflicts with our Constitution.
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:34.840]  And yet, we see over and over again that under color of law, we see Obama doing a head fake
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:35.920]  on amnesty.
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.880]  We see them violating the law on so many different issues.
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:40.880]  Will they do it with us?
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:41.880]  Of course they will.
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:45.680]  They'll say that they have authority to do it and they will have people who will back
[03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:46.680]  them up.
[03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:48.000]  I'm sorry, I couldn't get to the other callers today.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.280]  Tonight, 7th Central, 8 p.m. The Nightly News.
[03:04:51.280 --> 03:05:06.080]  Have a nice day, everyone, and I'll see you in the next video.
