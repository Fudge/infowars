[00:00.000 --> 00:09.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, April 10th, 2017, thin red line, Russia and Iran pledge
[00:09.120 --> 00:11.920]  to hit back against further Syria strikes.
[00:11.920 --> 00:16.000]  And there's an article on infowars.com, Trump pushes back against a neocon plan to invade
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  Syria.
[00:17.000 --> 00:24.000]  It's an exclusive, but first, a powerful report from John Baum, but it's in the news that
[00:24.000 --> 00:31.080]  thousands of army special forces, thousands of Navy SEALs, and the numbers I've been told
[00:31.080 --> 00:38.840]  are above 10,000 regular U.S. Army alone in Iraq, in Western Iraq in support of that,
[00:38.840 --> 00:41.920]  but also an even larger force now going into Syria.
[00:41.920 --> 00:47.560]  Now, I heard this a few weeks ago from my Pentagon sources, but when you've got thousands
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.560]  of U.S. troops in Syria in the last 80 days, that's how long Trump's been in, it started
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.720]  days after he got in.
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.400]  And you've got tens of thousands on their way.
[00:58.400 --> 00:59.840]  That is boots on the ground.
[00:59.840 --> 01:01.340]  That is an invasion.
[01:01.340 --> 01:08.240]  Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation or consultation or permission,
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.360]  they are invaders, whether they are American, Turkish or any other one, and we don't think
[01:14.360 --> 01:17.080]  this is going to help.
[01:17.080 --> 01:19.680]  What are they going to do to fight ISIS?
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.640]  You have Trump saying he's signaling to do more, you have McMaster, the head national
[01:23.640 --> 01:30.400]  security advisor to the president, who replaced Michael Flynn, saying we intend to take out
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.920]  ISIS and we intend to take out Assad simultaneously.
[01:37.920 --> 01:38.920]  H.R.
[01:38.920 --> 01:44.120]  McMaster has actually been manipulating intelligence reports that go to Trump and manipulating what
[01:44.120 --> 01:52.360]  is happening because McMaster wants a full-scale, 150,000 boots on the ground, war with Syria.
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.240]  He's doing this at the behest of the betrayals, so once you really start looking at the personnel
[01:57.240 --> 02:02.760]  decisions being made and how good people are being denied security clearances and bad people
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.160]  are being brought in, you realize that the betrayals and McMaster have completely taken
[02:07.160 --> 02:12.440]  over the NSC and they're trying to manipulate Trump into getting us into a full-scale war
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.440]  in the Middle East.
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.680]  And McMaster was actually overheard screaming two weeks ago, if he sees Steve Bannon again,
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.040]  he's going to get his hands all over him and hit him and get violent.
[02:22.040 --> 02:28.400]  So McMaster is really extreme and very hateful of Bannon and anybody who is actually a nationalist
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.560]  and is opposed to another full-scale war in Iraq.
[02:32.560 --> 02:37.160]  That's why Bannon is not on the National Security Council anymore.
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.560]  Nikki Haley goes on CNN and says, we need regime change.
[02:40.560 --> 02:44.600]  We cannot have a peaceful solution in Syria without getting rid of Assad.
[02:44.600 --> 02:49.560]  McMaster himself goes on and says that he wants to get rid of Assad.
[02:49.560 --> 02:50.560]  Regime change.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.560]  Sure.
[02:51.560 --> 02:53.080]  I mean, that's all over the news for two days.
[02:53.080 --> 02:55.080]  And then we know US troops are already massing.
[02:55.080 --> 02:56.080]  That's in the news.
[02:56.080 --> 02:58.200]  But then they go, oh, no one's massing.
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.200]  No one's massing.
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.160]  And then they tell Trump, oh, this is a cover for us in case Assad attacks us.
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.200]  So it looks like the president's had his foreign policy taken away from him.
[03:08.200 --> 03:14.520]  Yeah, the deep state has performed a silent coup by taking over NSC and Petraeus is behind
[03:14.520 --> 03:15.520]  all of this.
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.320]  Petraeus takes massive amounts of money from the Saudi Arabians.
[03:19.320 --> 03:25.520]  McMaster is actually more loyal to Saudi Arabia than he is to America and to American soldiers.
[03:25.520 --> 03:27.920]  So the Saudis are behind this too.
[03:27.920 --> 03:30.440]  They're funding a lot of the media operations.
[03:30.440 --> 03:33.720]  Petraeus has a lot of friendly people in the media.
[03:33.720 --> 03:40.360]  So they're building up the forces right now and they're letting Russia know when we go
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.360]  in, you better back off.
[03:41.360 --> 03:44.160]  And this is why Trump thinks he can do this.
[03:44.160 --> 03:49.840]  He believes if they cut it off, kick out Assad, they'll be able to put it in a provisional
[03:49.840 --> 03:56.120]  government, stabilize it, have the US military there, cut off Iran, who's trying to take
[03:56.120 --> 03:58.880]  it over, and cut off Saudi Arabia and basically block it.
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.920]  He's kind of going back to an Eisenhower plan pre-1960, which was a good plan before
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.440]  it, but the secular government in Iraq and other things like that.
[04:08.440 --> 04:12.600]  That previous Eisenhower plan left Assad's daddy alone or the people for him, all of
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.600]  it.
[04:13.600 --> 04:18.320]  So all that's going on and he thinks he can stabilize it, cut it off, end it, be a big
[04:18.320 --> 04:22.000]  peacemaker because he's told if he doesn't, it's going to keep on going and it's about
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.680]  the flood into Europe because Erdogan has now openly announced he's with ISIS, al-Qaeda
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.600]  and Saudi Arabia that's about to menace Europe, so this is more about taking out Turkey if
[04:29.600 --> 04:30.600]  they make a move.
[04:30.600 --> 04:34.520]  We've got nuclear weapons inside their country and more instead of Syria.
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.840]  The world is in such a crisis and it's about showing strength to China, who is belligerently
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.880]  claiming they control 90% of the sea lanes in the South China Sea, the most busy area
[04:43.880 --> 04:47.440]  in the world, from Japan all the way down to the Philippines, and it's about letting
[04:47.440 --> 04:51.400]  everybody know we're getting ready to take out Kim Jong-un, we're tired of him menacing
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.120]  the world, we're tired of him holding his hostage after he was given reactors and everything
[04:55.120 --> 04:59.120]  else, the 90s claiming he'd stop this, we're done.
[04:59.120 --> 05:04.640]  When we the people elected Donald Trump, we exhaled in relief, believing that we're going
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.640]  to crush ISIS with the help of Russia and that we've averted a nuclear war, in which
[05:08.640 --> 05:10.720]  we would have been already had Hillary won.
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.040]  The sense of relief has just been flipped on its head, it appears we're in the brink
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.000]  of nuclear war, and Russia is made out to be our enemy once again.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.160]  Explanations for this drastic turn of events range from this being part of Machiavelli
[05:21.160 --> 05:25.480]  tactics meant to in fact prevent a world war, with Russia being led in on the game, to
[05:25.480 --> 05:29.480]  Trump being hopelessly surrounded by deep state stuges who still hate him despite of
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.840]  all the newly founded love they're professing for him, and whose goal is to impeach and
[05:32.840 --> 05:37.360]  replace him with a bloodthirsty, war hungry zealot, the life of which we've never seen.
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.160]  Either way, the military industrial complex wins, and that is not why we elected Trump,
[05:41.160 --> 05:43.960]  this movement of making America great again is bigger than Trump.
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.800]  Trump is not our leader, he's our follower, and we must lead him in our dogged determination
[05:48.800 --> 05:53.040]  to ensure our children have a future, so don't give up on Trump, thus allowing him to become
[05:53.040 --> 05:55.200]  just another casualty of the deep state.
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.280]  After all no one said taking America back is going to be easy.

[06:10.960 --> 06:14.440]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from

[08:24.720 --> 08:36.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.760]  Here we are on this Monday, the 10th day of April, 2017, global broadcast.
[08:40.760 --> 08:43.560]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[08:43.560 --> 08:45.600]  We have several important guests joining us.
[08:45.600 --> 08:53.000]  We also have some really important inside intel from people associated with the CIA
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.800]  about what really went on with the supposed sarin gas attack last week and the response
[09:01.800 --> 09:09.360]  on Thursday evening by President Trump while the Chinese Communist dictator was here.
[09:09.360 --> 09:17.520]  Also have a lot of other inside intel that I'm going to be going over today, but I'm
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.880]  actually waiting until I get word back from some folks on whether I should even get into
[09:20.880 --> 09:31.760]  all of it or not, but believe me, it is all important.
[09:31.760 --> 09:35.000]  I'm really going to try to be calm today instead of going into my regular rant mode
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.120]  where I just go over all the information and perseverate.
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.040]  And I do think we should open the phones up throughout the four hours in between guests
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.320]  to get the public's response and to get the public's angles on what's happened.
[09:49.320 --> 09:54.360]  So first-time callers, long-time callers, I do want to take a lot of your phone calls
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.280]  and are sparse for the news and a lot of the clips we're going to be playing on what do
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.640]  you think about the Syria strike and what do you think about the direction this country's
[10:02.640 --> 10:05.680]  going in?
[10:05.680 --> 10:12.320]  What do you think this does to President Trump's promises to try to not be entangled in foreign
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.880]  wars, specifically pointing out the quagmire in Syria?
[10:17.880 --> 10:23.160]  It knows full well that it was a false flag attack back in 2013, there were a bunch of
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.360]  others that pointed towards the rebels but couldn't be confirmed.
[10:29.360 --> 10:34.120]  And there's no reason that Assad would use chemicals when he was already winning the
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.080]  war.
[10:38.080 --> 10:44.720]  The U.S. military has forces massed in Syria and in Iraq and more on the way, the Marine
[10:44.720 --> 10:51.600]  Expeditionary Force is there with heavy artillery, any aircraft weapons to back up the army to
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.720]  go into the cities.
[10:56.720 --> 11:03.480]  So ground war to push out ISIS is being prepared and General McMasters, the head of the National
[11:03.480 --> 11:11.440]  Security Council for the President's National Security Advisor, he has come out last week
[11:11.440 --> 11:19.160]  and this week and said, quote, we want to take out ISIS and Assad simultaneously.
[11:19.160 --> 11:22.080]  Now that's very, very clear, isn't it?
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.440]  Meanwhile, according to my White House sources, Trump openly says in meetings, we're not doing
[11:26.440 --> 11:31.520]  an O-fly zone, we're not escalating this, I want ISIS out of there.
[11:31.520 --> 11:34.760]  Then we can negotiate with Assad to step down.
[11:34.760 --> 11:38.920]  Four years ago Assad made a deal with the U.S. military and the Russians that they would
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.660]  push out ISIS slash al-Qaeda, because the media tries to confuse the terms, so I always
[11:43.660 --> 11:51.840]  mention them together, and that once they were removed from the country, Assad would
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.040]  transfer power to an elected government.
[11:58.040 --> 12:03.880]  So the U.S. military is there, according to Trump, to kick al-Qaeda and ISIS out into
[12:03.880 --> 12:09.360]  Iraq where the Spencer movement of the forces in Iraq are waiting to crush it so they can't
[12:09.360 --> 12:15.320]  just start a new war there, and then Assad will then be dictated to on how he's going
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.120]  to leave peacefully.
[12:20.120 --> 12:24.520]  The word is Assad has begun to waffle on leaving.
[12:24.520 --> 12:31.760]  So you could argue Trump has an argument in that Assad hasn't completely gotten rid of
[12:31.760 --> 12:36.520]  the chemical weapons, there were clearly some chemical weapons at that base, there's photos
[12:36.520 --> 12:40.160]  of them, there's video of them, it is the containers, those very chemical weapons they
[12:40.160 --> 12:42.360]  admitted they had were contained in.
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.280]  So the argument is you take out the chemical weapons, you take out the base, the bunkers
[12:48.280 --> 12:55.040]  they're held in, and then they can't use them and the agreement's been basically followed
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.800]  through on, and then Trump looks strong to his detractors that say he's a Russian agent
[12:59.800 --> 13:02.600]  and has to be removed from power.
[13:02.600 --> 13:09.920]  But you've got to pull back from all this and understand that McMasters and the rest
[13:09.920 --> 13:16.800]  of the people on the National Security Council now are calling for the removal of Assad.
[13:16.800 --> 13:21.480]  So the president on one side of his mouth saying he doesn't want to escalate the war,
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.400]  but out of the other side his people are moving forward with major boots on the ground.
[13:26.400 --> 13:32.960]  There is a U.S. invasion ongoing for 80 plus days in Syria and it's escalating quickly
[13:32.960 --> 13:35.640]  and the word is they're going in big time.
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.360]  They're already in, but this is just establishing the beachheads and the defense perimeters
[13:41.360 --> 13:46.960]  with the anti-aircraft guns, with the missiles and with the artillery, with the radar, the
[13:46.960 --> 13:52.160]  avionics, the systems, the ships are moving in, everything's lined up, more Russian ships
[13:52.160 --> 14:01.920]  are coming in, and the Russians have said that they intend, if there's any more strikes,
[14:01.920 --> 14:02.920]  to shoot back.
[14:02.920 --> 14:09.400]  Putin's war threats to West warns Trump, thin red line, Russia and Iran pledge to hit back
[14:09.400 --> 14:17.720]  against further Syria strikes as they blast U.S. for crossing red lines, and that's out
[14:17.720 --> 14:18.720]  of the sun.
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.080]  You know, the sun's a tabloid, our major newspapers won't even run with this because
[14:23.080 --> 14:24.600]  they don't even want you to know.
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.480]  These are official statements out of the Duma, official statements by Putin, official statements
[14:29.480 --> 14:37.960]  by Medvedev, official statements by all of them.
[14:37.960 --> 14:40.160]  We're going to go over all those quotes.
[14:40.160 --> 14:48.500]  Russian politician calls for retaliatory strikes against U.S. state Duma member wants to send
[14:48.500 --> 14:55.760]  a message to Trump, that's the leader of the Democratic party of Russia, Vladimir Zyrinovsky,
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.000]  has called for Moscow to carry out retaliatory strikes against the U.S. in response to Trump's
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.680]  administration's airstrike on Syria, because I'm saying, well, this guy always is a hothead.
[15:03.680 --> 15:09.160]  Well, he's probably the second most powerful person in Russia, and actually, he's only
[15:09.160 --> 15:15.080]  quoting what Putin said word for word.
[15:15.080 --> 15:19.040]  Now there's a report I've got directly out of the White House and other sources that
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.640]  in these meetings, Trump is saying, I'm not putting up a no fly zone, I don't intend to
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.440]  escalate this, and I don't have the generals bossing me around.
[15:26.440 --> 15:30.760]  We've got that force there to protect our ground troops as they kick ISIS and al-Qaeda
[15:30.760 --> 15:33.000]  out of the country.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.400]  We intend to end the civil war that threatens all of Europe because if that country falls
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.320]  to a hobbyist, then we already have Turkey linking up with them, calling for jihadists
[15:41.320 --> 15:42.320]  in Europe.
[15:42.320 --> 15:45.920]  We have a direct invasion route into Europe, and we'll have the jihadists that started
[15:45.920 --> 15:47.880]  the crusades all over again.
[15:47.880 --> 15:55.560]  This is exclusive information Paul Joseph Watson has in his article on infowars.com.
[15:55.560 --> 16:01.040]  Trump pushes back against neoconplanned to invade Syria, and I rarely agree with CNN,
[16:01.040 --> 16:03.080]  but here's the headline from CNN.
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.320]  Trump administration sends mixed signals on Syria ahead of G7 meeting.
[16:07.320 --> 16:10.720]  Boy, they said it.
[16:10.720 --> 16:15.000]  Well, it was George Washington trained by the greatest empire on earth at the time
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.040]  who said, no, foreign entanglements, let's have our own wealth, our own country, because
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.880]  these foreign wars don't even help the people, they help the elites, and are more trouble
[16:22.880 --> 16:23.880]  than they're worth.
[16:23.880 --> 16:27.440]  He didn't even say that from some moral position, even though he was a very moral man.
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.880]  He said it from a very informed, educated system, and he launched the American system.
[16:31.880 --> 16:40.040]  Now by 1898, with William McKinley, we began to become an empire, and our problems have
[16:40.040 --> 16:44.640]  never ended since then, and our productivity went from around 10% a year on average then
[16:44.640 --> 16:47.560]  to about 3% an hour less.
[16:47.560 --> 16:52.520]  You can mark the decline of our prosperity with us becoming an empire.
[16:52.520 --> 16:56.520]  We pay for a big corporate global empire, and so a bunch of generals can run around
[16:56.520 --> 17:01.400]  and act tough and powerful, and get bought off by the Saudi Arabians and also the crap.
[17:01.400 --> 17:09.520]  General McMasters is listed by Jihad Watch and others as a sympathizer, just like Brennan
[17:09.520 --> 17:10.520]  the Wahhabist.
[17:10.520 --> 17:16.720]  I'm not saying he's overall a bad guy, and he's certainly an articulate fellow, more
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.720]  articulate than most of those generals, he's a very well-spoken person.
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.040]  I've watched a lot of his speeches and things the last few months, just to get a handle
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.600]  on him, and he's charismatic, he's got a lot of good doctrine, he understands it's not
[17:28.600 --> 17:33.560]  about force on the ground, it's about getting the culture on your side and having leadership.
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.240]  Well, let me explain something McMasters to you.
[17:38.240 --> 17:42.240]  The globalists are running this country on the ground, so we don't trust any wars they
[17:42.240 --> 17:48.720]  launch or any wars they carry out, and we know that the globalists under the neocons
[17:48.720 --> 17:56.560]  leading it, but also directed by Hillary, Obama, and the usual suspect, Susan Rice, that
[17:56.560 --> 18:04.560]  entire gaggle of warmongers, we know that they started the Arab Spring with Google and
[18:04.560 --> 18:09.720]  Facebook, they all bragged about it, CNN pushed how glorious Libya was, how glorious Egypt
[18:09.720 --> 18:17.400]  was, how glorious the destabilization in all the other countries was, like Syria, and it's
[18:17.400 --> 18:18.560]  on you.
[18:18.560 --> 18:23.640]  You went into a sovereign country that was prosperous and where women could go to college,
[18:23.640 --> 18:27.280]  it didn't wear hoods over their heads, didn't wear beekeeper suits, and where Europeans
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.440]  went en masse to some of the best hotels and scuba diving and everything.
[18:32.440 --> 18:37.600]  I had looked, and I wanted to go to the Middle East like seven, eight years ago, I was looking
[18:37.600 --> 18:41.680]  at going to Israel, Egypt even though it's dangerous and dirty, I wanted to see the
[18:41.680 --> 18:49.920]  pyramids, and also to Syria to see those incredible Roman ruins and things, it's all blown up.
[18:49.920 --> 18:55.680]  The horrible dirty Al Qaeda went and blew all that up, not just the hundreds of thousands
[18:55.680 --> 18:58.840]  of people and the millions of Christians that they've driven out of the country, hundreds
[18:58.840 --> 19:04.480]  of thousands they've killed, show it's immoral, and I watched McMaster in speeches he gave
[19:04.480 --> 19:09.720]  and TV interviews he gave on Fox say no fewer than like 15 times in five minutes, mass
[19:09.720 --> 19:14.200]  murder weapons, mass murder weapons, I don't use WMDs anymore because they know that reminds
[19:14.200 --> 19:19.200]  you of BS, so now they're called mass murder weapons, mass murder weapons, mass murder
[19:19.200 --> 19:21.200]  weapons, mass murder weapons.
[19:21.200 --> 19:29.240]  Over and over again, with no proof Syria did this, and no motive, and so that's where
[19:29.240 --> 19:32.280]  I stand on this, we're going to come back, give the number out, start taking your calls
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.640]  and play the former top British ambassador to Syria saying they have given a green light
[19:37.640 --> 19:41.440]  to Al Qaeda and ISIS groups to stage false flags everywhere, which they've been caught
[19:41.440 --> 19:42.440]  doing.
[19:42.440 --> 19:47.760]  That's why Britain before didn't go with the whole provocation four years ago, because
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.160]  they knew putting ISIS and Al Qaeda in would end up being blamed on them and they'd lose
[19:52.160 --> 19:53.160]  moral high ground.
[19:53.160 --> 19:54.960]  It wasn't even a moral decision.
[19:54.960 --> 19:58.600]  They knew it wasn't going to work because the public was aware and the military was.
[19:58.600 --> 20:00.280]  Now they're doing it again.
[20:00.280 --> 20:05.640]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[20:05.640 --> 20:09.720]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[20:09.720 --> 20:11.480]  medical expenses.
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.440]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[20:16.440 --> 20:20.640]  Equities from three health sharing programs, holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[20:20.640 --> 20:21.640]  See guidelines.
[20:21.640 --> 20:24.880]  Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.

[20:30.200 --> 20:34.280]  Is your child's school not lining up with your family values?

[20:59.760 --> 21:00.760]  Think about this.
[21:00.760 --> 21:04.840]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[21:04.840 --> 21:09.880]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines
[21:09.880 --> 21:12.880]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[21:12.880 --> 21:17.760]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[22:01.520 --> 22:05.120]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their
[22:05.120 --> 22:06.600]  money and lawyers.
[22:06.600 --> 22:08.520]  But they don't know Harry's.
[22:08.520 --> 22:09.840]  How's Harry's done it?

[22:16.280 --> 22:19.680]  They ship directly from their site to you and do it for a lot less.
[22:19.680 --> 22:24.320]  And while those other guys rake in huge profits, Harry's passes the savings directly back to
[22:24.320 --> 22:25.320]  you.

[23:28.360 --> 23:32.680]  That's called the deep state, Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they
[23:32.680 --> 23:34.520]  want to stop President Trump.
[23:34.520 --> 23:38.440]  Deep state was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[23:38.440 --> 23:44.080]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[23:44.080 --> 23:49.680]  Newsmax, Lutobs, and Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda at bookstores everywhere

[23:55.720 --> 24:12.120]  Coming up, we've caught CNN again, something they're very famous for, claiming that they
[24:12.120 --> 24:18.920]  were on the scene in Syria when they're in a studio and it's fake concerning the chemical
[24:18.920 --> 24:20.800]  weapons attack.
[24:20.800 --> 24:25.000]  And I have a lot of inside intel that I obviously can't even get into at this point that by
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.800]  the end of the broadcast I should be able to break down on the air, but here's the bottom
[24:28.800 --> 24:29.800]  line.
[24:29.800 --> 24:35.520]  US forces are massing, boots are on the ground, tens of thousands of troops, Marines, Army,
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.680]  you name it, more ships coming in to the area, more ships in the Persian Gulf, more ships
[24:40.680 --> 24:46.840]  in the Mediterranean, a major Pacific task force on Armada is now cruising right up into
[24:46.840 --> 24:51.600]  the Korean Peninsula, openly threatening strikes after North Korea threatened to nuke
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.560]  Japan and South Korea, and they are a major threat.
[24:55.560 --> 25:01.480]  So the world is in a major crisis, these crises were ongoing before Trump got elected.
[25:01.480 --> 25:05.960]  He obviously wants to look strong in the face of the Russians that are on the ground, both
[25:05.960 --> 25:09.840]  with aircraft and troops, and they have ships again in the Mediterranean and more ships
[25:09.840 --> 25:11.320]  are on their way.
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.880]  And they want to have a lot of troops on the ground to broker the deal they did behind
[25:15.880 --> 25:20.400]  the scenes our military did, circumventing Obama, and a full war he wanted then, our
[25:20.400 --> 25:25.680]  military made a deal with the Russians outside of Obama, it was a military coup, a soft
[25:25.680 --> 25:30.680]  coup that you also saw come right through the campaign, the military intelligence agencies
[25:30.680 --> 25:34.640]  working with American people to defeat Hillary because she wants all out war with the Russians
[25:34.640 --> 25:36.920]  and others.
[25:36.920 --> 25:41.680]  Now this is a sign of strength by Trump, and you can see the perspective of why he did
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.800]  it, I'm playing devil's advocate right now.
[25:44.800 --> 25:48.720]  What I'm telling you is why President Trump believes he did this.
[25:48.720 --> 25:55.640]  The problem is McMasters and others are going around saying we want to take out Assad and
[25:55.640 --> 26:02.800]  ISIS simultaneously, that's a quote, he said ISIS, Assad simultaneously.
[26:02.800 --> 26:06.560]  And that's the same thing we're getting out of John McCain and others who seem very, very
[26:06.560 --> 26:12.680]  satisfied and who said last Thursday, the system in Washington has now gone back to
[26:12.680 --> 26:19.000]  its normal status, which I guess is nation building and wars and toppling countries
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.360]  and putting radical people in and having really, really bad morals.
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.160]  So McCain says we're going back to overthrowing countries and putting bad guys in.
[26:28.160 --> 26:30.960]  Trump says that's not the case.
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.120]  But the former British ambassador who was part of brokering these deals were the Brits
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.200]  for the first time in over 100 years voted to not join the United States in a war.
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.720]  Over four and a half years ago, they voted for the first time in over 100 years to not
[26:44.720 --> 26:47.800]  agree with us in a war we were in.
[26:47.800 --> 26:51.760]  And they said it was wronged about al-Qaeda and ISIS taking over the country.
[26:51.760 --> 26:53.240]  Assad didn't start the war.
[26:53.240 --> 26:54.880]  It was immoral.
[26:54.880 --> 26:56.840]  Our military said it was immoral.
[26:56.840 --> 26:58.200]  I said it was immoral.
[26:58.200 --> 27:02.320]  The guests we had on said it was immoral and wrong.
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.360]  Now Colonel Shaffer's gone on Fox News and said this shows the climate's changed.
[27:06.360 --> 27:10.480]  The United States is now ready to act.
[27:10.480 --> 27:12.640]  That better not be putting ISIS or al-Qaeda in.
[27:12.640 --> 27:15.160]  Well, Trump in 80 days has smashed them.
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.160]  They're almost defeated.
[27:16.160 --> 27:18.680]  That's admitted.
[27:18.680 --> 27:19.680]  They're panicking.
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.960]  They're saying launch car attacks all over Europe, the rest of it because they're losing.
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.960]  And here is the British ambassador.
[27:26.960 --> 27:32.240]  Trump has just given jihadists a thousand reasons to state false flag operations.
[27:32.240 --> 27:33.520]  That's the former British ambassador.
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.680]  Remember just 15 years ago I talked about false flag operations and people said they
[27:37.680 --> 27:40.720]  didn't exist.
[27:40.720 --> 27:43.040]  Now it's common nomenclature.
[27:43.040 --> 27:48.280]  So that's the good news here is, it's not as easy for these people to do this as it
[27:48.280 --> 27:49.280]  once was.
[27:49.280 --> 27:52.600]  That article with the video is on infowars.com.
[27:52.600 --> 27:53.600]  But let's play it.
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.480]  Trump has just given jihadists a thousand reasons to stage fake operations.
[27:57.480 --> 28:02.760]  This is Peter Ford, former British ambassador to Syria believes the chemical attack of the
[28:02.760 --> 28:11.320]  rebel-held town of Khan may not have been committed by the Assad regime.
[28:11.320 --> 28:18.640]  And based on previous experience, including Iraq, we can see that we cannot take at face
[28:18.640 --> 28:25.040]  value what the so-called intelligence experts tell us, not when they have an agenda.
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.560]  But come back to the main point, but it's not going to end here.
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.880]  And we are likely Britain to be dragged into it because Trump has just given the jihadists
[28:35.880 --> 28:44.840]  a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations, seeing how successful and how easy it is with
[28:44.840 --> 28:52.640]  a gullible media to provoke the West into intemperate reactions.
[28:52.640 --> 28:58.120]  They will very likely stage an operation similar to what they did, and this was documented
[28:58.120 --> 29:01.320]  by the United Nations in August last year.
[29:01.320 --> 29:07.800]  They mounted a chlorine gas attack on civilians and they tried to make it look like it was
[29:07.800 --> 29:09.400]  a regime operation.
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.000]  This marked my words, you're hearing it here.
[29:13.000 --> 29:20.680]  And it will happen and we'll get all the warmongers coming to tell us that Assad is defying us
[29:20.680 --> 29:23.400]  and we must go in more heavily into Syria.
[29:23.400 --> 29:30.600]  This will be fake flag, fake flag, so that's a new word, I guess he knows the public doesn't
[29:30.600 --> 29:32.160]  know false flag, I'm sorry.
[29:32.160 --> 29:35.720]  So false flag is the old British term for staging an attack and then blaming it on
[29:35.720 --> 29:41.000]  your enemy, or you know attacking a ship with other flags on your ship, making sure everybody
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  goes down.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.920]  But so I guess now he's calling it fake flag.
[29:44.920 --> 29:49.600]  So we'll be right back with more key intel, let's look at the good side of all this.
[29:49.600 --> 30:00.440]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.440 --> 30:04.280]  The fake stream media has been in panic mode, hanging onto dear life by the skin of their
[30:04.280 --> 30:05.280]  teeth.
[30:05.280 --> 30:10.400]  We the people driven by social media have exposed their lies, dominated breaking stories, discredited
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.000]  their deceptive asinine narratives, and have in righteous indignation laughed and ridiculed
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.560]  them for serving their corrupt corporate masters, trying to dictate to us the terms of reality.
[30:19.560 --> 30:23.400]  Jones has given them no quarters, starting their status of fraud as fake news, and even
[30:23.400 --> 30:25.160]  upgrading it to very fake news.
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.680]  There was a great chance we were going to completely dismantle the fake stream media
[30:28.680 --> 30:32.080]  and bring great American journalism back into the mainstream.
[30:32.080 --> 30:35.800]  Now the fake stream media has been reinvigorated, it's been handed a stamp of approval and
[30:35.800 --> 30:39.320]  legitimacy, as they cheer on our president, now that he's corrected his ways, and they've
[30:39.320 --> 30:41.240]  been redeemed and proven right.
[30:41.240 --> 30:45.240]  That is why we, the ones who elected him, have to double down and realize even more that
[30:45.240 --> 30:47.960]  each of us matters in this fight for our president in our future.
[30:47.960 --> 30:52.280]  We are standing up for him by fighting harder when they censor us, by sharing links that
[30:52.280 --> 30:57.080]  expose and attack the deep state operatives within his administration, because if we give
[30:57.080 --> 30:58.320]  up, it's all over.
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.920]  This has been Daria for Infowars.com.
[30:59.920 --> 31:03.920]  Hey everyone, Farmers has been Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you
[31:03.920 --> 31:07.240]  know I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[31:07.240 --> 31:10.680]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in
[31:10.680 --> 31:16.280]  healthcare nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes,
[31:16.280 --> 31:19.600]  cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[31:19.600 --> 31:22.880]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[31:22.880 --> 31:26.040]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[31:26.040 --> 31:28.720]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[31:28.720 --> 31:32.680]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[31:32.680 --> 31:37.240]  nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting
[31:37.240 --> 31:41.400]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids
[31:41.400 --> 31:46.920]  it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfowarsTeam.com.
[31:46.920 --> 31:48.760]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[31:48.760 --> 31:51.240]  Head over to InfowarsTeam.com.
[31:51.240 --> 31:53.000]  Your body will be very grateful.
[31:53.000 --> 32:00.400]  On the web at InfowarsTeam.com, that's InfowarsTeam.com.
[32:00.400 --> 32:05.400]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:05.400 --> 32:08.720]  before it became a loss to our modern diet, a processed junk.
[32:08.720 --> 32:13.920]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[32:13.920 --> 32:20.120]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[32:20.120 --> 32:22.480]  great tasting formula, Caveman.
[32:22.480 --> 32:26.480]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:26.480 --> 32:30.480]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:30.480 --> 32:34.480]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[32:34.480 --> 32:39.800]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[32:39.800 --> 32:43.720]  of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[32:43.720 --> 32:46.280]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.280 --> 32:50.640]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:50.640 --> 32:54.280]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.280 --> 32:57.760]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[32:57.760 --> 33:04.760]  and for which life's not common at all.
[33:28.760 --> 33:34.760]  From the front lines of the information war.
[33:34.760 --> 33:39.760]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode, we are at DEF CON 1.
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.760]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[33:43.760 --> 33:48.760]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[33:48.760 --> 33:52.760]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[33:52.760 --> 33:57.760]  One, two, one, impact.
[33:57.760 --> 33:59.760]  Now we play a game.
[33:59.760 --> 34:05.760]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[34:05.760 --> 34:10.760]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[34:10.760 --> 34:13.760]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready awaiting launch codes.
[34:13.760 --> 34:15.760]  We are at launch mode.
[34:15.760 --> 34:19.760]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[34:19.760 --> 34:23.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[34:23.760 --> 34:25.760]  We're in.
[34:25.760 --> 34:27.760]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[34:27.760 --> 34:29.760]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[34:29.760 --> 34:31.760]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[34:31.760 --> 34:33.760]  I wish I was like anybody else.
[34:33.760 --> 34:35.760]  Things end.
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.760]  The only winning move is not to break.
[34:42.760 --> 34:45.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, so much is breaking while I'm on the brakes.
[34:45.760 --> 34:49.760]  I should probably have David Knight come here and host the show while I work on some stories here.
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.760]  I've got high level CIA and tell them what's really going on
[34:54.760 --> 34:58.760]  that I've just been given authorization to go through later.
[34:58.760 --> 35:00.760]  I've got reports here.
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.760]  We're timers of the essence that will in John McCain's career.
[35:04.760 --> 35:07.760]  What he's been caught doing.
[35:07.760 --> 35:11.760]  I'm sitting on this till I get that green lighted.
[35:11.760 --> 35:16.760]  I've got the former top British ambassador saying this will create false flags.
[35:16.760 --> 35:21.760]  He calls them fake flags where Al Qaeda and ISIS will start staging terror attacks everywhere.
[35:21.760 --> 35:29.760]  Now this one's been green lighted when clearly he was there in 2013 when they staged the last one and they got caught doing it.
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.760]  So I've talked to my military sources too who are pretty right wing hawks.
[35:33.760 --> 35:36.760]  And they say they got a very bad feeling about Syria.
[35:36.760 --> 35:38.760]  It's very sticky.
[35:38.760 --> 35:42.760]  It's a war with Russia and Iran.
[35:42.760 --> 35:52.760]  So all hell is breaking loose and it's because of a chemical attack that the Russians and everybody else would never want to happen.
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.760]  Now are there photos of that base with a bunch of chemical weapons at them that the Russians clearly got tipped off
[35:57.760 --> 36:01.760]  and so they took them out of the bunkers and have them stored outside so they wouldn't get hit.
[36:01.760 --> 36:07.760]  What would have happened if Trump would have hit the nerve gas that was 300 yards from a village?
[36:07.760 --> 36:09.760]  I mean I've looked at every angle of this.
[36:09.760 --> 36:10.760]  I've stayed up late.
[36:10.760 --> 36:17.760]  I have really racked my brain over every angle of this and this just looks and smells really, really bad.
[36:17.760 --> 36:21.760]  Now I said I'd give you some of the good news.
[36:21.760 --> 36:29.760]  Trump wouldn't be fake and secure our borders, talk about bringing our jobs back, expose globalism as a scam,
[36:29.760 --> 36:40.760]  bring back $300 billion in jobs, $3 trillion in the stock market plus and the moratorium on Glass-Steagall,
[36:40.760 --> 36:47.760]  bring back the banking regulations, get the big banks to loan to small businesses, kill TPP.
[36:47.760 --> 36:49.760]  I mean that was 10 years of negotiation gone.
[36:49.760 --> 36:50.760]  The whole thing just exposed.
[36:50.760 --> 36:53.760]  Reverse the carbon taxes, reverse the coal plant shutdowns.
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.760]  I mean all of that is so good for our economy, so good for the people.
[36:57.760 --> 36:59.760]  I don't think Trump has it out to get us.
[36:59.760 --> 37:03.760]  He's not a globalist, but he's in there now.
[37:03.760 --> 37:11.760]  And he's got all these generals that come highly recommended telling them peace through strength.
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.760]  Meanwhile the Russians and Iranians are saying if you shoot at us anymore and our forces,
[37:16.760 --> 37:21.760]  I mean we just attacked a Russian held base, we're going to attack you back.
[37:21.760 --> 37:27.760]  10 red line Russia and Iran pledge to hit back against further serious strikes as they blast U.S. for crossing red lines.
[37:27.760 --> 37:32.760]  You know, Pristina right in the middle of an air base in the middle of a Kosovo.
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.760]  Our government, the Clintons, backed to take over one-third of Serbia,
[37:36.760 --> 37:39.760]  the place where they stopped the Muslim invasions more than 20 times.
[37:39.760 --> 37:45.760]  Millions and millions of Serbs have died in the last thousand years fighting jihadist millions.
[37:45.760 --> 37:48.760]  The biggest battles happen there in the Crusades, everything.
[37:48.760 --> 37:51.760]  That was the main battleground.
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.760]  More than Jerusalem, more than Turkey, it was obviously lost to the Muslims.
[37:56.760 --> 38:00.760]  And they made a deal with Albania, the Muslims, to take it.
[38:00.760 --> 38:02.760]  And they took it.
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.760]  And then the Russians came into that air base.
[38:07.760 --> 38:12.760]  It's been their air base and they said we're ready to fight and they had their missiles turned on ready to go.
[38:12.760 --> 38:17.760]  And then the head of NATO decided no, we're not going to do it and ignored the order
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.760]  from the Clintons to attack the Russians.
[38:22.760 --> 38:24.760]  So you think about that.
[38:24.760 --> 38:26.760]  We go into the Russians' backyard.
[38:26.760 --> 38:30.760]  They're under Islamic attack.
[38:30.760 --> 38:34.760]  And we attack them using Muslims.
[38:34.760 --> 38:37.760]  And then our media turns around and goes, oh, slow them Milosevic.
[38:37.760 --> 38:39.760]  He's killing innocent people.
[38:39.760 --> 38:46.760]  Even you admitted it was the Croats and the Muslims and all of them that started those wars.
[38:46.760 --> 38:52.760]  CNN famously, remember, would show the concentration camp victims in Serbia.
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.760]  And it was one guy with tuberculosis at a UN base wanting in to get food.
[38:57.760 --> 38:59.760]  But that one guy, they knew it was fake.
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.760]  We have a new footage of CNN on the night of the strikes last Thursday.
[39:04.760 --> 39:05.760]  And bring me in the notes.
[39:05.760 --> 39:08.760]  I had them in there on the correspondent, the reporters and who they are.
[39:08.760 --> 39:12.760]  But Don Lemon is on there with their foreign correspondent who's clearly in Atlanta at their studios.
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.760]  They have the fake bird sounds, those cut off, the audio cuts off and then phones start ringing
[39:17.760 --> 39:19.760]  and people are talking in the background.
[39:19.760 --> 39:26.760]  We're going to play that coming up.
[39:26.760 --> 39:28.760]  That's Ben Peterman.
[39:28.760 --> 39:32.760]  So all of this is going on.
[39:32.760 --> 39:34.760]  Ben Wiedemann.
[39:34.760 --> 39:38.760]  And they're having these fake events right in our faces.
[39:38.760 --> 39:40.760]  It's just stuff for the history books.
[39:40.760 --> 39:41.760]  And you know, I don't want to just play this.
[39:41.760 --> 39:43.760]  I want to cue up.
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.760]  It's actually in the report how to recognize war propaganda that McBreen and dude did last Friday.
[39:48.760 --> 39:50.760]  It's on our YouTube channel.
[39:50.760 --> 39:53.760]  They actually got the clips of the girl saying the babies were thrown out of the incubators.
[39:53.760 --> 39:54.760]  She'd never been to Kuwait.
[39:54.760 --> 39:58.760]  She was the daughter of the PR firm owner and an actress.
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.760]  And then of course they have the famous footage of some of the reporters on top, the CNN center in Atlanta,
[40:04.760 --> 40:07.760]  with palm trees with blue screen behind them.
[40:07.760 --> 40:10.760]  And the blue screen is cutting out and they're going, oh my gosh, sharing gas.
[40:10.760 --> 40:13.760]  I mean, it's worse acting than the three Stooges.
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.760]  And then it turned out they were at CNN center in Atlanta.
[40:18.760 --> 40:21.760]  That's how cheap CNN is, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:21.760 --> 40:26.760]  Fakes got a tax with chemical weapons of a Riyadh Saudi Arabia.
[40:26.760 --> 40:29.760]  And that's confirmed to be fake.
[40:29.760 --> 40:36.760]  Just like they caught Anderson Cooper with fake stuff at Sandy Hook where he turns at the memorial and his nose disappears.
[40:36.760 --> 40:43.760]  And you can see the footage of the plants behind him blowing and then they would blow the same way again because it was just a loop.
[40:43.760 --> 40:50.760]  Then they go, oh, Alex says everything is fake about Sandy Hook and says no kids died.
[40:50.760 --> 40:55.760]  No, what we said was you can't believe a word these people say.
[40:55.760 --> 40:57.760]  So I'm going to play that in the next segment.
[40:57.760 --> 41:05.760]  But first, I sit here chomping at the bit with these stories that I've got.
[41:05.760 --> 41:08.760]  We've got a very important report.
[41:08.760 --> 41:12.760]  Russia should declare partial mobilization.
[41:12.760 --> 41:15.760]  Zarinosky on US illegal strike.
[41:15.760 --> 41:18.760]  He says to the BBC and we have a translation.
[41:18.760 --> 41:24.760]  We're going to live with a Daria of the Russian on air with what he said.
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.760]  The full article is up on info wars.com.
[41:28.760 --> 41:32.760]  So Daria, whenever you'd like, you can you can start.
[41:32.760 --> 41:35.760]  You know what, we're going to go to that next hour now.
[41:35.760 --> 41:37.760]  I know I said I'd go to phone calls to sour.
[41:37.760 --> 41:40.760]  I know I was having this piece with Daria, but they just told me here.
[41:40.760 --> 41:43.760]  I'm teleprompter free, but they do put notes up on the board.
[41:43.760 --> 41:46.760]  I might show people the camera when I see Rogers on the phone ready for air.
[41:46.760 --> 41:49.760]  Okay, let me get set up for that.
[41:49.760 --> 41:51.760]  Again, this is a newsroom.
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.760]  I'm not just a talk show host that comes in here and then has the topics I'm going to cover and then as things break, we follow that.
[41:57.760 --> 41:58.760]  We have our reporters.
[41:58.760 --> 42:00.760]  We have our correspondence.
[42:00.760 --> 42:02.760]  And so things are very, very fluid.
[42:02.760 --> 42:05.760]  They're moving very, very quickly.
[42:05.760 --> 42:07.760]  Roger Stone is on the line with us.
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.760]  He is the former head of the Trump campaign in 2015 and 16.
[42:12.760 --> 42:14.760]  And then of course back in 2000.
[42:14.760 --> 42:18.760]  And of course he has regular conversations with the president, but we won't go into those in any detail.
[42:18.760 --> 42:21.760]  There's a Netflix series coming out about him in the campaign.
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.760]  And he's also a frequent guest here and also on meet the press national television.
[42:25.760 --> 42:26.760]  You name it.
[42:26.760 --> 42:34.760]  And so much of what he's broken down has turned out to be absolutely salient and prescient to where we are today in this world.
[42:34.760 --> 42:37.760]  He's got big breaking news on John McCain.
[42:37.760 --> 42:39.760]  So he joins us via the phone.
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.760]  Again, we have the Russians threatening retaliatory strikes against the United States along with the Iranians.
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.760]  You have a U.S. Task Force fleet cruising right into the Korean Peninsula right now.
[42:48.760 --> 42:52.760]  This is an unprecedented time where the president is being tested.
[42:52.760 --> 42:57.760]  And so from my view, he hit them last Thursday as a sign of strength for the Russians.
[42:57.760 --> 43:05.760]  But that's very demoralizing the American people because we know Hillary and Obama and John McCain started the war six years ago.
[43:05.760 --> 43:07.760]  And we're trying to put al-Qaeda in charge.
[43:07.760 --> 43:09.760]  And John McCain was just there a month and a half ago.
[43:09.760 --> 43:18.760]  We have the British ambassador saying he believes it was a false flag and we've green-lighted radical jihadist groups staging fake flags, as he calls them, to draw us into war.
[43:18.760 --> 43:20.760]  That's why al-Qaeda has been celebrating.
[43:20.760 --> 43:25.760]  So Roger Stone with a lot of key intel joins us right now.
[43:25.760 --> 43:26.760]  Roger, thanks for coming on.
[43:26.760 --> 43:28.760]  Alex, great to be here.
[43:28.760 --> 43:37.760]  You may remember back several years ago when John McCain was caught red-handed meeting with a group of Syrian terrorists.
[43:37.760 --> 43:47.760]  And his defense was that the photo taken at the time had been photoshopped, that the meeting had never taken place.
[43:47.760 --> 43:51.760]  There is now proof that that is a lie.
[43:51.760 --> 44:04.760]  But more importantly, a veteran foreign congressman, very respected former congressman, has let it be known that he has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure.
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.760]  And he does not have too much time to be on this mortal coil.
[44:09.760 --> 44:27.760]  And therefore, he is going to do an interview regarding John McCain and devastating, literally devastating information that I think could really destabilize and perhaps even remove John McCain from the political scene.
[44:27.760 --> 44:33.760]  Is that the former vice head of the armed services committee in the house who joined us?
[44:33.760 --> 44:40.760]  This is another member of congress and he is not well, so the minutes are ticking away.
[44:40.760 --> 44:49.760]  It is my belief that an info wars camera probably needs to get into this area of the south as soon as possible.
[44:49.760 --> 44:51.760]  We're ready to get on a plane right now.
[44:51.760 --> 44:54.760]  Can we just get him on cell phone?
[44:54.760 --> 45:09.760]  We probably can get him on Skype, but I think it is worth doing it his way and videotaping it, and then you can assess it and assess the best way to release it.
[45:09.760 --> 45:24.760]  But this is a very, very respected Reaganite member of Congress, someone who is known as a liberty oriented member, someone who had nothing but disdain for the neocons in his day.
[45:24.760 --> 45:34.760]  So I know there's a teaser there, but at the same time I think we're going to want to look at all the facts before we put our imprimatur behind it.
[45:34.760 --> 45:42.760]  On the other hand, I know this former congressman to be a man of unimpeachable integrity and enormous credibility.
[45:42.760 --> 45:47.760]  Wow, and he wants to spill the beans on John McCain on his deathbed, basically.
[45:47.760 --> 45:51.760]  Yes, and he wants to do it on info wars.
[45:51.760 --> 45:55.760]  So we can talk logistics after the program here.
[45:55.760 --> 45:56.760]  Listen, I don't want to wait.
[45:56.760 --> 46:02.760]  Rob Dew will call you and he will jump on an airplane right now and meet you there or do you want us to do it or do you want me to do it?
[46:02.760 --> 46:04.760]  Well, I think Rob is the right man.
[46:04.760 --> 46:06.760]  I think that's an excellent assignment.
[46:06.760 --> 46:10.760]  I think this is going to be an enormous story.
[46:10.760 --> 46:11.760]  Are you going to be able to fly there?
[46:11.760 --> 46:13.760]  I'll fly out there.
[46:13.760 --> 46:15.760]  I don't think it's necessary.
[46:15.760 --> 46:17.760]  Our man knows what he wants to say.
[46:17.760 --> 46:24.760]  This is somebody I've known for 20, almost 30 years, somebody who is truly, truly incredible.
[46:24.760 --> 46:31.760]  So I'm going to let him tell his own story, but it is indeed devastating.
[46:31.760 --> 46:41.760]  So separately, Roger, we have a report up on info wars.com from our sources and I talked to separate sources and asked you last night on air.
[46:41.760 --> 46:59.760]  If indeed President Trump is trying to block a larger war and doesn't want to know flies down and you said indeed that is the information you separately have from your sources.
[46:59.760 --> 47:09.760]  So we have that view, but CNN says, you know, we're getting mixed signals with the National Security Advisor McMaster saying that they do want to go in.
[47:09.760 --> 47:13.760]  We have the article up on info wars.com where Trump does not want a wider world.
[47:13.760 --> 47:15.760]  We'll put that up on screen if we can.
[47:15.760 --> 47:23.760]  We have a separate article that just went up from our intelligence source, a high level under a pseudonym says Donald Trump is an international lawbreaker.
[47:23.760 --> 47:28.760]  Donald Trump authorized and then justified attack on a sovereign country that comes from a high level source.
[47:28.760 --> 47:30.760]  And we've kind of got these two perspectives.
[47:30.760 --> 47:32.760]  I get Trump wants to look strong.
[47:32.760 --> 47:37.760]  I get we already have ground forces there or driving Al Qaeda and ISIS out when a broker deal for Assad to leave.
[47:37.760 --> 47:39.760]  So the country doesn't stay in a quagmire.
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.760]  I mean, quite frankly, I'm normally decisive on my view on something.
[47:43.760 --> 47:45.760]  I think we've got to have a wait and see here.
[47:45.760 --> 47:52.760]  But clearly, as you've said, if Trump widens this war, it just smells like defeat.
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.760]  It would be the end of his governing coalition.
[47:56.760 --> 48:10.760]  I think the reason we're getting mixed signals out, which is because there are those below the president who evidently are growingly confident that they can sell him on a carbon copy of Libya.
[48:10.760 --> 48:14.760]  Why we need to do this again, I don't know.
[48:14.760 --> 48:22.760]  Of course, Libya was mostly an incredible air assault, but still yet a wider war.
[48:22.760 --> 48:31.760]  And the Lords of War are definitely beating the drum for this to be the next Vietnam, which is a terrible idea.
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.760]  And I think Trump, based on my sources, knows that this is kind of this far, but no further.
[48:36.760 --> 48:38.760]  He made his point.
[48:38.760 --> 48:48.760]  It was a 10 strike in terms of changing the geopolitical international situation and in terms of beating back his enemies, I should say his adversaries,
[48:48.760 --> 48:55.760]  within the United States on this whole question of a Russian collusion, which really, really looks foolish.
[48:55.760 --> 49:03.760]  And then when you have guys like Warren, so Donald coming out saying, oh, well, maybe Putin staged his own humiliation to help Trump.
[49:03.760 --> 49:06.760]  That is the fakes, fake news I've ever heard.
[49:06.760 --> 49:07.760]  Sure.
[49:07.760 --> 49:10.760]  I mean, we know they told the Russians so it escalates ever going to hit it.
[49:10.760 --> 49:11.760]  It doesn't mean they staged it.
[49:11.760 --> 49:15.760]  It means they told them Trump pushes back against the Neocon plan to invade Syria.
[49:15.760 --> 49:20.760]  If folks want the inside scoop of what's going on in the White House, this is directly from inside the White House.
[49:20.760 --> 49:25.760]  I also ran this by Roger yesterday and he said, absolutely, that's on target.
[49:25.760 --> 49:27.760]  Well, you've got some good sources.
[49:27.760 --> 49:29.760]  So there it is right there.
[49:29.760 --> 49:32.760]  We want to know both sides of this and exactly what's being debated.
[49:32.760 --> 49:38.760]  My concern is McMaster saying he wants to take out, quote, ISIS and Assad simultaneously.
[49:38.760 --> 49:40.760]  So that's what's sending the mixed signals.
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.760]  Do you think a lot of our sources could be right that they're concerned the president is being misled?
[49:45.760 --> 49:48.760]  This is a protection force for our troops taking out ISIS.
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.760]  And then it really is a larger ground force to menace Assad and the Russians.
[49:53.760 --> 49:58.760]  Well, first of all, the opposition to Assad is much, much larger than just ISIS.
[49:58.760 --> 50:11.760]  You've got a substantial number of individual tribes and sects of Islamic terrorist groups that are not necessarily ISIS driven.
[50:11.760 --> 50:16.760]  So ISIS is certainly preeminent among them.
[50:16.760 --> 50:25.760]  I can't even imagine, given the fact that Assad has survived essentially only with Russia near power,
[50:25.760 --> 50:31.760]  and that at least at this juncture, about two-thirds of the country is in the hands of the rebels,
[50:31.760 --> 50:34.760]  although not the most populated areas.
[50:34.760 --> 50:41.760]  In order to take out both ISIS and Assad, you'd need to have a lot more than 150,000 troops.
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.760]  And you've got Iran and you've got the Russians threatening war.
[50:44.760 --> 50:46.760]  I mean, talk about a trap for Trump.
[50:46.760 --> 50:48.760]  We have got to get out of there immediately.
[50:48.760 --> 50:49.760]  This is crazy.
[50:49.760 --> 50:51.760]  Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[50:51.760 --> 50:52.760]  We'll talk soon.

[52:28.760 --> 52:30.760]  It's called the Deep State.
[52:30.760 --> 52:34.760]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office, and they want to stop President Trump.
[52:34.760 --> 52:38.760]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[52:38.760 --> 52:44.760]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[52:44.760 --> 52:51.760]  Newsmax, Lutobs and Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda at bookstores everywhere or check out our free offer.

[54:19.760 --> 54:24.760]  I'm your host Alex Jones. So much economic news, so much military news to get to.
[54:24.760 --> 54:32.760]  I have children, young children, and the situation in North Korea with China and the South China Sea incredibly important.
[54:32.760 --> 54:39.760]  Worse tensions since the ceasefire in 1953 in that area in the Korean War that never ended.
[54:39.760 --> 54:45.760]  There's just been a ceasefire. Some of the worst climate we've seen in the Middle East ever, maybe the worst.
[54:45.760 --> 54:49.760]  We didn't even have Russia saying they're going to attack the US if we went into Iraq.
[54:49.760 --> 54:56.760]  They didn't say that about Libya. But now it's on their doorstep and Assad's done nothing.
[54:56.760 --> 54:59.760]  And McMaster's saying take out Assad. This thing is so phony.
[54:59.760 --> 55:03.760]  We've got British ambassadors saying it's so phony.
[55:03.760 --> 55:09.760]  And then you've got Al Qaeda running over people on the streets, calling themselves ISIS.
[55:09.760 --> 55:15.760]  In Stockholm, and there's such Stockholm syndrome, the news won't call it Islamic even though ISIS took credit.
[55:15.760 --> 55:23.760]  Just like the attack that happened, you know, a week and a half ago in London on the bridge going over to Big Ben in Parliament,
[55:23.760 --> 55:27.760]  screaming Allah Akbar. And notice they won't show you the dead bodies of the kids.
[55:27.760 --> 55:37.760]  Turns out the guy in Stockholm, the monster, was running over small children on purpose, targeting them like it was a sick video game.
[55:37.760 --> 55:44.760]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-25-99-231-800-25-99-231.
[55:44.760 --> 55:49.760]  We have the head of the Eagle Forum popping in for about 15, 20 minutes to talk about geopolitical issues
[55:49.760 --> 55:53.760]  and nationalism in America first versus globalism in the Trump operation.
[55:53.760 --> 55:57.760]  Then we're going to continue with your phone calls. We're going to do that Russia piece of news.
[55:57.760 --> 56:00.760]  They're calling for war, basically. There's any more strikes.
[56:00.760 --> 56:03.760]  We're going to translate that into English. A lot of exclusives here today.
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.760]  We've got some big breaking news that I should be able to cover very, very soon.
[56:09.760 --> 56:14.760]  800-25-99-231.
[56:14.760 --> 56:21.760]  Before I go any further, you know, even though it's basically sold out, we are getting another shipment in Wednesday.
[56:21.760 --> 56:24.760]  So I'm not putting it on back order.
[56:24.760 --> 56:32.760]  And the group is confident he's going to be able to get a larger supply and a stockpile of the deep earth, pure iodine crystals we use for our iodine
[56:32.760 --> 56:34.760]  that makes it so special, the good halogen.
[56:34.760 --> 56:40.760]  If you just research iodine deficiency, big Israeli study just came out talking about what's done to their population
[56:40.760 --> 56:45.760]  on having the iodine, the birth defects, the lower IQs. It's amazing.
[56:45.760 --> 56:48.760]  So many of the birth defects in China and the Middle East are from that.
[56:48.760 --> 56:54.760]  It has 3,430 reviews, 4.8 to the average on power reviews, third-party site.
[56:54.760 --> 56:58.760]  Sign up for auto-ship an additional 10% off, the 25%.
[56:58.760 --> 57:07.760]  So I'm discounting it back from full retail down to the normal discount we give at 25% off at infowarslife.com
[57:07.760 --> 57:10.760]  or call toll-free, 888-253-33139.
[57:10.760 --> 57:16.760]  And it's so essential that we get the funding to get four or five more riders, three or four more camera people,
[57:16.760 --> 57:19.760]  some more reporters, some more anchors. We have great, great people.
[57:19.760 --> 57:21.760]  But you know, there's attrition.
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.760]  Folks get married or people want to go work with their brother.
[57:26.760 --> 57:30.760]  Or, you know, people get burned out, you know, after video editing for five years or whatever.
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.760]  I totally get it. I mean, I've been burned out for a while, so burned out.
[57:32.760 --> 57:34.760]  I've kind of hit the other side and love it.
[57:34.760 --> 57:38.760]  It's just a war for me. It's just, you know, all the horses are everywhere.
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.760]  So you get attrition, you get whatever. We need to build the operation.
[57:42.760 --> 57:45.760]  We need to build new websites, better websites. I'm trying, believe me.
[57:45.760 --> 57:47.760]  InfoWars has great content, but it's kind of an older design.
[57:47.760 --> 57:50.760]  We're working on all of it at infowarsstore.com.
[57:50.760 --> 57:52.760]  You get great products that you absolutely need.
[57:52.760 --> 57:56.760]  Restorable foods are still 30 to 40% off right now, the highest quality.
[57:56.760 --> 57:58.760]  Last 25 years, everybody needs them.
[57:58.760 --> 58:02.760]  We have a super blue for children that the adults have sold out for a couple of weeks.
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.760]  A bubblegum flavor, very, very popular.
[58:04.760 --> 58:08.760]  Again, I'll put a bigger order in. Made in America, but the biggest organic producer.
[58:08.760 --> 58:11.760]  And they have the iodine, the colloidal silver in.
[58:11.760 --> 58:13.760]  It just doesn't have the peppermint. That's what made it so strong.
[58:13.760 --> 58:18.760]  Kids didn't like it, plus it's concentrated. Four ounces.
[58:18.760 --> 58:25.760]  Four ounce tubes, infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[58:25.760 --> 58:30.760]  InfoWarslife.com picks you right to the sub page that has the supplements and toothpaste and everything else.
[58:30.760 --> 58:36.760]  The main page of infowarsstore.com has everything from the best grease dryers and water filtration to non-geome heirloom seeds.
[58:36.760 --> 58:40.760]  Everything you need to be self-sufficient, the highest quality, the lowest prices.

[58:44.760 --> 58:49.760]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[59:14.760 --> 59:19.760]  A lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others.
[59:19.760 --> 59:25.760]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:25.760 --> 59:32.760]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[59:32.760 --> 59:38.760]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:38.760 --> 59:44.760]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[59:44.760 --> 1:00:11.760]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:22.760]  Now it can be crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:29.760]  Make explosives right out of the winehouse on infowars.com.
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:34.760]  Trump pushes back against Neocon plan to invade Syria. You want answers? So do we.
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:41.760]  We've dug it up from multiple sources. I ran it by Roger and he said, wow, who'd you get that from?
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:49.760]  And he said, that is dead on, dead on, dead on. And he got that from, well, let's just say somebody high up.
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.760]  As high up as it goes.
[1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:55.760]  Trump pushes back against Neocon plan to invade Syria.
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:01.760]  Troops massing as deep state. Plots resume change.
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:04.760]  I need to read this whole article sometime on air today. It's very important.
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:12.760]  Coming up Russian top politician after Medidyev and Putin calls for retaliatory strikes against the United States.
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:17.760]  Things are escalating very, very quickly. That's up on infowars.com.
[1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:26.760]  Right now, let's go to Uncle Sam and then Carlos and others. Uncle Sam, you're on the air from Louisiana.
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:29.760]  Hey, Uncle Sam, how you doing?
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:32.760]  Yes, sir. Good. This is Alex Jones.
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:34.760]  Yep, sure is.
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:41.760]  All right. Hey, Uncle Sam, I don't have a lot of time. I love you calling. Thank you so much. You're on air, bro.
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:49.760]  Yeah, my art class is the question this weekend, which about 50,000 people walk by was Syria good or bad.
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:02:03.760]  I have video about five hours of video. I would, in my preliminary, I would say about 60% were for it and 40% against all the independence I talked to were leery about it.
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:08.760]  There were several Clinton bots that were for it.
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:23.760]  But for my own take on this, I don't know if you'll agree with this or not, but I'm feeling real queasy about this. This is not good. It's only like a problem reaction solution.
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:32.760]  I totally agree. I feel much worse about this. I mean, danger-wise, in the last few Gulf Wars, the Russians are now involved. They're engaged. They're on the ground.
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:40.760]  This is just totally crazy. And I know McMaster's been, you know, knocking heads of jihadis all day. Big deal.
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:46.760]  And now he wants to fight the Russians. They're not doing anything. John McCain's running around like a crazy person on the side of Al Qaeda.
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:53.760]  And the whole thing just thinks to high heaven. And I'd say about 80% of our audience is against it. And the more I learn about it, the more I don't like.
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:03:00.760]  And I'm not even blaming Trump. I think he's a good guy. He's already done great things on the economy.
[1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:04.760]  I just hope he doesn't become a slave of the generals. What do you think?
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:18.760]  I think you're right on target there. I'm also hoping to pray, but I'm looking at, you know, even the layperson I speak to out there now, getting aware of the fact that we're heading for a fall and that a lot of us are not going to make it through it.
[1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:30.760]  And if we, if the layperson knows this, the elites certainly know it. And I'm feeling real bad that maybe, but this is my worst case scenario in this, is that Trump is a shill.
[1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:39.760]  He played off of our anger that the powers of being knew we were angry. They knew we were angry before this election. And they played off of that.
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:45.760]  And they put him in there to play us. Now, I hope I pray I'm wrong there. And I'm going to, you know,
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:53.760]  Well, you know, I've thought that too, because they couldn't sell the war with Obama. They knew they couldn't do it with Hillary. They already failed, put in a supposed nationalist.
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:04:01.760]  But let me tell you, he wouldn't have killed TPP. He wouldn't have moved with all this stuff and hurt globalism so bad. His rhetoric alone is something they never wanted.
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:08.760]  He definitely was rogue from them. He definitely was somebody they tried to stop.
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:19.760]  I mean, they had the magazines all printed that Hillary was going to win. They really, there was an internal coup against them. The problem is, is those forces are still reasserting themselves yet again.
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:24.760]  But if he starts going sideways on the economic stuff and the rest of it, then we'll know we've been really, really betrayed.
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:32.760]  But regardless, globalism is in trouble all over the world. Very exciting things are happening. But yes, world economic meltdown is right around the corner.
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:41.760]  We don't reverse it with major prosperity, which Trump knows. And so the elites themselves are moving, you know, to the Southern Hemisphere shows you they're worried about nuclear war.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:48.760]  So great call. Uncle Sam, you know, when you hit the phone system, there's like a, then it goes through that a lot of times messes the caller up.
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:59.760]  So we're going to Carlos, Bobby, Rick, uh, Bito and many, many others on the other side. I'm Alex Jones. These are incredibly important times we live in.
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:10.760]  When we, the people elected Donald Trump, we exhaled in relief, believing that we're going to crush ISIS with the help of Russia and that we've averted a nuclear war in which we would have been already had Hillary won.
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:17.760]  The sense of relief has just been flipped on its head. It appears we're in the brink of nuclear war and Russia is made out to be our enemy once again.
[1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:25.760]  Explanations for this drastic turn of events range from this being part of Machiavelli tactics meant to in fact prevent a world war with Russia being led in on the game.
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:36.760]  Trump being hopelessly surrounded by deep state students who still hate him, despite of all the newly founded love they're professing for him and whose goal it is to impeach and replace him with a blood thirsty war hungry zealot, the likes of which we've never seen.
[1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:43.760]  Either way, the military industrial complex wins. And that is not why we elected Trump. This movement of making America great again is bigger than Trump.
[1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:50.760]  Trump is not our leader. He's our follower. And we must lead him in our dogged determination to ensure our children have a future.
[1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:57.760]  So don't give up on Trump, thus allowing him to become just another casualty of the deep state. After all, no one said taking America back is going to be easy.
[1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:26.760]  This has been Daria for Infowars.com.
[1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:34.760]  This video contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:46.760]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:58.760]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Superblue that is spearmint free. Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfowarsLife.com and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:19.760]  The reason InfowarsLife has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this. And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:34.760]  I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me. Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my Superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:44.760]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the Superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:58.760]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win InfowarsLife.com.
[1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:33.760]  News Center, deep behind enemy lines in Occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide. You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy tank goper. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:46.760]  That's right. Under the IMF, World Bank, the TPP, FEMA, we really are a country occupied by globalism. That's how the UK finally had Brexit when they went, we never voted to enter the Brexit.
[1:08:46.760 --> 1:09:01.760]  We never voted to enter the EU. We never voted to have 90 plus percent of our laws made by an unelected bureaucracy with Jean-Claude Juncker, the heir to the Nazi fortune, who literally owns Luxembourg because his grandfather invaded it during World War II and took it.
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:13.760]  Royalty, unelected royalty over an unelected board and the whole parliament is ceremonial. You think America's in trouble. Think about Europe under that.
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:24.760]  So, Marilla Penn's way ahead in polls, other nationalists are way ahead in polls. Trump saw all that, wrote in on it, has done some great things on the economy, great things on TPP.
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:34.760]  I mean, one side of me, he's totally delivered, but this strike in Syria, which I know he'd be called a Russian agent if he didn't strike it, I know why he did the optics.
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:43.760]  And I'd say with mainline conservatives, about 60%, I've seen it in the drudge polls and others support it. Our listeners are more libertarian nationalists. They're like 80% against it.
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:54.760]  My concern is the escalation. So I couldn't think of a better guest to come on than Ed Martin. And he sent me some points he wanted to get into. It's exactly where I'm at.
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:10:02.760]  There's the whole situation with the new Supreme Court nominee and the nuclear option. He, of course, was involved watching all that.
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:22.760]  And the inside baseball will get his take on that as well. Also, we'll get into the situation with what's happening with the United States, whether we're going to be an America first group and rebuild our country or go back to being globalist and so much more.
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:33.760]  And of course, it was September 5th of last year. She didn't get to see the election, but she did get to basically see the momentum building. And of course, that was Phyllis Schlafly and the Eagle Forum.
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:41.760]  They've done such a great job since the days of Barry Goldwater being the real conscience of the nationalistic, patriot, paleoconservative movement.
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:53.760]  The Eagle Forum is steaming ahead today, educating folks like never before. And Ed Martin's the head of the Eagle Forum president, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, pseagles.com, eagleforum.org.
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:55.760]  So Ed, thanks for coming on with us today.
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:05.760]  Alex, great to be with you. Phyllis enjoyed being on your show. In the last couple of years of her life, she did a lot more radio and a lot more TV by Skype and all.
[1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:12.760]  And she really did enjoy being on with you. She thought you were awfully correct on a lot of things. And so that was nice to be on with you.
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:17.760]  But I know she had great affection for what you're doing and what you're about. So thanks for having me on.
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:22.760]  No, well, thank you, sir. I mean, look, I've studied the whole conservative movement. The country wouldn't be here.
[1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:27.760]  World government would be here if it wasn't Phyllis Schlafly and Barry Goldwater and, you know, Ronald Reagan and others.
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:31.760]  Reagan wasn't perfect. He got co-opted, but he was a good guy, gave the anti-globalist speeches.
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:36.760]  He was against George Herbert Walker Bush, as you know. So nobody's perfect.
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  But I mean, certainly she's about as perfect as you could get when it came to that.
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:46.760]  I'm amazed that she worked right up until the time that she passed. I mean, I think she was on like a month before she died or less on my broadcast.
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:51.760]  Yeah, she was. She did. I kind of told people she was from the Depression era.
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:57.760]  And I used to joke when she can't go on the radio and can't write, she'll check out because that's who she was, right?
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:02.760]  She once, one time we were working on a column that was due on Monday afternoon and I said, Phyllis, there's a big football game on it.
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:07.760]  She said, just watch the last three minutes. You'll find out the score and, you know, who won and don't waste your time.
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:10.760]  She was working hard. But, you know, you put your finger on it, Alex.
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.760]  I mean, this movement, the globalist movement, and really Phyllis started in the late 1940s,
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:22.760]  identified the communists and the world governance movement, and she was the first person to figure out what the Bilderbergers were.
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:28.760]  She actually found them first, the meetings, and off of Georgia on one of the coasts in early 60s, late 50s.
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:32.760]  That's how she gave the info to Westbrook Peggler, who, exactly.
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  Exactly right. So, I mean, and now today we're facing the same question.
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:42.760]  I think, you know, one of the reasons that what you're doing is so valuable and what you've been doing is the questions are always the same.
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:48.760]  Who's going to win out? Is it the globalist vision or is it the Americans first, you know, a sense of sovereignty?
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:54.760]  That's what we're seeing faced in all kinds of things. And what I sent you this morning, what Phyllis identified in the 1970s,
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:59.760]  was every new president is tested by the superpowers.
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:03.760]  You know, it was Kennedy with Khrushchev. It was Ford with Brezhnev.
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:06.760]  We saw Carter rolled over by the Soviets.
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:10.760]  In fact, in one of her last interviews, she said, if Trump wins, we ought to pull that up.
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:15.760]  She said he will be tested the same way. So, she's speaking from the grave right now. So, tell us about it.
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:19.760]  Yeah, I didn't know that actually. I'm impressed to hear that, but I'm not surprised.
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:22.760]  So, you know, the consistent thing is we know they'll be tested.
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:30.760]  And I think you and I can agree the president, President Trump has done incredibly important things, specific things to take on the globalist.
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:35.760]  TPP is won when he was over. One of the guys was over. I can't remember. It was Tillerson or one of them.
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:38.760]  And they told the guys in Europe, yeah, we're not signing on to that deal.
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:43.760]  The finance ministers were trying to roll ahead. You know, protectionism is bad, all that kind of stuff.
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:52.760]  But on this question of Syria, a lot of us woke up on Thursday night late and Friday morning, worrying about whether we're being drawn in.
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:56.760]  We know the president showed he's tough and he cares about babies and all that.
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:00.760]  But, you know, there's another set of babies that Assad's going to kill or somebody's going to kill.
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:05.760]  And how do we get who wins the Rubio wing, you know, the interventionist?
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:09.760]  We must fight everywhere and fight every battle or the America first wing.
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:13.760]  And I think that's what we're seeing going on right now. And there never could, you know, no one win.
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:17.760]  America's never do well by intervening in the Middle East. We just don't do well.
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:21.760]  So the question is, how do you draw the right lines? And I'm concerned about it.
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:29.760]  Sure. Well, she brought up her book and talked about the fact that she had been there when they began to co-op Reagan.
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:38.760]  And that she was saying that she was going to try to talk to Trump to warn him about how he needs to drain the swamp and how that they were going to come at him.
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  And so I think, I think, you know, that clearly Trump should go read her book.
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:47.760]  I mean, I wrote several books that I read. Which one gets into all the battles of the 1980s?
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.760]  I guess she updated her book is what it was.
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:15:00.760]  That's right. The famous one is a choice, not an echo that she wrote in 1964, which recounted how the globalist rolled taft in favor of Eisenhower and then onto 64.
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:02.760]  But then she updated it just a couple of years ago.
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:05.760]  And then actually Ron Paul wrote the introduction and she talks about everyone.
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:09.760]  And the term she also coined was the king makers. The king makers, there it is.
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:15.760]  The king makers are the globalists who are constantly maneuvering to get control of things.
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:20.760]  And again, you know, we've gone 50, 60 years of the globalists getting creep and control.
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:26.760]  You know, I once told her the ERA, which she helped stop, which was an attempt to kind of the feminist takeover.
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:33.760]  She beat it. They went incrementally. The globalists get beat, but then they go incrementally and they take little pieces and little pieces and little pieces.
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:45.760]  I mean, I was a little disappointed, Alex, when the president's citing of one of the rationales was the UN convention on weapons of mass destruction.
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:50.760]  Yeah. I mean, the UN, to me, we ought not be talking about it because I don't want to abide by it.
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:52.760]  Because he just cut the funding to the UN by 50 percent.
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  So he's going the right direction there, but then now citing their authority.
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:57.760]  That's right. Exactly. And I know what he's doing, right?
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:00.760]  He said, this is a guy who understands and Phyllis understood this.
[1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:05.760]  Phyllis Schlafe used to say things like, you know, we're electing a president, not a pastor.
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:09.760]  You know, she knew we need a guy that's going to be practical and practically lead.
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:12.760]  It's not, it's not a kind of messiah complex.
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:15.760]  So I know what he's doing, but, and you're right, he's in the right direction.
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:18.760]  Although Nikki Haley at the UN, some of her pronouncements seem to be a little...
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:21.760]  Oh, she's full out warmonger and McMasters.
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:27.760]  You know, I've held my tongue about some of the statements before, but now he's like, we're going to take out Assad and ISIS simultaneously.
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:31.760]  Well, the Russians are there. I mean, the Russians are saying they're going to respond,
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:33.760]  and the Russians aren't communists anymore.
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  I'm not saying they're angels, but communist China is the one openly threatening us.
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.760]  They're the ones grabbing the South China Sea.
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:45.760]  I mean, if the Russians were grabbing part of the English Channel, I'd say we got to, you know, have our task forces go there.
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:47.760]  But I don't see Russia in this.
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:50.760]  It's like Warbacher. Congressman Warbacher has been studying Russia.
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:53.760]  He says, we need to work with Russia. They've got a lot of economic development we can do.
[1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:57.760]  I mean, I'm sorry, they're just not the demon that John McCain says.
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:02.760]  Well, and back to what Phyllis taught and what she was talking about is when the test of a president comes, you know,
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:05.760]  in Carter, 1977, Carter was tested.
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:10.760]  The Soviets literally swept up all the dissidents, many of the dissidents, and put them in gulags.
[1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:14.760]  And Carter's response was to write personal notes to each of the dissidents.
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:15.760]  That probably made him feel good.
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:17.760]  And then to ask the UN to investigate.
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:21.760]  A year later, he asked them again, I think we can see the president's going to be a different guy.
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.760]  The question is, are we going to, who's going to be in the, in the, survive the cage match in the White House
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:29.760]  to say who he, who has his ear and who he listens to?
[1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:31.760]  Because look, I think we can agree.
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:35.760]  It looks like he did a limited strike and it was smart in many ways.
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:36.760]  But now where do you draw the line?
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:42.760]  The Russians are pulling ships up next to us and Assad is bombing a hospital was one report.
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:46.760]  I mean, in other words, saying to the president, and then you got on TV on the weekend,
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:51.760]  Lindsey Graham saying, that's Assad saying this to the president, well, hold on a second.
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:53.760]  We can't fight the whole world.
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:54.760]  Let's figure out what we're going to do.
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:18:01.760]  So I think, you know, again, the lessons of history that Phyllis taught was be careful who's got the ear of the president.
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.760]  I saw the clip you're talking about, meet the press or something.
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:09.760]  I saw this morning and he says, oh, President Trump wakes up any given day.
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:10.760]  You're messing with him.
[1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:11.760]  You're crazy.
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:12.760]  Like promoting.
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:14.760]  Oh, it's great that Trump's a loose cannon when he's clearly not a loose cannon.
[1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:16.760]  So they're selling who you better be afraid.
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:17.760]  Our president's a loose cannon.
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:18.760]  That's crazy.
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:19.760]  Right.
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:20.760]  Right.
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:23.760]  And again, listen, the key to this is I think Trump is a master of this.
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.760]  So I'm comfortable with he's a masterful leader.
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:27.760]  I was on another show one time.
[1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:28.760]  They were complaining about this.
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.760]  I said, look, he's he's an entrepreneurial leader.
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:33.760]  He sells and he plays sides and all that.
[1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:39.760]  But I think, you know, again, I'm on the side of pushing towards people that understand the quagmire.
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:45.760]  A lot of presidents think they're going to solve big problems and have to know the limits of American power.
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:46.760]  That's right.
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:47.760]  And like Matt Drudge said, the swamp drains you.
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:49.760]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.760]  Most important thing I'm going to say in days here at the Luster's.
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:54.760]  I know this is key and I want to come back and get your take on this.
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:56.760]  But you can answer now as well.
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:59.760]  Ed Martin, president of the Eagle Forum.
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:01.760]  Trump's doing all these great things.
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:05.760]  The liberals openly are plotting in newspapers saying, oh, great, his base is going to break away.
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:08.760]  Then he'll only have us and we'll co-opt him.
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:12.760]  By us being a loyal opposition, praising him for good things, supporting good things he does,
[1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:18.760]  but also lobbying against bad things and staying on him, then he stays under the American people's control.
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:23.760]  If we totally throw our hands up day one, he's not perfect, then we'll lose full control.
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:25.760]  That is the most important thing we're going to talk about today.
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:27.760]  We can't quit now.
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:28.760]  We can't quit on Trump.
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:29.760]  We can't quit on the vision.
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.760]  We can't say, OK, that's that proves the point.
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:37.760]  We, as you said, every day things are happening in this administration that are on the side of the people against the global.
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:38.760]  Huge.
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  I mean, I'd say 90% is like, he gets an A plus right now.
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:43.760]  I agree with you.
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:44.760]  I agree with you.
[1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:47.760]  I mean, he gets like a 99 when it comes to what he's doing on the economy and everything.
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:51.760]  And I'd give him like a, I don't know, like a 75 or something right now in foreign affairs.
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  We're going to see what happens.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:55.760]  And clearly it is about looking strong with China out of control.
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:57.760]  China and North Korea are out of control.
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.760]  We'll be right back.
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:03.760]  When you started your business, it wasn't because you wanted to be like everybody else.

[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.520]  the Russians, and then I'm going to your phone calls, calling for a
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:51.360]  territory strike against the United States.
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:54.800]  State Duma member wants to send a message to Trump.
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:59.600]  The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.520]  Zirvinovsky, has called for Moscow to carry out territory strikes against
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:07.360]  the U.S. in response. The Trump administration's air strike on
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:11.360]  Syria and Daria is going to translate this for us.
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:15.040]  For the radio listeners, it's closed caption for folks watching us on TV.
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:19.360]  You can always tune in and infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:22.880]  Remember, they're trying to censor us everywhere they can in blockage
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:26.480]  and you go to iPhones, droids, the only push mainstream media on the front
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:30.640]  of the site. Go around all that, go directly to infowars.com
[1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:34.880]  and spread that link to folks saying this is the link, this is the site,
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:37.920]  they don't want you to visit. That's how we're going to circumvent it, person to
[1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:39.920]  person. And I want to thank you all for doing
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:43.040]  that because we need to be able to get this news out to counter them.
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:45.840]  Of course, he has some big news. He's broken an infowars.
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:50.400]  I'll get to after we take calls as well. Shock, GOP senator behind Obamacare
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:55.280]  looting scheme. But right now, Daria, let's go ahead and start
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:36:00.640]  rolling this clip and we'll translate it here live on air.
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:06.560]  All right, roll it. This is how air strikes against Syria were
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:10.480]  commented by Vladimir Zirvinovsky.
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:16.080]  This was all planned. This was provocation in advance.
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:20.400]  Allegedly, the official Damascus and its air force have used chemical weapons
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:26.480]  and in Idlib province and there were victims to prepare public opinion saying
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:31.360]  look, this is a retaliatory strike. So Syrian armed forces wouldn't bomb
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:34.640]  civilians. In reality, chemical weapons were used by
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:41.200]  local terrorists from such organizations as Anusra or ISIS
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:45.600]  in order to overthrow Assad and to undermine Russia's authority there
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:51.760]  to show that Russia hasn't won there. So they're destroying the military
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:57.040]  airfields and homes. Planes were destroyed. People died.
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:01.280]  That is, this is a direct aggression of the United States of America against
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:04.640]  Syria. Nobody has invited Americans to Syria,
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:09.360]  no Turks, nor anybody for that matter except for Russia.
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:13.280]  All of them are aggressors and Syria has every right to protect itself
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.200]  and perform retaliatory strikes to protect itself.
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:20.240]  We have exited the memorandum about confrontations
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:24.640]  of our fighter planes over Syrian territory.
[1:37:24.640 --> 1:37:28.400]  Now we should cover the whole Syrian territory with our S-300 and
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:32.320]  S-400 systems, send a part of our Black Sea fleet there
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:39.440]  and northern fleet and continue to help strike against ISIS
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:45.840]  and other anti-governmental locations from any airfields from theirs and from
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:50.960]  RF airfields by our pilots and our planes plus by military naval
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:54.160]  forces. I personally would order our strategic
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:59.200]  missile forces partial high combat readiness.
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:04.240]  In southern regions we should declare partial mobilization
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:07.360]  and make tough conditions that any armed forces
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:11.440]  that are illegally operating on Syrian territory are going to receive severe
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:17.600]  retaliatory strikes. If they continue aggressive actions
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:20.960]  against official Syria, official forces of Damascus,
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:26.800]  of Bashar al-Assad, so they would know that they will not be allowed to destroy
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:31.520]  Syrian armed forces like this with impunity.
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.840]  In this case, Syrian aviation and personnel, a few dozen planes were
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:41.280]  destroyed, officers died and servicemen.
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:45.760]  So then this is the continuation. Americans are envious of our success
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:50.400]  and they have only defeats since 1945.
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:56.000]  They lost in Korea, lost in Vietnam, in Afghanistan, everywhere.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.280]  And now with the new president, maybe he was misinformed,
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:03.600]  misled, and so he gave his consent to strike on military airfield in the
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:07.120]  city of Homs.
[1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:14.080]  This is his mistake. It's USA's mistake. And we should send back our airspace
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:18.320]  forces, our military naval forces, and this confrontation is going to last for
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:21.520]  a long time because this is the Middle East. It's oil and gas,
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:24.720]  collision of various nations, various religions.
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:29.520]  And this is a battleground between USA and Russia.
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:32.400]  I don't really find anything there that's not true and
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:35.600]  that's the supposed super right-winger that wanted to work with Trump and just
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:38.560]  have business deals. But if you look at this, and we're going to your phone
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.800]  calls,
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:45.360]  the West started this, began to overthrow that country.
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:49.520]  The Russians have pulled most of their forces out. So in comes
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:53.360]  Trump, he says he wants ISIS out of there. We put all these forces there.
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:56.640]  This chemical attack happens and we have the British ambassador. I want to play
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:39:59.280]  that one more time and I promise going to Carlos and others. This is really
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:03.760]  important. I want to play the British ambassador
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:11.040]  where he came out on the BBC and basically laid out the fact that
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:16.000]  this is a fake flag as the term he uses, Peter Ford, a false flag,
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.680]  and that now the jihadis will even have more staged events
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:22.960]  if they know it'll bring the West in. And the Russians are saying they bombed
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:25.520]  that facility
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:29.120]  that is
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:33.760]  Syrians in Russian aircraft and that there must have been chemicals on the
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:37.920]  ground. We know Hillary gave chemicals to them.
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:42.480]  But regardless, why would Assad do that? I keep going back to that, okay, because
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:45.360]  again, I want to support Trump on the economic things he's doing, the
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:48.960]  anti-globalism. It's all wonderful. Our economy's trying to turn it back on
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:51.920]  right as it was sputtering and running out of gas and faltering. We're on a
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:56.080]  knife's edge where this economy's going. I want prosperity. I want to believe in
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:59.520]  my military. I want to do all this. But it's true, since we went under
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:03.280]  globalism at the end of World War II, we're not allowed to win wars.
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:07.600]  We're put into UN police actions like Korea,
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:11.920]  like Vietnam, and like the whole UN operations before to take out non-radical
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:15.440]  Muslim countries. And we're there now at the behest of al-Qaeda
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:20.400]  and ISIS who celebrated this, and it's wrong. I know it looks
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:26.000]  tough to Russia, it looks tough to China, but I think it is overall a miscalculation.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:29.360]  And I'm talking to a lot of right-wingers, a lot of people in the military,
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:32.480]  a lot of high-level people, and they all don't like it.
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:36.320]  They don't like it. And they think Trump's being set up. That's what Ron Paul
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.800]  said. That's what Joe Scalzen said. That's what all of our expert guests have
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:45.840]  been saying. And then now you notice the second most
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:52.640]  powerful party in Russia thinks Trump was misinformed about this.
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:54.960]  Trump saw the image of those children. His daughter came and,
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:58.560]  Daddy, please do something. What?
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:03.040]  We don't see the images of the dead kids killed in Stockholm
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:07.280]  last week, or the dead people in Germany, or the dead kids in Nice.
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:11.920]  They don't show you that, but they show you the nerve gas kids when they want
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:15.840]  to war, don't they? Gulping like fish out of water,
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:21.040]  like something out of a nightmare, assaulting us with that crap.
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:26.080]  Those jihadis are so dirty, folks, so evil, so twisted.
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.160]  They blow their own kids up. Don't put it past some of those jihadis that
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:33.680]  detonated on themselves. I'm not saying that's the case in all
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:38.560]  these cases, but they got caught in 2013 launching an attack on their own people.
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:43.040]  They got caught. But see, I don't have any amnesia.
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:46.480]  So I'm called a conspiracy theorist because I have a memory. Let's play the
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:49.680]  ambassador and then write your calls. Here's the ambassador from the UK
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:55.840]  formally to Syria. Here is Peter Ford. And based on previous
[1:42:55.840 --> 1:43:00.800]  experience, including Iraq, we can see that we cannot
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:05.600]  take at face value what the so-called intelligence experts
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:10.880]  tell us, not when they have an agenda. But come back to the main point, but
[1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:15.920]  it's not going to end here. And we are likely Britain to be dragged into it
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:19.360]  because Trump has just given the jihadis
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:26.320]  a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations. Seeing how successful
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:30.160]  and how easy it is with a gullible media
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:34.080]  to provoke the West into
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:38.080]  intemperate reactions, they will very likely stage
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:41.680]  an operation similar to what they did. And this was documented
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:47.840]  by the United Nations in August last year. They mounted a chlorine gas attack
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.000]  on civilians and they tried to make it look like it was a regime
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.320]  operation. This marked my words. You're hearing it here.
[1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:01.920]  And it will happen and we'll get all the warmongers coming to tell us
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:06.720]  that Assad is defying us and we must go in more heavily into Syria.
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:13.040]  This will be fake flag. Powerful. All right, Carlos. And then we're
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:16.160]  going to go to Bobby. And then we're going to go to Nick and
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.760]  Beto and Leigh Ann. All of you in order. Carlos, thanks for holding
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:24.000]  from the great nation of Canada. Carlos, you're on the air.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.240]  Thank you, Alex. The news when it broke made me wonder,
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:32.960]  wow, President Trump has always used good judgment.
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:36.080]  Always, always, always, his judgment was dead on.
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:40.320]  And when the cognitive dissonance struck,
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:44.720]  my first reaction was to say, wait a second. This is the time for Americans
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:48.880]  to support him, to show that we too are good wood.
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:55.520]  And at that moment, you know, it struck me that the real point, and I think I
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:00.000]  agree with Mr. Pesinic, Mr. Pesinic, 100%, the fact that the
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:03.120]  president of China did not turn around, get back in an
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:08.640]  airplane and go back to China should worry Kim Jong-un of North Korea
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:13.040]  much more than whatever threat is posed by President Trump.
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.720]  Because the president of China couldn't do
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:23.120]  to Korea what Trump has done indirectly and showing his might
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:26.560]  in Syria. Well, what he showed is he's willing to go to war with the Russians,
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:30.480]  which, again, I have children and I understand we have to show strength,
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:35.120]  but if our government hadn't started at the civil war to begin with,
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.880]  I wouldn't have an issue, okay? And I support Trump going and taking out
[1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:41.760]  ISIS and al-Qaeda. And a lot of people told me, Alex, it's
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:44.560]  going to get bigger. You're wrong. You're wrong. And I said, no, I trust Trump.
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:47.520]  But look, I want it. Here's the deal. Some people say, Alex,
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:53.040]  hate Trump or love Trump. Don't be on the fence. I'm not. If I support him
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:56.880]  on his domestic issues and getting conservative judges and cutting taxes
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:46:01.600]  and bringing jobs back and he's doing that, then that's a great thing.
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:05.520]  But then if I have real grave concerns about going into a thing in a proxy
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:09.200]  war with Iran and Russia, I think that's reasonable. But listen, it's fine for
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:12.560]  you. I mean, tell us your view. If you think it shows strength to China,
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:16.000]  shows it to Russia, maybe as Intel, we don't have. It does look like chemical
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:19.440]  weapons weren't that base. I mean, Assad made a deal to turn the
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:22.320]  chemicals over. I know that. But think about this. Trump
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:26.080]  was going to blow up a chemical base less than a quarter mile away from a
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:29.520]  village. I mean, that would cause its own deal. So the whole thing just,
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:34.800]  it sounds weird. What do you think? Well, Alex, now to Syria.
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:39.280]  Okay, I think that President Trump is finding out as he drains the swamp that
[1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:45.360]  there are two main streets in the swamp. Wall Street and War Street.
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:50.000]  Wall Street, we know he's aware of what he has to do and he's doing it.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:53.360]  He did not put President Jackson's picture on the wall
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:57.520]  by accident. Second of all, with regards to War Street,
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:02.000]  he has to be very careful because coming from the academy
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.520]  of where it was a thought leadership,
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:08.880]  you can see in his pattern of decision making
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:13.600]  that when he confronts an enemy, such as an opponent in politics,
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:18.160]  one thing you do is you assign a perjurative name to that opponent.
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:22.080]  Crooked Hillary, lying, you know, Ted, whatever.
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:26.800]  And then after that, you go all out and you win.
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:30.960]  However, in the academy, you're really dealing with peers that are good people
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:34.720]  like yourself. And so you do not, you stop it because it's an
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:39.440]  exercise in leadership building. Had he been in the military, he may not
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:43.520]  have acted the same way. But definitely, you realize that when
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:48.160]  he was becoming president, he, incognitiveness,
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:52.000]  he said of the Clintons, oh, they're good people. In other words, he was treating
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.480]  them like, you know, in the academy you were treated somebody
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:01.120]  an opponent that you defeated. In Syria, he has to understand that the
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:05.040]  leadership that he brings has to transcend the generals.
[1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:09.120]  I think it's very important. I don't think that General Petraeus
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.960]  failing the honey trap showed great judgment. And I think you should be
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.840]  careful with his advice. All right. I appreciate your call, Carlos. Absolutely.
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:21.680]  We're going to go to Bobby and then Rick and Vito and
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:25.280]  Leigh Ann and others here right now. But
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:30.000]  I get the fact that he wanted to look strong for Russia and China.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:33.760]  But that doesn't carry me over the threshold.
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:37.600]  I don't think Trump would do a false flag. I think he may have been misled, given
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:41.440]  bad intel, and he knew he couldn't challenge that part of the deep state
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:45.200]  like Judo. He took the attack and turned it around to make himself
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:49.280]  look like a hero to his enemies to deflect all the Russia stuff. And I think
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:52.000]  at the end of the day, that's what Trump did.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.880]  Remember, he said the whole Jewish center's being attacked was fake. It
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:57.120]  turned out it was. I mean, Trump knows what's going on.
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:00.960]  He's not stupid. And I think he couldn't go back on the kids being killed.
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:03.680]  And so he went ahead and made lemons out of lemonade. The problem is, it's going
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:09.760]  to encourage more false flags now. That's the big problem in Trump's thinking.
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:14.000]  Bobby in California. Bobby, you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:19.520]  First, Trump's entire base, turning against him over the war, only helps Trump battle
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:23.520]  the neocons. Second, as far as North Korea, China knows it's going to
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:26.480]  collapse if Trump gets the tariffs through, so they're desperate for the U.S.
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:30.720]  to spark aggression to divert the poor people's anger onto a foreign enemy before
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:34.640]  that happens. Another thing, if Trump wants to win,
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:38.800]  he should do an immediate bill for emergency infrastructure bill for the
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:42.080]  over 3,000 U.S. cities that have confirmed lead levels
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:45.600]  higher than Flint. Sure, that's a great way to start business up
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:48.800]  in that building in a big boom. Let's just go back for a minute,
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:55.280]  though. How does losing his base defeat the neocons? If he loses his base,
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:49:59.200]  he'll then rely on new policies and a new base that's agreeing with him.
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:04.800]  That's that. What are you getting at? Not losing his base, the base and turning
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:11.760]  on him over the war. Because now he has that, when the neocons try to
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:15.040]  put him in a corner, his whole base, everyone that's influential, turn
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:19.040]  against him. So, you know, if his base didn't turn
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:24.560]  against him, then, you know, he might go with more war aggression.
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:28.880]  Well, yeah, but I mean, if you completely abandon somebody, you know, support them
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:33.920]  and they don't care about you. So technically,
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:38.560]  look, here's what I'm getting at. They're trying to remove him from office
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:42.480]  saying he's soft on Russia. So now by having this
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:46.080]  locking of swords with Russia and all these threats back and forth,
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:49.840]  that repudiates the biggest threat to his White House. Because they are trying
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:52.960]  to remove him. They got a whole COG program there,
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:57.360]  and so Trump used their move against him
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:01.280]  by embracing it. He basically defeated them if he can stop a water war.

[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:16.960]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us. The news website. The enemy
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:21.120]  doesn't want you to see. Literally. It's infowars.com.
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:24.320]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, they're all announcing ways to block us.
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:28.080]  Ways to tell people not to go to our site that it's hate or that's inaccurate
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.800]  when it's super accurate, super hardcore. The last hour and 54 minutes, I mean go
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:37.200]  over it. It's just documented research, hardcore clips,
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:41.280]  hardcore analysis, breaking inside intel. It's amazing.
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:46.880]  I was just watching Sean Spicer during the break while I was getting some coffee.
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.520]  And it dovetails with everything we put out in a report this morning
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:55.440]  that I gave Paul Watson last night to put in the report.
[1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:59.760]  Trump pushes back against neocon plan to invade Syria.
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:02.640]  Troops massing as deep state plots for zine change.
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:07.600]  And Spicer came out and said we're there to stop refugees flooding into Europe.
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:11.920]  We're there to take out Al Qaeda and ISIS. We're not there to take out Assad.
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:14.880]  They were supposed to get rid of those chemical weapons regardless and they
[1:55:14.880 --> 1:55:17.920]  were still sitting there. He agreed to get rid of them.
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.760]  Everything I was told. But that's not on the news. It's
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:25.040]  McMaster saying something else for the National Security Council
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:28.480]  about we want to take out Assad too.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:34.000]  Trump couldn't even get three other guys do the job after Flynn.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.880]  So I don't want to turn McMaster into the devil.
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:40.480]  It's just that what the president's saying to people
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:43.520]  in the meetings and directly the folks I've talked to and I'll just leave it at
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:48.560]  that is not what they're saying. And so the president believes he acted
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:51.600]  to take out chemical weapons that he was told about years ago.
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.200]  He's like didn't they agree to fly those out of there or incinerate him?
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:55:59.200]  You mean and he saw the intel and he said and they showed him the flights from
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:02.560]  there over and the plane turning back. He sees a plane coming from a base that
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:06.240]  has chemical weapons. There's a chemical attack. He bombs it.
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.560]  The president was believing what he was told.
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:14.720]  Now is that true info? We have an article up on infowars.com.
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:19.520]  If people say Alex either before Trump or against him, I don't know exactly.
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:23.120]  I don't sit up here like other people who claim I know everything when I don't.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:27.520]  They're the conspiracy theorist. Here's one from a high level government
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:31.440]  individual. Donald Trump is an international lawbreaker.
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:34.960]  It's on infowars.com sent to us by the individual who won't come on because
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:38.160]  they had to be threats when they come on. But they're high level and very
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:41.520]  respected. So how am I going to go back to your
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:43.440]  calls as soon as we start the next hour?
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:50.080]  Bido and Rick and well, Leigh Ann, Zachary,
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:53.680]  Russell, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:57.440]  But I haven't even read this report yet that has all the inside stuff from the
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:00.480]  White House. Everybody really should read this info.
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.240]  Like I should probably say Trump pushes back against the EOCONs. I should say
[1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:08.640]  from, you know, exclusive from inside the White House. I mean,
[1:57:08.640 --> 1:57:11.360]  I told Paul to put that up. Paul's awesome. I was already written two articles
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:16.000]  today, but I had him write this. I sent him a transcript yesterday of my notes
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:20.720]  and I want people to understand when we say White House source who spoke to
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:22.960]  info or so. I mean, I guess that's in there, but he's
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:26.240]  to say White House source. Trump pushes back White House source.
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:29.440]  Need to add that to the top. People understand this is a big story. I want to
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:35.120]  red-link that. Briefly, folks love our organic Made
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.520]  America by the biggest company out there, Private Labeled,
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:41.520]  fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver. So good for your gums.
[1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:45.280]  So, you know, a wonderfully anti-bacterial.
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:48.720]  It's available at infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:51.520]  That sold out. The latest run of that. We're getting an even bigger run done
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:55.360]  right now. Five stars of you now just started
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:58.560]  shipping last week. We already have four reviews for the bubblegum flavor for
[1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:02.560]  kids. Naturally, organically flavored. It has iodine and
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:05.760]  nano-silver and tea tree oil. It doesn't have the spearmint or the peppermint.
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:10.080]  It's so strong in it because it is concentrated. A tiny little dot
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:12.800]  goes with normal toothpaste, too, because they said, you know, we don't really do
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:15.600]  this, but you want it concentrated. Because we've been talking about doing
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:18.320]  something different, and I said, yeah, we want it even stronger. It doesn't have the
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:21.680]  normal filler that's in there.
[1:58:21.680 --> 1:58:25.600]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or triple A
[1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:29.760]  253-3139. We're going to come back and go to
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:33.200]  Beto, Leanne. Everybody stay there. I want to talk to you.
[1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:36.640]  Russell, Zach's been holding a long time, too. We'll get to everybody.
[1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:40.720]  I'm Alex Jones, a third hour straight ahead, and we have some special guests
[1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:44.880]  joining us. And then David Knight always knocks it out of the park. Stay with us.
[1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:49.200]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:55.040]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money
[1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:58.320]  on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[1:58:58.320 --> 1:59:01.360]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these. I'm talking
[1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:04.640]  about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from
[1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:08.720]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors. The PPX is so small, you can put it in your
[1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:11.440]  pocket. But so powerful, you can run some 110
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:14.640]  appliances at your house. Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:17.600]  food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:21.280]  cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:24.720]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you
[1:59:24.720 --> 1:59:28.320]  to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[1:59:28.320 --> 1:59:32.640]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a
[1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:35.680]  while. Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:39.120]  thing in action. That's privatepowergrid.com. Even better,

[1:59:50.400 --> 2:00:00.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:36.800]  Right now, from my viewpoint, and a few others, maybe more than a few,
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:40.720]  see this as just a sort of a victory for the neoconservatives who
[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:45.520]  have been looking for a sod has to go and who is it that wants to get rid of them.
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:51.680]  And you have to look for that, who's involved in that. And that's,
[2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:55.360]  I think, unfortunately, the ones who are winning out on this.
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:58.720]  And the radicals are winning too, the people who have been
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:03.840]  trying to get rid of a sod as well. So there was a bit of hypocrisy going on
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:08.400]  here because, you know, in one minute we say that, well, maybe a sod has to
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:12.240]  stay, the next day he has to go. And yes, we're over there fighting
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:16.720]  ISIS and Al Qaeda. At the same time, what we end up doing by these bombs,
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:22.080]  we've actually strengthened them. So it is a mess. And that is why
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:26.880]  I work so hard in America to present the case for non-interventionism,
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:29.360]  mind our own business. There are problems around the world,
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:32.960]  but I do not believe the American people and our American government should be
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:37.440]  the policeman of the world. It makes no sense. It causes us more trouble and more grief.
[2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:41.120]  It causes us more financial problems because of this. It's not in our
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:44.800]  self-interest, and it's hardly a way that we can defend our Constitution and
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:47.680]  liberty. It is not for that reason. There are other
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:51.440]  motives for this. And to understand clearly how they're
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:55.600]  thinking, I can't tell you that, but I do know that the
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:58.720]  results are not very good for the American people.
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:04.720]  But all I know is that from my viewpoint analysis that there was no need to rush,
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:10.000]  there was no threat to our national security, and they have to give a reason
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:13.200]  for doing these things. But there was a rush in to it,
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:18.880]  and I have no idea what his purpose was. He doesn't maybe just didn't want to
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:22.160]  hear the debate because the last time they debated it, they lost the
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:26.000]  debate. And this time, you know, it was necessary
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.680]  for him to jump on this, I guess, before people
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:34.400]  came to know what was really going on. Essentially, just listening to it too,
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:38.400]  it's presented as a fair complete, isn't it, that the Bashar al-Assad is behind
[2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:41.680]  this chemical attack. But of course, the Russian envoy was trying to make the
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:45.680]  point, again, you're basing your evidence on stuff that's
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:48.960]  presented by groups and bodies in NGOs that we
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:53.280]  know to have been unreliable in the past.
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:02:58.240]  No, I don't think the evidence is there. At least it hasn't been presented, and
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:02.320]  they needed a so-called excuse. They worked real hard.
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:06.320]  That is our government and their coalition, an excuse to go into
[2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:10.000]  Iraq so they can caulk at stories, all kinds of things,
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.760]  and that's what this is part of. I don't know why, if
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.280]  if any of it is true, why they couldn't wait and take a look at it.
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:21.120]  You know, a few years ago in 2013, there were these similar stories
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:26.080]  that, you know, didn't go anywhere because with a little bit of a pause, there
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:29.760]  was a resistance to it built up in our Congress as well as the American
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:32.400]  people. They thought it was all, you know, a
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:36.240]  fraud, and that nothing like that was happening. And right now, I just don't
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:39.520]  see how it could conceivably about what they claim,
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:43.920]  because it's helping ISIS, it's helping al-Qaeda, it's helping the
[2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:46.880]  the enemy that we're supposed to at least be fighting.
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:50.240]  Yeah, the peace talks, of course, have been ended now.
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:53.840]  They were afraid, they were terrified that peace was going to break out.
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:59.200]  You know, al-Qaeda was on the run, peace talks were being talked,
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:02.960]  being entertained with, and all of a sudden they had to change, and this
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:06.320]  changed things dramatically, you know, the whole event.
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:12.800]  And I do not expect them anytime soon or in the distant future
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:17.760]  to prove that Assad would be so stupid as to do this. Why would he do it?
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:23.280]  You know, it was zero benefit to him to participate in it,
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:27.520]  and but the headlines here, United States says Assad's killing his own people,
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:31.600]  killing his own people. Well, that makes no sense
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:37.040]  whatsoever, and I wish that people would demand to hear the truth
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:41.840]  before they decide they have to go and start another war.
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:44.800]  All right, folks, I thought I'd play in that segment some of those Ron Paul
[2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:48.160]  clips, because he's so dead on effect. Let's get him on as soon as possible.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:50.400]  What a great statesman wish he could have been president.
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:54.080]  All right, Bito, Leanne, Rick, everybody, I'm going right to you on the other side
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:58.080]  of this break. Please stay with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.680]  When we, the people, elected Donald Trump, we exhaled in relief,
[2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:06.720]  believing that we're going to crush ISIS with the help of Russia and that we've
[2:05:06.720 --> 2:05:10.480]  averted a nuclear war in which we would have been already had Hillary won.
[2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:13.680]  The sense of relief has just been flipped on its head. It appears we're in the
[2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:17.280]  brink of nuclear war and Russia is made out to be our enemy once again.
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:20.400]  Explanations for the drastic turn of events range from this being part of
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:24.240]  Machiavelli tactics meant to in fact prevent a world war with Russia being
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:27.600]  let in on the game, to Trump being hopelessly surrounded by deep state
[2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:29.840]  studious who still hate him despite of all the newly
[2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:32.720]  found love they're professing for him and whose goal it is to impeach and
[2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:36.160]  replace him with a bloodthirsty war hungry zealot the likes of which
[2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:39.680]  we've never seen. Either way, the military industrial complex wins and that is
[2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:42.560]  not why we elected Trump. This movement of making America great again
[2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:45.920]  is bigger than Trump. Trump is not our leader. He's our follower
[2:05:45.920 --> 2:05:49.840]  and we must lead him in our dogged determination to ensure our children have
[2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:52.320]  a future. So don't give up on Trump, thus allowing
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:54.800]  him to become just another casualty of the deep state.
[2:05:54.800 --> 2:05:57.920]  After all no one said taking America back is going to be easy.
[2:05:57.920 --> 2:06:24.160]  This has been Daria for Infowars.com.
[2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:28.880]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost. We won.
[2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:32.960]  Wanna see what Trump's up against? It's time to ride, boss. We need a thousand
[2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:36.320]  pallet beers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud
[2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:42.240]  of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. And beef was for supper.

[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:10.480]  Got some good news folks? We're queuing the tape up.
[2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:14.720]  But first we take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:18.000]  In the heart of the Resistance Against Globalism.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:22.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:26.880]  in the heart of the Resistance. It's good old me.
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:35.680]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind. Boy, this sure is.
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:39.840]  I'll give the globalists this. They are bold and they repeat the same stuff over
[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:42.720]  and over again. They've got caught stage and chemical
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:48.080]  attacks in 2013 all over the news. The rebels are so badly
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:51.200]  commanded they videotaped it and screamed Allah Akbar and a bunch
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:56.720]  other jihadi stuff. And now it looks like they've done it again.
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:08:59.600]  The Russians are saying it's a false flag. The British ambassadors saying it's a
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:04.240]  false flag. So why did Trump do it? Well I know this.
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:08.720]  The good news is I've been told they don't tend to topple Assad.
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:13.600]  But McMaster wants to have a big force there to quote protect our troops as
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:19.440]  they kick out Al Qaeda and ISIS. But just earlier we're going to cue it up.
[2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:22.800]  Just about 15 minutes ago during a break I watched Spicer live
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:25.600]  in a press conference. He's still going right now saying look we're there to
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:30.960]  take out Al Qaeda, ISIS. We are not intending to have a wider
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:34.080]  war and Trump did this to take out chemical
[2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:36.880]  weapons. We knew we're there that could be used in the future.
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:40.000]  Which is what I was told. Hey they made an agreement. The chemicals are there. The
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.720]  Russians did the ship them out. The planes came from a base that have
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:46.240]  chemicals. We blew it up. When Trump went late they made an
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:51.600]  agreement. He saw the agreement. So that's in Trump's brain.
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:56.240]  That's how that works. And that's what I've been told by our White House sources
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:09:59.280]  that have been talking directly to the president. The story's pretty important.
[2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:02.960]  It's on info wars.com. Everybody that's so mad at Trump. And I'm not being an
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:07.200]  apologist here. I'm glad that Trump is pushing back against neocon plan
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:11.200]  to invade Syria. But we need to say White House source.
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:15.280]  Trump is pushing back. We should probably change that headline
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:18.720]  by Paul Watts as the folks understand this is a White House source. I mean I
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:21.600]  know it's in the
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:24.560]  second paragraph but that's just that's not going to cut mustard. We people
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:28.080]  understand this is serious. With Russia and Iran pledging to hit back against
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:32.560]  further Syria interventions. All right we're going to Beato and others. I
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:36.320]  wanted to play this clip from Zero Hedge. Zero Hedge.com. It's up on info
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:40.400]  wars.com. Al Jazeera slams Assad now dropping
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:44.720]  white phosphorus bombs on Syria. In Qatar fueling escalation in Syria with
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:49.600]  propaganda. White phosphorus the Israelis use that.
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:51.760]  I mean that's what weapons do. They kill people but you don't even know that's
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:54.800]  white phosphorus. But they just keep like pushing these
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:59.680]  war crimes are happening. The West and the Islamists started the war. Qatar and
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:04.240]  Saudi Arabia are the main funders of it. They're the ones to blame for this.
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:08.160]  Along with Hillary and the neocons. That's a fact.
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:31.040]  No one's debating it.
[2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:34.560]  I tell you that's all you hear on these videos. It's just total cult.
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:41.440]  Throw up. That's enough.
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:44.560]  We've got really bad stuff on Palm Sunday. The in the Egypt the jihad is
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:47.120]  blowing up churches which is a lot less than it used to be when our government
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:49.840]  put the bad guys in. Remember the Arab Spring five years ago was
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:52.720]  celebrating it. Anderson Cooper. Oh it's so wonderful the liberation is
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:55.840]  they're murdering and killing people and he's just how great it is.
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:11:58.960]  Oh I never got to it. I'll get to it after the calls.
[2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:04.880]  We have singing in with a fake newscast.
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:08.880]  The terrifying moment one of two ISIS suicide bombers detonate outside
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:13.360]  Egyptian church after being turned away by three hero policemen in Palm Sunday
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:17.280]  massacre that killed nearly 50 Christians.
[2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:30.480]  Bido in Iowa. You're on the air. Welcome.
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:33.680]  Thank you very much Mr. Jones. I appreciate you taking my call. First
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:35.920]  there's a lot of things I want to discuss with you. What we are seeing right
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:39.680]  now is the elite are using well of course their corrupt media and their
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:43.760]  incidious network of violent agitators to wage a psychological war example with
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:47.600]  the whole chemical attack which is imprisoning the people's mind with political
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:51.520]  practice and envy politics and intimidation. And then we're also
[2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:55.040]  seeing what what Trump needs to avoid is the pitfall of almost every public
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.120]  servant from small town select men to commander-in-chief which is temptation
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:02.160]  which then he needs to be careful he needs not to be surrounded by
[2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:05.280]  yes men and he should not be told to possess more power because that will
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:08.960]  eventually he'll become the convinced of his own divinity and I think
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:12.400]  you should read Mr. Dr. Ron Paul's book The
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:15.680]  Revolution and Manifesto where he explains that the war is the enemy of
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:19.120]  the Constitution but let's not let's not forget that even
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:21.920]  before Obama or even Trump was even in office
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:26.080]  Wesley Clark was warning about the whole all these countries we've been
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:29.600]  getting involved with in even Syria and I want to talk about the Obama
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:32.960]  administration how I'm not supporting what Trump did but
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:36.400]  he did drop 26,000 bombs last year in Syria
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:39.680]  and then Dyehurst exposed that Hillary Clinton
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:43.200]  was the one that gave the rebels the staring gas and then
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:47.520]  if you go to Daily Caller they have this headline called in between policies
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:50.640]  talking about Obama and Hillary Clinton's
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:54.160]  Middle Eastern policies and how of course Susan Rice is involved with that so
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:56.480]  it's sort of funny how she's involved and she is the one that's been
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:13:59.680]  asking Trump and then people want to ask well why
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:02.720]  well why would they do this well if you go to weekly
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:06.800]  exposing Hillary Clinton's emails she's surrounded by people who are trying to
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:10.400]  destroy Christianity and create this Islamic you know
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:13.920]  catastrophe absolutely I appreciate your call Bito
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:17.280]  listen there is no doubt
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:21.600]  that Islamists had major influence over the neocons and over the democrats
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:24.160]  especially and that they are literally opening the door
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:27.680]  upward Islamic invasion and being bought off and paid off to do it
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:31.920]  and now Erdogan is even saying that's the plan and trying to activate his forces
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:35.600]  because Europe's finally trying to shut the door because a lot of Europe figured
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:38.960]  out what was happening it mean it's so crazy who can believe it but the Muslims
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:43.440]  are organized their people are slaves their money is then given
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:48.080]  to organize the takeover of their neighbors of other Muslims of anybody
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:50.880]  around them that is what Saudi Arabia will hobbyism
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:54.560]  does all right let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Canada Rick thanks for
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:57.440]  holding it on the air
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:03.120]  hey Alex how are you good brother you bet um anyway I think a lot of this is
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:06.480]  just a ruse just to displace more the Middle East and then
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:10.080]  by time in the next year or two when more
[2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:13.280]  migrate across and I think that's what they're going to start to
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:17.760]  try to hit other people in America and then try to create a civil war
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.160]  like they're already doing now make it easier because you can't fight other
[2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:26.880]  people and your own country at the same time
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:30.320]  well that's exactly what's happening the the globalists never get the blame
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:33.520]  for world war they never get the blame for depression they never get the war
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:37.280]  the you know blame for bad things they do so as long as they're not identified
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:41.520]  they'll continue to create crises from a safe distance to consolidate power
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:44.560]  order out of chaos that's their admitted plan that's their admitted
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:48.720]  statements and the globalists do not want to allow the
[2:15:48.720 --> 2:15:52.560]  world to start dealing with each other along the lines of trade and along the
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:56.720]  lines of open free societies they want to use Islam
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:00.720]  and authoritarian China to to leverage out the planet
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:05.440]  and so now authoritarian China and Islam are basically challenging Trump
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:08.240]  and so he's trying to look strong but you don't look strong
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:12.480]  hitting Assad who's fighting authoritarian Islam
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:16.880]  and who didn't start the war but I understand what Trump did he silenced
[2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:19.600]  his critics that said he was soft on Russia
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:23.440]  and he sent him as a China that's why this was done because again
[2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:29.440]  in Trump's brain a deal was made to destroy those chemicals four years ago
[2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:32.880]  between the Russians and the US military and Assad that was on the news
[2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:37.760]  we told you about it here first and those chemicals were still there
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:42.560]  and so Trump bombed them and I'm just asking thank god the Russians pulled
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:45.920]  them all out of there you see them sitting out on the airfield
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:52.640]  right outside the bunkers because the Russians knew if they got hit
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:55.600]  and and Trump told them that the strike was coming
[2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:59.840]  I don't know if Zirinovsky's wrong he says that they lost Russian soldiers
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:02.480]  but other Russian news says they didn't I mean we're going to find out
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:05.280]  the point is if the Russians would have pulled all that out of there you'd
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:09.840]  had a giant cloud of gas and then it would have been
[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:13.200]  Trumps to blame for bombing a chemical weapons depot and it killing a bunch of
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:15.600]  people in fact the neocons might have been
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:18.800]  setting Trump up with that I I'll tell you this thank god the Russians got
[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:21.360]  those chemicals out of there I'm not trying to lionize the Russians just
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:24.560]  thank god you're told you've got less than an hour
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:28.160]  uh and and these crucible attacks are coming get out of there
[2:17:28.160 --> 2:17:31.520]  and you pull the planes out you pull the weapons out you pull the chemicals
[2:17:31.520 --> 2:17:35.040]  out thank god that happened now Rick I appreciate your call
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:38.560]  let's go ahead and talk to Lee Ann in Georgia Lee Ann in the great state of
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:42.480]  Georgia welcome oh welcome thank you Alex
[2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:47.840]  um the reason that Trump is going to end up invading Syria
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:53.040]  probably sooner than we think is so obvious yet no one is talking about it
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:56.800]  this has nothing to do with gas attacks or dead baby pictures
[2:17:56.800 --> 2:18:03.200]  it's the Iranian Syrian oil pipeline back in 2009 Syria took bids on a
[2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:05.840]  pipeline that is going to feed oil into Europe
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:09.120]  that's right and and and they don't want Russia to have a pipeline
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:12.320]  that gives Syria and Russia their own money just like
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:15.520]  Ukraine they're sick of Russia selling gas to Europe
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:18.560]  and being able to fund itself it's about cutting Russia off economically
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:23.360]  it's economic warfare why are we talking about dead baby pictures
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:26.640]  this is about um it's a huge oil pipeline
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:30.480]  we're going to end up in a war with Russia and Iran
[2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:34.800]  Russia may back down Iran could send EMPs our way
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:38.560]  this is a huge big deal why is the mainstream media not talking about that
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:41.200]  pipeline why aren't you talking about the pipeline
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:44.640]  well ma'am we we didn't censure your call right I mean you were able to call
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:49.040]  in and bring it up yes you did but you keep talking
[2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:53.120]  about Ivanka and dead baby pictures this is huge money
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:58.880]  Tillerson was put in charge of this well man hold on hold on hold on we're
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:01.440]  going to I want to hear what you have to say and I'm going to hold you over the
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:03.920]  next segment you must have missed some of the
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:07.360]  shows we have talked about the pipeline last week
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:10.720]  and we probably should talk more about it I've been covering Syria
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:14.960]  heavily for six plus years that's why Israel has been backing some of the
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:17.440]  al-Qaeda forces and that's when the big debate in Israel
[2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:21.040]  is because they don't want that pipeline being there as well it's all about
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:23.760]  economic warfare and we have discussed and you're
[2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:26.480]  absolutely right much of the reason to overthrow Syria
[2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:30.400]  is about controlling that pipeline and that deal that they have sending that up
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:34.480]  into the rest of Europe and Eastern Europe so you're absolutely right
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:38.640]  and that Qatar is a Sunni gas powerhouse who wants to become
[2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:42.640]  the main supplier of gas there in Saudi Arabia is a Sunni oil powerhouse which
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:45.520]  wants to become the major supplier of oil but Saudi Arabia
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:48.880]  Qatar gas would be pipeline through
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:52.880]  secular controlled Assad's regime and that is why the US and its fundamental
[2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:56.720]  Sunni allies in Saudis and Qataris are using al-Qaeda other jihadists to
[2:19:56.720 --> 2:19:58.880]  conquer and up the strip through the Syria to get
[2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:01.040]  control we'll talk about when we come back many books have been written
[2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:04.560]  regarding the law of attraction but what if all these books are missing the

[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:20.560]  not covering gas pipelines so i had the crew go back and look at the last time
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:24.800]  we covered it and it was sunday we posted an article in full and in full
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:28.800]  wars dot com let's pull it up for tv viewers um
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:33.280]  russia iran warned us they will respond with force of syria red line crossed
[2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:37.520]  again and the article is all about the turkish
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:41.120]  gas pipeline let's scroll down we should probably just change the headline to
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:47.680]  say syria war is all about gas pipeline because again it's the headline the
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:51.360]  article is really about that and so it's like some of people call and say
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:54.560]  you need to expose the fellow reserve as private
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:57.920]  or you never talk about a thing called bohemian grove
[2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:01.680]  when i blow it wide open so you can see globally
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:04.560]  how they've got all through the middle east these big gas pipelines to go into
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:12.880]  europe you can back back out out of iran out of all these other places
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:16.880]  throughout the middle east into europe and they don't want the russians to have
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:23.040]  theirs as you can see the iranians have their pipeline
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:26.480]  but the sari arabians others have theirs and they don't want
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:30.720]  people having access to that so yes that's a big part of this but you know
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:35.680]  everybody also said the iraq war was about oil but then the chinese and
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:38.720]  everybody got the concessions the u.s got none of it
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:42.720]  it was about control of the planet and what was bigger presence he calls the
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:46.400]  middle of the grand chessboard to control europe to control russia to
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:48.800]  control africa the middle east is the key
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:52.720]  battleground that is his strategy they don't really follow that now
[2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:56.880]  they've pivoted to asia saying that's key with the trade routes out of china and
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:00.560]  the south china sea and you see china grabbing that but both areas
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:06.320]  are are absolutely credit all right um but getting back to it instead of let's
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:09.040]  just say we're not covering it enough because callers have a tendency when
[2:26:09.040 --> 2:26:12.720]  they call something important to like say you didn't cover this let's just cover
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:16.240]  it because that changes the subject uh you know onto who's bad or whatever
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:19.680]  instead of actually covering it uh salin great point what else would you
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:22.320]  like to add to that
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:26.160]  trump is about to get us into world war three he's going to be threatening iran
[2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:29.760]  next and this this is george w bush all over again i feel
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:34.080]  sick that's all i have to say well no add some more about the pipeline i mean
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:37.680]  what should we do then educate the american people about this
[2:26:37.680 --> 2:26:43.040]  personally i'd be fine if iran ran that pipeline i am so sick of israel
[2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:46.080]  they need a balance of power in the middle east and let's
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:50.880]  iran can be that balance of power i just i've supported trump i registered as a
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:54.080]  republican for him i handed out stickers for him
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:58.160]  and he stabbed us in the back two months in and i'm one of those
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:01.440]  extremely disillusioned trump supporters you know
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:04.480]  spicer said earlier that they don't want to topple aside
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:07.520]  and that they're there to kick al-qaeda and ISIS out of the country
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:10.240]  and he says he wants countries be able to sell their oil and gas and doesn't
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:14.720]  want to block them so i don't think i i don't think
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:17.680]  it's time to make that judgment yet because he's done a lot of good things
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:21.920]  on the economy but i think it is a few marks against him
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:27.600]  uh so far but uh definitely part of ukraine is about
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:31.680]  pipelines but a lot of it's just about taking over the country and looting it
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:35.280]  for the imf and world bank and then coming in with marshal plans
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:38.720]  that are hundreds of billions more dollars to george soros
[2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:42.320]  and others in fact that's in the wiki leaks what they want is to stabilize
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:45.520]  countries and just the quagmires that it causes and they don't want other
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:50.640]  countries to do well period uh so it remains to be seen what's
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:54.960]  going to unfold from all of this uh but just imagine what hillary clinton
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:58.000]  would have already been doing right now
[2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:05.200]  the same thing that's what she would be doing
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:08.080]  so who do you think's run on the show i mean you bring up israel and certainly
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:13.280]  israel does some bad things but folks always think israel runs
[2:28:13.280 --> 2:28:16.320]  everything there's a lot of big power players i mean it's israel behind north
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:22.160]  korea and and china doing stuff i honestly don't know i just
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:25.200]  know that trump is he made an ultimatum if there's
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:28.880]  another attack he's going that's the red line well
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:32.320]  everybody has a reason to attack now everybody has a reason
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:35.920]  to set off another false that's right it's a major escalation and it lets the
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:38.000]  jihadis i grew the british ambassador now they're
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:41.760]  going to stage false flags this is clearly a false flag i i appreciate
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:44.720]  your call i've just tried to war game why
[2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:48.160]  trump would do this i talked to my sources and sure enough that's exactly
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:52.320]  what i was told and that's directly from the president to my source
[2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:57.680]  two sources and i called stone about it and he said wow that's a good sources
[2:28:57.680 --> 2:29:01.600]  this is a breaking news story on info wars dot com unusual navy patrol

[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:29.600]  so trump knows a lot of things we don't know the globalist hating for a reason
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:32.160]  he wouldn't be hurting globalists he wouldn't be
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:34.880]  creating new jobs he wouldn't have to stock market up he wouldn't be turning
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:38.720]  our coal back on if he wasn't double crossing them on a lot of fronts
[2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:42.400]  he's trying to bring in prosperity does that mean he's not a strong man

[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:08.080]  of their teeth we the people driven by social media have exposed their lives
[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:11.200]  dominated breaking stories discredited their deceptive
[2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:15.040]  asinine narratives and having righteous indignation laughed and ridiculed them
[2:30:15.040 --> 2:30:18.320]  for serving their corrupt corporate masters trying to dictate to us the
[2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:20.560]  terms of reality trump has given them no quarters
[2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:24.320]  serving their status of fraud as fake news and even upgrading it to very
[2:30:24.320 --> 2:30:26.480]  fake news there was a great chance we were going to
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:29.920]  completely dismantle the fake stream media and bring great american
[2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:33.360]  journalism back into the mainstream now the fake stream media has been
[2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:35.520]  reinvigorated it's been handed a stamp of approval
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:38.640]  and legitimacy as they cheer on our president now that he's corrected his
[2:30:38.640 --> 2:30:42.400]  ways and they've been redeemed and proven right that is why we the ones who
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:45.680]  elected him have to double down and realize even more that each of us

[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.880]  wasn't the same place that had the islamic shooters
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:42.320]  then they were covering it up who they were and for two years the FBI was
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:45.280]  trying to stop them going to terrorist training bases and coming back
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:49.840]  at least four victims have been located after a shooter walked on to the north
[2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:54.480]  park elementary school campus in san bernadino and opened fire in a possible
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:58.560]  murder suicide the shooter was also possibly down according to a report
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:02.560]  from san bernadino police department chief jared bergen
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:06.400]  who said the information was preliminary so we'll
[2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:09.760]  watch that as that unfolds
[2:34:10.080 --> 2:34:14.080]  it's an elementary school i love how these cowards go into victim disarmament
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.040]  zones it's always like california in places
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:20.160]  this happens and then there was a jihadi attack on a gay bar in florida
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:23.920]  they won't say it's a terror attack and they won't show you images of the dead
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:28.080]  kids that got killed by jihadis in london a
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:33.120]  few weeks ago or last week they're in stock home
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:35.840]  sweden because they have mass stock home syndrome
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:39.280]  but they will show you the dead kids that are gassed
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:41.680]  and just keep showing it to you and showing it to you and i want to play a
[2:34:41.680 --> 2:34:43.360]  clip before we go to our next guest and then
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:48.400]  back to your phone calls of the former british ambassador
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:52.160]  the head guy there is the british ambassador to syria
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:56.240]  what he said on the bbc where he said trump
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:02.480]  has given jihadists a thousand reasons to stage a false flag operation
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:06.560]  and and whether the whether the syrians really did it or whatever now our media
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:10.240]  saying the russians probably did it so we don't war with russia
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:13.360]  don't just see now when they already got caught doing it three years ago and four
[2:35:13.360 --> 2:35:16.160]  years ago that was official because they were so
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:22.080]  uncoordinated they would brag on videos you're loading up the mortars that would explode on them
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:25.680]  that now they're celebrating they're going to stage more stuff and blame it on
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:28.880]  Assad or whatever they want i get looking strong for the chinese president
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:33.360]  and i look i understand looking strong for the for the russians and i look
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:36.240]  having a big force there to kick out al qaeda and isis in case
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:41.440]  Assad tried to attack him but why would he do that why would Assad do that now i
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:44.960]  know dr pacenic was on last friday to give his view on it
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:48.320]  i've since talked to my white house source and then
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:52.960]  roger stone has talked to his sources that go as high as they go
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:56.640]  and basically the same things we put an article out today
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:00.560]  i said the transcript to poll Watson last night trump pushes back against neocon
[2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:06.320]  plan to invade syria and you read this article this is a transcript from my
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:09.920]  source and roger's source i'll leave it at that
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:14.320]  and the president's like no we're not gonna have a no-fly zone no we're not
[2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:17.280]  going to go take a sod out but he agreed four years ago to get rid of these
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:19.440]  chemicals he didn't do it they're there at that air base
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:23.440]  there's an air track to there that's enough for me
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:26.160]  but then what's the president thinking is going to blow those up thank god the
[2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:29.440]  russians clearly the daily mail has the photos the special forces got the
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:32.240]  russians have shown it on their own footage they hauled all of it out in
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:35.040]  the hour notice they had before the missiles hit
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:39.840]  what is trump thinking because the russians claim they bombed an al qaeda
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:43.680]  isis base and it had chemicals in it and i've got my sources in the government
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:46.640]  that say absolutely if you look at the gear people had responding
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:50.480]  it wasn't sarin or they wouldn't not be wearing masks and stuff they weren't
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:55.440]  so and that's an article trump donald trump is their national lawbreaker
[2:36:55.440 --> 2:37:01.120]  by a person using a pseudonym who's been right up there with steve pechenik so
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.440]  people say hey be on the fence or be one way or the other why are you
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:11.280]  all over the map because i don't know i'm wargaming every angle of this
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:15.360]  china to me is a 10 times bigger threat they're absolutely belligerent taken
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:18.400]  over the south china sea the north criss threatening everybody shooting
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:20.560]  missiles off i get why trump was a little strong
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:23.760]  got a big task force going in there he's done great things in the economy
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:26.560]  so i'm gonna give the benefit of the doubt but then mcmaster's talking about
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:31.760]  taking out a sod and isis simultaneously and my military sources are saying
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:35.920]  oh yeah it's a big force going in more and more trips are there 20 000
[2:37:35.920 --> 2:37:40.240]  troops in iraq and and syria already special forces you name it marines
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:43.520]  heavy artillery we're gonna go to pechenik here in just a minute
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:46.080]  former head of psychological operations state department obviously worked in
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:49.200]  other agencies and been involved in regime change
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:53.440]  let's play that clip from peter ford former british ambassador to
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:56.480]  syria because he's he's got an incontrovertible point here
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:00.800]  just on its face is true the jihadis love false flags
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:03.920]  how are we going to keep him from doing it whether this was real or not here it
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:07.600]  is and based on previous experience
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:11.360]  including iraq we can see that we cannot
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:16.880]  take at face value what the so-called intelligence experts tell us not when
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:21.440]  they have an agenda but come back to the main point but
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:26.480]  it's not going to end here and we are likely britain to be dragged into it
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:32.960]  because trump has just given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:38.640]  fake flag operations seeing how successful and how easy it is
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:42.880]  with a gullible media to provoke
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:49.440]  the west into intemperate reactions they will very likely stage an operation
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:54.000]  similar to what they did and this was documented by the united nations in
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.400]  august last year they mounted a chlorine gas attack
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:02.640]  on civilians and they tried to make it look like it was a regime
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:06.880]  operation this marked my words you you're hearing it here
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:13.040]  and it will happen and we'll get all the warmongers coming to tell us that
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:17.280]  that Assad is defying us and we must go in more heavily into Syria
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:22.800]  this will be fake flag fake flag that's a great way to explain false flags of
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:24.960]  folks so dr steve picinic steve picinic.com
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:28.960]  that's something offered also with tom clancy and more uh join zache
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.760]  medical doctor psychiatrists i won't go over his whole bio from you your angle
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:37.520]  on friday from all my research is what the president currently believes so
[2:39:37.520 --> 2:39:40.560]  you're spot on now you tie that into scowls and
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:43.360]  believing he was misled i know you've learned more now over the
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:46.000]  weekend that's why you wanted to come on to we're honored to have you on
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.280]  dr steve picinic what is the latest information you have
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:54.640]  what i'm concerned about and this is a warning to our generals
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:40:00.800]  McMaster, Mathis and others who think that they can do a regime change in
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:04.880]  Syria number one that will not be possible
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:08.480]  not with the military not with all the forces you have
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:12.160]  and not with the quality of the soldiers that we have with the generals
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:15.600]  let me be very blunt of all the people i know
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:20.560]  i have been probably the only one who's been interrogated by Bashar Assad
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:25.600]  for hours at the same time worked against hafiz Assad and at the same time
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:31.040]  had a clear understanding how strong the Bashar Assad family is and how
[2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:36.400]  entrenched they will be so any notion of a regime change
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:41.200]  through force is both absurd and criminal if it occurs
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:46.560]  there will be no reason whatsoever including chemical weapons or any other
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:51.200]  cause bella that will be espoused by either the intelligence community or the
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:55.680]  president but the presence of constant a huge
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:41:00.720]  amount of marines and special forces and thousands of regular soldiers
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:05.360]  means that we are prepositioning to go in for a war
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:10.960]  maybe against isis but remember isis and al-qaeda was created by us by the cia
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:15.680]  by our military intelligence so to say that we're going to attack a terrorist
[2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:19.520]  group which we created means we're attacking ourselves
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:24.640]  the same issues right here in syria the issue of syria and bashar asad has no
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:28.400]  national security interests whatsoever to america
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:32.960]  what bashar asad has done to his people remains just people the russians have
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:36.320]  handled it hezbollah has been involved turkey has
[2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:39.200]  been involved the israelis have been involved
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:44.800]  let me tell you several things number one we have not won a war including world
[2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:47.680]  war two let me make it very clear to mcmaster
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:52.960]  who's talking about dereliction of duty this will be an incredible dereliction
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:59.200]  of duty if we go into war either in iraq or we can go into syria why
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:04.560]  because mcmaster knows very well we are not capable of executing an effective
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:08.160]  strike we have never won a war even world war two
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:14.160]  was primarily won in 1942 and 43 by the russians at stalingrad i teach that at
[2:42:14.160 --> 2:42:17.520]  fork mcnair i have told every general we have lost
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:22.000]  vietnam we lost korea we lost iraq we lost afghanistan
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:28.080]  so on and so forth mcmaster will come forth and be tried for criminal activity
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:31.840]  as will mathes because there is no reason
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:37.840]  to put our men and women in harm's way for oil pipelines or whatever nonsense
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:42.640]  that this military industrial complex thinks that we need to do in order to get
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:45.840]  into the middle east we have no interest in the middle east
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:50.480]  if anything the syops that was created with president ji
[2:42:50.480 --> 2:42:55.200]  ji pang from china was an excellent syops it means we're drawing to the
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:59.040]  asia peninsula that's fine we preposition
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:03.440]  for north korea but it does not mean we go either into north korea
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:07.120]  or china or syria there is no cause for war
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:13.440]  on either flank my concern is that again we're going through the nonsense of
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:17.600]  the neocons i think that uh david night had made a point
[2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:21.840]  yesterday my point was simply that the syops that was done at
[2:43:21.840 --> 2:43:25.680]  trump's hotel was very effective but if this goes
[2:43:25.680 --> 2:43:30.080]  any step further this is a warning to our generals to our president
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:34.320]  and to anyone involved once again we will react
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:40.080]  quite vociferously and strongly this is grounds for all types of legal action
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.600]  against the president and a voting that will create a
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:46.000]  desert okay but let me stop you let me stop you dr pochennick
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.360]  because we go from friday you're saying i get the syop
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:53.040]  uh you can't prove either way where the attack came from the jets did come from
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:56.400]  there there are chemicals in the base uh from the president's perspective because
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:58.800]  i've learned something over the weekend it's dead on what you said
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:01.520]  the president's like we have an agreement going back four years with the
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:05.920]  russians and Assad to start moving out once we defeat alakata and ices
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:08.560]  we can't say one way or the other they didn't get the chemicals out of there
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:11.680]  we have the intelligence so we're going to blow them up in place which i still
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:13.840]  have questions about what are they going to do if they actually hit them
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:17.360]  thank god the russians pulled them out and then trump is saying no we're not
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:21.040]  doing no flies no we're not taking a side out you saw spicer come out today
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:25.440]  and say everything that was in our article this morning he says it word
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:29.040]  for word uh one hour ago because it came
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:31.920]  from the president of course the media has hey days with this i'm just going to
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:34.800]  stop right there but i get thank you letters you name it from high level in
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:38.080]  the white house we get phone calls i check stuff
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:42.480]  then i call stone uh who gets it calls quite a bit let's just say quite a bit
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:46.720]  i mean you don't want me to talk about it let's say a lot and so it's all dead on
[2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:50.480]  information and the president's like no but i'm not going to let anybody use
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:53.520]  these chemicals i'm gonna let people know if you do use it i'm coming after you
[2:44:53.520 --> 2:44:57.440]  and it's a message and and there's a deal in place and then folks ask the
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:00.960]  president well why are the troops getting mass and he goes i can't talk about
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:03.200]  it now this is word for word from the president
[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:06.960]  so our article is key it's a white house source trump
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:10.800]  is pushing back against neocon plan to invade syria and then you see mcmaster
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:14.720]  and others on fox news constantly like he's the new
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:19.200]  press secretary saying different things than what trump and his
[2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:23.760]  and spicer saying and spicer is taking notes directly from the president
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.120]  and putting them out on air i mean again you listen to spicer it's word
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:31.120]  for word what's in our article that came out hours before
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:34.720]  uh and so roger uh stone is calling he's got some
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:38.480]  breaking news there's a lot of uh breaking news taking place here
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:43.680]  uh as things unfold so again taking that intel what do you make of that
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:47.040]  and then expanding on it i guess you've got some really good sources obviously
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:50.240]  as well because your word for word saying what we're getting
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:55.120]  let me tell you this i i i understand what you're saying i understand what
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:45:58.640]  roger may be saying what i'm telling you is that i know
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:02.640]  for a fact the people i know in the military
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:06.800]  are increasing their force structures to the degree
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:11.600]  that there is no strategy whatsoever in effect i wrote this
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:14.800]  to my people in the intelligence community and elsewhere
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:19.280]  if you have no strategy and regime change it's not a strategy
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:24.640]  do not go into war increasing well sure if anything was ever a quagmire it's
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:27.440]  Syria with all these different forces so why is
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:31.760]  McMaster saying things different than the president and his press secretary
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:35.920]  because it's an old technique you have one person saying one thing putting
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:38.560]  pressure on then you have the president denying it
[2:46:38.560 --> 2:46:42.640]  what you're doing is trying to confuse the public media or
[2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:48.480]  otherwise said you're trying to create a kind of disturbance for Assad
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:51.760]  who's very smart he's much smarter than our own people
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:55.520]  he's an ophthalmologist he's board certified he's been in power for over
[2:46:55.520 --> 2:46:58.720]  30 years he understands what the reality is
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:02.640]  but for the american public which is being told two different things at the
[2:47:02.640 --> 2:47:05.680]  same time you have to go back to the bush administration
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:09.200]  which said we're not going into war you have to go back to the obama
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:12.000]  administration the clinton administration everyone said
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:16.160]  so it's the very same neocon crap so what does the president need to do
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:20.000]  the president needs to understand that if he goes to war
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:24.080]  that's his problem and we will have a major blowback
[2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:27.920]  domestically the american people do not want to have
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:31.440]  a war we do not want to send our kids into battle
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:34.560]  our military is not prepared for this kind of war
[2:47:34.560 --> 2:47:38.640]  i've been in the syrian desert during the summer it's unbearable
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:44.960]  it is huge it is the homes and hamas is filled with sunnis
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:49.680]  our generals have no idea of what they're doing and in fact if this is about
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:53.520]  pipeline wars or it's about the military industrial complex
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:57.200]  which it comes back again and again because we have no national security
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.280]  interests in syria iraq or iraq okay so how did you change since
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:03.840]  friday where you thought good struggle genius you said
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:07.840]  syop friday a successful syop now you're saying you're really concerned
[2:48:07.840 --> 2:48:14.160]  well because going from one syop to china was the appropriate thing to do
[2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:17.920]  but once i hear and i understand that there are more
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:23.360]  forces in syria over the weekend there was artillery placed in there and in
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:27.680]  fact they are creating in the white house what we call a dichotomy
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:31.520]  or two messages that's totally different from what happened on friday
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:36.160]  friday nothing was said nothing was said in terms of the syops it was
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:41.200]  elegant it was effective and we sent out a fleet as you said to the south
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:44.880]  china sea whether we attack north korea i think
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:48.240]  that's not very bright but at least we have a presence there
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:51.840]  but once we have a statement by mcmaster
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:56.480]  and at the same time trump denying it so you have a purposeful confusion
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:02.160]  then i am saying very clearly do not go to war we've been through this scenario
[2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:05.120]  repeatedly sure so what are the neocons thinking
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.440]  why do they want to go in war in syria much worse than iraq much worse than
[2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:12.880]  libya i mean what are they
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:16.320]  all of these neocons have never served our government they've never been in
[2:49:16.320 --> 2:49:19.120]  war they have belonged to the military industrial
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:22.320]  so why is mcmaster going along with it he's the national security advisor now
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:25.760]  not not john mccain because mcmaster is going to
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:30.160]  follow the orders of the president in short he may be committing the very
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:33.280]  sense he wrote about dereliction of duty
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:36.640]  there was dereliction of duty in vietnam when he wrote about it and
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:40.560]  westmoreland and other generals followed through knowing fully well we had
[2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:43.600]  never had a strategy we had an effective tactic
[2:49:43.600 --> 2:49:47.280]  nor were our soldiers prepared mcmaster knows the same
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:51.760]  issues here he knows we're not prepared we're not effective we have a one to one
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:54.720]  what about the patreus connection to mcmaster
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:50:00.240]  but patreus brought in mcmaster and and put him back as a lieutenant general
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:04.640]  because mcmaster was was basically isolated because of the book he
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:08.480]  wrote on dereliction of duty but i'm not a fan of patreus as i said
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:13.040]  repeatedly patreus went in he self-promoted himself he's never
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:15.680]  really been other than south well sure the
[2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:19.440]  reason we haven't won a war since world war two is we're in civil wars
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:23.360]  no one ever wins a civil war i mean it's like sticking your hand in a beehive
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:27.040]  there's no reason to do it well yeah but let me be very clear
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:31.040]  with all due respect including my own father we did not win the world war two
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:35.760]  what we did was to defeat the japanese in order to release a hundred thousand
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:39.280]  troops russian troops to go back into fighting the
[2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:43.680]  stolen ground and on the western front by the time we went into europe and
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:46.720]  germany the soviets were on the alba river
[2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:50.400]  so that has to be made very clear to a partial set in well sure
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:53.040]  when it comes to casualties of russians lost 20 million people in the red
[2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:55.280]  world what to yeah yeah we didn't even lose a million
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:50:58.320]  hold on we'll be right back let's talk about that straight ahead talk about

[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:01.680]  just briefly on china how do you think the meeting went
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.680]  what's the info you've got on that the big task force group going up
[2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:08.640]  you know there by northern china and the south china sea
[2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:13.200]  by japan by the korean peninsula where do you expect all that to go
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:16.000]  you got lindsay graham saying everybody about it better watch trump you know he's
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:20.880]  a crazy guy as if that's some positive thing plus i don't
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:24.800]  think it's true it just shows how crazy the neocons are wanting to quote
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:28.320]  scare the world well that's a good question actually your
[2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:32.560]  assistant nico just gave me an interesting point
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:36.160]  first of all the meeting went very well what trump did and
[2:56:36.160 --> 2:56:40.880]  and McMasters did was a brilliant scyops operation focusing to syria
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:44.160]  and then shifting really to the south china sea
[2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:48.400]  the real problem now and this is where the regime change comes in
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:51.760]  and this is where america has to watch itself
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:58.240]  what's happened now nico informed me that uh 150 000 chinese soldiers went on
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:02.320]  the north korean china border to me that's very credible and i'll
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:07.200]  tell you why for over 30 years i was held back on any regime change in
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:10.880]  north korea because for me it wasn't very hard to bring down
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:15.280]  north korea there are many simple ways to do it without going to war
[2:57:15.280 --> 2:57:19.440]  however one of the things that i had been warned about repeatedly
[2:57:19.440 --> 2:57:24.080]  was that china could not tolerate and would not tolerate
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:31.040]  the ingress of thousands of millions of north koreans into china that would
[2:57:31.040 --> 2:57:36.080]  eventually destabilize china so what we have going on right now is the
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:39.360]  potential destabilization of north korea
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:43.120]  and china and china knows that because president zizi pong
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:47.120]  was humiliated and correctly so and he has no idea
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:51.120]  of what trump can or cannot do but he does understand that trump
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:56.000]  has the willpower to use force at the same time we're looking at syria
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:00.640]  where we're building up troops one could be the distraction from the other or
[2:58:00.640 --> 2:58:04.480]  at the same time we would have two wars going on at the same time
[2:58:04.480 --> 2:58:07.920]  that's up to our president and that's up to our generals
[2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:12.960]  i warn them about wars taking down regimes do not does not mean you have to
[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:17.360]  have a war in the case of china this has already been quite
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:22.000]  significant for trump to have said to gg pong look i just
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:26.960]  launched 59 missiles i want to make sure you understand that
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:32.000]  g pong understands it but at the same time the chinese have a hold over
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:36.560]  jarrett kushner and his buildings and six exist fifth avenue let's talk
[2:58:36.560 --> 2:58:40.080]  about that when we come right back let's talk about ways foreign powers can
[2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:42.720]  influence the president and we're not talking about russia from
[2:58:42.720 --> 2:58:46.160]  my info it's the chinese that are manipulating us big time
[2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:50.000]  we're back in 70 seconds with our guest dr steve cenic
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.920]  we're selling a product dna force that is the very best
[2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:58.240]  nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to

[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:05.280]  working on for a long time alex because i think it's very very important
[2:59:05.280 --> 2:59:10.240]  what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of
[2:59:10.240 --> 2:59:13.440]  our telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the
[2:59:13.440 --> 2:59:16.400]  end of our chromosomes when it runs out you start dying
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:20.640]  we chose the pqq because it has over 175 different clinical trials

[2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:28.640]  antioxidant it works to repair nerve growth factor

[2:59:51.040 --> 3:00:03.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:07.360]  coming to you from the former united states of america
[3:00:07.360 --> 3:00:13.840]  deep in the heart of texas it's alex jones i hear people talking about the
[3:00:13.840 --> 3:00:19.040]  way i saw photos over the weekend of the
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:23.280]  yalu river i guess in the north there of china bordering north korea
[3:00:23.280 --> 3:00:27.840]  taken by a photographer i can even got a screenshot on my phone here
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:32.720]  and it's big skyscrapers on one side looks like manhattan
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:37.200]  and then on the other side it's just grass and villages
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:40.560]  to show how deindustrialized that country as most people walk
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:44.640]  most their highway crews carry their equipment it's amazing so in closing
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:47.840]  with dr. steve pacinic before day but night comes into the studio and takes
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:51.840]  over here in just a moment yeah there's a similar photo to what i saw even
[3:00:51.840 --> 3:00:54.240]  more striking before we go any further here
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:57.680]  we're bringing up jared kushner i don't want to make him the target
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:01.680]  but so many times he himself admits he's a democrat the democrats kind of
[3:01:01.680 --> 3:01:05.760]  celebrate him and uh i'm told that's a
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:09.440]  distraction it's really mic master running wild inside the white house
[3:01:09.440 --> 3:01:11.840]  but what we're gonna say about jared kushner
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:16.400]  well i don't know jared kushner i've seen the best of him he comes out of the
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:20.160]  family that was involved in real estate he's involved in real estate his father
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:24.320]  was indicted and convicted the problem is they have some major
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:27.840]  properties in manhattan one in particular which i know very well as
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:33.680]  six six six fifth avenue billions of dollars have been foreclosed upon on the
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:37.600]  kushner family and they can't refinance that property
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:41.440]  all it takes in the business of real estate believe me i know this very well
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:45.280]  is for one major property to go under from billions of dollars
[3:01:45.280 --> 3:01:51.120]  and then it starts to be a domino effect kushner is a highly vulnerable target
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:54.080]  for the chinese for the russians and any foreign
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:59.440]  individuals because their family was doing private business with the chinese
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:03.280]  it's the chinese who came in and told them we'll take care of you
[3:02:03.280 --> 3:02:07.040]  now he can resign if he wants he can do whatever he wants
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:11.280]  nevertheless from a counterintelligence point of view kushner
[3:02:11.280 --> 3:02:15.680]  and many of those civilians there are really prime targets for foreign
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:19.440]  governments in terms of manipulation and leveraging
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:23.360]  and if i were jared kushner i would leave the white house and
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:27.600]  and do the best thing he could just say to america thank you very much
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:32.880]  and go back to his real estate business otherwise he becomes a liability
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:36.640]  and that liability as a civilian it doesn't matter whether there's a son-in-law
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:41.120]  or not becomes a great liability by the way let me stop you
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:44.800]  the even the hill newspaper is reporting on this this is bombshell
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:48.320]  from just eight days ago but i know you have amazing sources
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:51.280]  is this from the news or from your sources because you're saying
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:54.880]  that they did penetrate him and that he should just step down now
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:58.240]  you made a lot of statements like that about hillary that that came true so
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:03:01.040]  you're not making this up are you getting this from the news
[3:03:01.040 --> 3:03:06.000]  or from your sources i don't even have to go to my sources this is typical
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.920]  counterintelligence techniques what i use is really just simple
[3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:14.320]  intelligence counterintelligence thinking this is not out of the box thinking
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:17.280]  this is not the kind of thing that we had with the syops
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:20.960]  at lardo where i thought really this was quite unusual
[3:03:20.960 --> 3:03:25.280]  in this case kushner is a highly valuable target
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:29.360]  for the chinese for the russians for the malaysians for the arabs
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:32.480]  in the same way that many of the other civilians are
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:37.040]  in the republican party they know it i know what the intelligence community
[3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:41.040]  knows that so i don't need a source to that it's just that
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:44.160]  in if he were a true if he were a good american
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:47.680]  he doesn't have to serve our country in the military which none of the neocons
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:50.240]  have i don't care whether it's democrat or republican
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:53.600]  i would resign if i were he and i would say look
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:57.280]  thank you for the opportunity i appreciate it and and put his efforts
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:02.160]  on 666 if they have but to his credit it has been reported that he
[3:04:02.160 --> 3:04:06.080]  didn't go along with it and they pulled out or is that just a cover story
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:09.920]  that's a cover story in the business where your father has been convicted and
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:13.680]  been in jail and and the prosecutors your own partner
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:18.960]  christy none of this washes so is trump elevating him to actually protect him
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:22.560]  and cover him because this sounds like a very bad judgment by trump
[3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:25.360]  knowing this is all going on including him in the white house
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:29.760]  well he wants to ask me why did trump keep his whole family with it and i
[3:04:29.760 --> 3:04:35.120]  simply said as a psychiatrist or as an american he needs it for security his
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:39.840]  own sense of security if that's the case then he has to
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:43.760]  rethink again why he has his own family around them
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:49.360]  with so many conflicts of interest i can't tell him what to do i can simply
[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:54.160]  say that it's time for him to focus on the infrastructure stay away from the
[3:04:54.160 --> 3:04:57.600]  wars decrease the size of our governor absolutely daughter
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:01.040]  pacific powerful david night's coming in when we the people
[3:05:01.040 --> 3:05:04.640]  elected donald trump we exhale in relief believing that we're going to
[3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:08.160]  crush isis with the help of russia and that we've averted a nuclear war
[3:05:08.160 --> 3:05:11.440]  in which we would have been already had hillary won the sense of relief has
[3:05:11.440 --> 3:05:14.800]  just been flipped on its head it appears we're in the brink of nuclear war
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:18.080]  and russia is made out to be our enemy once again explanations for this
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:21.520]  drastic turn of events range from this being part of maccha valley tactics
[3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:25.120]  meant to in fact prevent a world war with russia being led in on the game
[3:05:25.120 --> 3:05:28.800]  to trump being hopelessly surrounded by deep state students who still hate him
[3:05:28.800 --> 3:05:31.600]  despite of all the newly founded love they're professing for him and whose
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:35.440]  goal is to impeach and replace him with a bloodthirsty war hungry zealot the
[3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:38.800]  likes of which we've never seen either way the military industrial complex
[3:05:38.800 --> 3:05:42.000]  wins and that is not why we elected trump this movement of making america
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:45.840]  great again is bigger than trump trump is not our leader he's our follower
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:49.600]  and we must lead him in our dogged determination to ensure our children
[3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:51.680]  have a future so don't give up on trump
[3:05:51.680 --> 3:05:54.720]  thus allowing him to become just another casualty of the deep state
[3:05:54.720 --> 3:05:57.840]  after all no one said taking america back is going to be easy

[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:27.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night
[3:08:27.040 --> 3:08:30.240]  and it's been a busy weekend actually there's a lot of research
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:34.880]  part of my research was sitting in dunkin donuts watching cnl with my wife and
[3:08:34.880 --> 3:08:40.480]  as we saw the closed captioning of an interview that uh ferid zikaria had with
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:45.360]  general patrice who this interview should have been conducted from jail but
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:48.720]  of course he's not in jail for violating national security no he is a
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:52.480]  pundit a frequent bill de berg globalist attendee
[3:08:52.480 --> 3:08:56.880]  and as he was on cnn talking to ferid we're watching the closed captioning he
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:00.960]  said kind of a boilerplate thing oh this sends a message to friend and foe
[3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:05.760]  alike except that there was a fruity and slip on the closed captioning and it
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:12.960]  came out when he said friend and foe f a u x
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:16.800]  i think that says a lot and you know we look at these kinds of wag the dog
[3:09:16.800 --> 3:09:19.520]  scenarios a lot of people are saying well you know what what is this about why
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:22.960]  why did we do such a quick 180 we're going to take a look at
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:26.640]  the changing of the guard in the white house in the cabinet
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:29.760]  and i also want to take some of these calls too so don't hang out folks we're
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:32.560]  going to try to get to you here i thought it was also interesting because
[3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:36.960]  we went back and we watched wag the dog last night with a family
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:41.280]  the movie after watching the news for the last several days
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:44.000]  and it was kind of interesting when clinton did a wag the dog attack do
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:48.240]  you realize that he used cruise missiles tomahawk cruise missiles the same
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:51.120]  cruise missiles almost the same number of cruise missiles
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:54.560]  and after they released their report on monica lawinsky
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.720]  he released to distract everybody and it was about a month or two after the
[3:09:58.720 --> 3:10:02.640]  movie had come out he released 75 tomahawk cruise missiles attacking
[3:10:02.640 --> 3:10:05.840]  two different countries afghanistan and sudan interestingly enough
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:08.880]  see how see how i want you to think about how this
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:12.400]  script okay because this is like they said in wag the dog
[3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:16.480]  it's a pageant it's a pageant and we just keep recycling this script
[3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:22.320]  over and over again just like it's uh rocky 27 that we're going to see
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:26.400]  i've seen this movie so have you we've seen it over and over again quite
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:30.160]  frankly i am sick to death of this crap sick to death
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:33.440]  you really think we're that stupid yeah i guess we really are i guess we really
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:36.400]  are because you keep getting away with it don't you one of the
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:39.600]  places that clinton attacked and his wag the dog scenario was
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:44.000]  a pharmaceutical building factory in sudan
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.160]  said it was a chemical weapons manufacturing source nothing changes
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:52.000]  it just moved the details around a little bit
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:54.720]  absolutely amazing then patrice said something else i thought was very
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:10:58.480]  interesting on cnn he said and i tweeted this out
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:00.880]  you can see this tweet if you want to get the quote and you can go back and
[3:11:00.880 --> 3:11:03.680]  take a look at the interview too we need to pull the interview out of that
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:08.640]  he said america first can mean that america leads the rules based
[3:11:08.640 --> 3:11:14.400]  international order america will lead the rules based international order and
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:18.080]  who's going to make the rules he and his bill de berg globalist friends
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:22.720]  goldman sacks the rest of these people same globalism different bank
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:26.320]  we had obama tied in with city bank and now we've got goldman sacks running the
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:30.480]  show this quickly within a trump administration
[3:11:30.480 --> 3:11:34.080]  absolutely amazing to me and of course there's this article that was on daily
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:38.480]  mail from john r bradley he said there's a terrifying sense of deja vu
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:42.240]  as the generals take over the white house he said for those of us who covered
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:45.520]  the build up to the u.s led invasion of iraq in 2003 there was a terrifying
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:50.960]  sense of deja vu as another quote unquote coalition of the willing
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:54.400]  gears up to launch an attack in the middle east we hope that's not going to
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:58.560]  happen we had the article at info wars dot com sources inside saying that
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:02.000]  trump is going to push back against the neocon plan to invade syria i hope that
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:04.560]  really does happen you know one of the things my parents told me when i was
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:09.040]  going up and i've told my children as well be careful who you hang out with
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:14.640]  be careful who you run with because the people that you pick as your friends
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:18.160]  can change you and even if they don't change you
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:22.160]  even if you don't get involved in some criminal action
[3:12:22.160 --> 3:12:26.400]  if you're hanging out with these people and they rob a bank or they get busted
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:29.120]  for possession of drugs while you're in the car with them you may be going down
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:32.640]  with them too so be careful about who you pick for your
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:35.280]  friends that was the thing that concerned me so much about
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:39.200]  donald trump's administration he's putting all these globalist rats
[3:12:39.200 --> 3:12:42.160]  in his kitchen cabinet don't be surprised they eat all the cheese and leave
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:46.080]  nothing behind but rat crap and that's what we're starting to see here i want
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:48.800]  to take a look at some of the people that have happened at some of the things
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:53.040]  that are happening here of course we have axios talking about how trump is
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:57.200]  doing a centrist push previsus says yes yes i will
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:13:00.240]  you know do whatever you tell me the question is will ban and go along with
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:04.640]  it and here's the deal they say here's the changing culture here are the two
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:08.640]  crucial words to understand the outgoing style incoming style
[3:13:08.640 --> 3:13:13.120]  okay they're not two words but two phrases in the past
[3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:17.360]  they talked about nationalist versus globalist but now they're talking about
[3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:22.720]  combat versus collaboration so are you going to collaborate
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.720]  with the globalists or are you going to fight them if you're going to fight the
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:30.640]  globalist you're going to be pushed out by the globalists
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:34.240]  that's what i'm concerned about and we can see what's going on all the news
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:39.280]  saying that you know banna may be pushed out that the stock of
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:43.360]  gary kohn literally the stock of this is a guy who got what 285 million dollars
[3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:46.480]  or something like that from goldman stacks but uh his uh
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:52.000]  stacks there's a protean slip for you goldman stacks golden stacks um now
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:56.800]  this is a guy who got 200 i think it's 280 billion dollars that they
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:00.400]  accelerated his payoff so that he could get into the trump white house
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:04.320]  become the economic advisor the lead economic advisor
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:07.440]  he's now being tipped as someone who
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:12.160]  is uh maybe going to be the next chief of staff but of course
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:16.320]  in the national security council we have seen first
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:20.160]  general flan pushed out then steve bannon pushed out
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:23.600]  now we see katie mcfarland pushed out who was a protege
[3:14:23.600 --> 3:14:27.120]  of flan mic master did not want her there he's restructuring this
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:30.320]  but guess who's going to be saying dina powell
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:34.800]  of goldman sacks now every time the mainstream media refers to dina powell
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:39.600]  they do not use her middle name habib dina habib powell
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:44.000]  brought here at the age of four years old by her egyptian parents
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:47.680]  uh someone who worked a long time in the bush administration
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.960]  dina habib powell as i point out is climbing up the white house ranks at an
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:56.320]  impressive pace she has been as they point out in the
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:15:01.760]  news uh evanke trumps go to on women's issues so she was
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:06.240]  the advisor for evanke on women's issues but now she's going to advise
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:10.480]  evanke's dad on national security that's the way this is going why because
[3:15:10.480 --> 3:15:14.000]  mcmasters wants her there and they pointed out she's an egyptian immigrant
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:18.080]  fluent and arabic she reportedly was helping already
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:21.920]  with president trump to navigate geopolitics telling him exactly what he
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:24.320]  needs to know what mcmasters wants him to know see
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:27.600]  if you put these guys in as your advisors of course they're going to give you
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:31.040]  a limited number of options just like uh the washington post or the new york
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:35.840]  times or cbs or abc they're going to pick which stories you the audience here
[3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:38.640]  and they're not going to tell you anything about certain stories well
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:41.920]  guess what mcmasters and these other people they're with him
[3:15:41.920 --> 3:15:46.240]  betray us they're not going to give donald trump certain options
[3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:49.760]  when they do present options or even if they do present an option that maybe
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:54.000]  appears to be on the other side they can very easily skew those options if
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:56.640]  he's going to be relying on their expertise and of course he's picked
[3:15:56.640 --> 3:15:59.760]  them because he believes that they are experts so he's going to
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:03.040]  be susceptible to that and of course we've got this woman
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:07.920]  diana habib pal helping donald trump to navigate geopolitics and political
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:10.640]  reports she was seated at the head of the table
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:14.320]  during his lunch with saudi arabia's deputy crown prince
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:21.200]  last week okay now this was um back in july washington post said
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:26.320]  um when ivanka was talking at the convention they said who exactly was
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:29.520]  she endorsing because they looked at all the women's issues that she was
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:33.120]  talking about and they said well these things already sound good to us at the
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:37.120]  washington post the problem is that donald trump himself
[3:16:37.120 --> 3:16:40.800]  never outlined any of those proposals not even roughly
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:45.440]  the candidate who did was hillary clinton and of course who was advising
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:48.800]  ivanka on women's issues that would have been the same woman
[3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:54.400]  diana habib pal who is now advising donald trump on geopolitics
[3:16:54.400 --> 3:16:57.840]  and then we see these other issues from january
[3:16:57.840 --> 3:17:01.600]  we see that uh they're talking about the incoming first daughter has been
[3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:06.720]  leaning on diana habib pal a goldman partner as she fine tunes her
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:11.680]  powerful new role this is where this is all headed folks but i want to talk
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:17.040]  about the difference between generals you know we talked about how the this
[3:17:17.040 --> 3:17:20.800]  looks like a deja vu of generals taking over
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:26.560]  uh remember that it was in 2015 that we had general flan very honestly coming
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:30.320]  forward it's why we were so excited to see him become
[3:17:30.320 --> 3:17:34.320]  donald trump's advisor in the campaign one of the reasons that we supported
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:38.720]  donald trump was because we liked the candor and the honesty
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:42.400]  of general flan and they got him out of there pretty quickly didn't they
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:47.040]  pretty quickly they used him to get donald trump elected
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:50.640]  but they did not want to leave him in that administration now we see why we
[3:17:50.640 --> 3:17:54.800]  said at the time watch they're going to do the same thing they did in syria and
[3:17:54.800 --> 3:17:58.400]  they have now and this is what general flan said in
[3:17:58.400 --> 3:18:02.480]  august of 2015 he had an interview with al jazeera and
[3:18:02.480 --> 3:18:06.000]  they said well we think the u.s administration has turned a blind eye
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:11.600]  to analysis of what's really going on in syria he said no uh i think that uh
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:14.960]  they weren't listening to my agency on purpose he said i think it was a
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:20.080]  decision i think it was a willful decision and this was a classified
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:25.200]  di a report that was presented in august of 2012 they got out and it said
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:28.880]  quote the syloffists the muslim brotherhood
[3:18:28.880 --> 3:18:34.160]  and al qaeda are the major forces driving the insurgency in syria it is now
[3:18:34.160 --> 3:18:39.520]  being supported by the west by the gulf states and by turkey who was at the
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:43.760]  center of all this false flag gas attack that we saw last week
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:47.120]  it was turkey immediately in there saying this was saring gas so therefore it
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:51.840]  had to come from from syria it was a state
[3:18:51.840 --> 3:18:55.200]  developed it wasn't something that was done in a homebrew lab or even brought
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:58.480]  in by another country to give to these people no no this had to be the same
[3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:02.320]  thing we heard four years ago same thing that at the time
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:06.560]  donald trump pushed back against it was turkey that was there and it was
[3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:11.520]  turkey that was pushing this narrative the report that says
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:15.280]  at in 2012 warned of dire consequences of this exact
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:19.440]  type of scenario because it would allow al qaeda to regain its positions in iraq
[3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:24.240]  and to unify the jihadist sunni forces in iraq syria and the rest of the sunnis
[3:19:24.240 --> 3:19:27.600]  in the air world against all other muslim minorities that they
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:31.520]  considered to be dissenters all right so fast forward
[3:19:31.520 --> 3:19:37.440]  to this january when mcmasters comes into the administration
[3:19:37.440 --> 3:19:41.280]  his very first meeting as reported by the new york times he told the staff of

[3:25:53.280 --> 3:25:56.720]  the special for our newsletter subscribers is bill the the bill
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:01.200]  clinton rape whistle 75 off retail yes you too
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:04.720]  can become a whistleblower and you can blow the whistle
[3:26:04.720 --> 3:26:08.560]  on bill clinton his rapes and his wag the dog
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:13.040]  activities where he launched 75 tomahawk cruise missiles to cover up what was
[3:26:13.040 --> 3:26:16.320]  going on with Monica Lewinsky but of course the biggest cover-up wasn't it
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:21.120]  the biggest cover-up of that whole thing was the fact that we had ken star
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:25.280]  move it away from rape and sexual assault to a consensual
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:28.800]  affair that bill clinton committed perjury about that was the biggest
[3:26:28.800 --> 3:26:32.240]  cover-up of that whole thing but of course he was very successful with them
[3:26:32.240 --> 3:26:35.760]  to use the cruise missiles to distract our attention i was
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:39.760]  talking about the difference between michael flan and
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:43.840]  hr McMasters flin telling us exactly what was going on
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:47.600]  in syria very candid very honest and you know
[3:26:47.600 --> 3:26:50.560]  one of the things that i've talked about before is this quote from patrick
[3:26:50.560 --> 3:26:54.720]  henry the liberties of a people never were
[3:26:54.720 --> 3:26:59.040]  nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:03.280]  are concealed from them that's why candor honesty
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:07.520]  that we saw from michael flin was so important when he told us
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:11.280]  what was going on in syria so what did mic master do when he came in well his
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:14.240]  very first meeting was to say we're not going to use the term
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:18.240]  radical islamic terrorism he says this is not helpful
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:22.560]  terrorists are un islamic it has nothing to do with islam
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:26.240]  and within a day of being appointed this is new york times talking about this
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:30.240]  within a day of his appointment he was popping into offices introducing
[3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:33.680]  himself to the professional staff members who are
[3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:38.240]  holdovers from the obama administration and these people were
[3:27:38.240 --> 3:27:42.080]  upset because they had been shut out of the policy making process
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:45.280]  well yeah that's why we had an election
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:49.280]  that's why we had nationalist coming in that we're going to put america first
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:53.840]  we didn't want obama policy in syria and foreign policy
[3:27:53.840 --> 3:27:57.040]  so yeah they were being shut out but of course he comes in but don't worry
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:00.320]  we're going to bring you in and they say in his language
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:03.760]  general mic master is closer to the positions of former presidents obama
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:08.480]  and george w bush absolutely so don't worry we're going to keep you in
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:11.200]  you're going to be in the loop you're going to be making policy and now we
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:14.560]  see that they have the same policy that we did with the obama
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:18.560]  administration but it always gets through when you've got a republican
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:22.960]  who is doing this kind of military adventurism
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:27.040]  now i want to go back to an interview that was a little over a year ago
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:31.280]  about a year before general fenn was removed from the national security
[3:28:31.280 --> 3:28:38.000]  council he was interviewed and this was with al jazeera
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:40.960]  and this is what he had to say he said i've been at war with islam
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:45.120]  or with a component of islam for the last decade
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:48.720]  now this person that was interviewing him for al jazeera
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:52.400]  medi hassan was upset about that he didn't like that he said aren't you
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:55.840]  engaging in the kind of stuff that isle says isn't that
[3:28:55.840 --> 3:28:59.120]  what they want to hear and blaming all of islam
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:02.560]  michael fenn said let's not kid ourselves about what it is that we are
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:06.320]  facing we are facing and the islamic world is also
[3:29:06.320 --> 3:29:10.560]  facing an element within the religion of islam that is going to change it one
[3:29:10.560 --> 3:29:13.120]  way or the other in my belief change it for the bad
[3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.880]  for the negative if something is not done but they've grabbed hold of this
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:20.000]  religion they're using it in a very very dangerous way
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:24.160]  and if the religious component the somewhat pro-moderate component of islam
[3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:27.520]  actually stands up to it i believe it can be defeated see what he had said
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:31.120]  beginning that they didn't want to hear was a component of islam that he was
[3:29:31.120 --> 3:29:35.120]  talking about but he unapologetically talks about this they said isn't this
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:39.600]  unhelpful language he says no i have had arguments that i've set in and he says
[3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:44.000]  it's a religion of a billion people and he says that i'm not talking about that
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:47.520]  and he breaks this down he does not back down stay with us we'll be right back
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:53.040]  we'll be taking your calls we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:53.040 --> 3:30:00.080]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:00.080 --> 3:30:03.600]  the fake stream media has been in panic mode hanging on to dear life by the
[3:30:03.600 --> 3:30:07.600]  skin of their teeth we the people driven by social media have exposed their
[3:30:07.600 --> 3:30:11.120]  lies dominated breaking stories discredited their deceptive
[3:30:11.120 --> 3:30:14.320]  asinine narratives and have been righteous indignation laughed and
[3:30:14.320 --> 3:30:17.920]  ridiculed them for serving their corrupt corporate masters trying to dictate to
[3:30:17.920 --> 3:30:20.480]  us the terms of reality trump has given them no quarters
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:24.240]  starting their status of fraud as fake news and even upgrading it to very
[3:30:24.240 --> 3:30:27.600]  fake news there was a great chance we were going to completely dismantle the
[3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:30.960]  fake stream media and bring great american journalism back into the
[3:30:30.960 --> 3:30:34.080]  mainstream now the fake stream media has been reinvigorated
[3:30:34.080 --> 3:30:37.040]  it's been handed a stamp of approval and legitimacy as they cheer on our
[3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:39.920]  president now that he's corrected his ways and they've been redeemed and
[3:30:39.920 --> 3:30:42.960]  proven right that is why we the ones who elect in him
[3:30:42.960 --> 3:30:46.320]  have to double down and realize even more that each of us matters in this fight
[3:30:46.320 --> 3:30:50.080]  for our president in our future we're standing up for him by fighting harder
[3:30:50.080 --> 3:30:54.080]  when they censor us by sharing links that expose and attack the deep state
[3:30:54.080 --> 3:30:57.920]  operatives within his administration because if we give up it's all over

[3:33:00.800 --> 3:33:13.200]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[3:33:13.200 --> 3:33:25.120]  and now your host david night
[3:33:25.120 --> 3:33:29.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we heard a lot about america
[3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:35.120]  first let's hear from the first americans the founders of this country
[3:33:35.120 --> 3:33:39.280]  you know it was john adams who said we don't go abroad seeking monsters to
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:43.840]  destroy it was also president james madison who said
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:47.440]  that the means of defense against foreign danger
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:52.640]  have always always become instruments of tyranny at home
[3:33:52.640 --> 3:33:55.920]  this is the guy who wrote the bill of rights that we ignore now
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:33:58.720]  we have to understand what the consequences of this are going to be
[3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:01.920]  we also have to understand the difference between ideology
[3:34:01.920 --> 3:34:06.720]  and idolatry i'm not following any one man
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:11.920]  you know when we were very hopeful i was very hopeful about donald trump
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:15.200]  when he got elected we looked at it and we said just like julie and assign just
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:18.800]  like we know what hillary clinton is we know exactly what she's going to do
[3:34:18.800 --> 3:34:21.280]  there's absolutely no reason to vote for her
[3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:24.480]  we don't know what donald trump is he's telling us this he looks like he's got
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:27.360]  a long history four years ago he was tweeting out against this
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:30.480]  exact same thing that he did where he reversed himself
[3:34:30.480 --> 3:34:34.560]  in just 48 hours after being on the other side of this
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:37.360]  i think it has to do with the people that he put in place that he let
[3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:40.640]  surround him that he has advising him and hopefully
[3:34:40.640 --> 3:34:44.560]  uh one of the things big masters has said as i pointed out is he said we don't
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:47.600]  want to talk about radical islamic terrorism
[3:34:47.600 --> 3:34:52.080]  maybe donald trump could use that phrase and it'd become like you know hostage
[3:34:52.080 --> 3:34:56.560]  blinking his eyes to us saying no no i'm actually still in control here
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:00.320]  still in control we're still going to talk about radical islamic terror
[3:35:00.320 --> 3:35:04.160]  because that's what michael flinn talked about unapologetically
[3:35:04.160 --> 3:35:08.000]  you know i i really do not want to have the kind of situation where i'm
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:11.360]  falling into a situation when i'm idolizing an individual
[3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:14.880]  i'm not going to do that i'm not going to give donald trump the benefit of the
[3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:19.120]  doubt anymore though folks because i have seen too many people
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:23.200]  at the dnc when i was there and i would show them the documents i say
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:26.480]  what about these i'm not listening i'm not listening i'm not listening to any bad news
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:29.680]  about hillary or john pedestrian that stuff i'm not going to look at the
[3:35:29.680 --> 3:35:32.720]  wiki league stuff it's the russians it's the russians
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:37.040]  so we heard all that stuff from them okay and now we've got people who are so
[3:35:37.040 --> 3:35:41.760]  blindly following trump that are trolling me on twitter
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:44.800]  telling me you don't get it he's playing 40 chest and it's like well
[3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:48.800]  if he was playing 40 chest he wouldn't have surrounded himself with the opposing
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:53.280]  players okay uh i just i don't understand that
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:56.640]  you know again looking at what patrick henry said
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:36:01.280]  he said we're apt to shut our eyes against painful truth
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:04.720]  he said we want to listen to the siren song until it transforms us
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:10.720]  into beasts okay wise men who are struggling for liberty
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:14.480]  need to not have eyes that don't see and ears that don't hear
[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:18.160]  now when he does the right thing absolutely i will support him on that
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:22.080]  very strongly i supported ron wyden when he exposed the lies of the
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:26.080]  NSA and james clapper i don't support ron wyden on most other
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:29.760]  things and i don't feel like because he was right on that issue
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:34.480]  that i have to hold my fire on him on anything else i'm not
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:38.320]  and you shouldn't either you should take these things on an issue by issue basis
[3:36:38.320 --> 3:36:41.680]  because the fundamental thing that we're looking for here folks
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:45.680]  is liberty and i don't really care who gets us there if he can shut down the
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:49.440]  globalists and not be taken over by them great i'm all for that
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:53.200]  and we've gotten some good things from trump we got the tpp stopped on day one
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:56.800]  but then what happened gary cohen is there gary cohen
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:01.280]  is bringing in now the architect of tpp to try to stop any changes
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:05.520]  on nafta we had jared kushner bringing in multiple times
[3:37:05.520 --> 3:37:09.840]  the architect of obama care zeke manual there has been a change
[3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:13.280]  there's been a change and so we need to know that he's not captive now i want to
[3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:16.640]  go back to this real briefly before we go to our callers here
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:19.360]  one of the things that flin was saying at the time when he was talking to al
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:21.760]  jazeera and the guy was saying you can't characterize
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:25.600]  islam as being a terrorist ideology he says we are at war
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.600]  this is what flin said we're at war with a radical component of islam
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:33.680]  he says that's why i believe that islam is a political ideology based on a
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:37.040]  religion and the al jazeera guy came back and said but
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:40.880]  terrorism experts say that actually these guys are political these guys
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:44.160]  uh is a political group using religion as a cover
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:46.960]  to which flin said i don't agree i don't agree
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:50.480]  the guys that are serious the serious leaders of these groups absolutely
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:55.280]  believe their version of islam is the right version the correct version
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:37:58.560]  and he says most people won't even remember that it's only been a couple
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:01.920]  of years that the free syrian army that movement i mean where are they today
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:05.760]  they're al-nusra the people that we've got
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:11.120]  john mccain meeting with just a few weeks ago before this attack
[3:38:11.120 --> 3:38:14.960]  i said and then the guy from al jazeera says but wait a minute hold on you were
[3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:17.920]  helping them in 2012 all these groups are and he says yeah
[3:38:17.920 --> 3:38:21.840]  we've allowed this we've allowed this extremist you know these extremist
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:24.560]  militants to come in he says but i don't understand why are you supporting
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:26.960]  these people he said well we argued about this there were different
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:30.720]  competing groups and he said he didn't win the argument these
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:34.400]  other people won the argument now it looks like maybe
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:37.440]  the only people that are going to be there under mcmasters
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:41.920]  who is a protege of general patrice all the people are going to have a say at
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:44.720]  the table are going to be the people who have been supporting this idea that
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:48.560]  islam is our friend we have cernovich's
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:51.680]  report here that mcmasters has manipulating intelligence reports
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:55.840]  donald trump he wants 150 000 ground soldiers in syria
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:38:59.520]  current nsa national security adviser other herbert
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:04.480]  raymond uh hr mcmasters says is a manipulating intelligence reports given
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:07.520]  to president donald trump mcmasters plotting on how to
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:10.320]  sell a massive ground war in syria to president trump with the help of
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:15.520]  disgraced cia director convicted criminal david patrice and one of the
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:18.320]  interesting things in this article i don't know if this is true or not but
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:22.240]  their sources suggest that mcmasters is sharing classified
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:26.320]  information with patrice whose security clearance has been revoked let's go to
[3:39:26.320 --> 3:39:30.400]  jason in germany jason go ahead
[3:39:30.400 --> 3:39:34.000]  hey david good to be honest here again um you know everybody's been exploring
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:38.080]  like pretty much every faster aspect of the whole syrian thing
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:41.600]  up one side down the other and you can correct me if i'm wrong but i really
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:45.680]  haven't heard anybody uh try to tend to down to what the central
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:48.640]  issue is and i always like to try to do that i feel like
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:53.440]  the central issue of of all of our involvement in international disputes is
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:56.800]  are we going to be the world's policeman yes that's it
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:00.240]  that's it that's it exactly and that's what the people like bill
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:04.160]  crystal were saying last week donald trump he said has finally
[3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:07.920]  become president this week he became president because he became the leader
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:11.120]  of the world that's what they want they're not satisfied with anything else
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:15.200]  and you can see the fact that trump's hardcore supporters are wringing their
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:18.560]  hands and despair over the fact that we're not going to fix the
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:21.440]  problems here at home that's one of the issues he's running into problems
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:26.640]  with tax reform with obama care repeal and it's so much easier to go shoot off a
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:30.800]  couple of missiles and then now everybody is applauding him and
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:33.920]  that's the fundamental issue that's why i don't really care
[3:40:33.920 --> 3:40:38.320]  about whether this was a signal to inoculate him against the russia
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:40.880]  criticism or whether he's trying to impress
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:45.040]  china and how does that impress china simply it makes him look like he is
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:48.960]  unpredictable that doesn't make any of us more secure when you start
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:53.440]  acting like kim jong-un with more accurate missiles all
[3:40:53.440 --> 3:40:56.240]  that makes his people concerned about what you're liable to do if you're
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:40:59.520]  going to flip 180 degrees in two days because your daughter
[3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:02.000]  saw some pictures and got you upset about it
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:05.200]  and how do we conduct a foreign policy it seems to me like that makes
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:07.840]  everything a lot more dangerous a lot more unstable
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:12.320]  but the fact that we now have a move away from one of the fundamental tenets
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:16.400]  that donald trump had campaigned on nationalism versus globalism america
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:19.680]  first we're not going to be america's police that is the key issue we can
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:22.800]  argue all day about what's going on in syria the motivations behind this how
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:26.560]  we're going to take down a side so we can run the gas lines through there
[3:41:26.560 --> 3:41:30.960]  and how we want to set the place on fire so we've got
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:34.960]  isis running through the area and we can bring massive numbers of people as
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:38.800]  refugees into america that's a globalist plan to spread that kind of
[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:43.280]  war chaos and terrorism into the west creating war and chaos and all these
[3:41:43.280 --> 3:41:46.800]  other areas so they can then have an excuse to bring refugees and
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:50.080]  that's what he really needs to understand that's the root
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:54.080]  of what we're talking about in terms of you know put up a wall
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:58.320]  that's a bandaid over the fundamental situation that we've got happening here
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:01.600]  he needs to address these fundamental situations the fundamental situations
[3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:05.760]  are these wars for regime change and the war on drugs that's what's
[3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:09.600]  creating so much of the crime and the terrorism that's happening here
[3:42:09.600 --> 3:42:14.080]  a wall is not going to fix that we need to fix the root causes of these things
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.880]  instead they're doubling down on everything so yeah i agree with you
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:20.320]  absolutely was there anything else you want to say jason well just
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:24.400]  secondarily to that uh how is it that our government has decided that some
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:27.680]  forms of murder are basically worse than other forms like
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:32.080]  obviously we did nothing during rwanda when children ostensibly were being
[3:42:32.080 --> 3:42:35.520]  hacked to death with machetes and then later a few years later
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:40.320]  uh rate to death in darfur sudan and we did nothing in both cases so
[3:42:40.320 --> 3:42:43.920]  our government's basically saying they have a scale of outrage wherein
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:47.200]  uh if if a government kills its own people or
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:50.240]  whatever by this means then we're going to have to come and
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:53.920]  take you down but it's okay i mean i'm not saying that their thing is okay but
[3:42:53.920 --> 3:42:58.240]  the the uh that nonverbal message is basically saying
[3:42:58.240 --> 3:43:02.240]  we'll let you bomb and shoot and hack people and rape people to death
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:05.760]  and we'll do nothing but if you gas them or use a chemical on them then we're
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:08.320]  going to have to take you out and i would say
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:12.000]  that we will even help you to do that look at yemen look at what saudi arabia
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:14.560]  is doing in yemen and we have supported them and have you seen the pictures of
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:17.840]  what's going on in yemen no you haven't have you seen a lot of
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:20.960]  coverage about what happened in sweden not really did you see a lot of
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:24.640]  coverage about the churches that were attacked yesterday in egypt not really
[3:43:24.640 --> 3:43:27.760]  they're not going to get so upset about that that they're going to do something
[3:43:27.760 --> 3:43:32.400]  no they pick very selectively what they want to be morally outraged about
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:35.680]  that's the outrageous part of this and that's the wag the dog
[3:43:35.680 --> 3:43:39.360]  scenario of this this is the false flag aspect of it
[3:43:39.360 --> 3:43:42.080]  the fact that they would use something that is real
[3:43:42.080 --> 3:43:45.680]  to achieve their policy goals that's what we're talking about
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:48.800]  there's so many different aspects of a false flag attack it could be completely
[3:43:48.800 --> 3:43:53.680]  faked like the wag the dog movie was or it could be something that is a real
[3:43:53.680 --> 3:43:58.400]  incident that is used to distract you and to sell their pre-arranged agenda
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:01.040]  and of course that's precisely what's happening when you look at what's going
[3:44:01.040 --> 3:44:05.120]  on in in sweden i've got an article here of a guy who was a
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:08.160]  doctor he says it was terrible i will never understand
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:12.080]  how they could do it the west will never understand how these people could do
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:14.720]  it they don't understand the mind of islam
[3:44:14.720 --> 3:44:18.640]  because here's the next article from daily mail the killer i'm pleased with
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:21.840]  what i did i achieved what i set out to do
[3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:25.440]  what i do he was trying to retaliate for the attacks he saw
[3:44:25.440 --> 3:44:31.520]  saw against isis not against Assad see we are going to war
[3:44:31.520 --> 3:44:36.000]  with the only secular arab government and we are
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.960]  taking down the guy who has had a secular society
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:44.400]  who had protected christians and jews in that area he wasn't a perfect
[3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:48.000]  guy nobody is a perfect guy but now we've decided that
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:51.920]  he's a monster we need a monster for a foreign policy we're going to take him
[3:44:51.920 --> 3:44:54.400]  down and we're going to have regime changing we're
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:44:58.480]  going to turn it over to isis these are the people who are chopping people's
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:01.280]  heads off i mean who are we most closely allied with we're most
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:04.080]  closely allied with the arab government saudi arabia
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:09.360]  that cuts off the most teds only isis i think uh executes more people that way
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:13.200]  than saudi arabia does and of course you know you've also got the hands and
[3:45:13.200 --> 3:45:16.000]  other appendages that they like to chop off all the time as well
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:20.160]  let's go on to john and wyoming thank you jason john and wyoming
[3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:24.960]  yeah david i have a stack of uh annual reports from the council on foreign
[3:45:24.960 --> 3:45:29.600]  relations from 2005 to 2014 they won't send me any
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:32.720]  newer ones because i'm outing all of their people
[3:45:32.720 --> 3:45:36.400]  but go back to the 2005 that's when that lady
[3:45:36.400 --> 3:45:43.760]  dina habib pal was first elected to the cfr and go back to 2005
[3:45:43.760 --> 3:45:47.520]  when you see that both david betray us and herbert reyman
[3:45:47.520 --> 3:45:53.200]  McMaster hr mcmaster were already members of the cfr yeah
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:58.080]  so it's the same old stunt they're infiltrating like termites
[3:45:58.080 --> 3:46:02.720]  invading your home they're infiltrating trump's administration
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:07.440]  and they are the ones who are getting him to launch these attacks and trying to
[3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:11.760]  get him to start a war with the russians and start a war with the syrians
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:14.800]  and everything else these people are evil
[3:46:14.800 --> 3:46:20.560]  barry goldwater tried to warn us in his 1979 book with no apologies
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:26.160]  on page 126 he said the cfr is the american branch of a society which
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:30.960]  originated in england internationalist in viewpoint the cfr
[3:46:30.960 --> 3:46:35.040]  along with the atlantic union movement and the atlantic council of the united
[3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:39.680]  states believes national boundaries should be obliterated
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:44.640]  and one world rule established yeah absolutely
[3:46:44.640 --> 3:46:47.280]  and look at look at the people that have given us that people like woodrow
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:51.200]  wilson and what did he do he gave us a useless very costly world war one that
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:55.760]  he got us involved in even and i want to remind this of all these
[3:46:55.760 --> 3:47:00.400]  people out there on the left who are cheering this operation they remember
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:04.080]  woodrow wilson locked up a film director
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:06.880]  and they said it was okay because the supreme court said it was okay the
[3:47:06.880 --> 3:47:09.520]  supreme court said movies don't have first amendment protection and it was
[3:47:09.520 --> 3:47:14.320]  that way for about 50 years what was the film that he locked the guy up for
[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:18.400]  the spirit of 76 because he didn't want
[3:47:18.400 --> 3:47:21.920]  the british portrayed in a negative light he wanted to get into war
[3:47:21.920 --> 3:47:25.360]  world war one on the side of the british he didn't want us talking about
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:28.560]  the british in a negative light so he locked that guy up
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:31.920]  he was given a 10-year jail sentence i think he got off a little bit before the
[3:47:31.920 --> 3:47:35.600]  end of that but he was given i think uh i'm just going on memory now i think
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:38.080]  something like five thousand dollar fine
[3:47:38.080 --> 3:47:44.800]  which in uh you know 19 uh 16 something like that
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:47.760]  again i'm going on memory that was a lot of money because that was before the
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:51.840]  federal reserve started devaluating our currency to where it's worth one
[3:47:51.840 --> 3:47:56.080]  penny of its original purchasing price absolutely right john thank you let me
[3:47:56.080 --> 3:47:58.240]  get to some of the other callers that are waiting online
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:05.760]  kandace in kentucky go ahead kandace um yes i just wanted to address you know everybody's question and trump in his
[3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:10.240]  tactics right now but um i have full faith in him i think he knows more
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:13.920]  than we think he does i think he's got what makes you think that
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:17.280]  is that what what is what makes you think that he's he knows something that's
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:21.440]  that you don't know that uh he's got this all figured out in spite of what you
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:26.960]  see take it back to the wiretap anything he released his tweets like
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:30.880]  perfect timing to when everything came out to
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:35.520]  make it blow up in such a way that it made him look credible and everybody else
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:40.320]  uncredible you know what i mean like he timed that to a T like he knew exactly
[3:48:40.320 --> 3:48:44.800]  what was going on knew when to do it when to let it out
[3:48:44.800 --> 3:48:47.760]  okay but how do you how do you interpret these reactions how do you interpret
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:51.760]  what he just did here how do you interpret his temper tantrums that he
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:54.240]  went after the house freedom caucus and so we're gonna
[3:48:54.240 --> 3:48:57.920]  mention specific people by name i'm going to throw them out because they stood up
[3:48:57.920 --> 3:49:00.880]  for repeal how do you interpret that why why did he go on a
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:04.000]  twitter tirade about that
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:09.280]  um like what do you mean what is the strategy that you would throw the
[3:49:09.280 --> 3:49:14.400]  people who stand by the voters and stand by trump's promises to repeal
[3:49:14.400 --> 3:49:18.000]  obama care why would he say i'm going to remove them from
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:20.960]  office because they didn't give me a victory what is the strategy in the
[3:49:20.960 --> 3:49:25.440]  genius behind that i'm not saying all his strategies are
[3:49:25.440 --> 3:49:28.960]  genius but he's in a position where he's fighting
[3:49:28.960 --> 3:49:32.160]  ten different wars on ten different fronts you know he's taking fire from
[3:49:32.160 --> 3:49:35.440]  every angle he's gotta make some adjustments adjustments you know i'm
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:39.440]  saying yeah i think what he needed to do was he needed to use he needed to use
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:42.480]  those guys as his base because they were with him
[3:49:42.480 --> 3:49:46.720]  when paul ryan threw him under the bus the month before the election because of
[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:51.200]  that billy bush tape where he made the obscene comment
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:55.040]  paul ryan said forget trump save yourselves he's not going to win
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:49:58.240]  and these people said no we need donald trump because he's saying the types of
[3:49:58.240 --> 3:50:00.960]  things we want to see pushed they stood by him
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:06.320]  then when he becomes president he stands by paul ryan's plan which is not
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:10.480]  repeal of obama care which was a disaster in the way
[3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:13.280]  that it was put out to people constantly a
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:18.320]  multi thousand page report a law that was being changed up to the last minute
[3:50:18.320 --> 3:50:22.480]  and demanded blind obedience and loyalty to paul ryan and to donald
[3:50:22.480 --> 3:50:25.680]  trump and when they didn't get it he threw a temper tantrum that was
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:28.800]  strike two against him as far as i was concerned first one
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:33.120]  being throwing michael flin under the bus when he admitted that he hadn't done
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:36.400]  anything wrong this is strike three i'm saying that
[3:50:36.400 --> 3:50:39.840]  he could still do a lot of good things he did some good things with the epa it
[3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:45.040]  was also pulled back at the last minute by evanka who said we don't want you
[3:50:45.040 --> 3:50:49.360]  mentioning the paris climate treaty we don't want you saying that
[3:50:49.360 --> 3:50:53.760]  the endangerment clause is wrong so they left the fundamental structure there
[3:50:53.760 --> 3:50:56.560]  even though they made a very good beginning and the person they picked at

[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:26.720]  and yeah he brought jobs back like the auto industry but that's going to be
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:30.640]  robotics in a few years anyway yeah said to me that doesn't really
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:35.680]  mean much and um lately well bannon said hold their feet to the
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:39.840]  fire then he's gone and the more and more i hear of what
[3:56:39.840 --> 3:56:43.920]  trump's doing he's starting to look like a manchurian candidate to me
[3:56:43.920 --> 3:56:48.480]  yeah yeah he got rid of the tpp but he did nothing about the ndaa
[3:56:48.480 --> 3:56:54.160]  agenda 21 the patriot act and how about all the treason that was committed in
[3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:59.120]  the last 16 20 years the clinton's and uh well that's that's true and you know
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:02.480]  when he was running we knew that he was not going to be on our side in terms of
[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:05.360]  civil liberties he had said that he thought that snowed not to be executed
[3:57:05.360 --> 3:57:08.480]  and that was very troubling but that's not any different really than hillary
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:12.080]  clinton uh she wants the surveillance state as well and i
[3:57:12.080 --> 3:57:15.760]  had said at the time look what we can hopefully get out of
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:20.080]  donald trump is to block the globalist economically politically
[3:57:20.080 --> 3:57:24.240]  uh with the climate issues and that sort of thing if we can block them at the
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:28.480]  upper level if we can stop this global consolidation of governments
[3:57:28.480 --> 3:57:33.200]  then we still have in theory a constitution and we can fight at the
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:36.400]  local and state level to try to get back our liberties
[3:57:36.400 --> 3:57:39.440]  he never talked about any civil liberties issues i mean he was
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:42.560]  always wrong about things like torture the ndaa
[3:57:42.560 --> 3:57:45.920]  civil asset forfeiture that type of thing so i didn't expect to get that
[3:57:45.920 --> 3:57:50.000]  from donald trump i did expect that he would not get involved in syria
[3:57:50.000 --> 3:57:53.280]  and i'm very disappointed about that and the key with all of this
[3:57:53.280 --> 3:57:57.280]  that is taking this down are the people that he is surrounding himself with
[3:57:57.280 --> 3:58:01.120]  that is what is why he's made such a good start
[3:58:01.120 --> 3:58:04.960]  but now things are starting to go off the track because the good people that
[3:58:04.960 --> 3:58:08.080]  came in with him are one by one getting pushed out
[3:58:08.080 --> 3:58:11.600]  by the swamp that is swamping the trump administration
[3:58:11.600 --> 3:58:14.160]  that's all the time we've got today i'm sorry to the callers they're still on the
[3:58:14.160 --> 3:58:17.840]  line if you want to call we've got our three to five show that's live
[3:58:17.840 --> 3:58:21.680]  uh call in there tell them that you are on hold here and maybe they can get you
[3:58:21.680 --> 3:58:24.640]  to the front of the line if they start taking phone calls i think in the
[3:58:24.640 --> 3:58:28.880]  second hour they usually do that join us again tomorrow at 11 central
[3:58:28.880 --> 3:58:32.720]  noon eastern for the info wars show with alex jones
[3:58:32.720 --> 3:58:59.280]  and join us tonight at seven for the nightly news
