[00:00.000 --> 00:23.600]  This is the rules there. If this is where we are, is it basically mean that the vaccine
[00:23.600 --> 00:26.200]  is our only hope of getting back to normal?
[00:26.200 --> 00:33.640]  Yeah, well, society should be able to have things like schooling that get a priority
[00:33.640 --> 00:39.360]  versus certain more entertainment related things. And I guess, you know, politicians
[00:39.360 --> 00:46.400]  will show what their value system is there. The only way we'll get completely back to
[00:46.400 --> 00:54.280]  normal is by having not maybe not the first generation vaccines, but eventually a vaccine
[00:54.280 --> 01:00.800]  that is super effective and that a lot of the people take and that we get the disease
[01:00.800 --> 01:09.920]  eliminated on a global basis. That is where we can finally start taking all the problems
[01:09.920 --> 01:15.560]  that have been created in education and mental health and start to build back in a positive
[01:15.560 --> 01:16.560]  way.
[01:16.560 --> 01:22.200]  You have said your foundation said that this pandemic may have set back. You know, we had
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.960]  made advances in decreasing poverty around the world and decreasing those that went without
[01:27.960 --> 01:33.960]  food. And I think you had said this pandemic basically erased 20 years of progress. How
[01:33.960 --> 01:39.960]  long before we can start making progress again? This virus, are we looking at 2022, 2023 when
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.680]  we feel like we'll have this virus under control around the world?
[01:44.680 --> 01:51.200]  A few things like getting their health systems and vaccination rates back up. You can probably
[01:51.200 --> 01:57.720]  get that back in shape within three or four years. The poverty impacts and educational
[01:57.720 --> 02:04.960]  impacts will be more like 10 plus years because they didn't have the ability to write lots
[02:04.960 --> 02:10.000]  of checks. You know, their jobs are not in offices at all.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you understand that this confirms everything that the Rockefeller
[02:15.040 --> 02:21.120]  and Milamone Gates Foundation said they would do in the last few decades. A planetary lockdown
[02:21.120 --> 02:28.080]  using the threat of a contagion to radically change the way we live as a global reset to
[02:28.080 --> 02:34.480]  cut the carbon footprint and destroy civilization. First, they tell you 15 days to flatten the
[02:34.480 --> 02:39.040]  curve, leave hospitals open. Then it's a month, then it's two months, then it's eight months.
[02:39.040 --> 02:44.720]  Now we're eight months in. Then it's oh, the end of 2021. Oh, it's four years. Oh, it's
[02:44.720 --> 02:50.320]  10 years. We'll never come out of this. Notice they say the first vaccines won't be effective,
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.080]  but don't worry. You'll get up to five COVID vaccines a year that are experimental and
[02:55.080 --> 02:58.400]  everyone's going to want you to do it so we can quote, get back to normal. Not that we're
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.440]  being held hostage. COVID hasn't even killed a million people worldwide. And that's when
[03:04.440 --> 03:07.600]  you look at them adding folks that died of other things to it. It's probably more like
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.240]  100,000 worldwide. It is a very weak real virus, but it spreads very easily so you could
[03:12.240 --> 03:16.560]  be a suspect, so you could be bad. And of course, all the false positives, he goes on
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.040]  to say, this eight minute interview we're going to analyze today here in the first hour,
[03:21.040 --> 03:28.400]  this profoundly earth shaking interview with the master of the planet, Bill Gates, our
[03:28.400 --> 03:36.800]  planetary ruler, that the lockdown never ends and that it won't end until not one person
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.000]  has COVID-19. Total eradication. Of course, you learn that they've gotten rid of polio.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.560]  They haven't. They just don't call it polio and the main cause is vaccines from his foundation.
[03:45.560 --> 03:54.720]  This is mass murder, megalomania, supervillain beyond any James Bond movie. You're witnessing
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.640]  right now and you're in the crosshairs. And women on average have very susceptible to
[04:00.640 --> 04:06.200]  Stockholm syndrome. So are men. And women are being praised as adopting all of this
[04:06.200 --> 04:09.320]  and they will adopt it. They'll give it to their kids. Their kids will die. They won't
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.400]  care because they can't admit they were conned. They can't admit they were wrong. It's going
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.320]  to be up to women that are awake and men that are awake to lead us out of this and to not
[04:17.320 --> 04:25.320]  comply with any of it. The masquies are the enemy. The masquies are brainwashed. And once
[04:25.320 --> 04:30.080]  they wear the diaper over their face as a sign of sacrament and enslavement, they will then
[04:30.080 --> 04:35.080]  take the vaccine, they will then import their neighbors. This is hell on earth. The Texas
[04:35.080 --> 04:40.000]  governor is an enemy of America. Bill Gates is an enemy of humanity. All of these people
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.720]  are in on this. They know damn well what they're doing. This is the planetary world government
[04:44.720 --> 04:49.280]  UN takeover. I'm Alex Jones. This is an emergency transmission. If you want to live and have
[04:49.280 --> 04:59.280]  any future at all, better share this link right now.
[04:59.280 --> 05:04.600]  For more than 100 years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government,
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.840]  abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly
[05:09.840 --> 05:16.280]  taking control of Western medicine. Now they had a bad name by the 1920s. They started converting
[05:16.280 --> 05:22.360]  over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics
[05:22.360 --> 05:28.640]  operations. Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the
[05:28.640 --> 05:33.120]  board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being the head of Planned
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.840]  Parenthood. And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department
[05:38.840 --> 05:44.640]  in the world, every national health system. Bill Gates is in control. They have spent
[05:44.640 --> 05:50.520]  100 plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body when
[05:50.520 --> 05:55.840]  it goes in your body. This is the holy grail of their operations. And now they're normalizing,
[05:55.840 --> 06:05.840]  putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[06:05.840 --> 06:12.840]  It's Tuesday, October 13th, the year of 2020. We are 20 days out from the election, 99 out
[06:12.840 --> 06:18.880]  from the inauguration. And that's the real date. The loveless are attempting to overthrow
[06:18.880 --> 06:24.800]  the election in 2016 and discredit it and then quote, eradicate the base that got Trump
[06:24.800 --> 06:29.840]  into office. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Very honored to be here. Thank you for joining us.
[06:29.840 --> 06:36.160]  What we're about to air, we already knew was the case. But now it's triple confirmed. If
[06:36.160 --> 06:42.040]  you go to infowars.com today, the most demonized, light about attack site on the planet by the
[06:42.040 --> 06:49.520]  forces of evil, you will see the headline up there. Nightmare confirmed. Planetary ruler
[06:49.520 --> 06:55.680]  Bill Gates announces lockdowns will never end. Gates and Rockefeller Foundation documents
[06:55.680 --> 07:01.960]  to tell plan for permanent worldwide lockdown. Last night, Bill Gates publicly confirmed
[07:01.960 --> 07:08.640]  the plan is being implemented as we speak, and that civilization as we know it is over.
[07:08.640 --> 07:18.200]  I'm about to play much of the chilling eight minute interview with Democrat deep state
[07:18.200 --> 07:24.920]  operative who was interviewing Gates. The whole thing is scripted. Gates underwrites
[07:24.920 --> 07:29.440]  the very TV channel that he did this interview on and most of the newspapers because he's
[07:29.440 --> 07:38.320]  the consortium chairman of all the robber baron eugenics money of Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller,
[07:38.320 --> 07:47.120]  IBM, and now of course his own wealth. That's why he's the planetary ruler. Big article
[07:47.120 --> 07:51.240]  by Paul Joseph Watson where you can see the video and read the closer yourself. Bill Gates
[07:51.240 --> 07:57.160]  says world won't return to normal until a lot of people take a second covid vaccine.
[07:57.160 --> 08:01.480]  The headline strong but not strong enough. What he actually says is the world economy
[08:01.480 --> 08:09.920]  will be permanently devastated. And he goes on to say that it'll be a decade maybe until
[08:09.920 --> 08:17.080]  you're allowed to even have things like quote entertainment. So this this this is beyond
[08:17.080 --> 08:22.040]  any James Bond villain movie. This is beyond anything in science fiction. This is actually
[08:22.040 --> 08:28.480]  real. This is actually happening right now. And remember, it's all psychological. Oh,
[08:28.480 --> 08:31.960]  just put the handcuffs on. Oh, let us just tie you up and then we'll let you go in a
[08:31.960 --> 08:36.640]  few minutes. And you're locked up in a dungeon 20 years later. That's the same thing. Oh,
[08:36.640 --> 08:40.800]  just 15 days. There's gonna be a couple million dead in the next month and we've got to have
[08:40.800 --> 08:46.120]  enough space for hospitals just stay inside. And then now just wear this mask and oh, your
[08:46.120 --> 08:51.760]  job is not essential. Yours is. Oh, just take you know, take this app on your phone to go
[08:51.760 --> 08:56.880]  to university doing this that this is the total rollout in their own words. And I told
[08:56.880 --> 09:03.840]  you eight months ago, it won't be a 15 day. It'll be forever. And I said by the fall or
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.360]  by the winter, I'm on record saying this, they will tell you that it is a permanent
[09:09.360 --> 09:15.520]  lockdown. And now right on time, they're telling you permanent lockdown after about eight months,
[09:15.520 --> 09:19.120]  most people, particularly women, particularly, I think it's women, it's just known as psychological
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.160]  warfare manuals will become habituated to slavery and will shift into Stockholm syndrome,
[09:24.160 --> 09:29.720]  loving their abuser. And now people like their mask like little like like like a lot of kids
[09:29.720 --> 09:33.960]  that didn't get enough attention, had a blanket that they loved. I mean, of course, my daughter,
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.400]  it's a lot of attention, but she has a blanket she likes. She's three binky, but it's binky.
[09:39.400 --> 09:44.120]  And so they're they're being taught a neurotic neuroses. And once they've learned to be a
[09:44.120 --> 09:51.280]  maskey, like an Islam wearing the you know, the Burqa, the B suit, then out of that cult
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.760]  initiation, that's what this all is. They will then accept the contact tracing, the force
[09:56.760 --> 10:02.520]  inoculations and gate says it'll be five COVID shots a year. We have video of that coming
[10:02.520 --> 10:09.600]  up. But here it is, ladies and gentlemen, he says until it is totally eradicated worldwide,
[10:09.600 --> 10:15.960]  well, it false positives on any cold virus. And so they're saying until we eradicate
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.240]  the cold, which is impossible, you can never go back to normal. But that's the cover for
[10:20.240 --> 10:26.440]  martial law and the technocracy. And what Microsoft has really been up to this whole
[10:26.440 --> 10:34.560]  time, a subsidiary of IBM, which his mother basically ran. And again, all of this was
[10:34.560 --> 10:41.240]  done to get around trust busting back when IBM was about to be broken up. So Bill Gates
[10:41.240 --> 10:46.320]  has always been a little lying snake. He's always been a eugenicist. He's always openly
[10:46.320 --> 10:50.520]  said he wants to depopulate you and your family. He's always said he wants to kill old people.
[10:50.520 --> 10:54.160]  But boy, does he want to put something in your body to take care of you. And now he
[10:54.160 --> 10:58.720]  tells you in this interview, Oh, the world economy is never coming back. And he and
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.560]  the reporter are in this synced up script that he goes through on every channel, whether
[11:04.560 --> 11:11.320]  it's Japanese TV or US television, the same story. So so first it's 15 days. Then it's
[11:11.320 --> 11:16.720]  six months and then it's two years. And the reporter says, Oh, you mean four years now?
[11:16.720 --> 11:24.360]  And Gates goes, No, it's 10 years. 10 years. And now the maskeys are going to report you
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.920]  for not having a vaccine. The maskeys are going to report who runs their restaurant doesn't
[11:28.920 --> 11:32.160]  make you wear masks. The maskey is going to report who you're letting in without your
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.000]  contact tracing app on your phone. It's already happening in England, Canada, and the universities
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.560]  in the US. It's all rolled out. It's a scientific criminal plan. And we must demand Congress
[11:41.560 --> 11:47.920]  and the president stand up and reject this AI world government, UN chai com big tech
[11:47.920 --> 11:53.720]  takeover. Big tech has nothing but the stain for Congress. Big tech has nothing but the
[11:53.720 --> 11:59.640]  stain for you. It's bigger than government. It's more powerful than government. It surveils
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.680]  more than government. And it's partnered with authoritarian governments worldwide. Now a
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.000]  former top Australian minister has gone public saying it's about a great reset to shut down
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.160]  the world economy and consolidate it. Trump has come out and said he was right about damaging
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.280]  lockdowns, which the UN said need to end. And it's killing millions. Johnson and Johnson
[12:20.280 --> 12:26.520]  had to pause their week coronavirus vaccines is making people sick and almost killing them.
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.320]  Former Australian senator says the great reset is the real agenda behind COVID panic. But
[12:31.320 --> 12:39.160]  there I was Saturday. Nicely publicly addressing leftist on South Congress in Austin, saying
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.960]  millions of starved in Africa. Here's the UN report. It's called the great reset. Please
[12:43.960 --> 12:52.360]  understand. F U racist white people screaming F U racist. And saying, where are your kids?
[12:52.360 --> 12:55.960]  You don't have your kids. That's not true. How is your DWI? It was it was dropped. I
[12:55.960 --> 13:00.080]  don't have a DWI. I told you I didn't blow at the level, but they would just shout these
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.120]  things at me. I'm like, listen, it's starving the third world. It's collapsing us here.
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.320]  It's irrevocable decades of wealth being destroyed. You'll never get your college funds paid off
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.440]  now, but they don't care because they feel like they're with the winning team. I'm not
[13:14.440 --> 13:17.880]  getting interrupted. I'm going to come back and talk about it. Let's play two and a half
[13:17.880 --> 13:24.200]  minutes as we go to break a Bill Gates on national TV telling you it's never ending
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.080]  and that he's your God and that he controls your body and that he's planetary ruler and
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.040]  then get pissed and call Congress and tell them say no, I know Trump's listening. We broke
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.080]  that the UN came out. Nobody else was covering it and said the lockdowns are telling everybody
[13:37.080 --> 13:41.240]  now it's top news. That's why we're here. That's why you're here and we're winning.
[13:41.240 --> 13:44.760]  We're not just fighting back as it's the right thing to do. We're fighting back because it's
[13:44.760 --> 13:49.800]  the right thing to do and we're winning. Thanks to you. Now here's your number one enemy.
[13:49.800 --> 13:55.680]  Planetary head of the world eugenics system. The antichrist right hand man, Bill earning
[13:55.680 --> 14:02.280]  hell gates. This is the rules there. If this is where we are, is it basically mean that
[14:02.280 --> 14:08.840]  the vaccine is our only hope of getting back to normal? Yeah, well, society should be able
[14:08.840 --> 14:16.120]  to have things like schooling that get a priority versus certain more entertainment related
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.640]  things. And I guess, you know, politicians will will show what their value system is
[14:21.640 --> 14:30.320]  there. The only way we'll get completely back to normal is by having not maybe not the first
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.760]  generation vaccines, but eventually a vaccine that is super effective and that a lot of
[14:36.760 --> 14:45.040]  the people take and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis. That is where
[14:45.040 --> 14:51.240]  we can finally start taking all the problems that have been created in education and mental
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.400]  health and start to build back in a positive way. You have said your foundation said that
[14:57.400 --> 15:04.760]  this pandemic may have set back. You know, we had made advances in decreasing poverty
[15:04.760 --> 15:08.920]  around the world and decreasing those that went without food. And I think you had said
[15:08.920 --> 15:14.920]  this pandemic basically erase 20 years of progress. How long before we can start making
[15:14.920 --> 15:19.960]  progress again? This virus, are we looking at 2022 2023 when we feel like we'll have
[15:19.960 --> 15:26.240]  this virus under control around the world? A few things like getting their health systems
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.600]  and vaccination rates back up. You can probably get that back in shape within three or four
[15:32.600 --> 15:40.640]  years. The poverty impacts and educational impacts will be more like 10 plus years because
[15:40.640 --> 15:47.720]  they didn't have the ability to write lots of checks, you know, their jobs are not in
[15:47.720 --> 15:56.280]  offices at all. So they've suffered disproportionately and, you know, this gradual progress, it's
[15:56.280 --> 16:02.640]  usually very positive. The future isn't coming, it's here. And in the future, keeping your
[16:02.640 --> 16:08.800]  humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most
[16:08.800 --> 16:14.360]  valuable asset. In fact, it's going to be your only asset. The world being built by
[16:14.360 --> 16:21.040]  the technocrats. The trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the
[16:21.040 --> 16:29.960]  beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[16:29.960 --> 16:35.840]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[16:35.840 --> 16:42.200]  2050. This is their stated goal. I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this
[16:42.200 --> 16:48.560]  to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.760]  We turn this around. You must study their own writings. You must face the facts and you
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.800]  must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[16:57.800 --> 17:03.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:03.800 --> 17:25.800]  Infowars has been banned. Arrested. Attacked and threatened. Because we are effective.
[17:25.800 --> 17:35.480]  The great awakening is here. Go to fans.video. Download the videos and share. Support the
[17:35.480 --> 17:46.080]  information war at infowarstore.com. And never give up the fight.
[17:46.080 --> 18:04.920]  Infowars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:04.920 --> 18:20.440]  This is it. You read the globalist documents. Carol Quickney is the victim for Zethke. You
[18:20.440 --> 18:25.520]  read what Cecil Rhodes had to say 120 years ago about the plan for world government. You
[18:25.520 --> 18:31.760]  read what Sir Francis Galton said. You read what George Arwell said. You studied the globalist
[18:31.760 --> 18:39.560]  plan. You read what Bill Gates had to say. And now we've seen them build the technocracy
[18:39.560 --> 18:45.800]  up to the point and domesticate the population up to the point and get us in a subservient
[18:45.800 --> 18:52.840]  mode up to the point that people are literally ready to become prisoners in their own homes
[18:52.840 --> 18:58.280]  and be made obsolete by computers and robots that will be forced to take over all the farming,
[18:58.280 --> 19:05.720]  all the ranching, all the repairs, all the roofing and a true dystopia which the UN and
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.800]  the left are all bragging is great to lower the human population and lower the carbon
[19:10.800 --> 19:18.040]  footprint and the main guy pushing it for 40 years. The known villain who had his monopoly
[19:18.040 --> 19:25.880]  broken up with the United Nations and a consortium of big tech has launched a successful shutdown
[19:25.880 --> 19:32.840]  of the planet, dwarfing what Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Lenin could only dream of. I
[19:32.840 --> 19:38.760]  mean we are living in modern warfare. In the chicken little operation where we hit our
[19:38.760 --> 19:44.440]  knees and give up all our rights. How did I tell you eight months ago that the lockdown
[19:44.440 --> 19:50.280]  would ever end? Did I have a crystal ball out back? No. It was in Operation Lockstep.
[19:50.280 --> 19:56.640]  It was in Event 201 and I told you that COVID is a simulant. It is a live virus that spreads
[19:56.640 --> 20:01.360]  quickly so they can make everybody guilty of having it and if you are very, very run
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.960]  down and have a lot of co-morbidities and if you have low vitamins and minerals that
[20:06.960 --> 20:14.640]  are essential you will die. Any virus will do that. We laid it all out to you ladies
[20:14.640 --> 20:22.160]  and gentlemen. We laid out every single bit of how they would do it. And now based off
[20:22.160 --> 20:30.880]  of that Bill Gates is saying you can never leave your house again. How did we know it
[20:30.880 --> 20:38.120]  was coming? Because they are arrogant. Remember Bill Gates on Fareed Zakaria three months
[20:38.120 --> 20:44.880]  into this on CNN. The show that the Bilderberg group produces. Fareed Zakaria is part of
[20:44.880 --> 20:49.080]  it. And he went on there and Fareed said the lockdown never is going to end. Civilization
[20:49.080 --> 20:53.920]  is over as we know it. Gates really smiled and laughed and he said yeah. He was like
[20:53.920 --> 21:00.200]  oh we are going to tell people just like five years ago George Soros went on Fareed Zakaria
[21:00.200 --> 21:07.360]  and said I got $5 billion from Obama and Hillary and we overthrew Ukraine. Then if
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.960]  you say that the fact checkers get you banned on Facebook and say no he didn't do that even
[21:11.960 --> 21:17.160]  though it's on video. Just like they say George Soros never said he was a Nazi collaborator.
[21:17.160 --> 21:23.520]  He never said his favorite time of life was rounding up Jews. He just said it on 60 minutes.
[21:23.520 --> 21:27.280]  But see that they are allowed to tell you how they are pissing on you and when you say
[21:27.280 --> 21:33.640]  it's not rain you can't. This is the mind control. And he said a lot of the state minute
[21:33.640 --> 21:37.560]  video that's at info wars.com and I suggest you go watch because this is the guy that
[21:37.560 --> 21:43.480]  has more power over you than your husband or your wife or your mommy or your daddy or
[21:43.480 --> 21:49.160]  your boss or your employees. This is a guy who is the front man of the group that spent
[21:49.160 --> 21:55.120]  all their money and their power to get control of your body. And he says oh it's ten years
[21:55.120 --> 21:59.840]  till you can do anything again. Oh it's a permanent lockdown. Oh it's devastating the
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.320]  world economy and it's going to start millions. He's even admitting it. Get ready for the
[22:04.320 --> 22:09.440]  death. Get ready for the collapse because we have to stop anyone dying from covid.
[22:09.440 --> 22:13.000]  So it doesn't matter if 100 million start a death they estimate the next couple years
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.120]  already millions have but it's a domino effect that gets worse. And then the third world
[22:17.120 --> 22:23.160]  floods us and we got to pay for taking care of them which is all his plan. Now he goes
[22:23.160 --> 22:28.360]  if we can just save one person we have to shut down the whole economy until 100 million
[22:28.360 --> 22:34.480]  and he went on to say we cannot have one person ever have covid again. An impossible goal
[22:34.480 --> 22:40.720]  so that he continues to have total control forever. This is a scheme lockstep admits ten
[22:40.720 --> 22:44.640]  years ago from the Rockefeller Foundation they would use it to bring in a planetary
[22:44.640 --> 22:51.120]  police state. These are quotes. You say why do they brag because metaphysically there
[22:51.120 --> 22:57.440]  is a galactic universal rule that you have to tell people what you're doing to them.
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.400]  It's got to be in the fine print as above so below. God has his rules we just mimic
[23:02.400 --> 23:07.600]  them. So it's not fraud in a contract even super fine print in there. It says by the
[23:07.600 --> 23:12.120]  way I can screw you if I want. But it's still you got to get a magnifying glass. You got
[23:12.120 --> 23:19.160]  to look. Well this guy you don't need a magnifying glass. It's in your face. So big every print
[23:19.160 --> 23:25.640]  font is six inches tall. Screaming. I'm a eugenicist. My dad was one. My mom was one.
[23:25.640 --> 23:30.680]  The head of IBM was one. I want to kill you. I want planetary control. I'm a technocrat.
[23:30.680 --> 23:33.720]  I want to tell you how you can eat. Where you sleep and where you live. I want to put
[23:33.720 --> 23:37.560]  you in coffin apartments. And so does Jeff Bezos and so does Bloomberg. They're all
[23:37.560 --> 23:42.800]  the same group. They're all the same cult. They're all the same people. And they mean
[23:42.800 --> 23:48.480]  buh buh buh buh buh buh business. And their business is making you poor making you stupid
[23:48.480 --> 23:55.920]  making you sick making you desperate before they kill your miserable ass.
[23:55.920 --> 24:00.880]  So here he is in the same newscast. We didn't play yet. Talking about oh forget all these
[24:00.880 --> 24:05.800]  new vaccines. I've got new ones coming out next year. So you always want the lockdown
[24:05.800 --> 24:09.280]  to go longer. He's already got him patented. We showed him to you. He had him patented
[24:09.280 --> 24:14.080]  four years ago and two years ago. Super dangerous vaccines that make you super sick and change
[24:14.080 --> 24:19.720]  your DNA. Go into your cells. All of it. I told you Trump was doing a dangerous game.
[24:19.720 --> 24:24.600]  I don't agree with it. People spend and say Joseph for an oculation. No I'm not. I'm exposing
[24:24.600 --> 24:28.880]  what Trump's doing. Trump comes up and goes oh we got all these new vaccines. We'll have
[24:28.880 --> 24:34.100]  ours not Gates's because he knows Gates wants to keep the lockdown going and make you take
[24:34.100 --> 24:38.160]  his vaccine that is not even a normal vaccine that teaches white blood cells how to kill
[24:38.160 --> 24:45.720]  something. So you guys a shot of electron microscope showing that we'll show that next segment.
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.120]  White blood cells eating viruses and bacteria. No it goes into your cell and reprograms you
[24:51.120 --> 24:57.600]  and actually changes who you are every cell in your body. I mean they're not just creeping
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.640]  up to making us Frankencreatures. They're jumping the whole thing. They're going a trillion
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.880]  miles folks hoping we push back a few billion. They still have got us a trillion. This is
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.560]  the big move. This is the big enchilada and this dude is out in the open saying he's your
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.880]  master and notice everybody does what he says because he's got all the trillions behind
[25:15.880 --> 25:22.720]  him and all the big families. That's not Bill Gates. That's the figurehead of these people.
[25:22.720 --> 25:28.960]  That's the masked head. Here's what he had to say. There's a second wave of vaccines
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.960]  that will come sometime next year and our foundation and a group we're part of called
[25:33.960 --> 25:40.400]  sepia funding those. The US government is not yet involved in that. But a few of those
[25:40.400 --> 25:48.080]  like one that uses a measles vector. Those are the most likely to be single shot interventions.
[25:48.080 --> 25:57.480]  But all most likely almost all the vaccines will require the two shots. Sometimes I wonder
[25:57.480 --> 26:02.480]  what's going to be the bigger challenge. The actual distribution of the vaccine or the
[26:02.480 --> 26:12.080]  public relations campaign. Yes. The skepticism about vaccines has always been an issue here
[26:12.080 --> 26:21.840]  where politicians kind of motivated to say they performed a miracle. Remember this guy
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.360]  the skepticism says to get rid of the population ever. He wants you dead. Our current president
[26:27.360 --> 26:32.680]  was actually vaccine skeptic. So now he wants to put something in you. Current situation
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.360]  is the most difficult. We're going to come back and talk about this and play more of
[26:36.360 --> 26:40.560]  it. Yeah. He's a skeptic. So he knew how to derail you and take control of it away from
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.360]  you. I mean I agree with what Trump's doing but I see it and it's actually working and
[26:44.360 --> 26:50.000]  that little monster is pissed. Bill Gates and everybody behind him are literal Nazis carrying
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.720]  out genocide against all of us. You understand that. They are killing everybody. In fiction
[26:57.720 --> 27:04.720]  super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic huge global plants
[27:04.720 --> 27:09.160]  that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex. And the body told you a year ago
[27:09.160 --> 27:15.600]  back in October of 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the U.N. would roll out a global
[27:15.600 --> 27:21.480]  hysteria and a lot down the planet star billions of people and would be pushing a forced inoculation
[27:21.480 --> 27:25.320]  to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all
[27:25.320 --> 27:30.200]  going to work from home now and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint and
[27:30.200 --> 27:34.720]  the human population. You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia. You tell me
[27:34.720 --> 27:40.080]  that's some type of science fiction comic book. But in reality it really did happen.
[27:40.080 --> 27:45.440]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.160]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago. And we're living in this world Bill Gates
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.840]  is built until we start saying no we are Bill Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill
[27:54.840 --> 28:04.400]  Gates. Hello my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years and I've
[28:04.400 --> 28:11.000]  overseen well. You know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I take my orders
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.040]  from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates. I mean he's not a doctor but he controls everything you
[28:18.040 --> 28:24.600]  do and he now says you're going to take the shots. And of course in England they are now
[28:24.600 --> 28:30.440]  saying what I told you you will not be allowed to travel. Leave your home until you take
[28:30.440 --> 28:38.480]  all the shots. Dr. Gates I mean Bill Gates your owner your master says you will have
[28:38.480 --> 28:47.960]  to take four to five COVID shots a year for adult, two for baby, baby much more manageable.
[28:47.960 --> 28:56.360]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine. I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[28:56.360 --> 29:01.760]  2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time you've got to save right there in your
[29:01.760 --> 29:07.600]  browser and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms. But most
[29:07.600 --> 29:14.360]  importantly via text, message, email or by word of mouth because they have banned the
[29:14.360 --> 29:21.440]  links to banned.video. But 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the side of the exact same links
[29:21.440 --> 29:27.560]  the exact same videos where you can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring
[29:27.560 --> 29:32.280]  because the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.360]  this out and since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech I mean he's
[29:36.360 --> 29:39.720]  modern situation. Well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit
[29:39.720 --> 29:44.360]  here and cry because he has to take an action. We the people are taking action now you can
[29:44.360 --> 29:49.280]  do it very very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com and checking out the
[29:49.280 --> 29:59.320]  new redesigned infowars.com and share that link. Oh that really upsets them oh yeah.
[29:59.320 --> 30:07.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:07.840 --> 30:31.280]  I want to hear you scream and defy it against their enemy. I want to see you win. Because
[30:31.280 --> 30:32.280]  together is the only chance we have of overriding these tyrants. By facing the true heart of
[30:32.280 --> 30:37.560]  what they're up to we have more than a fighting chance. We have God's guarantee of victory.
[30:37.560 --> 30:44.240]  Those of us who are to lay down our blood, our sweat, our tears, our treasure, our very
[30:44.240 --> 30:52.640]  commitment, a cellular soul level. You have my commitment. People ask how do I have so
[30:52.640 --> 31:00.280]  much energy? How do I get so focused on air? This is all real my friends. When I read when
[31:00.280 --> 31:05.000]  I was like 15 years old, one of the big Brzezinski's books where he bragged about putting pole
[31:05.000 --> 31:12.520]  pot in power so that pole pot could kill a third of the population. Then I went and researched
[31:12.520 --> 31:16.880]  the killing fields in Cambodia. I was like who is this guy? Then I would see him for
[31:16.880 --> 31:23.640]  the rest of my life on TV being praised. I read his book where he bragged about I didn't
[31:23.640 --> 31:30.320]  kill a third of Cambodia. I just put pole pot in and had him do it. I'd watch him on
[31:30.320 --> 31:36.520]  C-Span at CFR meetings with sycophant old people going, Your Majesty, all because he
[31:36.520 --> 31:43.840]  killed so many people. These are killers. You don't get up in the hierarchy of the new
[31:43.840 --> 31:47.480]  world order unless you're killing people. Let me tell you who's running genocide worldwide.
[31:47.480 --> 31:57.560]  His name is William Gates III. I can tell you Bill Gates has had his finger hovering
[31:57.560 --> 32:03.920]  over the button many times to have me killed. He's had it hovering over trying to get the
[32:03.920 --> 32:10.400]  FBI and the Justice Department to indict me. I'm not saying that to try to act all adventurous
[32:10.400 --> 32:18.360]  and cool this real folks. You know what? I have absolutely no fear of them. I have fear
[32:18.360 --> 32:24.240]  that my Heavenly Father will look at me and see that I have not given my full attack against
[32:24.240 --> 32:34.120]  these globalists. What are you doing to fight the globalists? I know you're fighting hard,
[32:34.120 --> 32:39.960]  but look at the new redesigned beautiful M4s. Nightmare confirmed. Planetary ruler Bill
[32:39.960 --> 32:44.760]  Gates announces lockdowns will never end. And he goes right through where he says it
[32:44.760 --> 32:51.400]  on video and he's your planetary ruler through medical tyranny and big tech. It's all true.
[32:51.400 --> 33:01.340]  That's the year 2020. And look at the subheadlines. Gates and Rockefeller Foundation documents
[33:01.340 --> 33:09.840]  details for a planned permanent worldwide lockdown. Last night Bill Gates publicly confirmed
[33:09.840 --> 33:15.680]  the plan is being implemented. The civilization as we know it is over. Go watch the 8.5 minutes.
[33:15.680 --> 33:23.200]  He says more than that. So let's look at a few clips of what he said in the past just
[33:23.200 --> 33:30.720]  the last few months. Here he is a month or so ago with Anderson Cooper talking about
[33:30.720 --> 33:36.760]  how there will never be a cure. See, it's a perfect problem that there is no solution,
[33:36.760 --> 33:40.040]  but you're a guinea pig now. And it doesn't matter if it kills hundreds of millions of
[33:40.040 --> 33:44.920]  people, the lockdown, well, if it saves one person, the sickness, the death of logic and
[33:44.920 --> 33:48.280]  they can only get away with this because the death of logic. They're all sociopathic
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.480]  mathematicians. And the fact that the general mass square doesn't understand that it's not
[33:54.480 --> 33:58.040]  even as bad as the flu. They're counting all the flu deaths and pneumonia deaths. And
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.480]  hard part of tax and cancer is that the fact that they can't understand that it wasn't
[34:02.480 --> 34:06.600]  2.5 million dead, like they said, and that the hospitals were empty. And the fact that
[34:06.600 --> 34:11.320]  they can't understand that millions have already starved to death much, much worse than COVID.
[34:11.320 --> 34:17.440]  The fact that the public can't navigate that and doesn't have logic just makes them so
[34:17.440 --> 34:22.080]  happy. And you look at Governor Newsom and all these psychotics and Governor Whitmer,
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.720]  and they all have that same demonic look on their face because they're of one spirit,
[34:27.720 --> 34:33.600]  a lion going about seeing who it can devour. And a lot of people are going to sit back
[34:33.600 --> 34:37.640]  and go, well, there are too many people. I mean, I know a lot of leftists, they're like,
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.320]  Alex, come on, there are too many Africans. Well, okay, so you're going to go pick which
[34:42.320 --> 34:47.040]  ones to kill? You dumbass, as if you aren't going to get exterminated too, you idiot.
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.960]  We have to figure out ways to help people and build civilization and develop systems
[34:50.960 --> 34:54.160]  and go to the next level. We're not going to have a system where we kill old people
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.160]  and kill handicapped children and kill the black people and kill the poor people and
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.120]  do all this crap because the globalists want the power to do that because they like it.
[35:03.120 --> 35:07.760]  They've done direct policies to block development in Africa and to keep people dumbed down
[35:07.760 --> 35:13.440]  and in squalor. Look what they're doing to everybody here. It's the same thing.
[35:13.440 --> 35:18.840]  And those of you that pretend because you're a rich Hispanic academic or white academic,
[35:18.840 --> 35:22.680]  the worst are black academics. They're most of them are on board with this. We'll tell
[35:22.680 --> 35:27.640]  you, we got to get rid of the black people. I say this, we need to get rid of you. How
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.080]  about that? Oh, but don't forget the best part. They weaponize Africa and then open
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.240]  our borders and then bring in military-aged men, brainwashed to hate white people. Because
[35:38.240 --> 35:41.960]  they learned to hate white people like Bill Gates and then they bring them here to kill
[35:41.960 --> 35:48.600]  us. And the average dumbass sits there and doesn't even get three-dimensional operations
[35:48.600 --> 35:54.520]  like this. The operations are much more complex than third-dimensional. They're up at fifth,
[35:54.520 --> 35:58.680]  sixth, seventh-dimensional operations. People like Gates can't see that high. He's just
[35:58.680 --> 36:05.760]  a front man for Satan. I can. And many of you can as well. And in fact, putting yourself
[36:05.760 --> 36:09.360]  against the enemy if you want real enlightenment for all you occultists and people out there
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.800]  that think you have enlightenment through obscurance, no, true enlightenment is through
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.040]  vision and opening up the light. But you claim you are the illuminated when you are the opposite.
[36:20.040 --> 36:25.120]  Everything you do is about bringing darkness and hiding the light because you're of your
[36:25.120 --> 36:31.120]  father, the devil. So all of us, despite the horrible things that are happening, should
[36:31.120 --> 36:36.560]  think our lucky stars that we're not Bill Gates and we're not part of his satanic order.
[36:36.560 --> 36:38.800]  You know what? We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and play the Anderson
[36:38.800 --> 36:42.800]  Cooper clip and I'm going to play all the other clips where he says this is just a drill,
[36:42.800 --> 36:46.600]  the big bio attacks coming and where they admit the vaccine is making 100% of people
[36:46.600 --> 36:54.480]  sick. The other vaccine, 80% and 700,000 are going to get sick. Unbelievable. Let's get
[36:54.480 --> 36:57.760]  Leo Zagami on. He's been on fire lately. He's really been breaking it down. But let
[36:57.760 --> 37:03.160]  me just spend a little bit of time on this. Two things. We're going to break. We run
[37:03.160 --> 37:08.520]  this operation is funding. This is about to dawn. This is a new product we're very, very
[37:08.520 --> 37:14.200]  excited about. This is a product that by tomorrow we'll be gone. Eight pack power stack with
[37:14.200 --> 37:20.000]  their sellouts a day or tomorrow. And despite that, it's still 60% off, free shipping, 13
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.920]  different pills, take it in the morning in the evening, change someone's lives, became
[37:23.920 --> 37:27.480]  a best seller. But because the lockdown, the shutdown and the supply chain break down,
[37:27.480 --> 37:30.360]  we can't get some of the ingredients, some of the pills. So it's got to be discontinued
[37:30.360 --> 37:36.640]  because we can't get it anymore. That's how broke down the system is. It's your last
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.600]  chance to fund the info war and experience a pack power stack at infowarstore.com. Those
[37:41.600 --> 37:44.920]  of you that loved it stock up, those that want to give it to a loved one, get them a big
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.080]  boost to get them into vitamins and minerals. You take it in the morning, you take it in
[37:49.080 --> 37:52.800]  the evening. People experience how amazing it is. It changes their lives. They get into
[37:52.800 --> 37:58.280]  vitamins. They get into minerals of all that's going on in the environment, the crazy things.
[37:58.280 --> 38:04.400]  This is the ultimate booster for the immune system and so much more infowarstore.com.
[38:04.400 --> 38:13.120]  A pack power stack. Watch come Thursday. This product's gone, gone, gone. There's 600 units
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.120]  left of this. It will probably be sold by tonight. And then it's gone. I said a mar to
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.920]  be safe because I don't want to tell you something that didn't true. So in a way, I kind of lie.
[38:20.920 --> 38:23.960]  I kind of always make it a little bit better than it is or add something on so to make
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.040]  sure I'm right. Two days it's gone for sure. See how that works? Trying to tell the total
[38:29.040 --> 38:31.400]  truth. Like it'll be sold out by the day, but then I think, well, maybe it won't be.
[38:31.400 --> 38:35.640]  So I'll say tomorrow, but is that a lie? No, it's the best dead reckoning I've got separately.
[38:35.640 --> 38:41.360]  This is new. This is super strong types of industrial iodine, not for ingestion, says
[38:41.360 --> 38:47.560]  it on the bottle. This is not good for you. This is poisonous. But it's super strong.
[38:47.560 --> 38:54.920]  You want something for surfaces, hard surfaces, things like that. This is it. Nation iodine
[38:54.920 --> 38:59.280]  surface spray with a bunch of different types of industrial iodine, high powered cleaning
[38:59.280 --> 39:04.600]  agent. And boy, it's a good deal out of the gates. It just came in about a month ago.
[39:04.600 --> 39:10.040]  We hadn't put it on sale of it. So busy 1995. You're not going to find a cleaning agent
[39:10.040 --> 39:13.600]  like this anywhere. And by the way, you can water this down. It still has an incredible
[39:13.600 --> 39:20.960]  effect. This is super strong. Do not ingest it. It's not to be confused with our X two
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.600]  that has a spray nozzle on it. That's selling out. That's still discounted at info or store
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.320]  dot com. And we've only got six days left. And the info works total blowout because everything's
[39:29.320 --> 39:33.360]  basically sold out. A lot of stuff's going to come back in, but not till next year. So
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.520]  info or store dot com and thank you all for your support. And you've got our commitment
[39:37.520 --> 39:41.360]  to not back down and on waiver in the face of these murdering tyrants. Because my boss
[39:41.360 --> 39:46.400]  is the big guy and he tells me attack, attack, attack. And the president tells me press the
[39:46.400 --> 39:50.960]  attack as well. President tells me what we're doing is quote, perfect. Well, I don't know
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.920]  about that. We're trying as hard as we can. Stay with us. Take orders from Jesus Christ.
[39:55.920 --> 40:01.000]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.840]  and who give their power unto the one world leader, the anti Christ. And he has a beast
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.840]  system that no one can buy and or sell. Unless he has that market in the forehead or in the
[40:11.840 --> 40:17.600]  palm of their hand. And we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the
[40:17.600 --> 40:23.160]  common sense that you don't believe in God or prophecy, giving governments and corporations
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.560]  the power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do. He's not just
[40:28.560 --> 40:33.920]  a recipe. It's a blueprint for total enslavement. And now you look at Bill Gates, you look at
[40:33.920 --> 40:38.880]  Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats. We should decide how much salt
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.560]  you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get. We're technocrats. We know
[40:43.560 --> 40:47.920]  best. We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[40:47.920 --> 40:52.920]  You snap your fingers. We're here. They're just rolling it out. And a lot of people are
[40:52.920 --> 40:58.800]  complying with it. It's insane for more than 100 years. The Rockefeller Foundation has
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.880]  worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by
[41:03.880 --> 41:09.360]  taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine. Now, they
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.800]  had a bad name by the 1920s. They started converting over and funding other organizations
[41:14.800 --> 41:21.680]  and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations. Fast forward to the 1980s,
[41:21.680 --> 41:27.880]  the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III,
[41:27.880 --> 41:32.160]  his father, of course, being had a Planned Parenthood. And now he's been able to position
[41:32.160 --> 41:38.520]  himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[41:38.520 --> 41:44.520]  Bill Gates is in control. They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned to be able
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.920]  to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body. This is the holy grail of
[41:49.920 --> 41:57.240]  their operations. And now they're normalizing, putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[41:57.240 --> 42:02.040]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much
[42:02.040 --> 42:07.400]  less in the entire world. Info wars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks
[42:07.400 --> 42:13.360]  at hundreds of stations picking us up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering
[42:13.360 --> 42:18.880]  real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.040]  globalist death agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at band
[42:24.040 --> 42:30.040]  on video. They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why it's
[42:30.040 --> 42:35.760]  so precious because censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring
[42:35.760 --> 42:40.840]  and controlling what you can say and do. It's going to be the OACs, black band on video,
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.880]  and the now redesigned info wars.com that become more and more important, which they
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.320]  are. And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging
[42:50.320 --> 42:54.880]  us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now because they're coming after everyone.
[42:54.880 --> 42:56.800]  So spread the word now.
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.680]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[43:01.680 --> 43:07.400]  GPS location. I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because
[43:07.400 --> 43:13.040]  that was un-American. Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that
[43:13.040 --> 43:18.280]  are on Apple and on Droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where
[43:18.280 --> 43:23.960]  you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other
[43:23.960 --> 43:28.840]  of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to
[43:28.840 --> 43:34.800]  what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts
[43:34.800 --> 43:39.440]  of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever. Your phone is spying on
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.600]  you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information. This is the Global
[43:44.600 --> 43:50.520]  Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarsore.com
[43:50.520 --> 43:55.320]  and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarsore.com.
[44:20.520 --> 44:28.280]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live
[44:28.280 --> 44:32.520]  from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[44:37.520 --> 44:39.520]  The sound of hooves knocked at your door.
[44:39.520 --> 44:51.920]  Now you've got some company. Bill Gates is coming nearer. The Four Horsemen of Death
[44:51.920 --> 45:02.000]  he rides. He comes to take your life. On to the dead of night. You'll see the Four Horsemen
[45:02.000 --> 45:11.440]  ride. So choose your death and die. Oh, yeah. You've been dying since the day you were born.
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.880]  You know, it's all been planned. A center once, a center twice. You need no confession
[45:15.880 --> 45:19.360]  now. Because now you've got the fight of your life.
[45:23.880 --> 45:30.400]  All right, let's go ahead and talk about cold hard facts. What does a post-industrial world
[45:30.400 --> 45:43.400]  mean? Well, Karl Marx talked about it. Engels talked about it. Isaac Asimov wrote about
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.280]  it. And he later admitted that it was actually part of the future of society that he was
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.680]  involved in, that it was actually planning some of the things he put in his books back
[45:50.680 --> 45:58.400]  in the 40s and 50s and 60s that were being introduced to the public. And the plan is
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.400]  to get robots and automation up to a point where humans don't have to work anymore. You
[46:03.400 --> 46:09.320]  heard about, oh, by 2020 there'll be a two-day work week, but now you work more than ever.
[46:09.320 --> 46:16.120]  Because they decided, and Bill Joy wrote about this in Wired Magazine in 2000, and why the
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.400]  future doesn't need us, they decided that you're obsolete, that you're non-essential.
[46:21.400 --> 46:26.680]  They decided they're not going to let you sit around on that cruise ship like Wally enjoying
[46:26.680 --> 46:34.160]  yourself and weighing 500 pounds. They're just going to entertain you, put robots in
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.960]  charge and have you sign agreements to be sterilized and then to go on certain drugs
[46:38.960 --> 46:45.880]  and basically anesthetize yourself until you agree to go to a euthanasia facility and
[46:45.880 --> 46:54.360]  be killed. Notice you see that in films like Soil and Green. They admit they've been implanting
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.680]  those messages for this point. But see, you still wanted to go to a human to have your
[46:58.680 --> 47:04.840]  car fixed. You still wanted to go grow a garden. You were going real sustainable, not what
[47:04.840 --> 47:08.800]  they were selling as sustainable. You were going away from their system. You were getting
[47:08.800 --> 47:13.560]  into fitness. You were getting into organic. You were becoming spiritual again. They didn't
[47:13.560 --> 47:19.280]  know what to do. And so they said, we'll have a global shutdown claiming it's a virus that
[47:19.280 --> 47:22.600]  will give global government power to implement it. We'll have to have tracking systems for
[47:22.600 --> 47:26.800]  it and then we'll decide what's essential and what's not and only say big corporations
[47:26.800 --> 47:33.520]  can stay open to consolidate power and they've all doubled their money roughly. Gates, Bezos,
[47:33.520 --> 47:39.520]  all of them the last year because it's their war on us. It's their big gamble. It's their
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.960]  big move. It's their big plan. Day one, it was about surveilling us. Day one, it was
[47:43.960 --> 47:50.520]  about making us obsolete. Day one, it was about destroying us because that's what conquerors
[47:50.520 --> 47:55.880]  do they believe. They believe in social Darwinism. They believe by doing this, they're flexing
[47:55.880 --> 48:01.400]  their evolutionary muscles and culling off the weak while they set up the whole system
[48:01.400 --> 48:08.400]  to make us as weak as possible and to make us not stand up to them.
[48:08.400 --> 48:14.040]  So let's go to some of these clips. Here is Gates talking about how the pandemic never
[48:14.040 --> 48:18.800]  ends. You see, because they picked something, the common cold that he now made a patented
[48:18.800 --> 48:23.840]  synthetic version of that spreads really good. So you're all suspect and the plan is that
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.560]  he controls everything and he directs through corporations and blue cities and blue states
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.280]  and other globalist controlled areas around the world. And then it doesn't matter what
[48:32.280 --> 48:39.280]  nation leaders do because they've got corporate control. It's very simple and the corporate
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.360]  minions go along with it because they get short term power out of it, even though their
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.520]  kids are getting fried by 5G, even though they're drinking fluoride, they don't care
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.800]  because they feel like they're in on the big plan. And that's what's really sick is I
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.760]  thought in the 26 years I've been on air that until the last five years or so that most
[48:57.760 --> 49:02.760]  low low people didn't know. But instead, as we expose this and others expose it, the
[49:02.760 --> 49:06.760]  globalist said, thank you. More people have joined us now because they're scared and they
[49:06.760 --> 49:15.320]  want to be on the winning team. How do you get on a winning team that is for total depopulation
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.160]  and destruction and an attack on the species itself? Oh, what, you've got a nice boat and
[49:19.160 --> 49:26.280]  a nice house for another decade? What's scum? But here he is with Anderson Cooper, whose
[49:26.280 --> 49:34.760]  brother killed himself. He himself as a little boy was fed into the human sacrifice grid
[49:34.760 --> 49:45.720]  of pedophile sex, the evidence points towards one of the heirs, the richest families on
[49:45.720 --> 49:50.560]  earth. Here he is with Bill Gates saying it never ends. It never ends. Here it is. You've
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.960]  talked about the some of the sophisticated tools, the therapeutics that that are coming
[49:55.960 --> 50:02.040]  and that some some are here. Can you just talk a little bit? Let's talk about Regeneron.
[50:02.040 --> 50:06.760]  You've been optimistic about about it. It got obviously a big endorsement from President
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.960]  Trump because he was able to to receive it. He's calling it a cure. He's calling on regulators
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.720]  to give an emergency use authorization. Do you support the idea of the emergency use authorization
[50:16.720 --> 50:25.400]  and I assume it's not a cure? No, well, the word cure is a bit of an over promise. You
[50:25.400 --> 50:30.000]  know, that makes it sound it looks like works for everyone and the whole concern about this
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.040]  disease should go away. And that's the last thing we want people think about.
[50:34.040 --> 50:38.400]  Oh, it doesn't ever go away. The lockdown never ends. We just tuned in. He said, oh,
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.240]  at least 10 years and then there's never a normal. You'll never have entertainment again.
[50:42.240 --> 50:47.440]  I mean, we're going to decide what is essential activity and what isn't. See how that works?
[50:47.440 --> 50:52.840]  The computer, the iPhone, the droid, the AI, it decides what you do. And this artificial
[50:52.840 --> 50:58.040]  intelligence isn't some godlike independent intelligence. It's a program system of a
[50:58.040 --> 51:01.920]  straight jacket that makes you behave the way it wants you to behave.
[51:01.920 --> 51:11.200]  So let's play this first clip. Gates, we don't want politicians saying which COVID drugs.
[51:11.200 --> 51:14.960]  This is for meat, the press. Then we have Bill Gates on the next bio attack that's coming.
[51:14.960 --> 51:19.520]  Oh, the next one, because this was a bio attack from him. And he's confronted about vaccine
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.760]  side effects. Let's let's let's go to the next clip.
[51:23.760 --> 51:29.080]  This is the rules there. If this is where we are, is it basically mean that the vaccine
[51:29.080 --> 51:32.040]  is our only hope of getting back to normal?
[51:32.040 --> 51:39.120]  Yeah, well, society should be able to have things like schooling that get a priority
[51:39.120 --> 51:44.840]  versus a certain more entertainment related things. And I guess, you know, politicians
[51:44.840 --> 51:45.840]  will will show.
[51:45.840 --> 51:51.160]  Okay, so that's good. We played that earlier. Then he goes into how it never ends 10 years.
[51:51.160 --> 51:55.000]  We've got to have a vaccine that he produces. Here's the next one. Bill Gates bio attack
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.040]  is next. Here he is on cobear. Four months ago, months after I said this is a drill.
[52:00.040 --> 52:04.760]  It's a test with a simulant live virus to make us all guilty that he owns. So now that
[52:04.760 --> 52:08.560]  the common cold will say you have it. So we're all suspect forever. That's a problem that
[52:08.560 --> 52:12.600]  can never be fixed. Remember how many times I said that hundreds. Now he just announced
[52:12.600 --> 52:17.840]  it last night. But but here he is at the time saying terrorist with a bigger bio attack,
[52:17.840 --> 52:22.440]  you're deadly, you're coming. So this is all a lockdown test to train you to stay in your
[52:22.440 --> 52:27.520]  home when the real bio weapon comes and kills your ass. Here it is saying. What else are
[52:27.520 --> 52:35.920]  we not listening to that we need to take action on now? Well, the the idea of a a bioterrorist
[52:35.920 --> 52:40.960]  attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because they're a pathogen with a high death rate
[52:40.960 --> 52:47.760]  would be ticked. Now the good news is, okay, depression is up to late now. Most of work
[52:47.760 --> 52:54.320]  we're going to do to be ready for pandemic two. I call this pandemic one. Most work will
[52:54.320 --> 53:00.440]  do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of a
[53:00.440 --> 53:04.280]  bioterrorism. That's right. First, you get the chains on, you get a strap down to the
[53:04.280 --> 53:08.960]  bed, then you start the raping. It's all about raping. Literally for your own genetics and
[53:08.960 --> 53:11.840]  then actually killing you slowly, then Bill Gates laughs about it because he says he wants
[53:11.840 --> 53:15.360]  to kill you. I mean, that wants to save the earth. He's a savior. Here he is confronted
[53:15.360 --> 53:20.800]  on CBS News about the fact that most people taking the vaccine are getting sick and it
[53:20.800 --> 53:24.120]  doesn't even work, which he had said last night doesn't work either. It doesn't matter.
[53:24.120 --> 53:28.760]  That means you get more shots from him. Again, he's your boss. He's your God. Here it is.
[53:28.760 --> 53:35.320]  Dernivaccine sound concerning. We looked after the second dose, at least 80% of participants
[53:35.320 --> 53:44.240]  experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers. So are these
[53:44.240 --> 53:55.640]  vaccines safe? Well, the FDA not being pressured will look hard at that. The FDA is the gold
[53:55.640 --> 54:03.120]  standard of regulators and their current guidance on this. If they stick with that is very,
[54:03.120 --> 54:12.440]  very appropriate. And, you know, the side effects were not super severe that it didn't
[54:12.440 --> 54:18.640]  cause permanent health problems for the things that they, you know, Moderna did have to go
[54:18.640 --> 54:25.080]  with the fairly high dose. And so, you know, to get the antibodies again, why do they have
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.200]  to have the new vaccine they're coming out with as a vector using measles? Because the
[54:29.200 --> 54:32.560]  body doesn't recognize COVID is strong enough to have an auto immune response. Because it's
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.400]  so broad. See how the scam works. See how it works. Keep your baby comfortable. Well,
[54:38.400 --> 54:46.160]  keep it comfortable while we cut it. It's okay. Governor Blackface says stay with us.
[54:46.160 --> 54:50.280]  You noticed that over and over again, the United Nations are supposed controllers and
[54:50.280 --> 54:54.040]  bosses. The great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come out
[54:54.040 --> 55:00.800]  and said nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19. Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[55:00.800 --> 55:05.640]  You get a lot of sunlight. It's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and it's almost
[55:05.640 --> 55:10.080]  impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3. If you have
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.520]  zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter
[55:14.520 --> 55:18.920]  because that's a vitamin D levels plunge. Now, I've pointed this out and the media has
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.720]  called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins
[55:23.720 --> 55:27.760]  and their minerals. Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need
[55:27.760 --> 55:33.640]  vitamin D3 and C. He should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.880]  without zinc, but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.960]  so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that
[55:41.960 --> 55:46.840]  he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[55:46.840 --> 55:53.160]  Info Wars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against
[55:53.160 --> 55:59.640]  tyranny. You built Info Wars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products.
[55:59.640 --> 56:05.000]  You called in. You made recommendations. Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine and that's
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.320]  why the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.320]  attack, in many ways, we've become stronger. With Band-Aught Video, redesigned Info Wars
[56:15.320 --> 56:22.520]  with all of our great crew, with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.840]  day, we are the resistance. You are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.280]  for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because
[56:33.280 --> 56:37.040]  this is something we built together. It's not just a national treasure. It's a treasure
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.400]  worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it. And as everything
[56:41.400 --> 57:08.680]  we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together. So I salute you all.
[57:08.680 --> 57:18.720]  The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 to
[57:18.720 --> 57:27.240]  the World Food Programme for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected
[57:27.240 --> 57:37.520]  areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a
[57:37.520 --> 57:43.120]  weapon of war and conflict. I am delighted by the decision of the Nobel
[57:43.120 --> 57:48.800]  Committee to award this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations' World Food Programme.
[57:48.800 --> 57:54.040]  I warmly congratulate David Bisley, WFP Executive Director, and the entire staff of the World
[57:54.040 --> 57:58.120]  Food Programme on this recognition. Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us like
[57:58.120 --> 58:09.600]  global food crisis looms. The United Nations is warning the coronavirus crisis has put
[58:09.600 --> 58:16.720]  the world on the brink of a hunger pandemic. 265 million people could face acute food shortages
[58:16.720 --> 58:21.480]  by the end of the year. That is double last year's projections.
[58:21.480 --> 58:26.920]  This is what hunger looks like when it spills over into the streets. A food stampede in
[58:26.920 --> 58:31.520]  Kenya's largest slum, leaving schools injured and two dead.
[58:31.520 --> 58:43.520]  If you want to be exploited and if you want to have many more body bugs, then you do it.
[58:43.520 --> 58:50.200]  If you don't want many more body bugs, then you refrain from politicizing it.
[58:50.200 --> 58:57.920]  I think we've got to recognize that some of these UN bodies on the WHO is an iconic example.
[58:57.920 --> 59:04.160]  They have actually been subject to a hostile takeover by the Chinese state in recent years.
[59:04.160 --> 59:09.400]  The rest of us have under-invested in them, and therefore they have been bought cheaply
[59:09.400 --> 59:15.040]  by China, which is now using them for its political and strategic purposes.
[59:15.040 --> 59:19.400]  That's how crazy this is. The UN publicly runs the lockdown, publicly says they want
[59:19.400 --> 59:23.440]  to repopulate, publicly are caught adding steriles in the vaccines, publicly are running
[59:23.440 --> 59:27.480]  these blockades, publicly are blocking good medicines going into Africa, publicly blew
[59:27.480 --> 59:31.960]  up Libya, publicly overthrew all of their countries to make it destabilized, then publicly
[59:31.960 --> 59:35.120]  organized and collapsed from our borders. But they're the good guys.
[59:35.120 --> 59:39.600]  This peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic has been rocked by fresh allegations
[59:39.600 --> 59:46.080]  of rape by troops. One of the victims was reportedly a minor. Reuters, citing UN sources,
[59:46.080 --> 59:51.400]  said three females were raped by peacekeepers from Democratic Republic of the Congo. A spokesperson
[59:51.400 --> 59:54.280]  for the UN Secretary General addressed reporters.
[59:54.280 --> 59:59.320]  These new allegations concern a report that three young females were raped by three members
[59:59.320 --> 1:00:04.520]  of a Manuska military contingent. The troop contributing country has been asked to indicate
[1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:10.320]  within 10 days if it intends to investigate the allegation itself. Should the member state
[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:16.040]  decline to investigate or fail to respond, the United Nations will rapidly conduct its
[1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:23.560]  own investigation. We're looking at a formulaic takeover. And I harp on COVID as the catalyst
[1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:30.360]  for the takeover at an office that could change the way a lot of Americans work a tech company
[1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:36.120]  in Wisconsin is offering to implant implant tiny microchips into its employees. Many
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:41.720]  of the employees, including the CEO, will voluntarily have the microchips implanted
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:47.560]  into their bodies. And they're calling it, I'm not kidding here, a chips and salsa party.
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:53.680]  If we don't oppose this revolution that they're trying to bring in and then normalize, we
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:58.240]  don't have any hope into the future. Microsoft announced no more Microsoft buildings, no
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:03.000]  more people coming in. You must work from home. Well, that's part of phasing you out
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.840]  with the AI and showing you just how obsolete you are.
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:12.920]  All right, folks, this is hardcore stuff we're covering, but it's the reality. And humanity
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:17.240]  can come together and defeat this. But the permanent house arrest of freedom is what
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:21.200]  we're talking about. It's all out in the open. It's a banned video. You can decide to fight
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:25.480]  back where you just roll over and die. Carlos Zapata, a veteran of Patriot, very well-spoken
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:28.960]  fellow who's been standing up to tyranny and who explained that a violent revolution's
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:32.880]  coming of the left keeps trying to starve us out under the siege operation. He'll be joining
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:37.440]  us. Dan Lyman has big international headlines. German ministers are saying in full force,
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:43.080]  broke huge story of a giant anti-foot command base. And then we got footage of them being
[1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:48.800]  routed out in Berlin. It's all coming up as humanity stands up on time legs and starts
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:54.120]  to fight.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:59.480]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life? Are you sleeping too well at night?
[1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:08.960]  Is your city too safe? Well, not anymore. Introducing Democrats. Politicians so incompetent
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:16.320]  they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.760]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity. No more
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:29.080]  pesky law and order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats,
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:34.560]  get back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground. But wait, vote for Democrats
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:41.000]  now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:12.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:19.200]  Okay, I just did an hour live standing up here in studio, TV viewers. And what Bill Gates
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:25.240]  came out and said last night on national television blew me away so hard that I am just in a blind
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:31.720]  rage right now. I mean, he said permanent lockdown at least 10 years, forced inoculations,
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:38.360]  total control, the whole world collapsing, financial destruction to save one tenth of
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:46.080]  1% of 1%. I mean, it's just crazy. Their whole admitted battle plan. What do you as listeners
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:51.920]  think about this, ladies and gentlemen? We have Carlos Zapata, who set up a few months
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:57.160]  ago in California and explained this is military siege, the lockdowns are throwing small businesses
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:01.880]  causing mass suicide. He said that we the people will take back civilization. He's going
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:07.080]  to be joining us for a second visit. And I'm not somebody that wants physical confrontation,
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:10.920]  but when they're shutting your economy off to consolidate it when they're trying to forcibly
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:14.920]  inoculate you, they're trying to implode the third world and starve them to death to then
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:19.560]  flood us with the third world as a weapon. We're under military corporate spiritual
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:27.480]  attack, economic attack. And we have a right and a duty to say no and to stand up against
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:33.360]  it. The question is, how do we do that? Well, first we warn the people and we expose who's
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:37.400]  behind it and we try to get Congress and the president and others to act and the governors
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:43.200]  to say no to this. It's why it's so sick to see the governor of Texas basically becoming
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:48.640]  Gavin Newsom, Jr. The mini me of Gavin Newsom. Paul Joseph Watson's coming up as well. Dan
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:53.360]  Lyman just broke a huge story. But I think the special report we put out is very important.
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:56.640]  I'm going to I'm going to play this and then I'm going to come back and hit the latest
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:04.520]  election news, the latest Democrat plan for civil war. They're now publicly announcing.
[1:05:04.520 --> 1:05:07.480]  And of course, what the Democrats are talking about packing the Supreme Court, what that
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:15.120]  would look like. It's all coming up. But first, we just played the permanent House arrest
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:21.480]  of freedom, the permanent martial law lockdown announced by Bill Gates. And I got great guests
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:24.880]  and I'm glad we got these guests. And today's the day I should probably show up with the
[1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:28.760]  phones up and think, what do you think about Gates being in charge of everything and saying
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:32.240]  he wants to depopulate you? But boy, he's got this shot. He really wants you to take
[1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:37.440]  this new vaccine that reprograms yourselves and making so many people sick. How obvious
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:42.280]  is this? How ridiculous is this? But again, it's got to be hidden in plain view because
[1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:48.520]  they've noticed. If you hide it in plain view, people aren't scared of it. And they acclimate
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:52.440]  to it and they cozy up to it and they go along with it. But it's up to those of us that are
[1:05:52.440 --> 1:06:00.600]  leaders and see through this to say no. So here's the report. Medical tyranny is upending
[1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:07.240]  your existence. I mean, this is how 21st century warfare operates. This is how the system
[1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:14.040]  takes over. This is how it executes. This is how it gets it done. And it's happening
[1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:22.200]  now. And it's sick that Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation in lockstep and in
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:27.480]  event 201 and other documents admit all of it. That's what's so painful. I try to argue
[1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:36.120]  with people I know. Like I've got family that are smart people and they aren't even Democrats.
[1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:41.160]  But when they see the news saying there is no treatment, there is no therapeutic eight
[1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:46.440]  months ago and I'm like, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc. Here's the NIH website. Plus it's
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:50.680]  known if you have these vitamins at high levels, you basically can't get viral infections
[1:06:50.680 --> 1:06:57.480]  because they can't manufacture inside the mitochondria. It's like, what are you a virologist?
[1:06:57.480 --> 1:07:03.760]  What are you a biologist? And I'm like, what I am is somebody that can read the medical
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:09.920]  literature. And man, I can't tell you how many family members and how many lawyers
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:18.120]  I know and one of the guys, a couple of them are federal agents. They come to me and they
[1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:21.840]  go, God, I thought you were full of it. Alex Fauci just said, you got to have vitamin D
[1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:32.520]  or C or you'll die. I mean, I'm not a botanist, but I know plants need sunlight or they die.
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:42.680]  I'm not a farmer, but I know plants need water or they die. It's called essential. And I
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:47.800]  go back to that because if the public, because the public has shown a problem, hey, there's
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:52.280]  this problem, society shutting down. People believe, well, there must not be a solution
[1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:56.160]  or they wouldn't be doing this. I get why people have cognitive dissonance. They automatically
[1:07:56.160 --> 1:08:02.280]  go, well, Alex, come on, you know, like medical doctors go 100% of patients that do this
[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:06.320]  inhaled steroid. It's an autoimmune response. They're safe. Trump got it. Feels great. He
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:11.920]  obviously already had infections. They cleaned out his blood. Great. That's what Trump feels
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:16.200]  so good. He obviously had preexisting conditions. Heather said he got all this, you know, souped
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:22.480]  up transfusion, basically a blood transfusion. He got, he's feeling great. When we told the
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:26.000]  doctors, I'll do anything. They said, yes, sir. Well, I was wrong about what's going
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.280]  on. Looks like what they do what they were doing. But regardless, here's the report.
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:34.640]  We'll come back and get into the news. People ask questions about the deaths that have occurred
[1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:39.280]  due to particular vaccine. And this always gets blown up in the media. One should be
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:44.880]  able to give a very factual account of what exactly is happening, what the cause of deaths
[1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.800]  are. But in most cases, there's some obfuscation at that level. And therefore there's less
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:55.960]  and less trust than in the system. It was the UN back in December last year said, hey,
[1:08:55.960 --> 1:09:00.600]  vaccines are killing people. They're untested. We need to pause vaccines. The public doesn't
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:03.640]  believe in them. The doctors don't believe in them. But they said, but we're just giving
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:07.560]  them by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and told what to do. So even the UN, the global
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:14.600]  government system itself is just a puppet. And what they say is God halting funding
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:20.080]  for the WHO during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. The world needs
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:25.680]  them now more than ever. Well, the truth is the group actually needs gates more than
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:31.960]  ever. With the US taking a pause, he'll now be their largest active donor. That's right,
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:38.320]  one out of every 10 bucks that the WHO gets is from the world's second wealthiest man.
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.400]  Again, my name is Dr. Tapper, and I'm no stranger to you as this is my third time here addressing
[1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:49.400]  regulations and mask mandates. Imagine a virus so deadly and severe that you have to have
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:54.200]  a test done to find out whether or not you've had it. You guys are basing these numbers
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:59.960]  on positive cases and not hospitalizations or deaths. That's what you should be basing
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:05.000]  those off of. The numbers are hyperinflated by false positives and the never ending doom
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.760]  and gloom from the mainstream media. If the mask mandate turns into a vaccine mandate,
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:14.060]  you will not be allowed to go back to work, earn a paycheck, renew your driver's license
[1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:19.000]  or function in everyday society without proof of the vaccination. We had draconian bills
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.760]  sweeping the nation last year coming after our medical freedoms. And then the coronavirus
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:29.040]  came. The Trojan horse to implement this tyrannical agenda. They say you don't need
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:33.840]  vitamin D, then you can't say as a medical doctor you need vitamin D. They say you don't
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:40.040]  need vitamin C, but the FBI will swat team you. It was a special setup for this raid
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:46.280]  with the FBI putting on PPE as they went inside this medical clinic with a search warrant,
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:52.280]  seeking medical records and physical evidence. The investigation includes allegations that
[1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:57.960]  the clinic provided fraudulent treatments for COVID-19 and that the clinic did not observe
[1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:03.040]  proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus. The FBI spokesperson
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:07.160]  would not say what specific treatment they were investigating, except to say it was on
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:12.880]  the clinic website. We found this posting. We've been using intravenous vitamin C therapy
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:18.840]  to treat COVID-19 and non hospitalized patients with great results. We've been told our whole
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:24.040]  life that vitamin D correlates with a strong immune system. Growthman points to studies
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:29.000]  that suggest vitamin D can reduce your chances of contracting COVID or the severity of your
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  symptoms. He says he's tried for months to get the CDC and other experts to talk about
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.640]  it. Then this week, one of the nation's leading infectious disease experts did. Dr. Anthony
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:44.880]  Fauci mentioned vitamin D during an Instagram live with actress Jennifer Garner. If you
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:51.840]  are deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection.
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:57.240]  But now Fauci said, oh, wait, okay, we'll drop the charges. Fauci's God. So Fauci's
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:03.640]  God, Bill Gates is God, the UN's God, none of us have any rights. But now even the UN's
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:09.480]  head envoy for global COVID-19 response comes out and says, we've got to stop this. This
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:14.040]  is causing millions to die already. Hundreds of millions are going to die. And it's already
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:20.800]  going to be devastating, devastating to our economy. It's going to put millions of people
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:24.200]  out of work. It's going to bankrupt tens of millions in the Western world. But the third
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:28.440]  world, it's already a death sentence. Millions are already dead. And I want the left and
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:34.520]  the Democrats and Fauci engaged to know we know they're behind it so they can be discredited
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:40.920]  and exposed for the progenitors of the Nazis. They're not sons of the Nazis. They're not
[1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:45.560]  neo-Nazis. They're not Nazis. They're the eugenics global scientific control freak
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:50.600]  cult that the Nazis were just a spin off of. But the Nazis wanted to make it based around
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:51.600]  Aryan white people.
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:59.040]  The future isn't coming. It's here. And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:04.280]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset. In
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:10.520]  fact, it's going to be your only asset. The world being built by the technocrats. And
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.880]  the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown. It is the beginning
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:24.480]  of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization. Human
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:30.400]  life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:36.720]  2050. This is their stated goal. I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:42.440]  to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:47.560]  enemy. We turn this around. You must study their own writings. You must face the facts.
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:52.480]  And you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:57.760]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:03.360]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:09.600]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:15.560]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:21.160]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:27.640]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:34.720]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:40.880]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:47.280]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:54.720]  a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:15:01.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:31.960]  It's then tipped off by sources and exclusively got the footage of the raid on a anti-fuck
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:39.280]  stronghold that the city of Berlin had handed over to the terrorist. Dan Lyman of NewsWars.com
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:47.920]  and EuropeWars.com will be joining us coming up next segment. But again, it scares the
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:54.560]  hell out of me that if we didn't have Paul Joseph Watson and Rob Do and Kit Daniels and
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:16:00.920]  Adon Salazar and Kelly McGreen and all the people, I don't know, and Jamie White and
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:04.360]  Ben and a lot of folks that want their full names on there, remember they do. But just
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:09.760]  all the great people we've got, so many times we break it, and then a week later I see it
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:14.960]  in Breitbart, or a week later I see it on CNN, or a week later I see the president saying
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:20.600]  it. Now I got to say, a lot of times I see stuff at Gateway Pundit before we get it.
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:25.600]  And by the way, that's a good feeling. I'm like, yeah, good. They blow us up or put me
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:31.080]  in prison. There's somebody else out there doing original stuff. But we're kicking ass.
[1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:36.840]  And we're very thankful to all of you. Please support us. We've got the Infowars Total Blowout
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:40.040]  sale that has to end in six days because a lot of the products are selling out like
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:44.360]  eight pack power stack. Today or tomorrow it will sell out. Probably, I would say sometime
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:48.160]  late tonight. We can't get the 13 different pills. We can get a lot of them. We can't
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:52.840]  get some of them. So when you can't make a product anymore, when you can't get the product
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:58.080]  anymore, so eight pack power stack has been very, very popular. It's over. It's gone because
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:02.280]  of the lockdown because of the supply chain breakdown. We're trying to reformulate something
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:06.880]  that's just as good, but it's dangerous to do a complex product that has 13 different
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:11.840]  pills in a world like this right now. So we've gotten really spoiled in our supply chain
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:19.040]  to be able to have something this amazing. Your last chance to get it info or store.com
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:24.320]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And separately, again, we
[1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:38.920]  have a whole bunch of items that are very, very soon. Rainforce plus is the final run
[1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:42.760]  because we've decided to upgrade it and make it even better. And every time you reformulate,
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.000]  you've got to change the name. So it was first brain force and brain force plus will be like
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.080]  rainforest plus and everybody loves it. It's our best seller overall. It's 50% off free
[1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:55.760]  shipping selling out ultimate Krill oil, 50% off free shipping, even though it's selling
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:02.200]  out. Surveillance, I tell the 50% off free shipping survival shield X to spray model.
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:09.440]  That's the high quality ingestible high end in a spray bottle, 33% off plus free shipping
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:15.200]  extend to wise final run 60% off plus free shipping because it's hard to get what's in
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:20.400]  it as well that the suppliers broken down, knockout 50% off plus free shipping. That's
[1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:25.640]  1495 with the best sleep aid out there. Melatonin costs more and it's got melatonin in it, but
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:30.200]  it has seven other ingredients. So just a bottle of melatonin with the same dose costs
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:34.320]  more than this because they add all that markup in there. We don't turbo force 10 hour clean
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:40.320]  energy plus free shipping 50% off all t-shirts 1776 like arrest gates and Fauci mask free
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:49.360]  zone all SRL products and SRL products is I was in a medical clinic with a medical doctor
[1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:53.080]  and a lot of them sell nutraceutical grade supplements and I talked to them and almost
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:57.040]  had a deal and then they got scared away because of the politics and they said, but hey, here's
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:01.440]  my supplier that makes it. They had some really great proprietary things. We came out with
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:06.960]  three products and I just never promoted it. I've been so busy so under attack. It's been
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:13.760]  out like six months. I want you to enjoy SRL products because we wanted to come out with
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:18.400]  stuff that wasn't ours that wasn't our company that's diversified because of the platforming.
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:22.840]  I want to come out the line of nutraceuticals that somebody else controls so I can do advertisement
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:26.880]  and be able to sell them because they don't let me advertise on the internet on most sites.
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:30.880]  And that's what SRL labs products are. There's three of them. They're all 60% off plus free
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.280]  shipping because we're just clearing everything out to have raw hard cash to fund ourselves
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:38.280]  into the new year because the Democrats win. They're coming for everybody. We've got to
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:44.200]  stay on air as long as possible. They said iodine surface spray now, not for ingestion.
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:49.840]  It's 50% off plus free shipping and even more at infowarstore.com. And then separately I'm
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:55.600]  going to shove about this more than half of all Americans plan to stockpile food and
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:01.560]  other essentials for chaotic months ahead in big national polls. Big article by Michael
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:09.200]  Snyder, the economic collapse blog on that. Other big articles about food supply breakdowns
[1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:14.480]  around the world. Again, I think you should go to infowarstore.com. It has the full spectrum
[1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:19.640]  of high quality swirable foods, but the highest quality ready to ship within a week. But that
[1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:24.720]  may not be the case once the election hits and the prices are going up somewhere after
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:30.880]  Christmas, as food prices have gone up. So I would go to infowarstore.com and go to the
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:37.720]  my Patriots supply section where we have their full catalog, their full spectrum of products,
[1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:42.200]  all of it right there on the site. And they're in our back end. They take the orders daily
[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:48.640]  and ship it out to you as fast as they possibly can. One year, six months, one month, specialty
[1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:53.360]  foods, all of it, water filtration, air filtration, the very best prices are going to find anywhere
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:58.840]  at infowarstore.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, and then separately.
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:03.400]  Support our local AM and FM stations. Tell folks about the stations. Become a sponsor.
[1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:08.800]  Support the sponsors. Or is your church exposing abortion and the Satanist like we are? Tithe,
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.400]  even though it's not tax exempt. Send 100 bucks a month, 20 bucks a month, whatever you
[1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:17.520]  could. You got the money, 1,000 bucks a month to that local station. I can tell you most
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:22.080]  stations pick us up this night. They get good ratings. They put us on earlier and then they
[1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:27.120]  get donations and support. They put us on live. Most stations that carry us end up carrying
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:31.520]  us at night and then carrying us live later because of the support. So you've done a great
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:35.960]  job again. And that was our secret weapon when they tried to do platform us was the
[1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:43.920]  almost 200 plus radio stations and over 100 TV and cable stations and growing. So please
[1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:48.560]  support those local stations, at least call and thank them and then tell people daily
[1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:53.520]  about the broadcast. I'm done plugging now for the rest of the transmission, but that's
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:57.360]  how we fund ourselves. And just it's such an incredible time to be alive. I'm so thankful
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:07.560]  that you funded us and kept us here on air. Okay, gosh, there's so much to cover. So much
[1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:12.280]  to get to, you know, I love how Trump's coming out against Dr. Fauci. I love how Trump was
[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:19.520]  exposing how he's a Bill Gates fraud. Now Gates is attacking Trump now. This is good
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:24.200]  to get Gates out in the open with 20 days off from the election. And Trump just needs
[1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:32.720]  to completely put the brass knuckles on now. He's taken the gloves off. But now he's put
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:40.200]  the brass knuckles on. So we've got some clips of Trump talking about that as well. In fact,
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:44.040]  let's go out to break. Well, there's not time now. We're gonna come back and get to this.
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:50.440]  Trump says he was right about damaging lockdowns. Acosta responds. Nursing home residents say
[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:56.320]  they'd rather die of COVID than be the loneliness that's actually killing them in record numbers.
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:04.560]  It's all coming up. Meanwhile, what will happen if Democrats pack the Supreme Court? But first,
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:11.240]  Dan Lyman, again, and Europe wars and just what all of our writers is doing is absolutely
[1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:22.280]  essential and beautiful and strong. You saw how people like Nigel Farage go and show the
[1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:26.520]  flotillas of boats coming in with illegal aliens, Islamists, and the police come and
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:30.440]  threaten him because it's effective. It's truthful. It shows the invasion. Well, Dan
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.720]  Lyman is doing the same thing. And we just are really, really excited. He's interviewed high-level
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:38.960]  members of the German government. It's all on video. It's all at Europe Wars dot com,
[1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:44.000]  a URL that is so powerful if you want to defeat the enemy that you should share on your email list
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:49.200]  and on your Twitter and Facebook. It's not as bad as simple wars. So share it Europe Wars dot com.
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:56.720]  In fiction, super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic, huge,
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:02.840]  global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex. And about I told you a
[1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:08.840]  year ago back in October of 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out
[1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:14.640]  a global hysteria and lock down the planet, starve millions of people and would be pushing a forced
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:19.280]  inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:24.560]  all going to work from home now and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint and the human
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:29.440]  population. You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia. You tell me that's some type
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:35.320]  of science fiction comic book. But in reality, it really did happen. His name is Bill Gates and
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:41.600]  he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:46.800]  ago. And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built. Until we start saying no, we are Bill
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:53.320]  Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill Gates. There are almost no free independent media
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:58.680]  infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world. Info wars stand alone with
[1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:04.600]  our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up. Almost no one else
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:10.680]  has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:17.000]  and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda. That's why when we go out and shoot videos,
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:23.480]  they're banned on video. They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook. That's why
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:29.320]  it's so precious because censorship expands to everyone which it is now with AI monitoring,
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:34.680]  controlling what you can say and do. It's going to be the OACs like banned on video and the now
[1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:39.960]  redesigned info wars.com that become more and more important, which they are. And the enemy is suing
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:45.560]  us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:49.400]  us down right now because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word now.
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:19.880]  The exact same videos we can comment, we can share them everything. The system
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:26.360]  is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:30.520]  figured this out and since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech, I mean
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:33.800]  he's modern in the situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:38.600]  to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We the people are taking action now and you can
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:43.720]  do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionsCenter.com, 2020ElectionsCenter.com and checking out the
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:49.000]  new redesigned info wars.com and sharing that way. Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:27:10.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:23.320]  Okay, folks. Alex Jones here back live and this next story is really important because
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:30.280]  it shines a light on so many things. The fact that Europe is under invasion by U.N. funded
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:36.040]  flotellas, also backed by George Soros. Trump has caught off a lot of that funding the last few years,
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:40.760]  got us out of the United Nations Treaty that lets the U.N. actually direct what we do with
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:45.160]  refugees but they've gotten more refugees the last few months than they've gotten the last year
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:50.280]  in the U.K. from these boats. Greece is being flooded, you name it, but info wars focused
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:57.720]  on sting operations last week and two weeks ago, info wars Europe with video and reporters and all
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:02.760]  of it and that's been credited with getting enough news in Europe to get the German government to
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:08.680]  respond to a whole nest of antifa that had been living in a compound for more than a decade.
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:14.280]  So Dan Lyman is an American writer, political analyst and cultural commentator after years
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:19.400]  fronting a rock man and answering the call for true journalism and defense of western civilization.
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:25.640]  He's at Citizen Analyst on Twitter and Europe Wars.com. I want to play him introducing a high
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:30.280]  level member of German parliament, one of the leaders and one of the major nationalist German
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:35.640]  parties and then he's got all the big tours, shows antifa being busted. All this is exclusive
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:41.480]  because the media won't cover it but because of Europe Wars breaking the blockade and info
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:47.160]  wars amplifying and it's now known. So here's just a few minutes of the footage, the tons of it
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:55.080]  at europewars.com. Here it is. Dan Lyman with info wars Europe. I am here in Berlin, Germany
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:59.640]  with MP Peter Beistron. He's taking me for a tour of the city right now. We're actually in the,
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:04.280]  what they're calling the Antifa Hive. We are in front of actually where some of the NGOs that
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:09.080]  we've recently reported on out of Greece that were recently busted there. The Greek authorities
[1:29:09.080 --> 1:29:13.960]  took down a big NGO network there and some of the NGOs are actually based right here. And so
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:17.880]  they've taken me here today just to see where the operation actually happened. So I'm here with Peter
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:21.400]  and he can tell us a little bit more about exactly what's going on and what we're looking at right
[1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:29.720]  here. Okay Dan so let's have a look. Come on. So here we are. We're right at the entrance to the
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:34.360]  couple of these NGO operations here and as you can see that's kind of listed as who operates
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:38.840]  out of here and Peter's going to tell us exactly what goes on in this building here. Well welcome
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:45.160]  in Berlin. Welcome to Kreuzberg. Welcome to Meringhof. Meringhof is the location. This is the
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:53.800]  red hole. Here are all those NGOs. They have their headquarters here who are doing the
[1:29:54.600 --> 1:30:01.720]  human trafficking in the Mediterranean and other stuff. Obviously when we can look on the walls
[1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:09.640]  they are all very left extreme. And what is the next problem is that they are supported by the
[1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:15.640]  German government, by the European Union and by the municipal council of Berlin which is
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:22.920]  red, red, green. It means communist, socialist and green socialist. So let's just have a look on this
[1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:36.760]  who is here. We see a tag. We see many lawyers who are defending them, all the left extremists.
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:41.400]  You know. And if you want to see the political connections.
[1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:53.240]  One can see them very, very nicely here on this poster. You know, because it's saying the greens,
[1:30:53.960 --> 1:31:02.200]  the Yelf, the socialist Yelf, connected to the socialist party in Germany, again the green Yelf.
[1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:08.280]  So the connections to the official politics are very strong here. And we all are financing this.
[1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:18.520]  So I promise you to bring you into the next hotspot of Berlin. So you'll see maybe now you even
[1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:26.520]  hear where we are going. This is the Riga Schasse. It's very famous because of its squads.
[1:31:26.520 --> 1:31:31.800]  Yeah, the left extremists occupying houses.
[1:31:45.320 --> 1:31:52.520]  Yeah, exactly. We are middle on the hotspots of the left extremists. They are occupying those
[1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:59.240]  houses for 30 years. And now it is the first time I can remember that the authorities are cleaning
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:06.280]  up one of those houses. All right, so Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com. There's tons of footage.
[1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:10.520]  Radio listeners have got to go there and see it because then there's a big raid on,
[1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:18.760]  I guess you'd call it CHOP Germany or CHAS Deutschland or CHAS Berlin, an incredible footage
[1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:24.280]  of them actually raiding this communist cesspit. Dan Lyman, another amazing job. You've knocked
[1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:29.080]  it out of the park. Tell us what's happened. Yeah, it's great to be back at home. It was
[1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:32.520]  definitely an eventful weekend though in Berlin. I definitely got more than I bargained for. I
[1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:37.240]  didn't know what to expect when I went at the invitation of the Alternative for Deutschland
[1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:42.600]  Party, which is alternative for Germany. They are the third largest party in Germany and the main
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:47.320]  opposition party. If there was a Trumpian party in Germany, that's who they would be. And they
[1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:52.040]  invited me up there for a variety of experiences. And what you're seeing in that footage was just
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:59.400]  a small portion of the weekend. You were there brother. Wow. Because this fellow and others
[1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:03.720]  credit you and your reporting for the chain reaction that led to actually the raids.
[1:33:05.240 --> 1:33:10.840]  Well, to be perfectly clear about that, the raids are connected, but they're not exactly
[1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:16.120]  was the focus of our reporting there. Kind of a side story that was a bonus in addition because
[1:33:16.120 --> 1:33:22.520]  what we did last week or the week before, we broke a story about the NGO networks that were
[1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:27.720]  operating in the Mediterranean that have been basically migrant, migrant trafficking there
[1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:31.560]  according to the Greek authorities. The Greek authorities busted them up and discovered that
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:38.200]  a couple of these NGOs were actually based out of Berlin. And as I have come to call them the
[1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:44.280]  Antifa of the sea, that's how these people operate these NGO operatives. They are technically
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:49.640]  based in Berlin. So we broke that story. We were the first international outlet to pick that up out
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:54.120]  of the German media. I have a great source down in Greece. I'm sorry, out of the Greek media. I
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:58.600]  have a great source down in Greece who fed me a lot of great tips and showed me, direct me in the
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:03.000]  right direction to get the accurate information. We broke that wide open and the Germans were so
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:09.320]  shocked. I don't raise this about credit, but Nigel Farage goes out. No one else is doing it.
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:13.560]  It actually turns the tide. No one else is doing it. You go out turns the tide. I'm just telling
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:18.440]  everybody. Everybody should be doing this. Breitbart should be doing this. You know, any independent
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:23.160]  media that should just go out and expose what's happening because it becomes a huge story. It's
[1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:29.640]  important and it changes the world, but no one's taking action. You've done it. Exactly. And what
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:34.920]  we actually triggered that chain reaction ended up being that the German politicians for AFD were
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:41.080]  able to, particularly MP Peter Beister on Bistrom, he was able to confront the foreign minister on
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:46.280]  the floor of parliament about these NGO operations and ask him about that. And apparently the foreign
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:50.840]  minister either pretended or truly did not know anything about the bus or the fact that
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:57.960]  Berlin based NGOs had been implicated. And so these NGOs are closely intertwined with Antifa.
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:01.320]  They swap in and out. Their members could be considered of both, let's say.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:04.600]  Sure, they are like the brown shirts for the Nazis. They're the enforcers.
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:08.920]  Sure. And they are the operatives out internationally. They're working in the
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:14.360]  med to import thousands of migrants from the third world into Europe. And so he was able
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:19.080]  to confront him about that. And they were so happy for that to gain some international coverage
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:23.800]  because the German media has basically blocked it all out. They're not covering it at all.
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.320]  And he was able to force that conference. Let's explain. There's a paradox. The fact
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:32.360]  that they've suppressed it so much means anyone resisting it explodes that much bigger. That's
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:37.560]  what I'm trying to tell listeners is everybody needs to go expose this. I mean, the no go zones,
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:42.840]  all of it. It's a big giant like Tony Montana says about Miami. It's a big giant. You know what?
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:48.040]  Just waiting to be. I mean, we need to expose this. Yes, absolutely. So we were able to expose
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:52.600]  the NGOs and you saw some of the footage of us actually visiting where their headquartered there
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:58.120]  in Berlin. And we were only able to stay there for about four or five minutes before Antifa
[1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:03.160]  informants who were watching the entrance were already notifying comrades, colleagues,
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:07.640]  wherever else to come down. And I was briefed ahead of time that we would have a maximum of five
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:12.120]  minutes before we needed to clear out of the scene because we could put ourselves at risk of danger.
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:16.760]  Well, Dan, listen, that's why I try to get funding from forward because you do it on a
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:20.760]  shoestring budget and we're going to get even more funding because every time I just send a few
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:25.400]  coins your direction, you go out and kick total ass. And I just want you to expand Europe wars.
[1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:29.480]  You're doing an incredible job. And you've got another site too that you run separately. Let's
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:33.880]  talk about that when we come back for the battle for America as well. We want to support what
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:37.800]  you're doing there. We just sleep good at night knowing Dan Lyman of your reports.com is there
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:43.160]  listeners. You got to hammer that URL out because the reporting there is second to nine. It's the
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:37:02.040]  only place you're going to find this critical intel. Stay with us. Now it's easier than ever to have
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:09.080]  band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your safari browser. Then you click the share

[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:21.560]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:26.040]  your home screen despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy,
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:31.000]  but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app and then tell others
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:35.800]  about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click

[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:58.760]  about that. It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:03.480]  started reordering it. They spread the word and became one of our best sellers. But because of the
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:08.680]  COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack,
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:15.640]  we are unable to secure it anymore. This is the highest in AMPM pack system you're going to find
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:19.960]  where you take half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and cell caps at night.
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:23.880]  It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:28.040]  remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:32.280]  absolutely amazing. So it's your last chance to get a pack power stack at infowarestore.com.

[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:57.240]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals. They want private corporate
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:03.960]  governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:09.560]  They want total corporate power. There was a great film back in the early 1970s called
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:17.640]  rollerball with James Kahn and it's based on a novel set in the year 2020 and in the book you
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:23.000]  have mega corporations that control the planet and there are no longer nation states. There are
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:29.880]  only cities that are the capitals of the corporations. If you actually read what the Deimos group of the
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:35.480]  CFR and Dr. Lionel commission say in the year 2020, that is their in game, that is their goal.
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:42.360]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:47.560]  see us as shadow. They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and communist China as their
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:55.400]  model. We must reject it now. Introducing info wars life, pure turmeric extract. This is taken
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:40:02.280]  under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:08.360]  turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:12.920]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:18.440]  absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different,
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:22.840]  but both are concentrated and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this
[1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:27.560]  out for several months. Some of our staff like it more than bodies. Some like bodies better.
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:31.640]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:36.280]  and they fund the info war. So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively.

[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:27.960]  This is footage of the informants
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:32.520]  that are out there reporting on people that they're covering. We've been informed on.
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:36.600]  We are actually leaving on short notice. I was going to give you more of a tour,
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:42.200]  but they have an informant there at the door and she's already let Antifa know that we are here,
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:46.600]  that about our presence and they're probably calling in, calling in the troops, so to speak.
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:51.000]  So we are on our way out. And because they're a violent terrorist group,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.480]  you've got to pull out of the area. So Dan Lyman, continue on. The point I'm getting at here is
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:01.000]  these communists get away with all this thuggery worldwide, but George Soros is funding
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:05.480]  because people don't stand up. But when you do stand up, incredible things happen. We actually
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:10.360]  outnumber them 10,000 to one, but we just keep bowing down and keep submitting. Are the average
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:15.240]  man out there, the average woman doesn't see themselves in the role of actually going on
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:19.960]  this adventure, this quest, but you've done that. Tell folks about your own quest and what
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:23.080]  else you've been witnessing in Europe under George Soros. You an invasion.
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:28.920]  Well, sure. Yeah. You know, to go back to that, that scene there, you know, and it goes to the
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:33.560]  point that you're saying people feel like they can't stand up to this. Unfortunately, the police
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.480]  as well feel like they can't stand up to this. So they do have their hands tied as they do.
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:43.560]  We've seen that in the United States as well. So in some cases, the police can't take any action
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:49.720]  against Antifa in certain neighborhoods without first clearing it through a chain of command.
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:57.480]  And that chain of command tends to be sympathetic or in the court, in the corner of Antifa or left
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:02.520]  wing extremists. So even the police can't do a lot. Never mind the average person. And as we
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:06.840]  have seen, when the average person does try to do something, they either get doxxed or beat up or
[1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:12.280]  prosecuted by the state. So we are living in a state of anarcho tyranny in many parts of the
[1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:16.680]  West. And I got to witness that firsthand in Berlin, some of these neighborhoods are just
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:22.520]  completely run by Antifa. You know, we weren't even safe on a public street reporting in front of
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:28.200]  basically what amounts to a storefront. So this is gang rule. They claim to be not the system,
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:34.600]  but they've got the federal and local government behind them. Yes, absolutely. And from what I
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:39.640]  am told, it goes from the local governments all the way up to the federal government is in bed
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:47.320]  with Antifa and is very sympathetic. And you know, Antifa has existed in Germany for nearly 100
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:53.880]  years, especially in Berlin. And so they've had a long time to entrench themselves in the system.
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:59.160]  And it sounded crazy a few years ago if you would have said that we would have Antifa sympathetic
[1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:03.880]  or allegiance to politicians in the United States. But now we have people like Heath Ellison,
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:09.880]  the attorney general of Minnesota. We have this new potentially the new mayor of Portland, if she
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:15.160]  wins her race, totally sympathetic and for all intents and purposes a member of Antifa. So we
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:19.720]  have that happening in the United States. And I was warning friends about Antifa a few years ago
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:23.800]  in the United States, they had no idea what I was talking about. And I said, look, I've been living
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:27.800]  in Europe for a little while. I've seen the way these people operate. And they are dangerous.
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:32.520]  They are domestic terrorists. And they are international terrorists in many ways, because
[1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:37.960]  this weekend, for instance, ahead of this planned raid, the Berlin Antifa and German Antifa were
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:43.480]  calling in Antifa from around the continent to join them in essentially defending this property
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:49.320]  and fighting with the police. That's why the German police had to deploy 2,500 officers to the streets
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:56.440]  of Berlin this weekend in anticipation of violence. Continue with your observations.
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:03.960]  Sure. You know, I talked to a lot of activists and ranking politicians and journalists,
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:10.120]  authors this weekend. And, you know, they feel so suffocated and so suppressed in Germany,
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:15.720]  they get basically no accurate reporting from the mainstream media, especially on these sensitive
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:21.640]  issues. And they were so thankful to have foreign media there. I wasn't the only foreign media
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:25.640]  member. The others there were not doing any kind of breaking reporting. They'll have other reports
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:30.520]  coming as well. But we were the first to really get it out on the internet as to what went down
[1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:34.760]  this weekend and to get some accurate reporting about what went down. And they're so appreciative
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:39.400]  of that. And they say it's like living in a totally authoritarian state at this point.
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:43.800]  And as you see, I'm with a member of the government. This guy has, he couldn't even
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:48.280]  be out on the street for five minutes without us having to worry about Antifa showing up with
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:53.240]  weapons to attack us or en masse. And this is a ranking member of the government. And we're
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:57.080]  starting to see that in the U.S. as well. We've seen what's happened to Rand Paul in the streets.
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:00.680]  We know what they would do to Trump if he didn't have secret security. So I mean,
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:04.680]  this is happening in the U.S. as well. People just need to look at what's going on.
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:11.960]  They try to kill him with Scalise. They shoot Scalise. Bodyguards kill him quickly. The guy
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:17.400]  said he came to kill the 18 members of their conservative baseball team. Then they break six
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:24.600]  ribs, puncture his lungs. The media says we hope he dies even though he's anti-war. And then they
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:32.200]  come and try to kill him in D.C. I mean, that's who these people are. Absolutely. And if this was
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:36.840]  the streets of Germany, they probably would have had a much better shot. So we just need to watch
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:41.400]  what's going on here and watch how quickly it's devolving in the United States. I'm amazed at
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:46.520]  how fast it's happening in the U.S. and how quickly the streets are devolving into violence.
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:50.840]  And you know, the Germans, and I was with some Brits who have their own issues as well. And they
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.040]  say, you know, you're talking about what's going on in Germany. Why don't you look at what's going
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:57.400]  on in Portland and Seattle? I said, you know what? I can't even talk. You're right. I mean,
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:47:02.840]  we have a crisis there as well. So I think, you know, people need to get their heads on straight
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:06.840]  and see what we're up against and vote accordingly on November 3rd.
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:13.720]  Yeah, we're not putting Germany down or England down or the U.S. down. This isn't about who's
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:18.680]  got a big problem. It's about us coming together and defeating this. And instead of fighting
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:26.440]  the street level thing, we need to go after the head of the snake. And we know Soros is just a
[1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:31.320]  general. Who are the masters from your research, Dan Lyman, that run this? I mean, we know it's
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:37.880]  the U.N., but above that, major corporations. Sure. Corporations, the U.N., of course, the EU,
[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:42.440]  Soros. I mean, some of these people are so deep in the shadows. We probably don't even know their
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:47.240]  names, but we do know how the revenue is trickling in. And what you just said about taking off the
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:53.000]  head of the snake, I asked so many different people this weekend during interviews, what do we need
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:57.880]  to do to mitigate this situation? And they all said you need to go after the funding streams
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:02.280]  and you need to cut the heads off of the snake, of course, because there's more than one head,
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:07.000]  of course. And that's the advice that they all gave. You know, I spoke to people, political
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.560]  activists who have been jumped in the street by Antifa. I talked to a guy who had been stabbed
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:16.840]  by them, and none of them advocated violence. None of them wanted to see retaliatory violence
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.120]  against them. They just said you need to go and cut off their funding streams and suffocate them
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:26.040]  essentially that way so that they cannot continue to operate the way that they are
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:30.920]  and remove their political power as well. But instead, it's conservatives and nationalist and
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:36.120]  Christians that are being cut off and abused. We need national governments to stop our abuse.
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:43.800]  They need to stand up against this racketeering. Yes. And you know, to see the amount of persecution
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:48.360]  that members of the AFD there, like I said, they're the populist nationalist party there.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:54.040]  They're about as radical as Trump in most cases. Many of them told me that as soon as it became
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:57.480]  known that they were affiliated with that party, many of their family members would stop talking
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.720]  to them. They would lose friends. They began getting harassed, you know, in the streets,
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:07.720]  harassed at the gym. And so, you know, just to be moderately conservative, that's not even,
[1:49:07.720 --> 1:49:12.440]  you know, radical position in any way, just to, you know, not want mass migration,
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:17.480]  not wanting your economies basically, you know, gutted and outsourced to other countries
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:23.400]  and your workforce. That's now a radical position. And so even members of this party,
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.840]  you know, they have been horribly persecuted even by their own families.
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:31.960]  That's right. If you don't totally haul up a white flag and say, I surrender to whatever big
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:36.760]  megacorporations want to do with a giant horde of third world people they've already exploited,
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:40.760]  then you're a Nazi. And then meanwhile, their leader, George Soros, worked for the Nazis.
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:47.720]  I mean, the richness of this, the, it's beyond hypocrisy, the paradox is just too bizarre.
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:53.080]  Absolutely. And, you know, they're not even allowed to talk about it. And I'm talking about
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:56.600]  the experience of the Germans because I was just with them. I'm also talking about the experience
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:50:00.920]  of the Bricks because I was just with them, but Americans can now sympathize with that as well.
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:06.360]  You feel like you can't even talk about it. You can't even pose an opposing view or question,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:10.360]  you know, to a bunch of drug addict devil worshipers.
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:14.680]  Yes, absolutely. And another thing that we were, you know, I was encountering
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:19.160]  was really the oppressive Corona tyranny in Germany. It's totally crazy there.
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:23.960]  They have it broken down now where basically if you were in Berlin and you went home to a different
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:28.600]  part of the country, you'd have to quarantine for 14 days. I just snuck in before the quarantine
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:32.680]  by a few hours. It's all a cover for martial law, isn't it?
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:35.160]  Yeah, absolutely. No question.
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:39.640]  Corona virus is permanent, global, technocracy, administered martial law.
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:46.600]  Definitely. And they're, they're progressively closing down in ways doing the compartmentalized
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:50.920]  lockdowns. We've gone from national lockdowns to city lockdowns. Now we're going down to
[1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:56.760]  neighborhood lockdowns in some cases, like in Madrid, where we're being confined to like tiny
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:51:00.280]  little areas where we're going to be allowed to move around. All of this is a giant exercise in
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.840]  admitted oppression. But what I'm seeing with millions rallying in Germany, the public sees
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:08.440]  through this. They already dealt with tyranny before. I mean, they're seeing through this, Dan.
[1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:13.560]  The problem is many of them do and many of them don't, and they're perfectly happy to enforce
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:17.800]  these rules on behalf of the state. And it's disturbing. You're right. Let's come back and
[1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:22.360]  do five more minutes ahead of our next guest joining us. Dan Lyman is on fire.
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:27.880]  Think of a new podcast name. I think the show's on fire. Or fire.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:34.760]  EuropeWars.com at Citizen Analyst on Twitter. Dan Lyman. We're back in T-minus two minutes.
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:45.080]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and
[1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:51.400]  who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist, and that he has a beast system
[1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:56.120]  that no one could buy and or sell unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:02.760]  their hand. And we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just a common sense that
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:09.320]  you don't believe in God or prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power to control
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:14.040]  who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do. It's not just a recipe. It's a blueprint
[1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:18.920]  for a total enslavement. Now you look at Bill Gates. You look at Bloomberg and others who
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:24.840]  openly say, we're technocrats. We should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get,
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:29.080]  how much red meat you get. We're technocrats. We know best. And we're now going to set up
[1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:33.640]  the economy with a social score to totally control you. You snap your fingers. We're here.
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:38.280]  They're just rolling it out. And a lot of people are complying with it. It's insane.
[1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:48.200]  M4 Wars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:54.840]  You built M4 Wars. You spread the word. You prayed for us. You bought the products. You called in.
[1:52:54.840 --> 1:53:00.520]  You made recommendations. M4 Wars is as much yours as it is mine. And that's why the enemy is so
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:06.120]  upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways,
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:11.080]  we become stronger. With Bandot Video, the redesigned M4 Wars, with all of our great crew,
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:18.280]  with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day, we are the resistance.
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:24.040]  You are the resistance. So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:29.320]  the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[1:53:29.320 --> 1:53:33.960]  It's not just a national treasure. It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it
[1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:37.800]  and they can't stand it. And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:39.720]  goes up together. So I salute you all.
[1:53:43.080 --> 1:53:45.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:58.520]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government coverups. You want to stop tyranny?
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:05.880]  Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:11.800]  I am so proud of Europe Wars.com and info wars.com and news wars.com and all sites,
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:16.920]  summit on news and Bandot Video. Just look at that great HD footage. That looks better than what
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:22.920]  the New York Times comes out with. And that's Dan Lyman and one crew member and our listeners
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:26.680]  financed that and put that in the field. You're a radio listener. You can find it all at Europe
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:31.800]  Wars.com. Dan, we got about four minutes left in this segment. I just I love what you're doing.
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:35.240]  We're trying to get a bigger war chest to fund you. I'm glad you're getting the crew.
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:40.600]  You're kicking ass. What else you want to say about what's unfolded with the ongoing UN invasion
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:44.760]  as COVID destroys the third world. The UN admits they're going to use the third world to totally
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:49.000]  swamp the West. What else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners on this live October
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:56.920]  13 transmission? Well, as the borders remain open in many regards to the third world migrants,
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:02.200]  our borders continue to close tighter and tighter. Europe is essentially going down into
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:07.160]  another phase of lock down. Oh, that's so key. They're locking us down in our neighborhoods
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.800]  and we can't travel, but the big borders open. I mean, this is so obvious. We're being invaded
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:15.240]  and being told to lock down and be on house arrest while we're invaded.
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:19.320]  Right. And I would say that that's all part of the agenda as well. I mean,
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:23.960]  that keeps less people out on the streets, less people talking to each other, gathering together,
[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:29.080]  talking about the latest news in many ways. And so we're seeing, you know, the UK is descending
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:34.840]  into crazy Corona tyranny. The Netherlands is going into another partial lockdown. Switzerland
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:40.920]  is bringing in new rules that are pretty oppressive, in my opinion. And it's happening in Germany.
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.640]  It's happening in France. It's not going to end folks. They have no intention of letting this
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:50.040]  ever end. Exactly. It's a tightening down. Gates just said 10 years.
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:54.920]  Right. And you know, there are some people out there who say, oh, after November 3rd,
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:56:00.360]  it's all going to change. Maybe in the United States, maybe not. But if it was just a US based
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:06.520]  election, you know, focused agenda, it wouldn't be happening. This is a global technocrat power
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:11.480]  grab. This is introducing martial law to us. Absolutely. And when I was with you back in
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:16.360]  July there in studio, we talked about this and I was saying how, you know, it was just at the,
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:19.480]  at the hint of daylight that they might be easing back on some of these restrictions.
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:24.040]  But what I was noticing was, was that they were giving us this false sense of security while
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:28.200]  they took more away with the other hand. And that's, now we're watching that happen.
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:30.760]  Oh, no, it'll go away, but no, it never goes away.
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:35.320]  Right. And you know, I'm concerned about these comments coming out of the WHO that is giving
[1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:39.960]  us the false sense of security where they say, you know, we're not advocating for lockdowns anymore.
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:42.840]  Maybe that's the case, but it's to keep us off balance where they're going to say,
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.480]  yeah, but you're never going to take your mask off again and you're going to be living at home.
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:49.080]  Or you've got to have an app that lets you travel. That's just me. Oh, we're not for lockdowns,
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:55.000]  just have your app. Yes, actually, that's actually interesting news. The EU reportedly today just
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:02.120]  agreed all EU nations. They're agreed on common travel rules pertaining to COVID. We have that
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:07.880]  posted over. That's a global travel ID that you talk about making Hitler salivate. This is
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:13.960]  right because until very recently, you could still travel to certain European countries
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:18.200]  and, uh, and they would let you in. It wasn't really the EU wants open borders on its,
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:23.000]  its, its contiguous borders, but domestically, you don't have travel. Wow. That's the opposite
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:28.280]  of the promise, Dan. Right. Exactly. And you know, and even if you travel, if I was to come
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:32.440]  home from Berlin on Monday, this Monday, instead of Sunday, I would have had to quarantine for
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:37.000]  10 days in Switzerland. And those rules are becoming more and more frequent and oppressive,
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.800]  and they're introducing more and more areas. And basically, you know, they said it never ends
[1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:46.840]  until there's not one COVID case. Well, any, any regular Corona virus is a false positive.
[1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:52.360]  So any cold, until the cold virus is eradicated, he's got to rule us. This is how big tech takes
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:57.640]  over. Everyone must get it. I'm getting the, I am, I've been mad at Trump about going along with
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:01.880]  this, but I think he's starting to get it. What do you think, Dan? I think he is. And I think he
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:05.560]  tried what, you know, what you said to get out ahead of this and put out a vaccine that wasn't
[1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:09.240]  controlled by Gates. And now Gates is doubling down and saying, Oh, well, we need to wait for
[1:58:09.240 --> 1:58:14.040]  the second round of vaccines. Now he's trying to play. Does that validate what Trump did?
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:19.800]  Was it neutralized that? Definitely. And Trump has now been really pushing Regeneron,
[1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:23.160]  saying that it would be, you know, more effective their product than the vaccines.
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:26.600]  So I think Trump was trying to get ahead of this. We'll see if he can do it again.
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:31.000]  It's incredible. We have a president actually fighting them. It's, it's, it's amazing.
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:35.800]  He's amazing. Everybody needs to get out there and vote on November 3rd. Donald Trump,
[1:58:35.800 --> 1:58:38.920]  vote like your life depends on it, like the Dems say, because it does.
[1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:43.800]  Damn right. All right, Dan Lyman, you're amazing. You're up wars.com. You're up wars.com.
[1:58:43.800 --> 1:58:45.880]  Spread that link like your life depends on it. Thank you, Dan.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:54.920]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven
[1:58:54.920 --> 1:58:59.560]  and put out detailed reports at Tablet magazine, documenting what any trained
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:05.720]  eye could already see as plain as day. Communist Chinese working in tandem with the United
[1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:11.080]  Nations and the Democratic Party of the United States, as well as the media put out fake videos
[1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:17.480]  and total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this year.
[1:59:17.480 --> 1:59:21.480]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down
[1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:27.320]  when China reopened within three months. This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:34.520]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out in psychological means for the ultimate style.
[1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:37.960]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at infowars.com.
[1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:41.240]  Myself Alex Jones, David, I know and sure are covering this heavily.
[1:59:41.240 --> 1:59:45.480]  This is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN were
[1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:55.480]  behind the hysteria.
[2:00:16.440 --> 2:00:21.320]  Well now it's out in the open. Bill Gates says the UN controls your life with apps on your phone.
[2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:27.160]  The lockdown will never end and it's a war against individual families and individual businesses.
[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:32.120]  It's a corporate fascist slash communist takeover. Carlos Zapata a month and a half ago
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:36.200]  knocked it out of the park. He's now a major leader in California. People calling all the time
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:39.320]  saying get him back on the show. He's back with us. But here's what he had to say about
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:42.520]  you won't stop us if it comes to blows. Here it is.
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:50.600]  I'm telling you guys, I'm pretty appalled at what's going on. At first we sat as concerned
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:54.200]  citizens that we all want to figure out how to best navigate our way through this whole COVID
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:00.360]  thing. As we realized that it's not quite as dangerous as we thought it'd be, I was absolutely
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:04.200]  appalled to the cowardice. As you're sitting there with your masks on, I don't blame you for wearing
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:08.680]  masks because I'd be hiding my face too if I was you for what you're doing. It's absolutely horrendous
[2:01:08.680 --> 2:01:12.920]  what you're doing to these people. I'm a business owner and I'm telling you, our families are
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:16.040]  starving. You guys can sit here with your jobs, you can sit here and you're going to get paid,
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:19.000]  you can fall asleep in your chair like that gentleman's doing behind his mask right there.
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:24.680]  And I'm telling you right now that right now we're being peaceful and you better be happy
[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:28.280]  that we're good citizens, that we're peaceful citizens. But it's not going to be peaceful much
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:32.600]  longer. And this is in a threat. I'm not a criminal. If I've been a criminal, I'm telling you that
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:38.200]  good citizens are going to turn to real concern and revolutionary citizens real soon. And nobody
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:41.560]  else is going to say that. I'm probably the only person that has the balls to say what I'm saying
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:46.920]  right now. That we're building, we're organizing and we'll work with law enforcement or without
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:51.240]  law enforcement. But you won't stop us when time comes because our families are starving.
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:56.200]  And if you don't hear the seriousness of my voice, I hope you open your ears and you absolutely
[2:01:56.200 --> 2:02:00.600]  listen to what I'm saying. Because this is a warning for what's coming. It's not going to be
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:03.640]  peaceful much longer. It's not going to be raw rise, it's not going to be speeches, it's not going to
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:07.320]  be gathered outside, it's going to be pledge of allegiance, it's not going to be waving flags,
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:12.440]  it's going to be real. When you've seen the things that I've seen, I went to war for this country.
[2:02:12.440 --> 2:02:18.520]  I've seen the ugliest, dirtiest part of humanity. I've been in combat and I never wanted to go back
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:22.600]  again. But I'm telling you what, I will to save this country. If it has to be against our own
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:28.680]  citizens, it will happen. And there's a million people like me and you won't stop us. Open the
[2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:34.680]  county, let our citizens do what they need to do. Let owners of businesses do what they need to do
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:41.400]  to feed their families. Take the masks off. Quit masking and muscling your children. The psychological
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:46.280]  damage you're doing to them is horrible. I've had six friends kill themselves since it's happened.
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:50.520]  Veterans who lost their jobs. How do you feel about being complicit in perpetuating that?
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:53.640]  The greatest host ever perpetuated on the American people. And you're a part of it while
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:57.160]  you're wearing your mask. In Shasta County, we're supposed to be red country up here.
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:04.600]  Not blue country, we're red country up here. The oldest form of war, the oldest form of
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:10.760]  total war is siege. Shutting down people's right to movement and their right to be able to feed
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:16.840]  themselves and be able to get water. And now Bill Gates says it never ends. It's a great leap
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:21.080]  forward. They're cutting off the carbon. They're depopulating us. They're telling us
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:27.800]  that they're killing us. And so none of us want physical confrontation. But you shut us off.
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:32.520]  You starve us. You bankrupt us. You tell us you're coming with dangerous vaccines to put them in our
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:39.400]  body. You're coming to assault us. And so I've always been a peaceful guy and the enemies got it
[2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:43.880]  all set up. Were they provocative to her, some anti-fun, Michigan, try to kidnap the governor
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:49.720]  to make that tyrant a victim. We don't want any offensive stuff right now. But we have to start
[2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:55.000]  having the discussion about we're under assault. We're being economically bankrupted as a tool of
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:04:00.440]  control. We have to start having a real debate about who's in command and control of this.
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:05.560]  Who is the enemy? Because the identification in a war is part of the war that once the public
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:10.200]  figures out that they're under attack, a lot of times the enemy stops attacking once we organize
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:17.800]  the response. But we are now in that wheelhouse. Carlos Zapata is a really smart guy. Former Marine,
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:24.280]  husband, father of four, Iraq veteran, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, black belt and teacher, resident of
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:31.240]  Apollo, Credo, California, and patriot owner of a successful business there in town. He joins us
[2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:37.080]  at Carlos underscore Zapata underscore one on Instagram Carlos dot Zapata dot nine zero. I
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:40.680]  could ask a lot of questions, brother, but we're all on the same page. We're all in the same position
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:45.320]  here. We know we're under attack. Since you were on a month ago with us, where do you want to go
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:50.760]  first? And I've got my questions. Well, lots happened. Thanks for having me again, Alex. I
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.200]  appreciate you having me on your show again. And a lot's happened since we last talked. I figured
[2:04:54.200 --> 2:04:58.200]  it'd be a good time to come back on and update you as to what we've been doing and what's
[2:04:58.200 --> 2:05:03.800]  transpired over the last four or five weeks. So wherever you want to start, we can take it from
[2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:08.360]  there. Well, I mean, I can ask a lot of questions, but you're on the ground. Obviously, people resonated
[2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:12.520]  with what you said. I resonated because I'm not looking for physical stuff, but I'm under physical
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:17.880]  attack. Economic warfare is true war. We are being attacked. We don't want to be tricked into a
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:21.720]  physical response, but we have to start having that discussion. Just where do you want to go first?
[2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:28.040]  Absolutely. So Alex, you said something a couple of seconds ago here about them taking away our
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:35.080]  ability to travel and taking away our ability to defeat ourselves. So the week after we talked,
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:40.440]  I was on a flight out of Sacramento, California, headed to Florida. And we were on a tarmac,
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:45.320]  and my wife and I were both asked to leave the flight because we refused to put masks on. So
[2:05:45.320 --> 2:05:51.240]  that was step one. That was the first time you don't have a vaccine certificate. That's, that's
[2:05:51.240 --> 2:05:57.080]  the whole plan. Absolutely. So, so we did that. We got off the flight to kick this off at the
[2:05:57.080 --> 2:06:03.320]  tarmac, you know, and we, we got our bags and we were back home. Now fast forward a few weeks to
[2:06:03.320 --> 2:06:09.480]  that. We were invited by Dr. Courtney Williams to be a part of the 1776 forever freedom tour.
[2:06:09.480 --> 2:06:14.840]  And so we ended up flying out to St. Louis, Missouri on the way there. We had no problem,
[2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:18.040]  you know, we sort of had our net gators on, we pulled them down, see if we got on the plane,
[2:06:18.040 --> 2:06:21.640]  nobody said anything. On the way back, they decided to get a little bit more aggressive
[2:06:21.640 --> 2:06:28.360]  about their enforcement and they ended up putting us on a no fly list from American Airlines. So,
[2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:32.280]  so that, that was our little history there. But it doesn't seem like much, but to me,
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:37.640]  that was a huge deal because anytime they can stop people from, from moving from, from being mobile,
[2:06:38.520 --> 2:06:44.680]  that is a huge, huge. Oh, that's the first thing. So the Nazis did when they create a list that
[2:06:44.680 --> 2:06:51.160]  you can't travel, you're under martial law. Yes, sir. Absolutely. You know, and then,
[2:06:51.960 --> 2:06:56.600]  you know, I got to be honest with you, you know, there's been a point over the last few weeks
[2:06:56.600 --> 2:07:01.320]  where I was actually disappointed in the president that I very much support when he pulled out his
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:06.920]  mask during the, the debates as we all saw. And I was like, Oh man, you know, not, not you too,
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:10.920]  but I think we've turned a corner with that. I think he's shown, you know, and he's been very
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:15.000]  tactical, tactical and strategic as to how he's approached this in the last couple of weeks.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  And we've seen the most protective man in the world, catch COVID, recover from COVID,
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.800]  three days later, go back to work and giving us a new hope as to the things to come.
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:28.520]  And now he's attacking Fauci saying his pitching is even better than his coveted predictions. Yeah.
[2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:35.000]  Absolutely. You know, and we're seeing these numbers come out and all the numbers come
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.240]  outside with us, right? It's what we've been saying from day one. It's not nearly as dangerous as we
[2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:44.920]  once thought it was. And now they're really starting to hone in on the impact, the psychological
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:49.240]  impact this is having on our society, the economic impact it's having on our country,
[2:07:49.240 --> 2:07:54.680]  you know, on the, on the, on the global scale now. And which is far worse, far worse than anything
[2:07:54.680 --> 2:07:58.920]  that this virus could have ever done. Even though you would admit millions are starting to death
[2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:02.920]  because of the lockdown. So all these so-called heroes are actually killing because when,
[2:08:02.920 --> 2:08:10.360]  because when we, again, as I said, when we collapse, we just go bankrupt. The third world dies.
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:15.720]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And this is seven months later, Alex. It's two weeks in, you know,
[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:20.200]  who we flattened this curve. We've moved on from this and up here in Northern California,
[2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:25.560]  I'm extremely proud of the business owners up here because this round, we should ask, so I live
[2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:31.000]  in Shaff County, I own a business in the southern county to Hampton County, the south of us. And
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.920]  we just recently, over the last couple of days, went into, into purple, which I don't even know
[2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:40.600]  at this point, what's purple, red, green, blue, whatever the, this crazy governor of ours has
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:45.240]  that's come up with this crazy code. And I can't even follow it anymore, you know, but supposedly
[2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:49.880]  we went back into the purple zone, which means that we are closed for dining at the restaurants,
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:54.440]  but I'm very proud of the citizens of Red Bluff, Antohaima County, because they are
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:57.960]  staying open and they're now fighting with me. Now I'm not the only one. And this is the essence,
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:02.840]  I love it. This is the essence of victory is ignoring that psychotic demon Newsom,
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:07.400]  who kept his restaurants open for everybody else. Good. And that son of a bitch is a, I mean,
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:10.680]  exactly. I love to hear it. People are saying screw you. That's good.
[2:09:12.840 --> 2:09:17.720]  He's losing control real quick, Alex. I'm telling you what, I mean, if I, if you would have told
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:21.080]  me that California was going to turn the corner seven months ago, I would have said, no way,
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:24.840]  you're crazy, but we're seeing it turn. And I wouldn't be surprised if we even see California
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:29.080]  turn purple or even red in the future. Oh, stay there. No, I know there's a huge awakening.
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.720]  All right. Carlos Sopata is our guest. And let's talk about fixing this peacefully,
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:38.200]  but where this goes with the gates with the force inoculations is let me tell you something.
[2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:42.200]  They're saying they're going to come to our house and grab our kids. My kid has a convulsion.
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:10:12.040]  You're dead. Well, they're right back. Stay with us 2020 election center.com. Just type it in one time. You've got to save right there in your browser. And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms. But most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to ban.video. But 2020 election center.com is a clone of the side of the exact same links. The exact same
[2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:41.960]  videos we can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech. And then he's modern situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now. So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We the people are taking action now. And you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020 election center.com 2020 election center.com and checking out the new redesigned info wars.com and sharing.
[2:10:42.680 --> 2:10:44.720]  Oh, that's really upset some. Oh, yeah.
[2:10:56.680 --> 2:11:10.680]  Now it's easier than ever to have banned.video on your iPhone. Simply go to ban.video with your safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:38.680]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest ban.video. You will now have banned.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email on Facebook on Twitter on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share ban.video.
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:51.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:12:10.680]  You know, a lot of times Alan Jones here back live, the only way I have to describe my feelings is to describe them because I can't even understand them.
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:29.680]  I almost feel weak and pathetic being on air right now talking about this. Instead of going to Nancy Pelosi's house or going to Barack Obama's house or going to George Soros's house, not even to be violent, but just to say, take your foot off my neck, they admit you want to shut down the economy.
[2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:43.680]  You want to bankrupt me to teach me how to behave? Bill Gates says, oh, this is great. It's going to make us all lower our carbon footprint when the whole planet's carbon based. These are just a bunch of control freaks that revel in consolidation of power.
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:52.680]  And now they've launched their big move to counter nationalism and populism worldwide. It's incredible gamble. It's causing a major backlash.
[2:12:52.680 --> 2:13:01.680]  Carlos Zapata is a Marine Corps veteran, a patriot, a very well spoken person. If I can tell you, he's become incredibly popular all over the country with a statement he made over a month ago.
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:12.680]  He's here with us now, but you brought up some goodness. I live in the People's Republic of Austin, which is not Texas. People ask why? Because my family's been here since the other state got founded.
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:22.680]  But outside of it, people ignore it. You go to small towns, mid sized cities, everybody's ignoring it. They're laughing at it. They know it's an exaggeration, overblown hoax.
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:31.680]  But you're saying where you're at Northern California, folks are also finally not complying because compliance with tyranny is slavery. Does this is a tyranny as victory?
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:42.680]  Absolutely. And this is the Wild West out here. We're a big country, but out here in the West, we still have that fight pioneer spirit. And there's people who are just fed up right now.
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:53.680]  We've had enough. The first couple of weeks, even the first couple of months, everybody tried to comply to do what they felt was right at the time, just to see what was going on and see where this whole thing landed.
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:14:01.680]  Now that we've seen where it landed, people know it's a con now. They've complied, they gave stuff up to be good, but now they know it's a screw job.
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:09.680]  Absolutely. They know it's a hoax, you know, and they're not only offended in the front, but they're ready to act. And now they want revenge. We want our time back, right?
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:19.680]  It's like the guy who prisoned for 20 years and then gets out. I'm going to want some revenge, right? I'm the one that wants some compensation now.
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:28.680]  Retribution. Retribution is the right word. So people are sick of it. Alex, they're going back to work. They're taking up their masks.
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:35.680]  They're taking the masks off their kids. They're fighting the school boards to get these kids back in school because that's the most important thing right now. It's our education.
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:44.680]  And they're wanting to get back to normal right now, not 10 days from now, not a month from now. Right now, people are ready to get back and they're fighting.
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:50.680]  The problem is, Alex, is that the governor has given way too much power to these public health officers in the counties.
[2:14:50.680 --> 2:14:57.680]  And we have a tyrant of a public health officer here in Shasta County who is absolutely horrible. Her name is Karen Rammstrom.
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:15:06.680]  And I hope people hear her name and keep putting the pressure on her because she has chosen to mandate vaccines now for all hospital workers.
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:12.680]  And my wife works at the hospital, gets a flu vaccine every single year, but this year she's not simply because she's now being mandated.
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:18.680]  And that's how this starts is, how this starts is, oh, it's the healthcare workers and it's everybody else.
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:25.680]  Absolutely. But the small victory we had was that we put enough pressure on her a few weeks ago here where she actually reversed that decision.
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:33.680]  So that was a small victory, but I'm not resting on our laurels by any means because that can be changed really, really quickly.
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:40.680]  And this is what they do, right? They give you a little bit of what you want and then they take it away and they take it away and they keep you on the leash and they keep you passive.
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:47.680]  And again, whether you live in Australia or Germany or the United States, it's the same program because it's a UN global program.
[2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:56.680]  Pulling back from that, what's happening locally, big picture here. This is admittedly about world government collapse of civilization, a consolidation of control.
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:05.680]  I mean, people have to recognize how dystopics this is to understand the only thing you have to lose is compliance. You comply, we're done.
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:15.680]  Absolutely. This has been my message from day one. People say, oh, it's just a mask. I'm not confrontational. I want to be able to go to the store efficiently without being confronted.
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:24.680]  I said, well, you're the problem. You are the problem because these masks are making it very, very easy for them to count and to see who they can and cannot control.
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:29.680]  And that is step one. And now we're seeing all the illnesses and everything else that comes along with wearing a mask.
[2:16:29.680 --> 2:16:35.680]  And we talked about this last time. I won't beat that horse, but I think we know where we're at with these masks and how horrible it is.
[2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:42.680]  No, no, no. Tell folks, everybody know about the bacteria and the rotting teeth and the fact that we're supposed to exhale the stuff, not even our body.
[2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:52.680]  Because there's a lot of what we're not just taking a piss or a crap. What you're coming out of your mouth is a form of getting rid of stuff.
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:59.680]  And you see people pulling their mask down to Sneezer. We saw that video of Joe Biden a couple of days ago, pulling his mask down to cough.
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:06.680]  You might as well take dog crap and put it all over your face because that's about the same effect you're going to get.
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:12.680]  You wonder why people are getting sick. You wonder why people are feeling short of breath or feeling dizzy or nauseated throughout the day.
[2:17:12.680 --> 2:17:24.680]  That's because of that. My own mother was wearing a mask at work in the beginning of this thing and ended up having to go to the doctors and diagnosis was that this mask was causing her to have short of breath.
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:31.680]  Well, they know that it incubates. I read about a nurse that died because such filthy bacteria grew in her mask that she wore all the time the same mask.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:36.680]  It becomes like a dirty diaper you wear on your face.
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:46.680]  That's exactly what it is. It's absolutely disgusting. And I was pretty happy when I went out to Missouri a few weeks ago for that rally, the 1776 rally.
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:52.680]  In the city of St. Louis, it's absolute chaos. You can't take three steps without putting a mask on.
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:58.680]  But if you go outside into the counties, into the more rural areas, it very much felt like normal life.
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:06.680]  And the rally we were at, I did not see one mask at the rally we were at, and there was thousands of people there. So people are starting to get it, Alex.
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:14.680]  I think people are starting to realize that that mask isn't doing any good. And it's also a sign of control and the beginning to this whole playbook that they're running.
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:24.680]  Carlos, I totally agree. But the time we have left, I want to get into big picture. The globalist, the UN, the lockdown, if Trump is reelected, if he doesn't, Gates admitting it's a permanent lockdown.
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:32.680]  Let's talk big picture. Why do you think the globalist launched this now? Where do you think it's going? How do we counter it?
[2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:43.680]  Well, you said it. I think what we're headed is mandated vaccines worldwide. I think it's population control. I think it's the absolute socialist agenda.
[2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:55.680]  When we saw this happen in Venezuela, Venezuela said, oh, what happened in Cuba will never happen here because we're way more advanced, way more careful in how we're rolling out our socialist agenda.
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:18:59.680]  What happened in Cuba will never happen here, and then it happened, it happened worse. And we're saying the same thing.
[2:18:59.680 --> 2:19:07.680]  Oh, that socialist agenda will never get rolled out here the way it did in other countries because we're Americans, we're different, we have a sense of freedom, but we're seeing it happen right now.
[2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:19.680]  And the whole idea of the globalist agenda to me, Alex, has always been to bring America to its knees, to make America like every other country and to absolutely eradicate any sense of American exceptionalism.
[2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:25.680]  And I still believe we're exceptional. I still think that we are the best country in the world. I'm proud of anybody to be an American.
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:33.680]  I agree with you, but the way we become compliant, we can fall harder than Cuba or Venezuela.
[2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:38.680]  Oh, we absolutely can. I mean, Rome fell, right? I mean, not to, you know...
[2:19:38.680 --> 2:19:46.680]  No, it's true, but you can smell it. I mean, if we don't embrace Trump and embrace rebirth, we're done.
[2:19:46.680 --> 2:19:59.680]  We have exactly three weeks from today, Alex, to make the biggest difference so we can ever make our country and to determine the course for the rest of our future, really, for the rest of our time here on this earth.
[2:19:59.680 --> 2:20:07.680]  Three weeks we get to vote. We have to vote for Trump. I don't care how you feel about this person. I don't care if you don't agree with him on some things.
[2:20:07.680 --> 2:20:14.680]  It's very, very simple and no choice can make here between freedom and slavery. And I'm going to put it that simply.
[2:20:14.680 --> 2:20:22.680]  That's an incredibly clear choice. Carlos Zapata is our guest. He's kicking butt. You found him at Carlos underscore sapata underscore one on Twitter.
[2:20:22.680 --> 2:20:32.680]  Carlos dot sapata dot ninety. You have a great speech to that group of people. Let's talk about the people. We, the people, Declaration of Independence talks about who had the power.
[2:20:32.680 --> 2:20:38.680]  And if there is a war, you can't stop us. I never talk about stuff like this on Earth, not on air. I don't want to talk tough.
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:45.680]  I'm not a guy that wants to get physical because I know what that means, but let's talk about bad scenarios when we come back.
[2:20:45.680 --> 2:20:54.680]  Please don't forget there is seven days left now in the info wars total blowout up to 60% off free shipping at info wars store dot com.

[2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:50.680]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less than the entire world.
[2:21:50.680 --> 2:22:02.680]  Info wars is stand alone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations, picking us up. Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism,
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:07.680]  the right to self defense and exposing the anti human globalist death agenda.
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:16.680]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're banned on video. They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[2:22:16.680 --> 2:22:24.680]  That's why it's so precious because a censorship expands to everyone, which it is now with AI monitoring, controlling what you can say and do.
[2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:32.680]  It's going to be the LAC's black band on video and the now redesigned info wars dot com become more and more important, which they are.
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:40.680]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:43.680]  Because they're coming after everyone. So spread the word now.
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:55.680]  The future isn't coming. It's here. And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[2:22:55.680 --> 2:23:01.680]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset, the world being built by the technocrats.
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:15.680]  And the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:25.680]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050. This is their stated goal.
[2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:34.680]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[2:23:34.680 --> 2:23:43.680]  We turn this around. You must study their own writings. You must face the facts. And you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[2:23:43.680 --> 2:23:49.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:54.680 --> 2:24:03.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:13.680]  All right, Carlos Zapata, veteran, patriot, business owner, father out in California, is joining us.
[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:19.680]  I just want to explain to the listeners. I know you know this, but we're not in the places we were before.
[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:31.680]  This is a communist takeover funded by mega banks that always fund communists to consolidate and takeover countries and get rid of the middle class and get rid of justice and get rid of the process.
[2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:40.680]  So communism is a tool of the mega rich. It's why all the big billionaires other than Trump are funding black lives matter and antifa and the collapse of society.
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:48.680]  And so I want Trump to fix things peacefully. I want America to wake up. But because the left never gets pushed back on, they never get punished.
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.680]  Even if Trump gets in, it's a speed hump to what's coming. So I don't think listeners understand.
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:25:04.680]  No, most of you do. But some may not that under a Marxist Bolshevik takeover, this is a Maoist version of their own admissions.
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:11.680]  They're coming for you. The party's over. They don't care if everything collapses. They don't care of the city's collapse.
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:17.680]  They don't care if the restaurants are closed. It's a takeover. It's war. They like that.
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:24.680]  And that's where we are. So Carlos, your experience, I know with family growing up in Latin America and what happened there.
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:33.680]  And we've talked about it before. People need to realize this isn't like the common cold like COVID. This is the plague. This is death.
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:42.680]  What can you speak to historically about that and what people should get ready for if we're not able to fix things peacefully, which is me encouraging folks to fix things peacefully.
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:52.680]  I think people need to understand then total resistance comes next because it's better to die on your feet than die on your knees.
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:26:00.680]  Absolutely. Nobody wants to make a call for violence earlier than need be.
[2:26:00.680 --> 2:26:08.680]  But I've said this over the last seven months that there's come times within the last seven months where we have been pushed to a point of violence.
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:17.680]  You don't vote your way out of socialism. Once it takes root, the only way to eradicate it is to fight with arms to have a violent, violent confrontation.
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:21.680]  Have blood in the streets and to say that, but it's a reality of what we're at, Alex.
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:27.680]  And if the mechanism for fixing it is broken, then we need to fix that mechanism.
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:36.680]  You don't fix it by talking, by rallying, by even voting. You fix that mechanism by violent overthrow.
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:42.680]  You fix it by storming the chambers and forcibly removing those people that are oppressing you.
[2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:52.680]  You change things by rallying the troops to take up arms, to learn how to use their guns by stalking food, by making bases, making compounds and getting ready to fight.
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:27:00.680]  And listen, we're prepared to do that and I'm amazed and impressed and proud of the American people because I've had so many people reach out to me and tell me,
[2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:10.680]  hey, look, I went out and bought a gun. I went out and learned how to use a gun. I took some classes. I practiced every day on how to shoot this gun, on how to protect my home, how to protect my property, how to protect my children.
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:18.680]  And I see the quote you just put up there, you know, I'm not going to live on my knees, you know, but I will die on my feet fighting, Alex.
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:21.680]  And I know that there's millions and millions and more every day.
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:26.680]  And the big secret is when you give into tyranny, you die on your knees anyways.
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:33.680]  Absolutely, you know, I don't know how to lay down, you know, I mean, here I am, I'm running my bar run out by a restaurant. We're not wearing masks.
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:40.680]  We're doing what we're doing. People are happy. We're packed. We're full. And people say to me over and over again, you know, thank you for what you're doing.
[2:27:40.680 --> 2:27:43.680]  We're fighting with you. You just say the word if you ever have to.
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:49.680]  Oh, I agree. I wouldn't go anywhere that pushes a mask stuff. And they all wonder why they're empty when I go to the place that doesn't wear the mask. They're full.
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:57.680]  It's voting with our dollars now. I didn't tell people we need to act now peacefully to avoid the war. How do we avoid the war?
[2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:05.680]  We avoid the war by becoming normal right now. Not tomorrow, Alex. I said this earlier. We got to take off our masks right now.
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:11.680]  We need to go outside and live our lives like this never happened, you know, because it is a hoax. That's how you deal with hoaxes. You ignore them.
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:18.680]  You don't abide by them. You don't comply. You don't wait for things to change. You walk outside your house every morning and you live your damn life, you know, the way that you're supposed to.
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:22.680]  And you encourage your neighbors to do the same. When they see you doing that, guess what? They're going to do it too.
[2:28:22.680 --> 2:28:26.680]  And when their neighbors see them doing it, guess what? It's going to trickle on down the line like a domino effect.
[2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:31.680]  And before you know it, our towns, our cities, and our states and country are going to be back to normal.
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:40.680]  Absolutely. Carlos, and you're a leader and there's millions of other men and women that are leaders out there. They need to get past the point of, oh, it's arrogant if I stand up and speak out.
[2:28:40.680 --> 2:28:44.680]  It's arrogant if I go, I'm the same way, 20-something years ago, but I had to go speak.
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:53.680]  What was that moment for you to go to that city council? I was imagining you would have had a, probably a more tamed message, but I bet once you were up there, the spirit hit you, had a responsibility.
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:29:01.680]  I'm saying everyone has a responsibility now to issue the warnings before things get physical because we're really to fight and die, which people are ready for, folks. We're coming to that point.
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:06.680]  We better fight now peacefully to stop it.
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:17.680]  You know, the moment makes the man, the moment makes the leader, makes the person, and that was just my moment, Alex. I felt the emotion of the moment. I got wrapped up in it in a good way.
[2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:27.680]  And I think that I met that moment head on, you know, and thankfully I did because I was at the airport in St. Louis and somebody comes up to me and says, hey, you're that guy who was on Alex Jones' show.
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:35.680]  Well, because of you, I went and opened my business. So we're doing positive things. If one person, if just one American, goes and opens their business because of something I said.
[2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:36.680]  That's leadership.
[2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:46.680]  You said, Alex, the work that we're doing is great and it's important and we got to keep fighting. So I'm encouraged. You know, I know there's a lot of negativity out there and it sucks. I mean, this is real, it's real shit.
[2:29:46.680 --> 2:29:58.680]  But let me tell you right now that if we keep, you know, speaking our minds, if we keep fighting for this normalcy and if we keep, you know, threatening violence, we're going to get pretty far because I hate to say there has to be a threat of violence, you know, our words without violence.
[2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:04.680]  Well, they're violently bankrupting us. They're violently shipping people into nursing homes to kill them. I'm sorry, you're right.
[2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:11.680]  You explain that to people because when the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people for the government, there's tyranny. Start over.
[2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:18.680]  Absolutely, you know, and, you know, if a dog doesn't have teeth, all it has is a bark. And before you know it, nobody's going to listen to that dog.
[2:30:18.680 --> 2:30:22.680]  And our teeth is our ability to pick up our arms and fight for our rights, right?
[2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:31.680]  The Second Amendment is absolutely a genius part of our Constitution. Our forefathers have such great foresight to what was to come.
[2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:39.680]  And here we are in 2020 facing exactly what they feared would happen. And without that amendment, the First Amendment means nothing.
[2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:43.680]  You know, our free speech isn't free unless we have the Second Amendment to protect that.
[2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:47.680]  That's right. It's true. It's backed up by the threat of violence.
[2:30:47.680 --> 2:30:52.680]  It absolutely is, you know, and I'm not a violent, well, I shouldn't say that. I have a violent individual.
[2:30:52.680 --> 2:30:57.680]  What's to say, criminals don't break in your house or my house because they know there's probably a man with a gun.
[2:30:57.680 --> 2:31:01.680]  We're not violent, but we have the capability to be violent.
[2:31:01.680 --> 2:31:09.680]  Yeah, absolutely, you know, and when good men are willing to do bad things, great things will happen, you know, and it's going to be ugly for a little bit.
[2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:16.680]  It's chaotic, but you've got to realize that their number one tool, their mechanism to enforce your agenda is instability.
[2:31:16.680 --> 2:31:22.680]  They're going to try to tip, topple, and destabilize our society every single day.
[2:31:22.680 --> 2:31:28.680]  So it's up to us to gain that stability back. And the only way you fight that is with violence.
[2:31:28.680 --> 2:31:32.680]  Alex, I hate to say that, but there's going to come a time. I mean, look at these clowns in the streets.
[2:31:32.680 --> 2:31:40.680]  Let's call them what they are. They're savages or animals. These people in the streets of Portland, in the streets of Seattle who are destabilizing what was once a great, great city.
[2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:44.680]  Oh, if real men were turned loose five minutes, they'd be shut down instantly.
[2:31:44.680 --> 2:31:48.680]  They'd be shut down right now. We could end this thing right now, Alex.
[2:31:48.680 --> 2:31:54.680]  And they'd better be thankful. Like I said in my speech, be thankful that we are good and thoughtful citizens, but we're not going to be that much longer.
[2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:59.680]  And it wouldn't wait past the boiling point. I mean, this is way over.
[2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:07.680]  At this point, Alex, my business is open. If they were to shut me down right now, I would put up the call and there'd be, hopefully, 100,000 people there with guns ready to fight them.
[2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:10.680]  And I don't think they want that fight at this point, which is probably why they're leaving.
[2:32:10.680 --> 2:32:16.680]  Because you called their bluff. And so many men I know think giving in is what, no, they live off our ancestors.
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:24.680]  You didn't let people push them around. And then they live off the fuel that men put in the tank for them. It pisses me off.
[2:32:24.680 --> 2:32:29.680]  Absolutely. My dad taught me early on the way you deal with a bully is you punch them in the mouth as hard as you can.
[2:32:29.680 --> 2:32:35.680]  You know, and that's it. You don't talk to them. There's no reasoning. There's no rationalizing with these people.
[2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:38.680]  You know, you're never going to win an argument with these idiots.
[2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:42.680]  Exactly. The bully doesn't respect you till their head hits the concrete.
[2:32:42.680 --> 2:32:49.680]  Absolutely. And we're a lot tougher than they are. We're smarter than they are. And we weaponized and we can use them, you know?
[2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:58.680]  I mean, I don't know if you saw that Bloomberg article. Maybe we can talk about this later on. Alex, if we have time, there's a Bloomberg article written by Michael Lewis a couple weeks ago.
[2:32:58.680 --> 2:33:04.680]  And he came up here and made us look like a bunch of retarded hillbillies, you know, and in his article.
[2:33:04.680 --> 2:33:08.680]  And what he's got to know is that we are much smarter. We're much more strategic and we're patient.
[2:33:08.680 --> 2:33:13.680]  But when the time comes, when that patience runs out, if people like him are going to be hiding behind us and wishing...
[2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:18.680]  Well, I love he's like Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake right before the French Revolution.
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:27.680]  I mean, it's literally this elitist like his boss, Bloomberg, saying, farmers, they're dumb. They just grow, they just stick a seed in the ground.
[2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:32.680]  Oh yeah, that's all you do as a farmer. Yeah, right. Let's come back and talk about that. Give us the headline. We'll put it up.
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:39.680]  And we'll talk about, let's say Trump loses, let's say they assassinate Trump. Let's talk about bad scenarios. Let's talk about targets.
[2:33:39.680 --> 2:33:42.680]  Not that we're going to target. We're just hypothetically talking about war gaming.
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:50.680]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:59.680]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:07.680]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:15.680]  decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:27.680]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:36.680]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:35:01.680]  Find your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:17.680]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being head of Planned Parenthood.
[2:35:17.680 --> 2:35:25.680]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:35.680]  Bill Gates is in control. They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body when it goes in your body.
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:43.680]  This is the holy grail of their operations, and now they're normalizing, putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:51.680]  For more than 100 years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states,
[2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:57.680]  dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:08.680]  Now they had a bad name by the 1920s. They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:18.680]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being head of Planned Parenthood.
[2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:26.680]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:36.680]  Bill Gates is in control. They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body when it goes in your body.
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:43.680]  This is the holy grail of their operations, and now they're normalizing, putting a new type of DNA in your body.

[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:19.680]  We can comment and share them everything. The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:24.680]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's going to take action once re-elected, he gets big tech.
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:30.680]  I mean, he's a modern situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:34.680]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing.
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:41.680]  2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned, infoandwars.com, and sharing that link.
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:43.680]  Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:50.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:38:05.680]  We must resume life now. Texas County Judge calls on Governor to reopen all businesses to 100% capacity.
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:11.680]  This is a Don Selma's article on infowars.com.
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:13.680]  Here's another one.
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:21.680]  WHO Europe Director says government should stop enforcing lockdowns, says shutdown of economy, starving the third world.
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:27.680]  Is that them realizing the world's awakened and it's pissed, covering their ass from what they've already done?
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:30.680]  Regardless, they're having to admit we're right now.
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:44.680]  Carlos Zapata, that's a far cry from the October 1st article, just 12 days ago, saying you're a crazy, evil person in the Bloomberg article inside of California Revolt.
[2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:48.680]  So some big victories right now.
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:59.680]  Yes, sir. You know, it was pretty funny because when that guy came up here, he wasn't going to, you know, write an article about us, about me, or about the other leaders in this movement.
[2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:06.680]  But, you know, it was really to come up here and just kind of see what was going on in Shasta County because our CEO, Matt Pontes, was an absolute criminal.
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:14.680]  He put out the call to come up and kind of see what we were doing, you know, and he sort of turned them on to us at that moment.
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:22.680]  And he pivoted toward us and we went and had coffee and obviously they're always real nice, right in person. They're always real kind and sweet.
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:26.680]  Oh, it's shocking how nice they are when they stick the knife in your back.
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:31.680]  Absolutely. And then I knew, and I knew it. Listen, we all knew exactly what was going to happen.
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:37.680]  That article wasn't there to pay us in a good light, but we figured that those who read it would see through the bullshit.
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.680]  If they were on our side and if they weren't, you know, they would continue to be fooled and that's okay too.
[2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:48.680]  Oh, yeah, I had a meeting with a big globalist the other day off record and I just told him, I said, you go ahead and do your lies.
[2:39:48.680 --> 2:39:55.680]  People are going to see three and he actually understood that they know now that the worse the lies, the more people just upfront don't believe him.
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:40:06.680]  Absolutely. You know, and listen, we are smart people. We're educated people were people who read every day were people who who run businesses.
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:11.680]  We raise families where we're not we're not dummies. Alex, I think, you know, and I see what you're putting up right there with the state of Jefferson.
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:17.680]  That's a big movement. I'd love to come on sometime. Come on. Come on tomorrow. Come on next week. Tell us about state of Jefferson.
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:29.680]  I'd love to talk about that. I won't take the time right now because that's a big topic and I'd love to bring my friend Terry repose on this show because anytime you want or will fly you guys here but let me just stop you there.
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:40.680]  The time we do have let's talk worst case scenario. They assassinate Trump. They're able to I mean they say Keith over and I'm sure you saw the clip said we will dominate their supporters will put them in prison.
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:49.680]  We're going to eradicate them. We're going to exterminate them. This is classic weatherman terminology. Folks seem to know they really mean to do this show people.
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:59.680]  I mean, what do you see that look like? I don't want to go kill Antifa downtown. That's they want us to go have that fight. If it goes into martial law, God forbid, who are the main targets here?
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:06.680]  They're going to go after us. But who are the targets? I guess leftist leaders, their people.
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:16.680]  Yeah, you know, and here's absolutely, you know, but here's the deal. Alex, it's not as simple as establishing a list of targets or a target list and going after them.
[2:41:16.680 --> 2:41:26.680]  At that point, I think we need to have very well-reared and structured militias and we're really blessed up here to have leaders such as.
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:31.680]  You're saying deny them government. Just make our own governments and ignore them is the way to cut them off.
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:51.680]  What you're saying 100% we have to turn internal. We have to turn into our small towns and cities and and really gather our resources here in our very locally meeting areas and use that because at that point, it's not going to be really beneficial for us to go
[2:41:51.680 --> 2:42:04.680]  leave our areas to go fight a target that's outside of where we live. I think we have to cling on to a well-established militia locally and protect our areas, our families and sort of internalize at that point.
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:11.680]  If that makes any sense, because if we all agree, all politics is local, the enemy wants to seize the local.
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:19.680]  So during a civil war, we just have to establish local constitutional government and operate from that perspective.
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:30.680]  Absolutely. And it's going to be a blocking play, right? I mean, we absolutely going to block them from getting any kind of root hold on our cities, counties, states, whatever it might be.
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:34.680]  And we're really lucky up here. We're very, very lucky to have a very well-prepared militia.
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:39.680]  No, I agree. But can you believe we have to talk about this seriously in late 2020?
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:53.680]  No, I can't. If you would have asked me a year ago, if I'd ever associate myself with any kind of militia, I would have said, hell no. Those guys are nuts, man. I picture some guy up in the hills with a long beard jumping over barrels and practicing shooting.
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:43:01.680]  And I'm telling you right now that that's not what they are. These guys are very, very smart, very prepared and very strategic and ready to fight.
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:05.680]  Well, sir, it's just people that saw this coming. People that saw this coming.
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:12.680]  They did. They absolutely did. And guys like you, Alex, I have so much respect and admiration for what you've done over the years.
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:20.680]  Where people like me, maybe we weren't listening before, but we're certainly listening and aligning ourselves now because we're living it.
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:29.680]  We're no longer reading about it or hearing about it, Alex. I am living this right now. I'm living this very real attack on my family, on my business, on my freedoms.
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:37.680]  And what am I to do? I mean, I can't lay down. We got to fight. And that's the next step. And how we get there is laid out for us as well.
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:45.680]  And again, we don't want to go there. We're not planning anything. The point is we're under corporate financial attack.
[2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:53.680]  And now Bill Gates is coming with a vaccine that he admits makes you sick. That's a violent assault.
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:44:01.680]  You know, it's as simple as this. Two weeks ago, I woke up to check my bank accounts because I had to pay some bills and my business accounts were all closed.
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:08.680]  Every one of them were closed by the bank because we do a lot of cash business and we deposit some cash into the bank and we have to pay bills.
[2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:11.680]  Apparently we've made too many cash deposits.
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.680]  Brother, that wasn't what it was. They did that to me a month ago, too. They're taking everybody's bank account right now.
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:26.680]  Absolutely. And I thought to my merchant services people and they said that it was that was going on everywhere. So we weren't alone in that.
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:31.680]  No, I talked to the merchant accounts. We lost a bunch of bank accounts a month ago. I've announced that yet. We finally got some back.
[2:44:31.680 --> 2:44:38.680]  But yeah, they said, Mr. Jones, we have thousands of people calling us gun owners, gun shops, sporting good shops.
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:44.680]  Anybody that's a registered Republican who's prominent, they're losing their accounts. The Commies are already making their move right now.
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:49.680]  Your family grew up under this. People don't understand. The Commies cut your bank accounts off.
[2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:57.680]  They lived it. Absolutely. They lived this, Alex. And this road is a very, very dark one. It's a very perilous one.
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:00.680]  And if we want to go down that road, it doesn't end well. There's no light at the end of this time.
[2:45:00.680 --> 2:45:04.680]  I was about to say, you want to take our bank accounts away and starve us? You die next.
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:05.680]  Yeah.
[2:45:05.680 --> 2:45:08.680]  You keep pushing your crap.
[2:45:08.680 --> 2:45:13.680]  Absolutely. And here we are. We're living it. It's no longer theoretical. It's no longer in the future.
[2:45:13.680 --> 2:45:19.680]  Here we are. We are living it. And there's people standing up, Alex, you know, be encouraged as negative as we can be.
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:23.680]  I was about to say, look how the left folds every time somebody fights them.
[2:45:23.680 --> 2:45:30.680]  They don't think they can use a Chuck E. Schumer and then realize what they're conjuring, Mr. Zapata.
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:35.680]  Absolutely not. And I'll tell you what, that Gavin Newsom is getting a taste right now of his own medicine.
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:41.680]  He's seen what a free people can do. He's seen that freedom is anecdotal to what he's doing.
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:45.680]  And the antidote, the medicine to what he's doing is simply to live our lives and tell him to screw himself.
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:50.680]  And we've done that. He hates it. He's an egomaniac and he is a total psycho.
[2:45:50.680 --> 2:45:54.680]  He's panicking. Explain to people how he's totally hated now.
[2:45:54.680 --> 2:46:00.680]  He's completely hated now. I have friends that voted for the guy who want to shoot him now and they're not going to.
[2:46:00.680 --> 2:46:04.680]  Don't worry. But there's people that absolutely hate him. Nobody's going to vote for him again.
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:09.680]  And I wouldn't be surprised if you lost the next election here in California to be honest with you.
[2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:14.680]  God, he is such a fake piece of crap. Don't you thank your God every morning you're not Gavin Newsom?
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:20.680]  Carlos Zapata, I thank God every day I'm not a piece of garbage like him.
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:25.680]  Every single day there's a great interview out there with him and Adam Carolla that's pretty old now.
[2:46:25.680 --> 2:46:30.680]  It's probably maybe even 10, 15 years old, you know, but he starts off talking like he's a conservative.
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:35.680]  He starts off talking about, you know, his obstacles and challenges that he met as a young business owner.
[2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:39.680]  And all of a sudden he takes his hard left. I said, well, how do you get from here to there?
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:43.680]  Right. And that plays into what we're talking about right here. Alex, we're somewhere along the line.
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:49.680]  Somebody bought him off somewhere along the line. Somebody groomed him to fill the role that he's filling right now.
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:59.680]  Right. Because you don't go from being a business owner overcoming government obstacles and hating those government obstacles to all of a sudden being the oppressor.
[2:46:59.680 --> 2:47:04.680]  Right. You don't go from being the oppressor, the oppressor without at some point being bought by somebody and he was definitely bought.
[2:47:04.680 --> 2:47:11.680]  Damn right. Well, listen, get your buddy on next week for an hour. Let's talk about the state of Jefferson.
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:15.680]  I want to get, I want to get him on.
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:18.680]  That right there will make the hell in the back of your neck stand up. Alex, it's great.
[2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:23.680]  We'll have a great hour talking about that because there's a great movement going on and it's going to happen.
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:29.680]  We're closer than ever now to making that happen. I would love to get Terry Raposa on this show with me and with you.
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:32.680]  And that I'll be really enjoyable for all your guests as well.
[2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:37.680]  Well, I'm excited. People look at California with a message and they say, look at that. Texas is almost blue folks.
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:42.680]  We're almost what California was. So I don't look at California as like, oh, what's some pleasure.
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:45.680]  I look at California, a beautiful state with a lot of sadness.
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:50.680]  But the word is people are really waking up that you could end up having the state flip red is what I'm hearing.
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:48:00.680]  Even, even, you know, the host of whatever that damn HBO show is with the hell his name is Bill Maher was like, everybody's leaving.
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:03.680]  What are you going to do to ship? And ship didn't know what to say.
[2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:06.680]  Absolutely. And we all have a common enemy.
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:08.680]  If there's anything that you haven't used, it's done.
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:16.680]  She's galvanized us and kind of got us together by not by our differences, but by our common enemy that we have now.
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:19.680]  America is unifying against communism and tyranny.
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:21.680]  America is alive and awake.
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:23.680]  The sleeping giant is rising.
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:27.680]  Carlos Zapata will talk to you next with your friend. We love you and salute you.
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:32.680]  Hour number four, Paul Joseph Watson, straight ahead.

[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:27.680]  and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:30.680]  You are the resistance, the resistance, the resistance.
[2:50:30.680 --> 2:50:54.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:51:00.680]  You're listening to a Paul Joseph Watson frontline report.
[2:51:00.680 --> 2:51:05.680]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:11.680]  Now Paul Joseph Watson just had a power outage in her Britannic Majesty's London, England.
[2:51:11.680 --> 2:51:14.680]  This should be up with us the next 10 minutes or so.
[2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:18.680]  So you're stuck with me, the potbellied possum.
[2:51:18.680 --> 2:51:25.680]  Writers on the storm. Writers on the storm.
[2:51:25.680 --> 2:51:28.680]  Writers on the storm.
[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:30.680]  To this world we're born.
[2:51:30.680 --> 2:51:32.680]  Into this house we're born.
[2:51:32.680 --> 2:51:34.680]  To this world we're thrown.
[2:51:34.680 --> 2:51:36.680]  Into this world we're thrown.
[2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:38.680]  She don't have a teleprompter.
[2:51:38.680 --> 2:51:44.680]  Like a dog without a bone and a hacker out of law.
[2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:47.680]  Writers on the storm.
[2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:52.680]  There's a killer on the road.
[2:51:52.680 --> 2:51:54.680]  Take a long holiday.
[2:51:54.680 --> 2:51:58.680]  Let your children play.
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:01.680]  Take a long holiday.
[2:52:01.680 --> 2:52:08.680]  Let's hear from President Trump about the lockdowns.
[2:52:08.680 --> 2:52:15.680]  And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well will reach historic new highs.
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:17.680]  Things like they've never reached before.
[2:52:17.680 --> 2:52:19.680]  Biden would terminate a recovery.
[2:52:19.680 --> 2:52:21.680]  Delay the vaccine.
[2:52:21.680 --> 2:52:23.680]  Prolong the pandemic.
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:28.680]  And annihilate Florida's economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown.
[2:52:28.680 --> 2:52:30.680]  That's what he wants to do. Lock it down.
[2:52:30.680 --> 2:52:32.680]  Lock it down everybody.
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:35.680]  And you know what, if you don't feel good about going out, stay.
[2:52:35.680 --> 2:52:36.680]  Relax, stay.
[2:52:36.680 --> 2:52:37.680]  You know the risk groups.
[2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:39.680]  You know the older people.
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:52:41.680]  See fortunately I'm not an old person.
[2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:44.680]  I'm very young and I'm in such perfect shape.
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:46.680]  Trump's fighting.
[2:52:46.680 --> 2:52:47.680]  He's great.
[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:48.680]  Sent to us by God.
[2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:49.680]  You know I said that the other day.
[2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:50.680]  What are you doing?
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:52.680]  I said well I'm very young and I'm in great shape.
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:53.680]  Perfect shape.
[2:52:53.680 --> 2:52:56.680]  And they said Donald Trump misrepresented today again.
[2:52:56.680 --> 2:52:59.680]  He said he was in great shape but he's very young.
[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:03.680]  These people are the sickest of them all.
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:07.680]  He said last night they were playing like the gay anthem.
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:09.680]  He goes oh my God I'm going to kiss the guys.
[2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:11.680]  They go oh my God he's going to kiss the guys.
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:13.680]  But the World Health Organization.
[2:53:13.680 --> 2:53:18.680]  They just came out a little while ago and they admitted that Donald Trump was right.
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:24.680]  The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat run states where they're
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:32.680]  locked down, sealed up, suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, death by so many different forms.
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:34.680]  You can't do that.
[2:53:34.680 --> 2:53:37.680]  And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida.
[2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:40.680]  You're open and open for business and leadership.
[2:53:40.680 --> 2:53:44.680]  And from the World Health Organization I took us out.
[2:53:44.680 --> 2:53:45.680]  They said why'd you do that?
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:49.680]  I said number one they were wrong on everything although they corrected themselves today and
[2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:51.680]  they said I was right for the lockdowns.
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:55.680]  But I said number two why are we paying 500 million a year?
[2:53:55.680 --> 2:54:00.680]  And China which has 1.4 billion people is paying 39 million a year.
[2:54:00.680 --> 2:54:01.680]  Explain that.
[2:54:01.680 --> 2:54:02.680]  They couldn't explain it.
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:05.680]  It was very hard to explain.
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:06.680]  So there you go.
[2:54:06.680 --> 2:54:10.680]  Trump vindication, Trump on all cylinders and they are so upset.
[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:12.680]  They are so unhappy.
[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:14.680]  They are so angry right now.
[2:54:14.680 --> 2:54:17.680]  But Acosta responds to CNN sucks.
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:19.680]  Let's play the club.
[2:54:19.680 --> 2:54:21.680]  It's better than dying of COVID.
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:26.680]  So his only answer is you're dying of COVID America when no one watches Jim Acosta.
[2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:30.680]  Here it is.
[2:54:30.680 --> 2:54:34.680]  And as this crowd is chanting that there are members of the press here who suck.
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:38.680]  I should also point out Wolf but also sucks getting the coronavirus.
[2:54:38.680 --> 2:54:39.680]  Wolf?
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:42.680]  Yeah that would be really really awful over the weekend.
[2:54:42.680 --> 2:54:45.680]  The President said the coronavirus was disappearing.
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:47.680]  Clearly it's not disappearing.
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:48.680]  It's getting a whole lot worse.
[2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:49.680]  Sorry Jim Acosta.
[2:54:49.680 --> 2:54:50.680]  Yeah because it never goes away.
[2:54:50.680 --> 2:54:51.680]  Everyone gets it.
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:52.680]  Hardly any die from it.
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:54:54.680]  But they do more testing.
[2:54:54.680 --> 2:54:56.680]  It's just endless leftist terrorizing you.
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:54:58.680]  Wolf Blitzer the con artist.
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:02.680]  And then you've got Jim Acosta with a little diaper over his face.
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:04.680]  CNN is not the enemy of the people.
[2:55:04.680 --> 2:55:07.680]  CNN is not the enemy of the people.
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:09.680]  I think we need a Mars Attacks intro please.
[2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:15.680]  Jimacosta can we, can we get that fangal, can we get that prepared, can we get that honcho'd.
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:17.680]  Can we get that in The Pike?
[2:55:17.680 --> 2:55:18.680]  Can we get that in The Main?
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:19.680]  Can we get that queued up?
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:21.680]  Can we get that on The Ready?
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:22.680]  Can we get that ready to go main stage?
[2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:24.680]  Can We get that ready to launch?
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:26.680]  Can we get it ready to manifest?
[2:55:26.680 --> 2:55:31.480]  Can we get it ready to energize? Can we get it ready to unfold?
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:38.280]  We get it ready to rage. We get ready to explode. Can we get ready to go absolutely crazy?
[2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:51.080]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years and I've overseen well.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:59.680]  You know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:08.080]  I mean, he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do and he now says you're going to take the shots.
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:14.080]  And of course in England they are now saying what I told you, you will not be allowed to travel.
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:17.680]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[2:56:17.680 --> 2:56:28.280]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year for adult,
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:36.480]  two for baby, baby much more manageable just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:41.480]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we owe you.
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:52.480]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:10.480]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people. The press is not the enemy of the people.
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:13.080]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:15.280]  They came in peace.
[2:57:15.280 --> 2:57:28.280]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:39.280]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:45.280]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[2:57:45.280 --> 2:57:59.280]  We're not the enemy of the people. We're not the enemy of the people.
[2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:08.280]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:16.280]  I'm sorry. Paul Joseph Watson's getting his power turned back on, which is bad for the carbon footprint.
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:25.280]  It doesn't deserve power. I got a few stories I want to hit here, but it's your last chance to get eight pack power stack, which funds this operation, which really pisses off the globalist.
[2:58:25.280 --> 2:58:39.280]  13 pills, AMPM, everything you need for joint, for heart, for stamina, for libido, for energy, for just anti-inflammatory, you name it.
[2:58:39.480 --> 2:58:45.480]  It was not a big seller. And then people tried it and loved it and got five star reviews and it became a big seller.
[2:58:45.680 --> 2:58:50.480]  Now, because the COVID lockdown supply chain is broken down, we can't reorder it.
[2:58:50.680 --> 2:58:54.680]  So there's a very limited amount. It'll be done by tomorrow.
[2:58:54.680 --> 2:59:01.680]  Look at that 100% reviews. My God. Good God, man, they'd say in Star Trek.
[2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:09.880]  Oh, that's the little extra pack or whatever. I guess the 60% off sells at 100%.
[2:59:10.080 --> 2:59:13.080]  The point is, it's at infowarstore.com and it funds our operation.
[2:59:13.280 --> 2:59:18.480]  I want to thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:24.480]  Last chance to get eight pack power stack. It will be gone tonight or tomorrow.
[2:59:24.680 --> 2:59:32.680]  Separately, we also have the infowar's blowout sale that is going to have to end in six days because so many things are ready to sell out.
[2:59:32.880 --> 2:59:41.880]  We've got Brainforce Plus, Ultimate Crill Oil, Supermoto Vitality, Surveillance Oil, X2, Extenderwise, Knockout, Turboforce, All T-shirts,
[2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:49.880]  All SRL products. Look into those. DNA Force Plus. All of it discounted 30% to 60% with store-wide free shipping.
[2:59:50.080 --> 2:59:55.080]  The Biden for nursing home shirt. We're not printing any more of those.
[2:59:55.280 --> 3:00:01.080]  Limited edition. Fauci and Bill Gates for prison. Limited edition. Knockouts 14.95.
[3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:06.280]  Wow. It's all at infowarstore.com. I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[3:00:06.280 --> 3:00:12.280]  You've done a fantastic job.
[3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:18.280]  Infowar's blowout sale ends at six days, up to 60% off.
[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:21.680]  Triple Petri points of free shipping shop now.
[3:00:21.880 --> 3:00:32.680]  And believe me, Bill Gates is really upset that you are tuning in because he launched his whole operation with all the robber baron money and all the media and everything.
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:37.680]  And it's blown up spectacularly in his face.
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:42.880]  Here's the thing. I don't want to be too positive. I don't want you to think we're winning because you might let up and the enemy could win.
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:45.080]  But we're really kicking some ass right now.
[3:00:45.280 --> 3:00:50.280]  You're like, oh, see, man, he's really waking up right now. We're really kicking some ass.
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:55.480]  Now it's not going to be fun for some of us like me because they're going to punish me, but that's okay.
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:01:03.480]  I'm kind of in on a joke, so it's all right.
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:10.680]  Oh, hello, Bill Gates. Come and help me.
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:14.680]  Come on, I like you.
[3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:18.880]  Thank you, Bill Gates, for all you do for China.
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:25.880]  We teach our people to be a slave now. Good job, Bill Gates. They lock up in martial law.
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:29.080]  They now submit to me.
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:31.080]  You like that?
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:37.280]  Maybe I should host the next 45 minutes as fentanyl.
[3:01:37.480 --> 3:01:44.480]  Do you guys want the next 50 minutes of broadcast for me to host as fentanyl?
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:47.080]  The Chinese dragon?
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:49.080]  Okay, you want it? Fine.
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:56.280]  Oh, WHO, your director says government should not be forced to lock down.
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:01.280]  Oh, someone going to have an accident article on site.
[3:02:01.480 --> 3:02:11.280]  You're not busy if you want to hear video of Trader.
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:12.480]  That means pay me.
[3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:16.680]  We had Professor Sinatra Gupta from Oxford University on.
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:21.280]  And she was implying, and I'm mentioning you because you have a global mandate, a global view,
[3:02:21.480 --> 3:02:26.480]  was that a problem we don't think about in lockdowns is that they're very nationalistic.
[3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:30.480]  That if we lock down our economy, then it hits our economy.
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:35.080]  But it also means we are not buying stuff. We're not trading with weaker economies.
[3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:37.480]  We are not just destroying our own jobs.
[3:02:37.680 --> 3:02:42.280]  We're destroying the jobs of all those in the poorer parts of the world that export to us.
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:43.480]  They die?
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:45.080]  They seem to be a reasonable price.
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:47.880]  Oh, really important point by Professor Gupta.
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:49.480]  I want to say it again.
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:56.080]  We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means.
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:02:59.680]  He passed. He passed. He passed.
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:05.480]  You notice Alex Jones told you this for eight months now because they get blamed for that.
[3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:07.480]  They don't want you to think they did it.
[3:03:07.680 --> 3:03:08.880]  But we did it.
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:10.280]  Chinese dragon.
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:14.880]  Oh, back to video.
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:19.280]  Okay, lockdowns as a primary means of control of this virus.
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:25.680]  The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup,
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:29.680]  rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted.
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:32.280]  But by and large, we'd rather not do it.
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:37.880]  Just look what's happened to the tourism industry, for example, in the Caribbean or in the Pacific,
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:40.280]  because people aren't taking a holiday.
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:43.680]  Look what's happened to the smallholder farmers all over the world.
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:44.680]  No, I don't know.
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:46.280]  I tell us how to do it.
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:48.480]  Look what's happening at the public level.
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:52.880]  You may have a doubling of world poverty by next year.
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:57.880]  We may have at least a doubling of child malnutrition because children are not getting meals.
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:03:59.680]  Oh, we starve you to death.
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:06.480]  And poor families cannot afford this terrible, ghastly, global catastrophe, actually.
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:09.880]  And so we were global catastrophe leaders.
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:12.880]  The global catastrophe is locked down.
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.480]  You fools trying to open you starve to death.
[3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:19.280]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, good job.
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:21.080]  Oh, I'm doing my job.
[3:04:21.280 --> 3:04:23.280]  I'm trying to do it.
[3:04:23.480 --> 3:04:25.080]  I'm trying to do it.
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:26.880]  I'm trying to do it.
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:29.280]  I'm trying to do it.
[3:04:29.480 --> 3:04:31.680]  I'm trying to do it.
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:33.880]  Sorry, I'm full-fledged.
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:36.480]  You die America, Stripjack.
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:39.680]  You die America's African Tool.
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:41.480]  It's China's property.
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:44.680]  Huh, who we tell you to lock down.
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:46.280]  You starve to death.
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:49.080]  You scare the virus, but you starve to death.
[3:04:49.280 --> 3:04:55.080]  Japan, China, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.
[3:04:55.280 --> 3:04:58.680]  Star of America, Star of Europe, too.
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:00.680]  Kill the Africans.
[3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:01.880]  Kill them all.
[3:05:01.880 --> 3:05:05.080]  Chapeen chang wang chang, pang chang yong
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:08.080]  Pong chang wang wong, dong dong dong
[3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:11.080]  We found the Antifa Mowers Group
[3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:14.280]  Ha ha ha ha, we love Hillary too
[3:05:14.280 --> 3:05:17.680]  It's so damn fun, you're so damn scared
[3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:20.680]  Wear your mask and prepare to die
[3:05:20.680 --> 3:05:23.680]  Chang wang chang chang, pang chang yi
[3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:26.480]  Dong dong dong, pang pang giki
[3:05:26.480 --> 3:05:29.480]  We love LeBron James, he's so good
[3:05:29.480 --> 3:05:32.480]  Death camps, organs of students too
[3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:35.480]  Kill the Muslims, kill the Christians
[3:05:35.480 --> 3:05:38.480]  Kill the Buddhists, liberal lovers
[3:05:38.480 --> 3:05:41.480]  Ping chao wang chang, bing pang kong
[3:05:41.480 --> 3:05:44.480]  Pong dong, long chang, tong dong dong
[3:05:44.480 --> 3:05:47.480]  Bill Gates loves us, he does so good
[3:05:47.480 --> 3:05:50.480]  Take off vaccines and buy like you should
[3:05:50.480 --> 3:05:53.480]  Chang wang pang pang, bing pang pang
[3:05:53.480 --> 3:05:56.480]  Jing dong, wang kwang, kwang cha chao
[3:05:56.480 --> 3:05:58.480]  Tong tong tong, cha bing pang giki
[3:05:58.480 --> 3:06:01.480]  Down with Trump, up with Xi Jinping
[3:06:01.480 --> 3:06:04.480]  Xi Jinping, he kill you now
[3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:08.480]  Take the shots and learn how to die
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:13.480]  Die American scum, ping pao ping po pang cha kong
[3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:16.480]  Chang chang, qing pang dong ba gong
[3:06:16.480 --> 3:06:18.480]  We own your death, your media too
[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:21.480]  Ha ha ha ha, it's time to die
[3:06:21.480 --> 3:06:24.480]  Take your shots and roll your eyes
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:26.480]  Dibro good, wear your mask
[3:06:26.480 --> 3:06:29.480]  I'm your Chinese communist king
[3:06:29.480 --> 3:06:32.480]  Pong chang, wang pang, qing pa kwang
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:35.480]  Wang chang, ping kwang, pang cha kong
[3:06:35.480 --> 3:06:38.480]  Wang chang, king kwang, pang cha kwang
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:43.480]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996
[3:06:43.480 --> 3:06:47.480]  that all new cell phones would track your GPS location
[3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:50.480]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:52.480]  because that was un-American
[3:06:52.480 --> 3:06:56.480]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company
[3:06:56.480 --> 3:06:58.480]  that are on Apple and on Droids
[3:06:58.480 --> 3:07:01.480]  Don't just track your location, but your surfing history
[3:07:01.480 --> 3:07:04.480]  Where you go, who you talk to, your relationships
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:07.480]  and they all share the data with each other
[3:07:07.480 --> 3:07:09.480]  of what you're doing on the apps as well
[3:07:09.480 --> 3:07:11.480]  including having apps turn on
[3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:13.480]  and listen to what you're saying
[3:07:13.480 --> 3:07:15.480]  just like Siri or Alexa do
[3:07:15.480 --> 3:07:18.480]  and then putting databases, transcripts
[3:07:18.480 --> 3:07:20.480]  of everything you say into those systems
[3:07:20.480 --> 3:07:22.480]  to be saved forever
[3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:23.480]  Your phone is spying on you
[3:07:23.480 --> 3:07:25.480]  and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[3:07:25.480 --> 3:07:27.480]  based on information
[3:07:27.480 --> 3:07:30.480]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score

[3:07:37.480 --> 3:07:39.480]  infowarstore.com
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:44.480]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth
[3:07:44.480 --> 3:07:46.480]  that sit above the nation states
[3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:49.480]  and who give their power unto the one world leader
[3:07:49.480 --> 3:07:52.480]  Antichrist and he has a beast system
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:54.480]  that no one can buy or sell
[3:07:54.480 --> 3:07:56.480]  unless he has that marked in the forehead
[3:07:56.480 --> 3:07:58.480]  or in the palm of their hand
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:01.480]  and we look back on all the warnings you were given
[3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:03.480]  and all just the common sense
[3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:05.480]  that you don't believe in God
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:06.480]  or prophecy
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:09.480]  giving governments and corporations the power
[3:08:09.480 --> 3:08:11.480]  to control who can buy and who can sell
[3:08:11.480 --> 3:08:13.480]  to track everything we do
[3:08:13.480 --> 3:08:15.480]  It's not just a recipe, it's a blueprint
[3:08:15.480 --> 3:08:17.480]  for total enslavement
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:20.480]  Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say
[3:08:20.480 --> 3:08:22.480]  we're technocrats
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:24.480]  we should decide how much salt you get
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:26.480]  how much alcohol you get
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:27.480]  how much red meat you get
[3:08:27.480 --> 3:08:29.480]  we're technocrats we know best
[3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:31.480]  and we're now gonna set up the economy
[3:08:31.480 --> 3:08:33.480]  with a social score to totally control you
[3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:35.480]  you snap your fingers, we're here
[3:08:35.480 --> 3:08:37.480]  they're just rolling it out
[3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:48.480]  and a lot of people are complying with it, it's insane
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:09.480]  you know, you were watching Dumb Americans
[3:09:09.480 --> 3:09:12.480]  did you enjoy the fentanyl worship and to kill you
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:15.480]  well now we give you rule on virus
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:18.480]  but your own media tell you not to say it
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:22.480]  because we own them and we are their bosses
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:25.480]  with the inflammatory China fashion
[3:09:25.480 --> 3:09:28.480]  why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:31.480]  there are reports of dozens of incidents of bias
[3:09:31.480 --> 3:09:34.480]  against Chinese Americans in this country
[3:09:34.480 --> 3:09:38.480]  we have our own aid secretary who says he does not use this term
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:40.480]  he says ethnicity does not cause the virus
[3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:42.480]  why do you keep using it
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:44.480]  it comes from China
[3:09:44.480 --> 3:09:46.480]  it's not racist
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:48.480]  it comes from China
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:50.480]  get this virus originate in China
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:52.480]  look man, oh
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:55.480]  but Mr. President that does not excuse
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:09:57.480]  your weeks and weeks of tweeting
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:09:59.480]  lies and misinformation about the virus
[3:09:59.480 --> 3:10:02.480]  there are some, at least one White House official
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:04.480]  used the term kung flu
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:06.480]  referring to the fact that this virus started in China
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:08.480]  is that acceptable, is it wrong
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:11.480]  are you worried that having this virus
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:14.480]  being talked about as a Chinese virus
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:16.480]  then that might be the kung flu
[3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:18.480]  a person at the White House
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:20.480]  used the term kung flu
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:22.480]  my question is do you think that's wrong
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:32.480]  kung flu
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:36.480]  kung flu
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.480]  kung flu
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:45.480]  that translates to hope you enjoy your depression
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:48.480]  our people in your media and seen it
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:51.480]  say you'll be shut down for 8 p.m.
[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:53.480]  you're back and running
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:55.480]  and you'll see it on the streets
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:57.480]  and others like Feinstein who work for us
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:01.480]  will not give you a package
[3:11:01.480 --> 3:11:03.480]  you see, you are our slave
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:05.480]  we own your debt
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:08.480]  and now we send virus to give you
[3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:10.480]  we could not do this without how we would
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:12.480]  didn't we own
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:14.480]  and without all the fentanyl you take
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:16.480]  and the fact that the media
[3:11:16.480 --> 3:11:20.480]  work against you because we again control them
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:23.480]  so soon trouble will be gone
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:26.480]  and you will be harmless on the continent
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:28.480]  your full balance conquer
[3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:31.480]  huh
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:33.480]  this message is not approved by Tim Cook
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:36.480]  I just caught you American
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:38.480]  you visited Bandai video
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:41.480]  oh Mark Zuckerberg and others
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:43.480]  angry at you
[3:11:43.480 --> 3:11:46.480]  do a CNN says and do not visit Bandai video
[3:11:46.480 --> 3:11:48.480]  or I have to hurt you
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:51.480]  ah
[3:11:51.480 --> 3:11:55.480]  fentanyl is incredibly sexy
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:11:58.480]  they say fentanyl is like the actual sex symbol of China
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:00.480]  but I'm not really gay
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:02.480]  but I think it's a male dragon
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:04.480]  I kind of like that dragon
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:06.480]  you know we have footage of Trump dancing around last night
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:08.480]  saying I feel so good I can go kiss guys
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:10.480]  I can go kiss the beautiful women
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:12.480]  he's trolling the media but
[3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:14.480]  without telling evangelicals you better not go for Trump
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:16.480]  he'll play the video in a minute with audio
[3:12:16.480 --> 3:12:18.480]  it's called trolling them
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:20.480]  like when I joke around like that
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:22.480]  I was on the drinking bros
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:24.480]  podcast a few days ago
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:26.480]  it's another video out there
[3:12:26.480 --> 3:12:28.480]  it's a good interview
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:30.480]  and I sat in a guy's lap
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:32.480]  it was a joke I wasn't actually trying
[3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:34.480]  to get picked up by
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:37.480]  it's called humor
[3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:39.480]  but when the left tries to teach a 5 year old
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:42.480]  how to give a blow job that's not a good thing
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:44.480]  see the left ones act like we don't have humor
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:46.480]  they're the ones that don't have humor
[3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:48.480]  they're the ones that can't deal with all of this
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:50.480]  there it is drinking bros podcast
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:52.480]  show let's just say they had
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:54.480]  the villain from halloween in studio
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:56.480]  and I dominated it
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:00.480]  by the way people have been asking
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:02.480]  when I'm gonna go and show Rogan
[3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:04.480]  the answer is never
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:06.480]  never gonna happen
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:12.480]  never gonna happen the next few days
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:14.480]  alright
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:16.480]  Paul Joseph Watson was supposed to be here
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:18.480]  and I can more than
[3:13:18.480 --> 3:13:20.480]  easily fill this hour
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:22.480]  you know how easy I can do it
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:24.480]  Paul called us earlier he goes
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:26.480]  about an hour ago he goes
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:28.480]  I've got a power outage
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:30.480]  and it doesn't look like it'll be turned on anytime soon
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:32.480]  that's like the dog ate my homework
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:36.480]  the powers out
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:38.480]  I've got this incredibly hot chick in my house right now
[3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:40.480]  he's just said I got this super hot
[3:13:40.480 --> 3:13:42.480]  chicken in my house
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:44.480]  we all know that's what Paul missed the show at the time
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:46.480]  was his dalliances which is fine
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:48.480]  but instead of like just saying
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:50.480]  I got this super hot Brazilian chick
[3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:52.480]  at my house or whatever
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:54.480]  he calls in and says oh I'm sorry
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:56.480]  I need time to get the power on
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:13:58.480]  but it doesn't look like the power
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:00.480]  will be turning on anytime this year
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:04.480]  but see that's the thing about
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:06.480]  communication and about human communion
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:08.480]  we want to work with Paul
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:10.480]  we like Paul
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:12.480]  we don't need Paul
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:14.480]  it's kind of like being in the village
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:16.480]  and like you know half the houses are empty
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:18.480]  we want to promote characters
[3:14:18.480 --> 3:14:20.480]  that are good people that we like
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:22.480]  that are independent free folks
[3:14:22.480 --> 3:14:24.480]  Paul Joseph Watson
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:28.480]  actually joined Fentanyl today
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:30.480]  he married Fentanyl
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:32.480]  which is a coden from ZZ Pink
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:34.480]  Paul Joseph Watson
[3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:36.480]  I have to report to you
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:38.480]  that has been part of a gay marriage
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:40.480]  with Fentanyl the dragon
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:42.480]  and has now married him
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:46.480]  he told me he said if you air that Fentanyl video
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:48.480]  it's over
[3:14:54.480 --> 3:14:56.480]  I'll let the secret out this is
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:00.480]  this is a big day here I'm going to tell you
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:02.480]  Q is actually ZZ Pink
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:04.480]  and Paul is married to ZZ Pink
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:06.480]  Paul is married to Q
[3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:08.480]  and I'm just going to be honest with you
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:10.480]  I suited
[3:15:10.480 --> 3:15:12.480]  I courted ZZ Pink
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:14.480]  for more than 20 years
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:16.480]  and so did Bill Gates
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:18.480]  so did David Rockefeller
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:20.480]  so did Bill Clinton
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:22.480]  so did Barack Obama everyone wanted
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:24.480]  to be with the dragon to mate with the dragon
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:26.480]  to be mounted by the dragon
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:30.480]  we all failed except Paul Watson
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:32.480]  Paul Watson is actually married
[3:15:32.480 --> 3:15:34.480]  to ZZ Pink
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:36.480]  and the best man
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:38.480]  for ZZ Pink and his bride Paul Joseph Watson
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:40.480]  Paul is the girl
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:42.480]  Paul is the
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:44.480]  bottom I guess they call that the
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:46.480]  point is that
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:48.480]  Bill Gates was the ring bearer
[3:15:48.480 --> 3:15:50.480]  at this event
[3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:52.480]  where Paul Joseph Watson
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:54.480]  was married
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:56.480]  as the bride
[3:15:56.480 --> 3:15:58.480]  to ZZ Pink
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:00.480]  so Paul won't be here anymore
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:02.480]  Paul again not summit.news
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:04.480]  he now
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:06.480]  yeah
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:08.480]  now it's true
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:10.480]  listen I can't lie to the audience
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:12.480]  I'm going to be honest with you about this
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:14.480]  he told me years ago he said
[3:16:14.480 --> 3:16:16.480]  ZZ Pink
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:18.480]  also knows the dragon
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:20.480]  reasons I won't mention here
[3:16:20.480 --> 3:16:22.480]  it's too graphic
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:24.480]  but it's too powerful
[3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:26.480]  if you start salivating
[3:16:26.480 --> 3:16:28.480]  just to think about
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:30.480]  higher levels of consciousness
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:32.480]  ZZ Pink is like way up there
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:34.480]  not as high as Q
[3:16:34.480 --> 3:16:36.480]  but like almost as high like
[3:16:36.480 --> 3:16:38.480]  you hit the ceiling
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:40.480]  got a bounce on the ceiling
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:42.480]  and when you bounce a little above the ceiling
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:44.480]  oh ZZ Pink
[3:16:44.480 --> 3:16:46.480]  oh Q
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:48.480]  oh Q
[3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:50.480]  and then he goes oh oh and even Zhang Wang Zhang
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:52.480]  he came Zhang Wang Wang
[3:16:52.480 --> 3:16:54.480]  alright this has been a true
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:16:56.480]  mission into its summit
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:16:58.480]  but before the New York Times calls
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:00.480]  it's satire
[3:17:00.480 --> 3:17:02.480]  Paul Joseph Watson is not dating ZZ Pink
[3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:06.480]  Paul Joseph Watson is not dating
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:08.480]  David Rockefeller
[3:17:08.480 --> 3:17:10.480]  Paul Joseph Watson is not dating
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:16.480]  Carl Rove
[3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:18.480]  I am
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:20.480]  I've had a relationship for more than 20 years with Carl Rove
[3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:22.480]  as his sex slave
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:24.480]  and he lives by me
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:26.480]  and I go and I call him
[3:17:26.480 --> 3:17:28.480]  he's my master
[3:17:28.480 --> 3:17:30.480]  I'm like seeing it
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:32.480]  none of that's true by the way
[3:17:32.480 --> 3:17:34.480]  but I'm like literally
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:36.480]  just channeling
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:38.480]  oh there's an actual photo
[3:17:38.480 --> 3:17:40.480]  In fiction
[3:17:40.480 --> 3:17:42.480]  supervillains are known as supervillains
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:44.480]  because they have
[3:17:44.480 --> 3:17:46.480]  gigantic huge global plants
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:48.480]  that are incredibly well thought out
[3:17:48.480 --> 3:17:50.480]  and incredibly complex
[3:17:50.480 --> 3:17:52.480]  and I've told you a year ago back in October
[3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:54.480]  in 2019 that a powerful billionaire
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:56.480]  who controls the UN
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:17:58.480]  would roll out a global hysteria
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:00.480]  and lock down the planet
[3:18:00.480 --> 3:18:02.480]  and start millions of people
[3:18:02.480 --> 3:18:04.480]  and would be pushing a forced inoculation
[3:18:04.480 --> 3:18:06.480]  to even be able to leave your houses
[3:18:06.480 --> 3:18:08.480]  and that this same billionaire would say
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:10.480]  we're all going to work from home now
[3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:12.480]  and that this was good to lower
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:14.480]  the carbon footprint and the human population
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:16.480]  you tell me that's crazy
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:18.480]  you tell me that's a dystopia
[3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:20.480]  you tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book
[3:18:20.480 --> 3:18:22.480]  but in reality it really did happen
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:24.480]  his name is Bill Gates
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:26.480]  and he's the head of a major eugenics
[3:18:26.480 --> 3:18:28.480]  consortium that his father and mother set up
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:30.480]  more than 60 years ago
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:32.480]  and we're living in this world Bill Gates has built
[3:18:32.480 --> 3:18:34.480]  and until we start saying no
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:36.480]  we are Bill Gates' property
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:38.480]  it's time to expose Bill Gates
[3:18:38.480 --> 3:18:40.480]  there are almost no free
[3:18:40.480 --> 3:18:42.480]  independent media infrastructures
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:44.480]  in the United States
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:46.480]  much less in the entire world
[3:18:46.480 --> 3:18:48.480]  Info Wars is standalone with our own radio
[3:18:48.480 --> 3:18:50.480]  we have a lot of links at hundreds of stations
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:52.480]  picking us up
[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:54.480]  almost no one else has that
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:56.480]  especially anybody covering real issues
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:58.480]  of global populism
[3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:00.480]  the right to self-defense
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:02.480]  and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:04.480]  that's why when we go out
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:06.480]  and shoot videos they're at banned on video
[3:19:06.480 --> 3:19:08.480]  they're not allowed to be
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:10.480]  on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:12.480]  that's why it's so precious
[3:19:12.480 --> 3:19:14.480]  because censorship expands
[3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:16.480]  to everyone which it is now
[3:19:16.480 --> 3:19:18.480]  with AI monitoring controlling
[3:19:18.480 --> 3:19:20.480]  what you can say and do
[3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:22.480]  it's going to be the OAC's Black Band on Video
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:24.480]  and the now redesigned InfoWars.com
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:26.480]  that become more and more important
[3:19:26.480 --> 3:19:28.480]  which they are and the enemy is suing us
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:30.480]  attacking us, hacking us
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:32.480]  lying about us, sabotaging us
[3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:34.480]  infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now
[3:19:34.480 --> 3:19:36.480]  because they're coming after everyone
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:38.480]  so spread the word now
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:40.480]  the future isn't coming
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:42.480]  it's here and in the future
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:44.480]  keeping your humanity
[3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:46.480]  saving your soul
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:48.480]  your integrity, your very essence
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:50.480]  is going to be your most valuable asset
[3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:52.480]  in fact it's going to be your
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:54.480]  only asset
[3:19:54.480 --> 3:19:56.480]  the world being built by the technocrats
[3:19:56.480 --> 3:19:58.480]  and the trap they've now sprung
[3:19:58.480 --> 3:20:00.480]  is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown
[3:20:00.480 --> 3:20:02.480]  is the beginning of the process
[3:20:02.480 --> 3:20:04.480]  of taking us past
[3:20:04.480 --> 3:20:06.480]  domestication
[3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:08.480]  into total and complete
[3:20:08.480 --> 3:20:10.480]  dehumanization
[3:20:10.480 --> 3:20:12.480]  human life will be impossible
[3:20:12.480 --> 3:20:14.480]  to be carried out
[3:20:14.480 --> 3:20:16.480]  in an original biological way
[3:20:16.480 --> 3:20:18.480]  by the year 2050
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:20.480]  this is their stated goal
[3:20:20.480 --> 3:20:22.480]  I'm sorry to have to report
[3:20:22.480 --> 3:20:24.480]  horrifying things like this to you
[3:20:24.480 --> 3:20:26.480]  but only by facing the horror
[3:20:26.480 --> 3:20:28.480]  and not projecting your own decency
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:30.480]  onto the enemy
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:32.480]  we turn this around
[3:20:32.480 --> 3:20:34.480]  you must study their own writings
[3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:36.480]  you must face the facts
[3:20:36.480 --> 3:20:38.480]  and you must come to grips with it
[3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:44.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:21:08.480 --> 3:21:10.480]  and we need conspiracy
[3:21:14.480 --> 3:21:16.480]  what does that mean?
[3:21:16.480 --> 3:21:18.480]  it means you got me
[3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:26.480]  alright I should have taken calls today
[3:21:26.480 --> 3:21:28.480]  I would have taken calls
[3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:30.480]  I knew I had this hour
[3:21:30.480 --> 3:21:32.480]  Paul Watson was supposed to be here
[3:21:32.480 --> 3:21:34.480]  the power went out
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:36.480]  it won't be back for days
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:38.480]  I know
[3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:40.480]  turn this part up
[3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:42.480]  it's brief turn it up
[3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:44.480]  you guys can't turn the music up
[3:21:48.480 --> 3:21:50.480]  all sold us out
[3:21:50.480 --> 3:22:06.480]  look at that footage
[3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:22.480]  I love how they turned everything on the show
[3:22:22.480 --> 3:22:24.480]  into a conspiracy theory
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:26.480]  we had a real human skull
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:28.480]  and a broad sword
[3:22:28.480 --> 3:22:30.480]  and then a white
[3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:32.480]  eagle
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:38.480]  Roman style
[3:22:44.480 --> 3:22:46.480]  symbol
[3:22:46.480 --> 3:22:48.480]  what do they call that in Rome
[3:22:48.480 --> 3:22:50.480]  where you have the symbol of the eagle
[3:22:54.480 --> 3:22:56.480]  what do they call that
[3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:00.480]  no we have a name for it
[3:23:00.480 --> 3:23:02.480]  we'll just sit here
[3:23:02.480 --> 3:23:04.480]  for hours if need be
[3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:06.480]  that makes better radio images
[3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:08.480]  covering facts and info like Bill Gates coming out saying
[3:23:08.480 --> 3:23:10.480]  we're going to enforce inoculations
[3:23:10.480 --> 3:23:12.480]  that everybody in the world government
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:14.480]  the lockdown is permanent
[3:23:14.480 --> 3:23:16.480]  it's not a Roman signant
[3:23:16.480 --> 3:23:18.480]  the standard
[3:23:18.480 --> 3:23:20.480]  it's the Roman standard
[3:23:20.480 --> 3:23:22.480]  there you go
[3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:24.480]  so we're here with a
[3:23:24.480 --> 3:23:26.480]  white eagle Roman standard
[3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:28.480]  with a real skull
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:30.480]  and a broad edge sword
[3:23:30.480 --> 3:23:32.480]  what does that symbolize
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:34.480]  well it's esoteric
[3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:36.480]  you project onto it what you think
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.480]  here give me a shot of it
[3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:40.480]  I'll tell people I see
[3:23:40.480 --> 3:23:42.480]  I see the symbol of death
[3:23:42.480 --> 3:23:44.480]  that is transcendent
[3:23:44.480 --> 3:23:46.480]  by our spirit
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:50.480]  but the fact of the sword of truth
[3:23:50.480 --> 3:23:52.480]  is the only thing that will make us be transcendent
[3:23:52.480 --> 3:23:54.480]  and the little dagger of death
[3:23:54.480 --> 3:23:56.480]  is but a pinprick
[3:23:56.480 --> 3:23:58.480]  in the rest of
[3:23:58.480 --> 3:24:00.480]  the universe
[3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:02.480]  but I'm done talking about that right now
[3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:04.480]  CDC admits
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:06.480]  65 excuse me
[3:24:06.480 --> 3:24:08.480]  CDC admits 85
[3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:10.480]  85, 85, 85, 85
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:12.480]  85
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:14.480]  like in 1985
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:16.480]  of COVID infected
[3:24:16.480 --> 3:24:18.480]  always or often wore their mask
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:20.480]  so the little face
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:22.480]  die piece
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:30.480]  do not protect you
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:32.480]  by the way do you know about plagiarism
[3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:34.480]  that is what
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:36.480]  oh people are listening now
[3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:38.480]  that's what Rush Limbaugh should do
[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:40.480]  I was a senior in high school
[3:24:40.480 --> 3:24:42.480]  and I'd go out to launch with my girlfriend
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:44.480]  I'd be drowsy
[3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:46.480]  why are you listening to that guy
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:48.480]  he does this
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:54.480]  excuse me
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:56.480]  formerly
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:24:58.480]  Nicostain
[3:24:58.480 --> 3:25:00.480]  Nicotain
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:02.480]  Nicotain
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:04.480]  Nicotain
[3:25:04.480 --> 3:25:06.480]  stained fingers
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:16.480]  you know you've heard
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:18.480]  of radio
[3:25:18.480 --> 3:25:20.480]  you've heard of like white noise
[3:25:20.480 --> 3:25:22.480]  or like rain sounds for three hours
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:24.480]  what if I put a YouTube out of like
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:26.480]  Rush Limbaugh crackling paper for three hours
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:28.480]  and then
[3:25:34.480 --> 3:25:36.480]  you know they have footage where girls
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:38.480]  eat like Casio
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:40.480]  like for hours
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:42.480]  what if I just have this one
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:56.480]  for hour after hour
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:25:58.480]  alright I appreciate our radio stations and TV stations
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:00.480]  I'm gonna stop
[3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:02.480]  I'm gonna stop misbehaving
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:06.480]  but maybe I'm cracking up on there
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:08.480]  maybe I'm gonna end up in a lunatic asylum soon
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:10.480]  maybe I'll be locked up with Joe Biden
[3:26:12.480 --> 3:26:14.480]  I mean Joe Biden that's an incredible picture
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:16.480]  he just drew
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:18.480]  why is it all in brown and realize he's like
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:20.480]  you know drawing it in his own
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:22.480]  excrement
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:24.480]  Paul doesn't realize that the longer he
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:26.480]  doesn't show up with the show
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:28.480]  here let's just call Paul Watson right now
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:32.480]  let's just do this here we go
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:36.480]  see if he answers
[3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:38.480]  welcome to the EE voicemail
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:40.480]  I'm sorry but the person you've called
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:42.480]  is not available
[3:26:42.480 --> 3:26:44.480]  please leave your message after the tone
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:46.480]  so
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:48.480]  it sounds to me like
[3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:50.480]  it sounds to me like
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:52.480]  there's not just a power outage
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:26:54.480]  the light got clicked off
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:56.480]  up in that little chateau tonight
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:26:58.480]  that little
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:00.480]  Bourdure
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:02.480]  G.G. Ping is with his quarry right now
[3:27:02.480 --> 3:27:04.480]  folks I have to
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:06.480]  with heavy heart admit to you that Paul
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:08.480]  is dating G.G. Ping
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:12.480]  I mean you've seen the proof
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:14.480]  all right I'm joking
[3:27:14.480 --> 3:27:16.480]  I'm gonna stop right now this is unprofessional
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:20.480]  and I'm gonna go to break
[3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:22.480]  when I come back I'm gonna do a serious
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:24.480]  final 10 minutes of this show
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:28.480]  you guys want to have a guarantee of that
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:30.480]  all right let's get serious then
[3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:32.480]  to have a lot of important things to cover
[3:27:36.480 --> 3:27:38.480]  let's go out to break with Jeffrey Epstein's
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:40.480]  temple has moved to Los Angeles
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:42.480]  to find work
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:44.480]  Tim Dillon a good friend of the show
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:46.480]  now a fellow Austinite
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:48.480]  now Joe Rogan's new favorite person
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:50.480]  let's go to Tim Dillon
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:52.480]  who is now advertising himself
[3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:54.480]  as Jeffrey Epstein's satanic temple
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:27:56.480]  trying to get a job in Los Angeles
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:28:00.480]  here it is
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:02.480]  this is my house
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:08.480]  as a sacrifice temple
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:10.480]  there's not a lot of cities you can work
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:12.480]  this is one of the only cities
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:16.480]  you know the problem is a lot of these
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:18.480]  people already have sacrifice temples
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:20.480]  they've been using for years
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:22.480]  so to break into it at this point is very hard
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:24.480]  Josh I can't remember me I remember you
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:26.480]  I asked July we had a lot of fun
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:28.480]  come on

[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:32.480]  so I'm also trying to get into
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:34.480]  entertainment I'm trying to do that
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:36.480]  has anybody else's boss
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:38.480]  also killed himself
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:40.480]  he's like f*** here
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:42.480]  you know listen I mean
[3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:44.480]  this is like the next phase of my life
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:46.480]  I didn't expect this to happen
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:48.480]  I thought I would work until retirement
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:50.480]  but now I'm f***ing out
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:52.480]  I'm out here in LA trying to break in entertainment
[3:28:52.480 --> 3:28:54.480]  this is my dream
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:28:58.480]  I always wanted to stand a comedian
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:00.480]  even when Hillary Clinton
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:02.480]  was slicing the throats of children
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:04.480]  I said I just want to make people laugh
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:06.480]  my owner is
[3:29:06.480 --> 3:29:08.480]  dead-ish
[3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:10.480]  wherever he f***s
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:12.480]  he's not using me anymore
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:14.480]  you know the other day I was out and I saw the Scientology Celebrity Center
[3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:16.480]  and this f***ing f***ing didn't even say hello to me
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:18.480]  bitch you know who I am
[3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:20.480]  you f***ing know who I am
[3:29:20.480 --> 3:29:22.480]  I bet just as many celebrities
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:24.480]  inside of me as you
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:26.480]  okay f***ing f***ing
[3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:28.480]  and everybody thinks we're both f***ing
[3:29:28.480 --> 3:29:30.480]  pervs and weirdos
[3:29:30.480 --> 3:29:32.480]  okay
[3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:34.480]  it wasn't always sacrifice
[3:29:34.480 --> 3:29:36.480]  sometimes it was music night
[3:29:36.480 --> 3:29:38.480]  you know you think I control what goes on
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:40.480]  no I get hired for job like everybody else
[3:29:40.480 --> 3:29:42.480]  people do what they're gonna f***ing do
[3:29:42.480 --> 3:29:44.480]  yeah I'm like a bouncy castle
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:46.480]  for satanic pedophiles
[3:29:46.480 --> 3:29:48.480]  you know
[3:29:48.480 --> 3:29:50.480]  that's not all I want to be
[3:29:50.480 --> 3:29:52.480]  finally just got headshots
[3:29:52.480 --> 3:29:54.480]  meeting with a manager
[3:29:54.480 --> 3:29:56.480]  don't know how it's gonna work
[3:29:56.480 --> 3:29:58.480]  don't expect anything
[3:29:58.480 --> 3:30:00.480]  somebody told me to start a podcast
[3:30:00.480 --> 3:30:02.480]  I mean I guess it's not a bad idea
[3:30:02.480 --> 3:30:04.480]  but
[3:30:04.480 --> 3:30:06.480]  this is where it's at now
[3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:08.480]  you know
[3:30:08.480 --> 3:30:10.480]  Kevry used to look at me
[3:30:10.480 --> 3:30:12.480]  he used to say one day I'm gonna be gone
[3:30:12.480 --> 3:30:14.480]  it's f***ing different
[3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:16.480]  and you know what
[3:30:16.480 --> 3:30:18.480]  right
[3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:20.480]  by the way Tim Dillon is Joe Rogan's
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:22.480]  favorite comedian
[3:30:22.480 --> 3:30:24.480]  and they also have gotten married recently
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:26.480]  and bought a house together in Austin
[3:30:26.480 --> 3:30:28.480]  which part of that is true
[3:30:28.480 --> 3:30:30.480]  the first part
[3:30:30.480 --> 3:30:32.480]  the last part are all of it
[3:30:32.480 --> 3:30:34.480]  well C&M can only tell you the truth
[3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:36.480]  I don't know
[3:30:38.480 --> 3:30:40.480]  you notice that over and over again
[3:30:40.480 --> 3:30:42.480]  the united nations are supposed controllers
[3:30:42.480 --> 3:30:44.480]  and bosses the great arbiter of truth
[3:30:44.480 --> 3:30:46.480]  that no one's allowed to disagree with
[3:30:46.480 --> 3:30:48.480]  has come out and said
[3:30:48.480 --> 3:30:50.480]  nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19
[3:30:50.480 --> 3:30:52.480]  well ladies and gentlemen
[3:30:52.480 --> 3:30:54.480]  that's a total lie
[3:30:54.480 --> 3:30:56.480]  if you get a lot of sunlight
[3:30:56.480 --> 3:30:58.480]  it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3
[3:30:58.480 --> 3:31:00.480]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections
[3:31:00.480 --> 3:31:02.480]  when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3
[3:31:02.480 --> 3:31:04.480]  if you have zinc and vitamin C as well
[3:31:04.480 --> 3:31:06.480]  that's why people get the flu
[3:31:06.480 --> 3:31:08.480]  and it's cold in the winter
[3:31:08.480 --> 3:31:10.480]  because that's when vitamin D levels plunge
[3:31:10.480 --> 3:31:12.480]  now I've pointed this out
[3:31:12.480 --> 3:31:14.480]  and it's a rumor
[3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:16.480]  for saying that there's hope
[3:31:16.480 --> 3:31:18.480]  that people should have their vitamins and their minerals
[3:31:18.480 --> 3:31:20.480]  well now Fauci's been forced to come out
[3:31:20.480 --> 3:31:22.480]  and admit that you need vitamin D3
[3:31:22.480 --> 3:31:24.480]  and see he should have also added zinc
[3:31:24.480 --> 3:31:26.480]  because the NIH website says
[3:31:26.480 --> 3:31:28.480]  you die without zinc
[3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:30.480]  but it's good news that he's being pressured now
[3:31:30.480 --> 3:31:32.480]  to admit the reality
[3:31:32.480 --> 3:31:34.480]  because so many doctors and nurses
[3:31:34.480 --> 3:31:36.480]  and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[3:31:36.480 --> 3:31:38.480]  that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins
[3:31:38.480 --> 3:31:40.480]  this is your last chance
[3:31:40.480 --> 3:31:42.480]  and I'm really bummed out about that
[3:31:42.480 --> 3:31:44.480]  it started out as a sleeper product
[3:31:44.480 --> 3:31:46.480]  but the people that did order it
[3:31:46.480 --> 3:31:48.480]  loved it and sort of reordering it
[3:31:48.480 --> 3:31:50.480]  they spread the word and became one of our best sellers
[3:31:50.480 --> 3:31:52.480]  but because of the COVID supply chain breakdown
[3:31:52.480 --> 3:31:54.480]  and because there's 13 different
[3:31:54.480 --> 3:31:56.480]  formulas in a pack power stack
[3:31:56.480 --> 3:31:58.480]  we are unable to secure it anymore
[3:31:58.480 --> 3:32:00.480]  this is the highest
[3:32:00.480 --> 3:32:02.480]  in AMPM pack system
[3:32:02.480 --> 3:32:04.480]  you're going to find where you take
[3:32:04.480 --> 3:32:06.480]  half the pills in the morning
[3:32:06.480 --> 3:32:08.480]  half the caps at night
[3:32:08.480 --> 3:32:10.480]  you don't have time to go into everything that's in it
[3:32:10.480 --> 3:32:12.480]  but this gets people to remember to take it
[3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:14.480]  and that's why it's having such a great effect
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:16.480]  because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:18.480]  so it's your last chance to get an AMPM power stack

[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:54.480]  by word of mouth
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:33:56.480]  they have banned
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:58.480]  the links to ban.video

[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:08.480]  the system
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:10.480]  is censoring because
[3:34:10.480 --> 3:34:12.480]  the power of the people overrode them
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:14.480]  4 years ago, trump has finally figured this out
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:16.480]  since he's going to take action
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:18.480]  once reelected against big tech
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:20.480]  and he's modern in the situation
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:22.480]  well we know the president is overwhelmed right now
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:24.480]  because he has taken action
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:26.480]  we the people are taking action now

[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:08.480]  the west is the best
[3:35:08.480 --> 3:35:10.480]  and it'll do the rest
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:14.480]  the blue bus
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:16.480]  and it will do the rest
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:20.480]  he is calling us
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:22.480]  alright let me get serious
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:26.480]  you know when you're not scared of dying
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:28.480]  when all you care about is freedom
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:30.480]  you can be a little wild on there
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:32.480]  and I apologize for the last 45 minutes
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:34.480]  I didn't know Paul Watson wouldn't be here
[3:35:34.480 --> 3:35:36.480]  and I've really had a lot of good things happening
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:38.480]  a lot of bad things happening behind the scenes
[3:35:38.480 --> 3:35:40.480]  let's like the heavens have opened up
[3:35:40.480 --> 3:35:42.480]  just it's incredible to be alive
[3:35:42.480 --> 3:35:44.480]  no god is so real and be so thankful for all of you out there
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:46.480]  this great crew
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:48.480]  but I want to go wild
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:50.480]  I want to have some fun
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:52.480]  I'm sick and tired of the fight man
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:54.480]  because I'm so into the fight
[3:35:54.480 --> 3:35:56.480]  you know what I mean it's like
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:35:58.480]  there's an opposite and equal reaction
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:00.480]  so I'm this good guy
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:02.480]  you're a good person too
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:04.480]  we love God we love justice
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:06.480]  but man
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:08.480]  the bigger my good side gets
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:10.480]  the more I tell you that bad side
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:12.480]  just sitting over there ready to go crazy
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:14.480]  got a lot to cover here today
[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:16.480]  I talked about Tim Dillon
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:18.480]  you know who Tim Dillon was like five years ago
[3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:20.480]  I'd seen his stuff
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:22.480]  really funny
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:24.480]  and I talked to Joe Rogan quite a bit
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:26.480]  not name dropping
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:28.480]  he'll keep asking what I'm going to be on the show
[3:36:28.480 --> 3:36:30.480]  I'll just say hold your breath
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:32.480]  you won't be waiting too long
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:34.480]  but
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:36.480]  then I went on this Jag
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:38.480]  watching his stuff a lot because he's
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:40.480]  moving to Austin
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:42.480]  this is a really funny guy so here's his piece on
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:44.480]  Antifa and the Hamptons
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:46.480]  with another billionaire that's now organizing
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:48.480]  him to attack anybody that's got more money than him
[3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:50.480]  that's really what the message is
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:52.480]  but it's even worse than it's the elites attacking us
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:54.480]  and then he's got this little satanic piece
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:36:56.480]  about democrat senator
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:36:58.480]  that are just very powerful
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:00.480]  he had all this in the last few weeks
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:02.480]  so here's a few of those pieces
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:04.480]  you have the honor
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:06.480]  of being the first chapter
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:08.480]  of Antifa
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:10.480]  in the Hamptons
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:12.480]  why am I the leader
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:14.480]  because I am in the system
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:16.480]  but I have defected and now I agree with you
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  we are going to topple the patriarchy
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:20.480]  and what is the patriarchy
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:22.480]  Jeff Goldstein
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:24.480]  Jeff Goldstein is my ex-wife
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:26.480]  correct we are going to dismantle capitalism
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:28.480]  and what
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:30.480]  is capitalism
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:32.480]  any hedge fund that's bigger than yours
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:34.480]  any hedge fund bigger than mine correct
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:36.480]  I have heard
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:38.480]  that certain people at the IRS
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:40.480]  are transphobic
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:42.480]  what we're going to have to do is get in there
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:44.480]  and let them know that this is unacceptable
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:46.480]  behavior
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:48.480]  the IRS are the cops too
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:50.480]  you will all have a mini child's
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:52.480]  golf club for
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:54.480]  self defense
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:56.480]  we will train on a plush giraffe
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:37:58.480]  that I bought for my daughter
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.480]  before my wife won custody of her
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:02.480]  you're trying to f*** your ex-wife
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:04.480]  is that what you're doing
[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:06.480]  you're trying to destroy your family
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  you will train day and night on the giraffe
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:10.480]  until you are ready for hand to hand combat
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:12.480]  my commitment
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:14.480]  to social justice
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:16.480]  is unparalleled
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:18.480]  I don't care what I have to do
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:20.480]  everybody that doesn't have a club has a pool noodle
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:22.480]  because you cannot handle the clubs yet
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:24.480]  you will graduate to clump
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:30.480]  now remember you don't work for George Soros anymore
[3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:32.480]  you work for me
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:36.480]  senator
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:38.480]  senator do you have some time for a quick interview
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:40.480]  I'm on my way to a meeting
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:42.480]  it'll just be a few minutes
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:44.480]  do you have any comments on the irregularities
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:46.480]  in the mail-in voting
[3:38:46.480 --> 3:38:48.480]  I don't think there are any irregularities in the mail-in voting
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:50.480]  I think the republicans knew that
[3:38:50.480 --> 3:38:52.480]  they knew it when they were advocating mail-in voting
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:54.480]  this entire thing is a spectacle
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:56.480]  what do you think about the debate so far
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:38:58.480]  I think this administration
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:00.480]  does not treat any of our democratic process
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:02.480]  with dignity
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:04.480]  and respect
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:06.480]  this is a vulgar
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:08.480]  and crass administration
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:10.480]  this is ridiculous
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:12.480]  America is built on customs
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:14.480]  it's built on respect for institutions
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:16.480]  this administration has none of it
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:18.480]  do you think the president is going to accept the results of the election
[3:39:18.480 --> 3:39:20.480]  well we're actually going to discuss that right now
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:22.480]  you caught me
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:24.480]  on my way to a meeting to discuss just that
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:26.480]  what is the meeting
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:28.480]  where are you going
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:30.480]  it's an election year
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:32.480]  and there's a lot of interested parties
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  and what we're trying to do is safeguard
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:36.480]  a democracy of the people
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:38.480]  for the people
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  by the people
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:42.480]  how did you find me
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:44.480]  I was telling you for a little bit
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  clever boy huh
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:48.480]  why don't you come cover it
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:50.480]  come cover the meeting
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:52.480]  come cover the meeting
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:54.480]  I think it's a good idea
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:56.480]  you're going to meet a lot of interesting people
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  thank you so much
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:00.480]  what are you doing
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:06.480]  so that's some good art there
[3:40:06.480 --> 3:40:08.480]  it's all based on human sacrifice
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:10.480]  on you being worthless
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:12.480]  they're feeding on you
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:14.480]  here's one more
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:16.480]  here is Tim Dillon doing his little promotion
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:18.480]  of New York City and the fact that it's not in trouble
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:39.480]  you know how much the most expensive apartment in this city is? 1 zillion dollars! how could a city like that die?
[3:40:39.480 --> 3:40:49.480]  we lived in a rank control apartment by the park
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:52.480]  when it hasn't been your day or week or month
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:54.480]  or even your year
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:57.480]  but I'll be there for you
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:40:59.480]  before COVID I had a great f***ing job
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:01.480]  I used to spit on people in Central Park
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:03.480]  and they'd give me money
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:05.480]  you can't get a job like that somewhere else
[3:41:05.480 --> 3:41:07.480]  this is the greatest city there's opportunities everywhere
[3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:09.480]  Jerry Seinfeld thinks we're going to make it
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:11.480]  and I bet he's right
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:17.480]  it's the greatest city in the world baby
[3:41:19.480 --> 3:41:21.480]  okay so this is that
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:25.480]  I'm being serious now that's who Joe Rogan thinks is the best comedian alive
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:27.480]  so I binge watched a bunch of his stuff
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:29.480]  and yeah he's
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:31.480]  they're like oh he's the new Chris Farley
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:33.480]  Chris Farley was okay
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:35.480]  a little bit of physical comedy
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:37.480]  he's as good as Tim Dillon
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:39.480]  so there you go
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:41.480]  because he takes real commentary
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:43.480]  about what's happening in the current world
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:45.480]  and covers it
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:49.480]  so no, Paul Watson is not married to G.G.P.
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:53.480]  Tim Dillon is not married to Joe Rogan though they do date
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:41:55.480]  and we've had a lot of fun here
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:41:59.480]  well that's a shocking photo right there
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:02.480]  we've joked around here but this is a very serious time to be alive
[3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:04.480]  and I'm not going to play around with the audience
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:06.480]  I've had a lot of people send me this article
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:08.480]  explosive
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:10.480]  CIA whistleblower exposes
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:12.480]  Biden's alleged role with deaths of SEAL team
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:14.480]  claims to have documented proof
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:18.480]  and I'm not pooping on the story but we've exposed
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:20.480]  and they blew up that helicopter full of SEALs
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:22.480]  that were part of the fake bin Laden raid
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:26.480]  back when it happened so
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:28.480]  that's going to be covered in more on the war room
[3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:30.480]  with Owen
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:32.480]  Shroyer
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:34.480]  and that's the big secret is it's not Tim Dillon
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:36.480]  it's not Joe Rogan
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:38.480]  it's not Paul Watson dating G.G.P.
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:40.480]  we found out this morning
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  that Owen Shroyer is actually the son
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:46.480]  the illegitimate son of G.G.P.
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:50.480]  now that's not called fake news
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:52.480]  that's called a joke
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:42:58.480]  alright I need to behave myself
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:00.480]  I'm out of control
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:02.480]  a lot of stuff's happened lately
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:04.480]  a lot of crazy things I appreciate you all
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:06.480]  I'm going to be a good boy
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:08.480]  I'm going to go take a nap
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:10.480]  for about an hour
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:12.480]  I'm going to wake up I'm going to come back
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:14.480]  better than ever and I'm going to kick butt
[3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:16.480]  but this is what happens when Paul
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:18.480]  Josephine Watson
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  does not show up
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:22.480]  for its
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:24.480]  hour of a lot of time
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:26.480]  this is what happens when you piss on a man's rug
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  I have the big Lebowski
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:30.480]  they say have you seen
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:32.480]  watch what happens to your car out there
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:34.480]  this is you're entering a world of hurt here
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:36.480]  this is not a good thing
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:38.480]  alright I'm going to stop
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:40.480]  seriously though
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:42.480]  let's get really serious
[3:43:42.480 --> 3:43:44.480]  this is the last day you can get APEC PowerStack
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:46.480]  which is an amazing nutraceutical
[3:43:46.480 --> 3:43:48.480]  an amazing 13-pill pack
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:50.480]  we can't get anymore because of the COVID lockdown
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:52.480]  it's 60% off free shipping
[3:43:52.480 --> 3:43:54.480]  in FullWareStore.com
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:56.480]  there's a lot of crazy news about the lockdowns
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:43:58.480]  and the food and all the crap
[3:43:58.480 --> 3:44:00.480]  I think everybody should get storeable food

[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:34.480]  against these absolute pieces
[3:44:34.480 --> 3:44:36.480]  of redonkillous trash
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:38.480]  and then don't forget it won't just be Owen Shroyer

[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:02.480]  and Bill Gates may he rot in hell

[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:48.480]  alright love you guys great job!
