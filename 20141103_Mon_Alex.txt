[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:14.000 --> 00:22.440]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:22.440 --> 00:32.200]  jones ladies and gentlemen we have swept the decks clean tomorrow's election
[00:32.200 --> 00:37.200]  coverage we're getting Tucker Carlson on and James O'Keeffe it looks like he's
[00:37.200 --> 00:43.080]  done it again that guy deserves like five Pulitzer prizes a true journalist
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.240]  that's a drudge that's coined that term O'Keeffe does it again and again and
[00:48.240 --> 00:53.520]  again and again got video exclusive undercover video shows North Carolina
[00:53.520 --> 00:59.160]  poll workers offering ballots to ineligible imposter 20 times putting
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.600]  voter ID battle on front burner yeah O'Keeffe caught Democrats in Texas saying
[01:03.600 --> 01:07.040]  we're gonna bring you legals in and have a vote
[01:07.400 --> 01:13.080]  Illinois is introduced to bill that was well it's it's past their house and
[01:13.080 --> 01:16.880]  Senate I think was unanimous in the Senate we covered it Sunday with David
[01:16.880 --> 01:25.080]  Knight yesterday that will that is a ballot initiative to let people vote
[01:25.080 --> 01:31.120]  quote from any country of origin who are not citizens imagine the boldness of
[01:31.120 --> 01:40.160]  saying if you can get here you can vote it's just over the top crazy but it'll
[01:40.160 --> 01:49.600]  probably pass it passed the Illinois Senate unanimously I'm living in the
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.200]  twilight zone I know I just keep saying that I really am because I read all this
[01:55.200 --> 01:58.080]  news I look at it morning noon and night I sit here before the show going
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.680]  through hundreds of articles just staring at it it's just creates an image
[02:02.680 --> 02:09.720]  an irrefutable image of people out of control and you study history that's
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.360]  what elites do over and over and over again so we're gonna be breaking this
[02:14.360 --> 02:21.920]  down today you want to talk election how about we talk about this article out
[02:21.920 --> 02:28.480]  of Politico Obama readying for lame duck presidency Obama faces the loss of his
[02:28.480 --> 02:34.920]  rabid fan base well you know what he's got a veto he's got his executive orders
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.600]  on his telephone stroke of the pin law the land kind of cool as Bogala said
[02:40.600 --> 02:47.920]  working for Clinton and he's got a bunch of people like Mitch McConnell in the
[02:47.920 --> 02:54.800]  Senate he'll probably the new leader of the Senate and he's got people in the
[02:54.800 --> 03:01.120]  house like Boehner the answer is get rid of Boehner get rid of Mitch McConnell
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.720]  McConnell's not as bad as Boehner hard to believe that but it's true I've looked
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.960]  at their voting records and get Rand Paul Ted Cruz types in there and then we
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.320]  could really start doing things like lowering taxes and watching the economy
[03:17.320 --> 03:25.120]  explode getting rid of Obamacare waivers for McDonald's and others
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.200]  abolishing Obamacare if you imagine what that would do we're like a boat tied to
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.480]  the dock with the motor going and we're not going anywhere we've got to cut the
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.200]  rope everything they're doing is to shut the economy down while promising to get
[03:40.200 --> 03:45.320]  it going it's easy to get the economy going but under agenda 21 they don't
[03:45.320 --> 03:50.600]  want us to have any wealth because they say it's bad for the earth wealth is not
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.080]  bad for the earth it's the type of wealth it's the type of industry but
[03:55.080 --> 04:00.520]  classical wealth improves the environment everybody knows that humans in many cases
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.440]  make the environment better wildlife just flocks to parks and places and humans
[04:06.440 --> 04:13.960]  turn the desert green I'm sick of this idea of putting humans down while the
[04:13.960 --> 04:16.760]  elite fly around in their big jet airplanes at red carpets telling Africans
[04:16.760 --> 04:21.360]  you can't have a car you can't have air conditioning Washington Post says 96
[04:21.360 --> 04:27.000]  percent chance Republicans will sweep the Senate CNN says 95 New York Times says
[04:27.000 --> 04:34.920]  70% I don't know what the truth is because undoubtedly there's a massive
[04:34.920 --> 04:39.600]  political realignment happening right now but there's so much election fraud
[04:39.600 --> 04:44.600]  going on by the Democratic Party nakedly that I don't know what to expect but
[04:44.600 --> 04:54.800]  it's hard to overpower a landslide 2014 is everything it was once said and I
[04:54.800 --> 05:01.120]  agree with that statement it is so critical that we reject Obama the
[05:01.120 --> 05:04.640]  government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at
[05:04.640 --> 05:09.120]  the same time the restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms can

[08:46.880 --> 08:52.320]  to have three hours of news and open phones today no guest today we've got
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.440]  Tucker Carlson on tomorrow and it looks like James O'Keefe who's done it again
[08:56.440 --> 09:01.560]  he's going to be joining us as well
[09:01.560 --> 09:06.640]  wow there's just so much to get into there's also a lot of Ebola news as a
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.600]  bowl continues to spread across Africa and Obama said last week he wouldn't be
[09:11.600 --> 09:15.920]  surprised if more cases don't pop up here and we see reports out of Spain over
[09:15.920 --> 09:20.800]  the weekend that they believe Al Nuzra or Al Qaeda or ISIS may try to get
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.480]  infected in Africa with Ebola and bring it to the west they don't need to do
[09:25.480 --> 09:31.360]  that we have Obama to do that and Spain has a government that brought Ebola
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.560]  patients in to spread it successfully so you don't need Islamist sleeper cells
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.520]  to bring it in when you have Western governments that are doing it here's
[09:42.520 --> 09:47.600]  another headline dealing with that from Breitbart Singapore requires visas for
[09:47.600 --> 09:54.000]  Ebola hit African states isn't that interesting AP is also reporting this
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.120]  citizens of Guiana Liberia Sierra Leone will eat a visa to enter Singapore as
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.640]  part of a measure against the spread of Ebola and guess what they're not issuing
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.000]  the visas but the United States is a poll reports this is up on info wars.com
[10:09.000 --> 10:18.040]  71% back mandatory Ebola quarantine in US Rand Paul libertarian in me horrified
[10:18.040 --> 10:24.360]  at government enforced detention well you're a medical doctor Rand and you
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.360]  know the only way to stop it is to shut it down when it first gets here or then
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.320]  we end up with tens of thousands quarantine a new NBC News Wall Street
[10:32.320 --> 10:35.280]  Journal poll finds in almost three-quarters of Americans want to
[10:35.280 --> 10:38.360]  see government-enforced mandatory quarantines for health workers returning
[10:38.360 --> 10:44.520]  from West Africa yeah that's just a default measure a whopping 71% of
[10:44.520 --> 10:48.160]  respondents said they felt health workers would have treated Ebola sufferers
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.520]  abroad should be subject to 21-day isolation if they show no symptoms of
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.920]  the virus themselves if you're treating people with Ebola in Africa you should
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.360]  not leave the country till you've separated yourself from the hot zone
[11:01.360 --> 11:05.600]  you're still in the country but not up against the patients that's the real
[11:05.600 --> 11:10.760]  hot zone and then you stay 21 days or more at the medical center or wherever
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.520]  and you don't show signs then you leave in fact so you don't come here in
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.200]  quarantine you quarantine there that's the default why is it being ignored why
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.560]  are medical workers bringing it in why is it spreading why is there an obvious
[11:23.560 --> 11:31.600]  cover-up that's what I'm getting at here fifth doctor in Sierra Leone dies of
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.120]  Ebola that's just some of the news I'm done covering that the big news
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.880]  obviously is election news I want to play this report coming up in a moment
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.520]  James O'Keeffe offered a bus load of ballots in North Carolina and last week
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.480]  he proved that they were letting illegals vote that's one guy with a camera
[11:51.480 --> 11:59.680]  person who is the model in my newsroom of go out do things like that that's real
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.320]  investigative journalism that's going out and showing the fraud remember him
[12:04.320 --> 12:12.000]  five years ago going into multiple acorn mafia facilities they're mafia in my
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.640]  view and saying hi I've got sex slaves from Latin America children I want to
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.000]  run them as prostitutes on the street they go sure we'll help set up your
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.080]  operation for it is quite normal just make sure you put them in the public
[12:23.080 --> 12:29.120]  school that will not arise any you know of the government's suspicion or CPS may
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.320]  get called do you understand the systematic evil to just walk in at the
[12:35.320 --> 12:39.320]  facility at facility and they're just ready to do it do you understand the
[12:39.320 --> 12:47.080]  level of premeditated criminal mindset we're dealing with so we're going to
[12:47.080 --> 12:50.800]  get into that report he said it again he said it last week he said it again
[12:50.800 --> 12:54.640]  this is what we need get on the offensive weather channel founder says
[12:54.640 --> 13:00.720]  man may global warming is baloney and we've had Pastor Chuck ball one and
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.320]  others on talking about this movement a few years ago that was launched by the
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.440]  Liberty Movement by this broadcast in part not bragging just showing how we
[13:08.440 --> 13:14.920]  can have an effect all across the country churches are defying the IRS
[13:14.920 --> 13:20.400]  endorsing candidates daring the agency to sue thousands of libertarian or
[13:20.400 --> 13:26.120]  Christian conservative style churches are saying look the Democrats openly
[13:26.120 --> 13:29.640]  collect money they openly endorse who they want we're not endorsing a
[13:29.640 --> 13:33.600]  Republican or a Democrat we're endorsing someone who's pro-life we're
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.560]  endorsing someone who's pro self-defense we're endorsing someone who's pro
[13:37.560 --> 13:42.520]  family we're endorsing someone who's pro business that we believe follows the
[13:42.520 --> 13:49.200]  ideas in the Bible of liberty and and and a free will that's the real message
[13:49.200 --> 13:52.320]  of the Bible and do unto others as you have them do unto you and so politico
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.680]  is kind of trying to sick the IRS on them hey they've already been attacked
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.800]  and see this is what how America always works the system thinks we're cowards
[14:01.800 --> 14:04.600]  when they come out and say hey you better not talk about government or we'll
[14:04.600 --> 14:09.080]  audit you you better not demonstrated a pro-life you know rally or we'll come
[14:09.080 --> 14:13.200]  audit you better not give money to the Tea Party we'll audit you better not go
[14:13.200 --> 14:16.460]  out and hold the sign outside or we'll come after you better not film the
[14:16.460 --> 14:21.320]  police or we'll arrest you that just makes ten times more people come out of
[14:21.320 --> 14:25.320]  the woodwork to go out once you start pushing people around I've said this
[14:25.320 --> 14:31.160]  thousands of times Americans aren't really cowardly in fact most Americans
[14:31.160 --> 14:39.480]  are super hard-working and come from vicious stock vicious vicious nail
[14:39.480 --> 14:48.320]  eating bare knuckles boxing just swashbuckling you get ready everybody
[14:48.320 --> 14:52.200]  knows that the whole world do that all the foreign Japanese and French
[14:52.200 --> 14:56.280]  historians came here in the last 200 plus years and marveled at the United
[14:56.280 --> 14:59.920]  States and the people here and so even though we become fat dumb and happy we
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.880]  still got it in us and so Americans have become totally focused on bread and
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.200]  circus until they get pushed around until they get bullied and the system
[15:09.200 --> 15:14.160]  thinks that oh we'll just have the IRS take all ladies pension funds with no
[15:14.160 --> 15:17.560]  judge no jury no proof of fraud oh we'll just have the police out running
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.680]  warrantless checkpoints to take blood oh we'll just we'll just push push push
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.400]  and we'll audit 20,000 tea partyers a year and we'll intimidate all that's
[15:27.400 --> 15:32.720]  going to cause is a giant backlash sure it's super cheesy but we should
[15:32.720 --> 15:36.280]  probably find the clip on YouTube from Star Wars in episode four where
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.120]  Princess Leia is on board the Death Star talking to Governor Tarkin or
[15:40.120 --> 15:44.680]  whatever his name is and he's telling her he's gonna blow up her home planet
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.600]  she doesn't answer his questions that she says listen the tighter you squeeze
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.760]  the more star systems will squeeze through your fingers and that is what we
[15:53.760 --> 15:59.080]  know historically happens it doesn't just happen in fictionalized accounts a
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.200]  long time ago in a galaxy far far away it happens historically and it
[16:04.200 --> 16:10.520]  particularly happens with Americans the reason I'm on air is that people mess
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.760]  with my family people in the government did the reason I'm on air is because I
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.360]  then saw farmers and ranchers having their houses taken and their farms
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.360]  taken by the environmental landgrabbers who turned around and sold it off to
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.000]  build on it a few years later I saw the mafia in action and at a fundamental
[16:28.000 --> 16:35.080]  cellular level started thinking how do I in the 21st century that was back in
[16:35.080 --> 16:40.160]  the 20th century but how do I looking forward resist them and I said I'll do
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.320]  whatever I can to resist them and I'll blow the trumpet to get other people to
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.520]  be watchmen on the wall to try to rally more people to resist peacefully this
[16:49.520 --> 16:56.680]  operation and have a velvet revolution of renaissance and awakening to this
[16:56.680 --> 17:03.960]  tyranny to this injustice that's why they scream racism all day that's why
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.400]  they push all these distractionary issues is because sure there's some
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.520]  racism going on on all sides out there there are groups of whites that go out
[17:12.520 --> 17:15.160]  and find blacks and attack them there's groups of blacks that go out and find
[17:15.160 --> 17:18.040]  whites and attack them and Hispanics that go out and find blacks and attack
[17:18.040 --> 17:21.520]  them and blacks that go out and find Asians and attack them on and on and on
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.720]  Asians that find other groups of you know Hispanics to attack there's all
[17:25.720 --> 17:31.240]  sorts of gang warfare going on at a dumbed-down level but at the end of the
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.400]  day 98% of us aren't involved in that we're all going under Obamacare in the
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.560]  death panels we're all having our job shipped overseas by design we're all
[17:40.560 --> 17:43.760]  being told we didn't build a business we're all being told our kids don't
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.680]  belong to us we're all being told we don't have a right to own guns we're all
[17:46.680 --> 17:49.320]  being told we don't have a right to have a vehicle we're all being told we don't
[17:49.320 --> 17:54.080]  have this is a bunch of bull and so we just come together on these simple
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.520]  ideas and I don't care who delivers them the Republicans the Democrats the
[17:57.520 --> 18:04.280]  libertarians I don't care what you call the organization or group we need to put
[18:04.280 --> 18:10.360]  our ideas out and then support whoever promotes them and get out of this
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.400]  partisanship but the Democrats when they were in power got on a power trip
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.520]  that I've never seen the likes of and they have run absolutely wild crazy
[18:21.520 --> 18:28.880]  Tasmanian devil meets Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde meets Woody Woodpecker meets
[18:28.880 --> 18:37.080]  Jeffrey Dahmer meets Adolf Hitler meets Joseph Stalin meets the most crazy
[18:37.080 --> 18:43.040]  stock market person you can imagine I mean I just it's wild and it's out of
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.880]  control and they've gone too far we have to have an indictment of Obama and if
[18:48.880 --> 18:53.640]  we can't get one in the Congress with an impeachment we can get one in the
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.600]  court of public opinion with a referendum on everything socialist
[18:57.600 --> 19:03.560]  everything collectivist everything big city machine of the oldest party in
[19:03.560 --> 19:08.360]  this country the Democrats who have perfected racial division and
[19:08.360 --> 19:13.240]  distraction and diversion and dumbing people down and their willing accomplices
[19:13.240 --> 19:16.560]  in the media and their willing accomplices in the Republican Party this
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.880]  is a referendum on all of these people that this is not business as usual and
[19:21.880 --> 19:24.880]  we don't care how much you try to militarize the cops and how many armored
[19:24.880 --> 19:29.880]  vehicles you buy and how much police state training it's the police out there

[25:43.160 --> 25:47.000]  repeatedly offered ballots last week to an imposter who arrived at polling
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.640]  places with the names and addresses of inactive voters who had participated
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.880]  in the election in many years no fraudulent votes were actually cast it
[25:54.880 --> 25:58.320]  was the latest undercover video sting from conservative activist James O'Keefe
[25:58.320 --> 26:04.400]  whose filmmaking resume reads like a target list of liberal causes yeah he's
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.120]  brought down multi-billion operations he famously shattered acorn the
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.120]  community organizing outfit linked to Barack Obama he dressed up as some of
[26:13.120 --> 26:18.000]  the Laden and crossed the Rio Grande showing how it's the borders wide open
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.680]  on and on and on and this is what anybody in media could do showing the
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.520]  hypocrisy and notice how he shakes them to their foundation info wars has
[26:28.520 --> 26:32.000]  shaken the system to its foundation drudgereport.com shaking them to the
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  foundation and it's great to have an O'Keefe or a world net daily or a Matt
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.920]  drudge out there because I don't like being one of the only big missiles being
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.520]  fired at the establishment it is dangerous and believe me if Republicans
[26:45.520 --> 26:49.480]  are doing stuff like this we'll be exposing it differences they just start
[26:49.480 --> 26:55.480]  big wars and build more prisons which I don't like and and support Patriot acts
[26:55.480 --> 27:00.640]  they don't just run these mafia operations and I'm not even saying
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.720]  they're good it's just the Democrats are so evil let's go to this clip and then
[27:05.720 --> 27:11.560]  it's official the new Samsung TVs they put it out in the press release and the
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.760]  terms of conditions Samsung listens to you in live time and warns you that they
[27:16.760 --> 27:23.920]  are indeed monitoring everything you do so it says watch what you say I've
[27:23.920 --> 27:28.280]  told people eight years ago under a Google patent this was going on we're
[27:28.280 --> 27:31.240]  gonna cover that after the break but here's a James O'Keefe and Veritas
[27:31.240 --> 27:37.400]  project I'm James O'Keefe reporting from North Carolina there are more than
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.880]  700,000 inactive voters in the state according to the voter integrity
[27:40.880 --> 27:44.920]  project these are people the state is essentially lost which creates a recipe
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.960]  for voter fraud on a massive scale don't believe it project Veritas action has
[27:49.960 --> 27:53.520]  proven it watch how many ballots I get offered from election officials
[27:53.520 --> 28:06.400]  throughout the state we easily access North Carolina's statewide voter roles
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.280]  from there we were able to isolate the inactive voters then we narrowed the
[28:11.280 --> 28:16.000]  list down to 30 year old males the next step to visit early voting sites across
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.040]  the state and ask if they had that person's name on the list we were
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.680]  careful not to say we were that person
[28:25.680 --> 28:29.600]  4618 is correct that's the correct address
[28:29.600 --> 28:33.600]  and I'll see if there's anything else
[28:33.600 --> 28:39.240]  George is the third yep that's the correct name
[28:39.240 --> 28:45.440]  and Raleigh 27612 that's correct that's right take a look at this
[28:45.440 --> 28:55.040]  so I just sign this and then I'll be able to vote afterwards yes some 20 times
[28:55.040 --> 28:59.920]  nearly a busload we were just a signature or two away from voting of
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.800]  course we never signed anything but we could have and if we had we could have
[29:04.800 --> 29:07.400]  voted and no one would have been the wiser
[29:07.400 --> 29:19.640]  just about every time we offered to produce ID to verify our identity we
[29:19.640 --> 29:23.720]  were quickly told it was unnecessary and almost scolded for off right all right
[29:23.720 --> 29:28.520]  that's enough you see the full video up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[29:28.520 --> 29:33.920]  dot com imagine the identity theft that this is causing as well using voter
[29:33.920 --> 29:42.520]  rolls and they don't want to have voter ID laws to vote because this is part of
[29:42.520 --> 29:47.280]  an organized globalist takeover of America with Democratic Party operatives

[33:26.840 --> 33:33.080]  it this weekend reporter was asking me how I would define myself I have a
[33:33.080 --> 33:42.280]  policy of truth to rip off the name of a popular depeche mode song I really try
[33:42.280 --> 33:46.560]  to tell the truth and if I don't want to hurt somebody's feelings I just try to
[33:46.560 --> 33:53.280]  shut up I want to be truthful to myself I don't want to be delusional one thing
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.440]  I've noticed is that most losers that I've known in my life fantasize about
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.920]  how they're successful and fantasize about how their competition is failing
[34:02.920 --> 34:07.560]  and we'll make things up they will sit right there to your face do something
[34:07.560 --> 34:13.120]  and then deny they did it instead of just owning up to it and when you lie like
[34:13.120 --> 34:21.080]  that it doesn't just infect the general culture it infects your brain you start
[34:21.080 --> 34:27.640]  believing your own bull and I don't want to be one of those people that's why it's
[34:27.640 --> 34:32.840]  so upsetting fundamentally to see a rotting political culture that's doing
[34:32.840 --> 34:41.560]  just that rotting I want to hear from you on elections 2014 I have never openly
[34:41.560 --> 34:48.520]  endorsed the Tea Party even though I was part of its founding with Ron Paul the
[34:48.520 --> 35:05.240]  the proto grips drafting him to run back in 2007 up ahead of 2008 and even
[35:05.240 --> 35:10.600]  before that in the election before that called themselves the Tea Party
[35:10.600 --> 35:14.360]  libertarian anti-war groups who didn't want to be associated with the
[35:14.360 --> 35:22.960]  Democratic Party they went out in Austin Texas and in Boston Massachusetts and
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.600]  then in San Diego California and I was part of some of those first events here
[35:27.600 --> 35:33.840]  in Austin and they would march to the bridge and throw the 9-11 Commission
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.880]  report in the water or they would throw the PNAC document in the water and the
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.320]  police would threaten to arrest them and then they would tie a rope to it and
[35:42.320 --> 35:49.560]  pull it back up I mean how pathetic that they would target us like that because
[35:49.560 --> 35:52.480]  the old Tea Party they just went and actually sack the ships and throw it
[35:52.480 --> 35:56.640]  right in the harbor and beat anybody over the head that tried to stop them think
[35:56.640 --> 35:59.840]  about how timid we've gotten and I'm not calling for violence I'm just
[35:59.840 --> 36:05.160]  illustrating the difference Paul Revere wrote around on his horse saying get
[36:05.160 --> 36:10.120]  your guns get ready for war get ready to kill people an enemy has landed to
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.840]  usurpus one is by land two is by sea and they called him a great founding
[36:14.840 --> 36:19.520]  American one of the archetypal symbols
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.920]  but then I go on air and get in Pierce Morgan's face and say look cut out the
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.840]  lies the fake debate you're here to take our guns to conquer us to enslave us
[36:31.840 --> 36:39.280]  you're on notice red coat oh my gosh the most evil thing why I was so
[36:39.280 --> 36:44.920]  discredited until his ratings slide accelerated and he lost his job and they
[36:44.920 --> 36:51.840]  accredited that particular interview as the salvo that broke the dam that's how
[36:51.840 --> 36:58.920]  easy it is to overthrow this un-American stinking fraud if we ever just start
[36:58.920 --> 37:05.160]  believing in ourselves and taking action the truth is every time you take
[37:05.160 --> 37:09.040]  action you and you do it long enough and don't stop you end up succeeding when
[37:09.040 --> 37:15.640]  you've got right on your side to quote the founding Texas Ranger a man in the
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.640]  wrong can't stand up against a man who's in the right when he keeps on a
[37:19.640 --> 37:22.000]  coming
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.680]  and isn't that the way it always is in life and almost every case when you've
[37:28.680 --> 37:33.040]  got the moral high ground and you've got courage and you don't back down and you
[37:33.040 --> 37:39.280]  keep on a coming it may seem like you're losing for a while but praise God I say
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.480]  praise God not to be a preacher that's just what I feel like saying that you
[37:44.480 --> 37:51.160]  end up winning and that's what it's all about is winning and trying to create a
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.320]  better world and that's what people like James O'Keefer doing and I want to
[37:56.320 --> 38:00.400]  salute him and I want to salute all of you the activists I want to promote some
[38:00.400 --> 38:04.880]  more of the contest entries maybe on a special page info wars.com
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.120]  four slash contest post them all there from folks going out drawing attention
[38:09.120 --> 38:13.680]  to Obama leaving the borders open flying a bowl of patients in and covering it up
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.800]  before the midterm elections that ended up being a New York Daily News and CBS
[38:18.800 --> 38:26.560]  News and a whole bunch of other publications and went super viral and
[38:26.560 --> 38:32.000]  drew attention to it 7,500 dollar contest you're gonna have three winners
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.800]  will announce them on Wednesday after the election but you all won by taking
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.720]  action getting involved I salute you and then millions of people ended up
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.640]  seeing the videos and ended up becoming national news and it brings heat on them
[38:46.640 --> 38:53.360]  and and they don't like that will our little action our protest idea save the
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.800]  world no but together that idea of resistance and telling the truth and
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.840]  getting active and getting out on the street and getting active in cyberspace
[39:01.840 --> 39:13.520]  that is the spirit of 1776 that will bring down the mindset of 1984 so here's
[39:13.520 --> 39:23.720]  the toll-free number 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 I'm gonna actually get to the
[39:23.720 --> 39:26.520]  quote here in a minute but Mitt Romney came out and said something I really
[39:26.520 --> 39:32.640]  agree with he said we need to have this be a referendum against Obama and
[39:32.640 --> 39:40.320]  repudiate his whole evil agenda and then we need to have election reform of all
[39:40.320 --> 39:47.320]  this election fraud once the Republicans have control of the Senate and the
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.840]  House well that's not gonna happen with people like Mitch McConnell and John
[39:51.840 --> 39:58.120]  Maynard and quite frankly Mitt Romney if you wouldn't have soft-subcut and taken
[39:58.120 --> 40:01.880]  a dive you would have been the president not Barack Obama but the
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.000]  Republicans would have rather had a bigger sweep of the House and Senate and
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.400]  get more campaign contributions running against Obama than they would have get
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.360]  in in there and stopping him there's no telling what Obama may do after this
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.600]  election with two years is a lame duck he's already proven he's acting as a
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.240]  dictator that's not me saying it that's Jonathan Turley a liberal
[40:23.240 --> 40:29.720]  constitutional law professor Obama is acting as a dictator so there's no
[40:29.720 --> 40:38.240]  telling what they're gonna pull while you guys have been playing politics I
[40:38.240 --> 40:43.600]  mean look it's well-known talk radio loses about 30% of its audience when a
[40:43.600 --> 40:50.760]  Republicans in office I could care less about losing audience and losing
[40:50.760 --> 41:00.960]  traffic to info wars calm and prison planet calm if we got a Rand Paul
[41:00.960 --> 41:07.800]  elected or a you know somebody similar I want a future for my children I don't
[41:07.800 --> 41:11.320]  want to sit there and go boy it's a big fire the Democrats have burned in the
[41:11.320 --> 41:16.920]  country down let's roast some hot dogs on it or something this is not a game and
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.840]  it's the lawyers shitting back that that run the Congress politically thinking
[41:22.840 --> 41:25.920]  about what'll drum up more business of more money for them while the whole
[41:25.920 --> 41:30.600]  country goes over the edge of an abyss we can't play these politics anymore the
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.040]  country is too fundamentally screwed up and while you're playing politics with
[41:34.040 --> 41:37.320]  Democrats because you want cheap labor and the rest of it they're flooding the
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.600]  country with third-world labor that will incidentally vote for their agenda and
[41:42.600 --> 41:47.520]  will vote to overthrow American citizens and disenfranchise us and
[41:47.520 --> 41:55.840]  politically make us slaves regardless of our color and this is all being run by
[41:55.840 --> 42:00.080]  big banks in Europe and New York who've already done this in other countries
[42:00.080 --> 42:03.640]  they're not going to be helping the third-world people and you know the sad
[42:03.640 --> 42:10.840]  part about it is I ran out of gas and a guy pulled right over who was from El
[42:10.840 --> 42:15.120]  Salvador really nice drove me to get gas
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.480]  and had run out of gas in years I tried to give him 20 bucks for Ben and
[42:22.480 --> 42:25.840]  Goodsbury said no no no he was just such a nice guy you tell him good nice
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.200]  Christian man you know have a whole cross hanging around the mirror in his
[42:29.200 --> 42:33.720]  car much more non-decorate hard-working that I'm guarantee a most
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.400]  spoiled Americans myself included of course our future is immigrants of
[42:37.400 --> 42:42.760]  course our future is poor people the problem is they get here now and the
[42:42.760 --> 42:46.640]  Democrats are there trying to put them into their cult that's why they want
[42:46.640 --> 42:49.520]  them that's why they say they want them and that's what's so sad about it is
[42:49.520 --> 42:55.440]  that there's no real libertarian patriot outreach to immigrants from Latin
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.080]  America immigrants from Africa immigrants from Asia immigrants from
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.920]  Eastern Europe with such hard-working people there just aren't there and so
[43:04.920 --> 43:15.560]  again the globalist can have all these arguments all day long about why well we
[43:15.560 --> 43:18.880]  need to take guns to make you safer we need to open the borders to be nice or
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.080]  we need to they can always have some arguments that sound good for this but
[43:23.080 --> 43:28.400]  in the final equation it's bad people running it so whatever they're doing you
[43:28.400 --> 43:35.680]  better believe it's not in your interest because it's a wicked mind piloting
[43:35.680 --> 43:47.920]  the system that's why the media has jumped on virgin galactic or as one of
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.080]  our guys put a video this weekend with a typo galactic virgin we're still trying
[43:52.080 --> 44:03.420]  to figure out what that means there's a galaxy of virgins not 47 of them but a
[44:03.420 --> 44:11.040]  whole galactic a billion I'm sorry I'm just trying to figure out a joke out of
[44:11.040 --> 44:18.760]  that I want to go to Judy veteran listen here's nothing after I take these five
[44:18.760 --> 44:22.960]  calls it's gonna be first-time callers in the next hour first-time callers I
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.160]  don't think I've ever even gave the number out the phones are full I give it
[44:27.160 --> 44:35.240]  out one time 800 2599 231 800 2599 231 but here's the point I was trying to get
[44:35.240 --> 44:46.080]  to earlier I never came out and endorsed a
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.200]  subgroup in a party even though I was part of the libertarian movement that
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.400]  just spontaneously called ourselves the Tea Party after 1776 I don't even know
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.520]  who the first person to do it was I just know it came out of the Ron Paul
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.760]  movement's loins and then I saw the Republicans try to take it over seven
[45:05.760 --> 45:09.860]  years ago because the Tea Party was going and bullhorning them and heckling
[45:09.860 --> 45:14.280]  rhinos so suddenly Rick Perry went from one in four shots and maybe he was for
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.400]  some gun control he should be a Democrat to running around with guns on TV saying
[45:18.400 --> 45:23.880]  I love killing coyotes and all the rest of it but that's a bunch of rhetoric at
[45:23.880 --> 45:28.240]  least we made him talk like that so when you see the big Republican donors and
[45:28.240 --> 45:31.680]  the Republican leadership teaming up with the Democrats to go after the Tea
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.040]  Party that's when I'm like whoa that's the good guys not that they're perfect
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.120]  but it's an insurrection through the Republican Party to try to just keep the
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.280]  the bus from me and driven over the edge of the proverbial cliff
[45:45.280 --> 45:52.600]  800 25 992 31 Republicans get what they want a midterm election about Obama the
[45:52.600 --> 45:59.080]  hill but it is about Obama on eve of election Obama's image matches all time
[45:59.080 --> 46:03.280]  low Washington Post to salvage his presidency Obama faces pressure to
[46:03.280 --> 46:10.440]  reboot but will he Cruz aims to take on Obama if GOP one Senate won't vow
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.600]  support for McConnell yeah get rid of McConnell didn't need to be a leader get
[46:14.600 --> 46:19.520]  rid of whoever's the oldest and sells out the most he can go beyond a committee
[46:19.520 --> 46:23.720]  somewhere but we need the people that want to save this country in there
[46:23.720 --> 46:30.800]  none of these lawyers Joe Biden ready to compromise oh I bet you are remember
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.640]  he said nobody wants your gun your rival your shotgun your semi-auto that's a
[46:34.640 --> 46:39.160]  lie we're not coming after your guns Bloomberg said we're not coming after
[46:39.160 --> 46:43.320]  your guns as they do everything they can to get them
[46:45.400 --> 46:52.000]  Romney this is really the last chance for America to pass judgment on the
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.720]  Obama administration and I agree we've been looking for a theme for our election
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.080]  coverage tomorrow night I said last week it's a referendum on collectivism and
[47:01.080 --> 47:10.440]  mafia government judgment day for Obama and that is what it is he's a puppet but
[47:10.440 --> 47:16.200]  he's the figurehead the titular head up there he's the golden calf the big the
[47:16.200 --> 47:22.840]  big idol Obama gets heckled he says this is a rowdy crowd that's just some of the

[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.040]  future but that's not what I wanted to talk about he is such a handsome man
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.880]  Alex I want to suggest a writing campaign you know any race where somebody
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:05.000]  runs unopposed or a race where by the latest poll it's like over 3% one
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.280]  person over another how about people write in something that's you know like
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:15.680]  a a kind of middle finger to the system kind of thing like yeah I write in write
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.920]  in info wars and then I'll show up on the news feeds people say what's that or
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:26.000]  here's something how about we could maybe kind of brainstorm this maybe other
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.720]  people have a better idea but how about vote for and write this in consent to be
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:40.240]  governed rescinded how about that yep that would be you know certainly a
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.840]  message to the government I don't know how much the public knows what that means
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.560]  but that is the Declaration of Independence boiled down great job
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.840]  veteran the last thing we want is for folks to get stamps or markers and
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:57.480]  write info wars calm on the money the private fellow reserve notes that the
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.520]  last thing we want is that please don't do that captain USA you're on the year

[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:10.080]  last hour it's up on info wars calm James O'Keefe a project Veritas went
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:19.720]  around and was able to vote 20 times 20 times in North Carolina alone or or he
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.480]  got up to the point of voting could have voted they gave him the ballot sending
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.640]  man he didn't break the law and do it he was able though to simulate voting 20
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.680]  times and they didn't want to see his ID it's all a big joke they would
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.600]  chastise him you don't show us that ID you can go online get the the voter roles
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.200]  of people that haven't voted in a decade or who were dead and you can vote over
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.600]  and over again so this is how it works the problem is the welfare people are
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.440]  so lazy the Democrats can't get them to go vote that's why last week they got
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.480]  caught in New York understates and Maryland sending out threatening
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.120]  emails and letters saying we will cut you off your welfare if you don't get up
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:04.360]  and go vote and Obama saying now listen I'm not saying me like Chicago you can
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:10.560]  be voting early this week I'm not saying vote repeatedly it's so obvious it's so
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.680]  criminal it's so over the top they want us to live like in South Chicago with no
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.520]  guns and you know 50 people getting shot a week and corrupt police they want us
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:30.600]  to live like in the armpit of Guatemala or Nigeria it's so disgusting so I'm
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.000]  gonna race through your calls now so just callers just make your point don't
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.480]  thank me let's just I never used to know when I was in like a freshman in
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.040]  college why Limbaugh would say ditto ditto ditto but it's because the whole
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.280]  show is taking up with thanking me just please let's just I want to hear what
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.000]  you have to say captain USA in Missouri go ahead I'm really anxious to see how
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.160]  this amendment nine goes through tomorrow you know whenever we voted five
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:04.560]  days before the Ferguson thing erupted the Missouri voters really did a lot of
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:11.680]  good Paul Kurtman he wrote a bill that's going to give electronic privacy
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.000]  just like the Constitution and Bill of Rights said but now it'll be Missouri's
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  ninth amendment so hopefully it passes very interesting what do you think of
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.200]  the amendment they're trying to pass in Illinois that says anyone can vote
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.680]  regardless of citizenship or national country of origin it says you can be a
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:43.040]  foreigner with no ID and vote it's just the a government revolution against the people totally crazy
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.760]  I'm one of those conspiracy theorists that started collecting newspapers today
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.560]  that Ronald Reagan was shot and I think I have Chicago newspapers of when the
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:59.920]  Clintons were handing out citizenship to get votes in that area back in the 90s
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.240]  when Ross Perot was warning us how bad NAFTA was gonna cripple us you know we've
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.080]  got clips of that debate in fall the Republic my second film on Obama and it
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.840]  charts what's going to happen that's why the film is so important four years
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.560]  later because it's all basically come true and you look at Ross Perot in that
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.360]  hour-long debate we only put a few clips of it and he just predicted
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:34.560]  everything now Larry Larry they get paid $30 an hour on average in Canada and as
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.000]  soon as they opened our border up to trade they dropped down to about $15 an
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.760]  hour and we were at 15 now when we drop it in Mexico there about a dollar an
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.720]  hour and so we'll drop on my numbers about seven or eight dollars an hour
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.720]  Larry and then you won't have an economy to buy goods and services it will kill
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.720]  the internal economy now I've made billions of dollars and hired tens of
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.280]  thousands of people I know how to do this Larry this is not rocket science
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.640]  though this will happen this has been done in other countries this is big
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.680]  corporations trying to gut the US for short-term profits and to bring in a
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.840]  lot of centralized control for politicians and companies that have
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.920]  connections and governments because they don't want to just move to Mexico they
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.640]  want to move to China after that it's a giant sucking sound Larry a race to the
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.480]  bottom is what the IMF and World Bank call it Larry and Al Gore just kept
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:31.040]  interrupting him and listen to this old guy over here what does he know and now
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.400]  you see what's happened and then Ross Perot came out and said they have
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.200]  threatened to kill my family and this country's in worse shape than I thought
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:44.160]  so I am bowing out of here
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:50.680]  soon as he hit 33 in the polls that's a three-way race as soon as he hit even
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:59.280]  with the other candidates in a trifecta he said I am bowing out of here and a
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:06.880]  lot was made of was Ross Perot a good guy was he a bad guy I know he was right
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.640]  that's all I know let's go ahead and talk to Wayne in Texas Wayne you're on
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:19.920]  the air hey Alex nice imitation look I went on the site last night about my
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:26.760]  election district and you know that they're saying that they're going to
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:32.840]  enforce the ID law here in Texas so two things that I would encourage people to
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.880]  do is number one I'm going to vote out a lot of these incumbents and number two
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.920]  you get an access code when you go vote and I think this access code may have
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:49.320]  to verify your vote you know in case there is a recount or something you know
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.800]  maybe you can take this claim ticket they give you and verify that your vote
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:15:01.080]  is recorded correctly well you do that also doing your own exit polls going
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.360]  and working you know during the stacking of the bowels to put them in the
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.320]  machines and other systems and then you get to really see what happened I was in
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:13.680]  Travis County in the Republican primaries in 1995 and I was there
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.960]  downtown at the old convention center they tore down stacking the ballots to
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.400]  stick them in the machines and I mean it was 60 percent Pat Buchanan I think
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.400]  Travis County was like six seven percent for Pat Buchanan on the night closed
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.920]  out and I talked to everybody in there like no it's Pat Buchanan hands down
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.560]  Pat Buchanan out of a whole bunch of Republicans just dominated and they
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:40.560]  proved in Arizona he really won in other states so the fix is in but then you add
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.280]  all these illegals to it it only gets crazier good to hear from you oh yeah
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:50.040]  the Justice Department the racer baiters huff and puff and say Texas wise
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.160]  being sued they're racist they want you to show one of eight forms of ID
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.280]  basically anything will do you can show your welfare card you can show your
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:03.640]  anything just to show I'm the person here to vote the Democrats hand out the
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:09.680]  rolls that are online of whose dad or who hadn't voted that's why if you haven't
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:15.960]  voted in a long time you need to get yourself off the roll because people are
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.040]  voting in your name it's identity theft it's identity theft and it's being
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:25.040]  fostered in fact they use online voter rolls for a lot of identity theft out
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.840]  there and have you ever had your identity stolen I've had mine just a little
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.160]  bit I've had it just a little bit about ten years ago and it was done as a
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.120]  dirty trick and let me tell you it's not fun when creditors are calling up
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.240]  you're getting bills and you know you're getting threatened or you try to fly
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:48.640]  and somebody's done something in your name it's not fun and it's happened to
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.960]  most Americans it happened to my dad he was on a no-fly list for a while
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.200]  because of it not because he was my dad this is happening to tens of millions
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.680]  of people to congressmen and women what a fraudulent system and their answer is
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.680]  biometrics I told you that was coming now Obama says biometrics let's talk to
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:15.320]  Catherine in Alabama thanks for calling you're on the air hey I read the poll
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:23.000]  about 78 percent race faders I live in Alabama and it's a huge problem here
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:30.080]  because black and white people basically get along but when you get to the topic
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:36.280]  politics it's just not something that that we can talk about it's meant to
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.000]  make everybody uncomfortable all this political correctness is meant to keep
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.400]  the whole race still going what's an articulate way to bring this up in
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.160]  conversation the the articulate way to bring it up is say we shouldn't be
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:57.200]  prisoners of the past and of a past that's meant to distract us on how we're
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:04.160]  all being screwed over by the globalist and then you need to just not care about
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.800]  it and not always be trying to placate and walk on eggshells around each other
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.400]  everybody just needs to start getting it out in the open and just talking about
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:22.120]  it I mean that's what I do there was a quote on Fox News over the weekend about
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.440]  you know Obama being the most racist president in in history I don't know
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.360]  about totally agree with that statement he's been the biggest it was Ben Stein
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.400]  that said it he's been one of the biggest race bait bait pushers ever but
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.120]  they always talk about the founding fathers some of them having slaves they
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:46.760]  were the first country ever in 1776 to almost get it in the Declaration of
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.440]  Independence and to almost get it years later in the Constitution to end it but
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.960]  it the South threatened basically to split off and there would never have
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.960]  been a union it was Europe that began to end slavery first slavery was going on
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.000]  in this in the caste system in India in the caste system in Japan in Africa the
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.320]  Aztecs had a caste system of slaves they sacrificed you for heaven's sakes and I'm
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.000]  not saying the practice of slavery was okay it's that it was going on
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.120]  everywhere it started in every culture six seven thousand years ago we're not
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:31.840]  sure every culture had it the difference is we had segregation after it and we
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.840]  had populations that stayed separate and so that's the unique American
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:43.520]  experience and what came after it is the shame what came after the slavery
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.080]  because the slavery was going on all over the world America and England in
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:52.120]  England really and the Dutch as well they led the world ending slavery the
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.400]  British one around for hundreds of years attacking ships that had slaves and
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.040]  freeing them okay I mean let's just be clear about that digestive health is

[01:23:53.920 --> 01:24:09.480]  them know be a part of the community at GCN live com by the way England doing
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:16.080]  back about 200 years ago was trying to ban slavery all over the world but
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.160]  really if they took the abolitionist movement started in England and the
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:25.320]  Netherlands and use the Christians wanting to end it as the excuse to just
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.080]  go rob ships and take over countries that still had slavery going especially
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.520]  in the Caribbean so I don't want to over lionize the British the same thing
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.040]  happened Christians wanted to end slavery here in the United States and then
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.360]  that wasn't really one of the big issues that when the Civil War started it was
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.560]  trade deals and tariffs but then they later made that a centerpiece of it
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.320]  towards the end but it was hijacked I mean talk about the British they were
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.400]  still doing press gangs until about 200 years ago when they had so many riots
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:02.000]  across England they would come and conk your son over the head that they like
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.360]  people 14 you know years old or so so they can mold them and then the Navy
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.080]  would just kidnap your child or sometimes your husband they but they
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:17.040]  didn't call it slavery they called it impressment impressment so there's many
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:22.360]  other forms of slavery just like 7 million people in the prison system 3
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:28.840]  million in minimum or medium or maximum security millions more in the halfway
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.400]  house system biggest prison population in the world teaching people how to be
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.520]  criminals letting the violent criminals out keeping the non-violence in that's
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.680]  modern slavery working for 25 cents an hour but there's no movement to try to
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.440]  stop that and calling it what it is and the prison industry lobbying at
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.240]  legislatures to have bigger and bigger sentences and more and more prisons to
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.600]  get our money and every good old boy I've ever known goes prisoners hot tubs
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:03.560]  cable TV smoking cigarettes all day take their air conditioning away make them
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:10.240]  make it painful and make them work that's why you don't have a job can you
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.440]  compete against 15 to 25 cents an hour at those huge factories they don't just
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:20.320]  make furniture and light bulbs and license plates
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.960]  disgusting let's go ahead and take another phone call Raider in Oregon you're

[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.800]  years you get the same thing from from your politicians so when I cuss you
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.520]  know you know think about that you don't think about what they do to you and
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.160]  then think about what we know me cussing you know thinking that that's that's the
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.640]  bad thing the distraction is if somebody that tells the truth but says it in a
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.880]  real manner and they use vulgarity sure sure that goes back to what I always

[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:09.680]  government it'd be like if you were out in Africa at night by yourself walking
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:18.080]  around in a loincloth and 20 hyenas come up or five lions come up and you go
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:22.760]  I have nothing to hide it's like a 16-year-old girl Ted Bundy pulls up in

[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.040]  history books read this on militant enthusiasm and the fact that the most
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:31.640]  aggressive super predators are actually very loving and care about people because
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.480]  it's like a governor built in so you don't savage and attack everyone around
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:39.400]  you I'll tell you right now I'll be honest people I am meaner than hell and I
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.680]  am a predator but the difference is I don't have the psychopath programming
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.400]  where I want to prey on weak people I want to deal with the scum and the
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.840]  bullies that's a normal impulse of males to defend people the problem is is that
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.320]  men that have that are laying down while a bunch of snakes run all over this
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.680]  ladies and gentlemen and it's time for that to end do you understand people
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.000]  think they're safe because they lay down that's all coming to an end we're all
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.440]  in grave danger okay and and see there's no more denial people don't come up to
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.040]  me and make black helicopter jokes anymore in fact that's how I can tell
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:18.080]  the public's really woken up I don't ever really get heckled anymore I never
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.920]  really people come over and knock my glass over a restaurant that used to
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.240]  happen guys don't pull up on their big hogs kind of right wingers to make fun
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:30.080]  of me and left wingers don't you know come up and boomie in restaurants people
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.000]  aren't laughing anymore and let me tell you something you're really not gonna be
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  laughing when all this comes through so see I'm not up here putting on a little
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.280]  NPR act for everybody when I sit there and I talk like the globalist talk and
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.920]  act like the globalist talk because folks I know how they are because I can
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:49.200]  look right into their minds I can I can see what they see think like they think
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.680]  I know their game plans I understand it and just as good as they do that's why
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.680]  they tried to recruit me you understand that ladies and gentlemen so stop
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.160]  acting like a bunch of chumps out there this is a serious emergency warning
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:08.600]  let's go ahead and talk to DC in Arizona thanks for holding hey John this
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.520]  is DC in Arizona just calling to give you some intel on what's going on in
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:19.200]  Arizona I wanted to be pretty brief so I'll get right to the point SCR 1015
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:24.240]  it's a 2013 concurrent resolution that was passed and the House of
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.480]  Representatives in Arizona it's a proclamation supporting the Second
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.920]  Amendment of all the people that voted against this proclamation all of them
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.800]  were Democrats but one key to this proclamation is all the members of the
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.560]  these people agreed to essentially not consider new legislation that would have
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.480]  been fringe on the constitutional right of the Second Amendment yeah that's a
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.680]  litmus test if you're for abortion especially partial birth or you're for
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:41:01.400]  gun control you can just you need to be voted on office absolutely and that's my
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:06.520]  point what's going on Arizona there's the Democrats are starting to take up
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.120]  much of the talking points that the conservatives and the Republicans are
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:16.360]  talking and they're actually taking the words that many of us are familiar with
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.920]  in Arizona is such as independence in Arizona we have one-third independent
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:26.920]  one-third Democrat one-third Republican that Democrats through their
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:33.040]  progressive ideology are taking the words and all the tactics that
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:36.000]  essentially the conservatives and the independents would use and they're
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.040]  running in their campaigns if you watch a Kristen Fennmont a lot of the people
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:43.920]  that are Hillary Clinton led the pack four months ago when she came out and
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.400]  said you know I actually believe in the right to keep and bear arms we shouldn't
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.400]  have more gun laws and you know what I don't think we should have open borders
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:54.680]  we need to deport people pure fabricated baloney and I've actually heard some
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.400]  conservative commentators going I tell you Hillary's getting all but sensible
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:07.480]  up there I mean just the chumpness of it I mean how I mean if I appreciate your
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.560]  call I just cannot look at Hillary Clinton my radio show would explode even
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.240]  faster and have more listeners if Hillary gets elected I don't want her to
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:21.560]  get elected if Jeb Bush gets elected I'll have more listeners because people
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.760]  want me to attack folks well if it's a Rand Paul or Ted Cruz I'm not gonna
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.400]  have anything to attack other than Democrats and you know rhinos and
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.680]  people everybody knows for a libertarian talk show ratings go down it's a cycle
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:39.240]  when Republicans are in well guess what I want the Republicans in but not that
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:42.480]  they're angels but they're a new group of thugs that we can get control of and
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:46.040]  a big realignment will scare them we'll get enough tea party people in there to
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.560]  keep control of it and maybe dial this back a little bit and that's why the
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.280]  establishments betting all their money against tea party candidates because
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:43:00.800]  they are one of the only nonviolent hopes we've got and I've never in 20 years on
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:05.280]  air gotten behind a party that's not really true I was pretty much a
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.400]  Republican the first year or two on air but then I just saw how treacherous and
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:13.480]  look the globalist can run their agenda through any party it's just the
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:19.160]  Democrats are metastasizing crazy cancer they need to be slapped down they need
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:22.760]  to be indicted they have been persecuting people at a level no
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.040]  exaggeration five thousand times Richard Nixon Richard Nixon persecuted a
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:34.080]  couple hundred people the Democrats are persecuting hundreds of thousands of
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.840]  people they're putting troops on secret death list and then defending it when it
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:46.200]  comes out I mean these people are just crazy and America recognizes that you
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.880]  think I wanted to have a shooting or start at the bunny ranch that's the
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.920]  last thing I wanted to do and I tried to dial things down and tried to exert my
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:58.280]  influence to stop that from happening so the media implied that I wanted
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.160]  violence I never wanted that but let me tell you the image of the feds backing
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:05.960]  off from those ranchers when they had their guns on them saying we'll shoot
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.360]  you if you come across that scared the system down to its base level do you
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.640]  think they want a civil war to start with feds in a shooting war with a bunch
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:19.560]  of ranchers no they wanted to start on their way when the globalist blow up a
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:24.840]  federal building full of a bunch of kids in a daycare again and then blame it
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.440]  within one hour on Rush Limbaugh and it's not that Rush Limbaugh is perfect but
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:34.160]  if they can bring down Rush Limbaugh they can bring down Matt Drudge they can
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.800]  bring down Alex Jones they can bring down Joseph Farrah they can bring down
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.640]  James O'Keeffe they can bring your local talk show host town they can bring
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:46.080]  everybody down we spent over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars I think it
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:50.280]  was on Rush Limbaugh show and all his people were deserting and they were
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.360]  trying to bring him down for his statements and so for the first
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:45:01.640]  amendment we tithed and bought ads for the Obama deception on there and we
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:06.000]  made our money back it didn't make a lot of money but it didn't matter we we went
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.480]  and we advertised on Rush Limbaugh like eight thousand dollars a minute
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:16.800]  of course it had gone down about six thousand is the protesting so we took
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.600]  advantage of that and had tried to send a message no one would do that out there
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:28.360]  what's your what's the where's the basic instinct do you understand that the
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:31.360]  federal elections commission is looking at trying to start censoring the
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.560]  drugs report people I've seen some of the other sides go good he's too big
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:42.480]  are you morons they're gonna get you next dummy where is people's basic
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:47.080]  instinct to stick together we've been taught that screwing each other over is
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:51.440]  how we get ahead that's the creed of failures ladies and gentlemen all we've
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.640]  got is our reliability ever the term he's
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:03.400]  disreputable you can't trust him well I tell you that news travels really fast
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.960]  we need to promote liberty and I know that simple but as all this evil starts
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:14.800]  collapsing around us if we're there telling the truth it will bring them
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.320]  down not us and that's why they're in so much trouble is because the liberty
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:26.880]  movement going back 50 years has been hold excuse me holding this back
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:33.160]  slowing it down slowing the globalist takeover down desperately with a bunch
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:37.840]  of complainers going I thought she said it was gonna take over where they're not
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:41.920]  trying to get my guns they're not tracking me or listening to me the GMO is
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.440]  not bad excuse me I have to go to the bathroom for the 10th time this hour that
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:52.480]  doesn't work anymore we stalled them with enough time to get defenses set up
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:55.840]  politically we stalled them while we also built up
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:02.120]  more militarily decompartmentalize it's beyond a cell network system it's just
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.320]  that it's an understanding it's a manifesto of freedom it's it's
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:10.120]  invincible if God be with us who can be against us we have been working the
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:19.280]  liberty movement for 50 plus years hard to believe I didn't hear for 20 but 50
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.760]  years to stop this and and and while we're trying to stop it we've been
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.920]  building our organizations just like arm wrestling makes both people's arms get
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:33.840]  bigger we've been wrestling them they've been wrestling us and we've been
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.720]  getting stronger as they've been getting stronger for every action is equal and
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.640]  opposite reaction so don't ever let them make you think that you don't have
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.000]  power and that you can't affect change I'm gonna play this Leigh Ann McAdoo
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.080]  piece then we're going to go back to your phone calls John Joe Julia Steven and
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:53.880]  others that are patiently holding we're taking first-time callers calls at 800

[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:08.680]  we're gonna cover this after this piece but the two go together Samsung smart TV
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.880]  records personal conversations and sends them to third parties companies new
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:20.120]  privacy policy causes consternation Samsung's new global privacy policy for
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:26.000]  its line of smart TVs states that a user's personal conversations will be
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.680]  recorded by the device's microphone and transmitted to third parties did you
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:35.520]  hear that a 46-page privacy policy which is now included in all newly
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:39.880]  purchased Samsung smart TV states that the voice recognition technology may
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.720]  capture voice commands and associated text in order to improve the features
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:51.320]  of the system uh-huh the policy a summary of which is also posted online

[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:14.040]  use of voice recognition and the article goes on there's video of this folks and
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.640]  you could say oh well they're not going to use it for that they're selling the
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:23.080]  data third party it's all on record Microsoft can see through eight walls it

[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.920]  digital biometric shot of your genitals okay I don't know how else to explain
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:41.680]  this to you but this is all premeditated on purpose and I'm bagging you to
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:46.040]  understand that it's meant to predict the future manipulate human activities
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:53.480]  dominate markets shut down competition and surveil the public into a hole I
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:57.480]  don't have to hide you say great leave your doors unlocked in the middle of
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.160]  Manhattan you go on vacation and post on Facebook where all your valuables are

[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.320]  data is your data and shouldn't be stolen from you if you walked out to your
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:27.440]  post office box and I was standing there the one the federal crime I do it to
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.240]  illustrate it and I'm sitting there reading your mail you would probably
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.080]  walk up say what are you doing buddy and punch me in the nose if I didn't quit
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:39.520]  you'd call the cops and you should like I'm gonna do this I'm gonna go people's
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.440]  doors and go hey you mind if I put some cameras in your house just for your

[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.080]  no wait a minute Samsung's doing it do you have a Samsung television by the way
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:57.160]  something they're all doing it now and I'm gonna give them the article they'll
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:01.600]  probably say get off my porch kook because see first they say this isn't
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.720]  coming and call you a cook so folks don't want to be a cook then when it
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.000]  actually happens they'll accept it because they don't want to be called a
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.320]  cook kind of like a decade ago we had engineers on from California they said
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:15.520]  hey I just retired these smart meters are gonna tax you they're gonna cheat you
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.880]  they're gonna dial into all your other wireless systems that are coming out it's
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.440]  a big DARPA program and I won't folks know about it we had engineers on this
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:26.880]  show and they had articles in the San Francisco Chronicle making fun of me and
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:34.320]  the engineer guess what five years later it started and they do it let's go to
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:43.440]  Leanne McAdoo's report it's up on info wars dot com trendies want cars banned
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:47.400]  well we'll put it up on screen I'll give you the actual headline if we can the
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.520]  actual info wars dot com headline because because I want to put it in the
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.960]  featured featured news area it's up there in the tiles special report
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:01.680]  trendies want to end human driving Leanne McAdoo and I only watched part of
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.240]  the report Friday before Eric's I had to leave but I believe a majority said
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.280]  banned cars immediately with humans driving them see anything that's
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.040]  establishment they want to do it anything that's a bad instinct they want to
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.560]  do it anything destructive they want to do it anything foolish they want to do
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:21.400]  it because they're in a cult of just agreeing to drink the Jim Jones Koolaid
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:27.320]  let's go to this bombshell report Leanne McAdoo reporting for info wars
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:33.280]  dot com I am here in downtown Austin to find out what the lovely trendies of
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.880]  Austin think about the rise of the machines now Elon Musk of Tesla says
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:42.360]  that they're gonna have driverless cars by 2023 we already know the Google car
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:47.480]  has logged over 300,000 miles testing their driverless car out in California
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:53.360]  now the UK is gonna be testing driverless buses so it is coming soon now
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.800]  we all know what this is about it's not about being more efficient and making
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.160]  life easier for everybody so they don't have to think for themselves it is
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:04.360]  literally about making people not have to think for themselves and not have to
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:08.200]  think about why they're being caged up inside these megacities why their cars
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:12.400]  won't drive them down a dirt road and take them down to a beautiful countryside
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.280]  why are they only allowed to stay within city limits we know what's coming we
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:20.160]  just want to find out if everybody else does
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:29.440]  sir pardon me hi there but question for you so how pumped are you that driverless
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:33.800]  cars are coming good because the traffic here in Austin sucks
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:39.240]  oh well that's for real I don't drive okay that car will take you wherever you
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.400]  want to go before we go back to report I just want to point out we have the time
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:48.200]  magazine article but the headline let's end human driving and then it says within
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:54.000]  ten years we will do it this is a plan and notice you can be in the ocean and
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.400]  go a hundred miles not running into a coral reef and see almost no fish or no
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:03.200]  life as soon as you get near a coral reef a city you will see thousands of
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:09.840]  fish sharks dolphins that's what cities are I don't like the traffic I don't like
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:15.520]  the lines at this restaurant I don't like that that's what a teaming place is
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.800]  like I moved here from California and you know it's that trendy I like all the
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.840]  people I like all the dates I can get though you know I like all the stuff and
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.640]  everything and I came here but I want it from me I want less people let's clean
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:36.520]  off the highways like Bill Marce let's kill some people yeah yeah they don't
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:41.160]  see the forest for the trees they're totally ignorant death panels that'll
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:47.360]  save me money for it no won't save you money they've been taught though when
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.080]  somebody loses out I get something that means I'm liberal let's go back to the
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.400]  idiots you wherever you want to go yes for sure driverless cars and buses
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:01.280]  makes me nervous yeah yeah I think it's an awesome idea yeah all about
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:11.760]  conserving energy and technology progression I don't know anything about it I'll research it okay I mean
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:16.000]  people drinking drive and that's someone behind the car so I'm guessing if a
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.960]  computer can operate better than they can oh yeah what do you think about you
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.200]  know not being able to drive yourself wherever you want having that spontaneity
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:32.080]  of taking a left instead of a right well yeah that's that's a point you giving up
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.040]  your freedom is always tough but we're getting so crowded now you have to make
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:43.480]  compromises probably kind of like getting used to reading a newspaper on an iPad
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:50.280]  it's a habit and it'll be a long time for people to trust it now I think there's
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:54.080]  a vision here a new technology and I'm really looking forward to a time when
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.400]  generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.080]  for driving cars I'm not sure I have an opinion on that by the way pilots can't
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:06.640]  even hardly plot points now because he's the creator of Tesla he says we're
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:12.360]  gonna have these driverless cars by 2023 driverless buses are already on their
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:18.120]  way in the UK I don't know my driverless buses I mean those are scary buses
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:26.880]  scare me as it is I drive it every day so what could go wrong yeah a lot can go
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:33.280]  wrong you do have that risk factor involved with it but I feel like as
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:41.880]  long as it's safe and it's approved by what is it the FDA you just wanted to
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.440]  randomly go left and your car is like no sorry you've chosen to go to this
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:51.120]  destination and I've chosen the best path for you well then we have a problem
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:55.280]  because I'm very hard-headed but there's no steering wheel they have a steering
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:59.680]  wheel in the new Tesla's they do now not in the Google car well or if you have
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:04.640]  enough money you can get a car with the steering wheel yeah yeah yeah yeah that's
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:09.920]  true these people are probably easiest to walk from here you barely see a car in
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.200]  the city center nowadays unless you're rich being a person who doesn't drive
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:20.000]  could you see this as being an issue no you think it's great yeah I'm curious
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.760]  what you think as a mom they have the programmers are trying to figure out how
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:30.080]  to set the ethics settings so basically that'll let the computer decide should
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:34.320]  they hit folks they're already hacking cars and killing people that's for this
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:38.880]  is totally insane we're gonna go to break and come back to full videos up on

[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:36.120]  FEMA region 5 what former state are you in Wisconsin all right welcome sir yeah
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:41.040]  I got a couple things two things really actually quick I grew up in Chicago and I
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:47.440]  know about the Democratic machine and there's never been a legal election in
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:50.960]  that talent is part of their turn this century and that's admitted and they want
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:56.600]  to turn the whole country that way yeah well I wonder why people you know like
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:01.720]  I was thinking about getting a t-shirt is it it's got a picture Kool-Aid on it
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:06.320]  with a circle with a slash you know with a cup of tea next to it this is you
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:12.400]  know dump the Kool-Aid switch to tea that'd be a great poster and then they
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.480]  always try to claim that that's some kind of code for racism or something
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:21.760]  Kool-Aid no it means Jim Jones the cult it means don't drink the status cult go
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.880]  to the tea party and I've actually seen those parallels before but not together
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:30.080]  we really should create a meme or something for Facebook you know that
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:35.280]  says dump the Jim Jones Kool-Aid and then have like an image of Obama the
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.440]  Obama sign inside the Kool-Aid and then right next to it you know say switch to
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:48.080]  tea with a tricordered hat that's a great idea I thought so anyhow this this
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.600]  whole thing about Illinois passing that that bill I guess it is to allow
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:57.760]  anybody from any country to vote bogus I mean you know those guys ought to be
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:02.280]  lynched in a normal society you know speaking in normal societies there's
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:09.600]  not a legitimate government worldwide that I and I could think of and we're fast
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:14.400]  becoming the same way well Switzerland isn't perfect but it's got 10 tons that
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:17.840]  are states and the people do vote their elections are some of the best out there
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.600]  everybody can own a gun lowest crime rate highest standard of living highest
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:29.640]  test scores I mean it's it's it's it's pretty darn good but yeah it's as bad
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:34.320]  as the US is there's still a memory of the Bill of Rights and Constitution so
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.120]  we're better than say Mexico or North Korea but they had a big university
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:43.080]  study out this year that I think we were like 33rd for economic freedom and I
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:47.960]  think 42nd for political freedom I forget the exact numbers but that's what
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:52.280]  most universities come out with we are dropping like a rock it's not just me
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:57.720]  saying this we are just burning up politically we are losing such hard one
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:03.360]  freedoms God bless you step on in New York you're on the air worldwide
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:06.600]  hey how's it going it's actually stepping but don't worry I'm not here to
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:10.400]  correct you listen let me try to slide through this because I'm actually I work
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:17.200]  like you listen one reason why I believe a lot of these people people might I'm
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:23.360]  23rd reason why a lot of youngsters aren't gonna believe really even listen to
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:28.720]  what it is that you're saying one in up north we've been we've been brainwashed
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.080]  that just the southern accent we automatically discredit you soon as
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.920]  you open your mouth up southern accent guys no idea what you talk about second
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:39.960]  is because a lot of people they don't believe in God and I'm not that you need
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.680]  to believe in God to see what's going on but if you don't believe in God you'll
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.080]  never get the spiritual side of it so as soon as you start to talk about all of
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.760]  this is you know because this is obviously the work of the devil that
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:53.280]  we're dealing with so as soon as you bring that up if people don't see that
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:57.560]  spiritually I'll never click and I'll never really see how deep it is you know
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.240]  how deep the fox don't really goes because why do you even say it is much
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:04.480]  worse than you say well that's a great point Stefan I mean I can tell you that
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:08.840]  a lot of good old boys might even listen to you more if you have an northern
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.760]  accent just because they find it interesting but there's certainly big
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.280]  it's out there that would just go off what somebody's voice sounds like so the
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:18.560]  content of their character and their deeds is Martin Luther King said but I
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:22.400]  have seen that stereotype a lot especially by kind of the yuppies in the
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:27.080]  north who you'll pop their collars and think they know everything and our own
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:31.240]  steroids when they're 13 years old kind of like the whole you know Jersey shore
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:36.000]  scene that they think we ride horses to school they don't know that like a third
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.960]  of the inventions in the country came out of Texas alone and I guess they just
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:45.080]  think that we you know don't know how to how to tie our shoelaces but that's an
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:49.480]  interesting point anything else you want to add stay there I'm gonna come back to
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:54.200]  you got to go to break then Julia Fred Joe patting and others and I'm gonna hit

[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:18.920]  hey wait a minute there's one guy holding up both puppets shut up go back to bed
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:25.440]  America your government is in control defending the Republic from enemies

[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:43.280]  you think Obama's gonna try to do once he's a lame duck and has the power to
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:48.200]  pardon himself and others a get out of jail free card well he's told us total
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:53.440]  amnesty total open borders Illinois style they have a ballot initiative that's
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:59.560]  already passed unanimously out of their Senate the house passes well to allow
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.000]  anyone from any foreign country instant voting rights just total treason that's
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.480]  an example of what they want to do nationwide James O. Keith and others have
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.240]  caught the Democrats nationwide handing out ballots to anybody that wants them
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.840]  he voted or was able to get ballots he didn't complete the voting because that
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:23.280]  would be criminal fraud 20 times in one day that video is up on info wars.com
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:27.560]  and prisonplanet.com but I want to go to your calls now Stefan finish your
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:32.120]  point from New York basically one reason why these cars are definitely gonna
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.640]  fly it's because the whole car thing is because a lot of us young guys we never
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:39.960]  really grew up with a serious car culture we don't know it's like to start
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.640]  up a GTO and just you know hear that rumble and know that they made cars
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.640]  too expensive and the regulations too expensive for the average person to have
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.280]  a car and the freedom that comes with it and for those that don't know they are
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:57.680]  announcing worldwide driverless little tin can cars and then they'll raise the
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:01.520]  taxes and the insurance where you've got to get one basically that is the
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.600]  actuary plan for the coffin houses that are 200 square feet for everything it's
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:09.640]  not that they're innovating to help the environment they're innovating for
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:15.880]  artificial scarcity to enslave exactly exactly and one last thing is as a
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.800]  New Yorker I do bless you Texans because by all means you guys you you guys are
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:22.920]  really the force that's gonna not be you guys are the force to stop this but they
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:26.440]  know that they have to take you text them out because you guys are really the
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:30.680]  toughest at all 50 states I mean by all means well I don't know about the toughest
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:34.240]  overall but politically and the history and the second amendment there are other
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.320]  states that are smaller that have even more freedom and more interesting
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:40.960]  histories than Texas is the Texas is the second most populous state and is
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:43.880]  probably gonna become the most populist but I appreciate what you say my
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.760]  friend pointed that you guys are a problem to them and God bless you guys
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:50.360]  hopefully you guys bring the heat well God bless you brother we're all
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:54.360]  Americans all human beings we're all on the same team I'll tell you I found some
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:11:00.120]  of the most awake people out there in New York in New Jersey in Illinois
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:02.560]  because they've been living under tyranny and they're some of the most
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:07.240]  awake people out there and running into all those blue-collar police and fire
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:11.520]  fighters and construction workers they're either totally awake and super cool
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.440]  people or they're completely dumb and completely sold out what I found in the
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:22.360]  north that's an overall simplification is that you're either awake or you don't
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:28.280]  know what's going on and you get down in Texas it's it's more of a mix and it's
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.920]  very frustrating and let me tell you we could lionize Texans in like World War
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:37.640]  2 we're known to be like the fist of the army but you look at Texans now they're
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:42.040]  in trailers watching cable TV or satellite television getting diabetes I
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:46.040]  don't care what color they are and to see the degeneration of Texas and the
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:51.920]  degeneration of Texans and the colonization of Texas if Californians
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.160]  were all bunch of pro-gun people I'd love them in fact a lot of Californians
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:12:01.120]  that come here in the first few waves in my life are the best people ever they're
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:04.960]  folks like Darren McBreen who's from Arizona Arizona's be more conservative
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:09.640]  libertarian than Texas well you take California he used to be like Texas 80
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:13.400]  years ago it was mainly people from Texas and Oklahoma that have gone out
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:17.720]  there not anymore ladies and gentlemen I mean these Californians will walk up to
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:21.280]  you in a whole foods and say you shouldn't have three kids or you're
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:26.080]  getting too much meat I can't go to Whole Foods because I'll be going through
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:31.160]  my kids and they'll walk over and say wise choices and the third time it
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:36.320]  happens you're being socially impact and like a cult that's the thing about the
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.400]  Democrats and political correctness it is a social engineering cult where the
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:44.200]  whole country the whole world is a giant reeducation camp that's what I'm
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:51.600]  trying to get at here it's all nudging us and pecking at us and in their own
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:56.680]  words telling us you know how to live our lives so they could build their
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:01.200]  utopia and a lot of the people doing it mean well they really think they're
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:05.880]  building something good they don't know how it all like an erector set or Legos
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:10.400]  decompartmentalizes and hooks together and that's not my words the big new
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:22.440]  Brzezinski Carol Quigley Henry Kissinger John P. Holdren Helmut Schmidt I mean
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:28.320]  I've read their books where they lay it all out and talk about how stupid we
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.960]  are and you sit here and you read this stuff it makes you angry it's not my
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:41.240]  opinion I'm gonna stop ranting I said I take calls Julia in Texas here on the
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:48.360]  air Alex I want everybody to vote too but what I'm more concerned with is
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:52.640]  them voting with their money don't support sports figures that are liberal
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:58.120]  communists don't support restaurants to spend your money where you were with the
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:05.000]  people you support and my second point is who at the Department of Defense is
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.640]  saying we have to do this or who at the CDC say we have to do that your phones
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.280]  overdrive it back off your phone just a little bit thank you yeah I want to know
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.960]  who these people are because if the state is anonymous the owners have no
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:25.160]  recourse we can't get to them no I agree I agree well well see here's the
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:29.720]  paradox the most awake people are at the Pentagon because they're
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.880]  decompartmentalized to a certain extent and no we're telling the truth so I mean
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.680]  I would say at the Pentagon like 95% of people there really are dedicated
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:44.720]  believe what they were doing we're compartmentalized and it's that very
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:48.960]  small percentage at the top that in most cases aren't even fellow travelers as
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:56.440]  well they just are company men and do what they're told so the Pentagon is it
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.480]  is like the center of the manipulation because it's the most professional thing
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:06.120]  and the collapsed government but it's also where the people are awake and so
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:10.320]  I mean you want to name who they are I mean General Dempsey the chairman of the
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.840]  joint chiefs carries out a very evil globalist agenda but then to cover his
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.480]  butt I guess complains about it publicly like funding Al Qaeda and stuff like
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.920]  that but I mean I talked to high-level officers and they say nobody likes it
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.480]  like nobody they like playing golf and living in big houses and you know having
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.680]  a girlfriend on the side or whatever but they don't like who wants to really
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:40.600]  bankrupt America and break up families and screw things over only a very small
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.640]  percentage of social engineers on top that want to just kill our normal
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:49.120]  instincts so they can roll out the technological technotronic era as
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:54.240]  Brzezinski called it the 70s so it's the human haters that are maybe one tenth
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:59.240]  of one percent or less than that the problem is they've been put in by the
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:03.040]  Queen of England and David Rockefeller and Lord Rothschild in almost every
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.800]  power position and so I mean we're talking about 6,000 people according to
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.520]  Henry Kissinger's group they did an analysis Rothkopf wrote about it in the
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:19.280]  book super class and there's about 6,000 world gophers and rulers and you
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.880]  don't get in the club unless you want a total takeover I bless you good to hear
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:30.120]  from you Joe in FEMA region 5 formerly Michigan go ahead yes Alex how you doing
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:35.200]  there buddy a longtime listener first time caller thanks for calling I am
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:42.880]  calling about I have a cereal box from 1994 and it's actually I don't know if I
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:46.840]  should say it over the air or not but I probably won't go ahead go ahead I don't
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:53.440]  care say that anything it's a kicks cereal box and it says explore America's
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:59.760]  regions and it says explore this great land of ours and it has all our regions
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:09.240]  of the United States in 10 separated you know regions so there are 10 regions
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:15.320]  here on this box no I absolutely did you know there was a 1937 New York Times
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:19.960]  that was the front page I have a copy of it somewhere around here I can't find
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:25.240]  if somebody's got it sent it to us again and it shows that the 10 regions and
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:29.960]  they're the exact same regions and then it shows the global 10 regions now
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:35.960]  understand this is a good eight years before the UN gets founded this is a
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:45.000]  good well the FEMA regions got set up in 1979 so see the rollout see the
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.320]  conditioning children's cartoons say you won't have cars in the future or if you
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:54.920]  do robots will run them they're already preparing everyone that's that's my
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.480]  whole point at me I mean you've got a little kid getting ready to go to school
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.560]  and here he's reading the back of the cereal box and says America's regions
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:08.920]  here and it says Mid-Atlantic it shows up with New York Pennsylvania and all
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:14.600]  these other states up there the Statue of Liberty Oysters Crab and the United
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:20.000]  Nations and it has the symbol of it it's just it's on freaking believable I
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.680]  mean I totally precursor they planned I learned about it 15 16 years ago but
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:30.960]  they planned 30 years ago in public documents the tracker boxes the cell
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:36.840]  towers taxing by the mile driverless cars Google search engines the the
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:42.160]  Internet of Things I mean how do you fight something so diabolical I don't
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.160]  know but I believe that you know the reason why we up in the Midwest here
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:50.480]  have a lot of thyroid problems because they put the chlorates in the water
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:55.680]  because that's main ingredient in rocket fuel that's right and that's the
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:00.680]  opposite that's the opposite of the good halogen which is iodine and they
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:06.360]  ordered in 1922 that it be put in salt iodine to stop the incredible problems
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.280]  in the Midwest because the water and food doesn't have a lot of in the soil
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:15.720]  iodine and it basically boosted IQs 15 points within five years this is
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:21.120]  mainstream news folks look it up you can just Google iodine boost IQ in Midwest
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:26.080]  and then the feds ordered it taken out of the salt a few decades ago why do you
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:31.480]  think that happened that's just that is just because they just want to control
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:40.280]  us you know I mean it's a simple mind control and and I believe that we're
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:43.440]  in trouble look they don't want you aggressive they don't want your mind on
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.000]  fire they don't want you to have energy that's why they don't want you to have
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.920]  iodine I mean it's a that simple it's unbelievable how simple it is all right
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:58.560]  thank you Joe take a photo of that box a digital photo and email it to show tips

[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:50.960]  I haven't aired Joe Biggs's piece from last week yet where he went out and got
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.000]  a whole bunch of UT students to sign a petition that said kill children up to
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:00.880]  age five and that's for the earth they go it's for Obamac for the earth we're
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:05.360]  gonna have post birth abortion well that's a woman's right isn't it we're
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:10.440]  gonna play that let's go to Fred and FEMA region 10 so are you in the former
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:15.440]  state of Oregon or the former state of Washington state. Washington state.
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:20.680]  All right so you're up there with old Bill Gates running the show. Oh I got a
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:26.360]  love Bill Gates I mean Monsanto the whole nine. Well you know
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:29.560]  reading for the calls that you're wondering what's gonna happen after these
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.320]  elections. Yeah a caller actually called in on what I said I wanted to hear from
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:38.960]  you on give this man a silver dollar of a blue ribbon or a gold star or
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:43.280]  something yes can you imagine what Obama's gonna do if the Republicans
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:47.400]  don't start impeachment whenever they get out of office whenever the
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:50.880]  Democrats get kicked out of the Senate can you imagine what Obama's gonna do
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:55.360]  when he's a lame duck. Well first thing he's gonna do he's gonna try
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.480]  inoculating us with a bowl of vaccination. I mean you had Steve play along
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:02.760]  last week. But if you don't take it why are you being racist right now you better
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:07.120]  do what he says you're racist. Because I like Bill Gates and Bill Gates is racist
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:13.680]  you know and I might as well be one too. He's a real racist. You interviewed
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:20.640]  Aaron Russo you know his soul a couple years ago and it was what
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:24.600]  reflections and warnings and one of the things he warned us about is microchip
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:30.280]  tracking. Yeah first they first they make you go to passwords then you go to
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.280]  biometrics then that gets released to the public and stolen but on purpose
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:39.560]  they that gets compromised and then next is an implantable system that's the
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:42.400]  official plan and the White House announced last week they want to ban
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:47.040]  passwords and make you take biometrics to buy and sell. So it's here and then
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:50.120]  they'll track everything they'll shut down all the farmers markets everything
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.600]  else and then shut down the economy that's what it's all about. Well you know
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:57.760]  what the solar bull thing going around we had Steve Quail on last week it
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:01.920]  really made me think that maybe they're gonna use microchip tracking devices so
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.440]  they know exactly where we are and who we come in contact with to become in
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.400]  contact with an infected person. Well you know we all already have a chip that's
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:13.720]  grown on to our body it's called an iPhone or an Adroid and most the public
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:17.640]  has one and this tracks everywhere you go and everything you do and all your
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:21.600]  hopes and dreams you put into it more than your wife or your husband. So we
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:27.560]  already have an implantable microchip. Yeah it's really unfortunate I don't care
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.760]  one of those around with me but you know about 99% of the population do. Well I mean
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:35.600]  I'm not being a hypocrite either I explained that I use it for limited
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:39.280]  reasons because it's such a powerful Trojan Horse weapon I could shoot video
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:44.640]  upload it tweet you name it but I put it in a blocket system when I'm traveling
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.440]  and I know it's being surveilled and I put it in a drawer and turn it off
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:56.320]  because it is a spy in my house just like the smart TVs all of them are. Well
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:01.560]  it would make it a lot easier to prevent you know voter fraud if we all
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:06.200]  have microchips on us. Well see exactly the illegals I mean I remember Lamar
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:10.120]  Smith wanting people to biometrically scan to get driver's license in Texas
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:15.600]  to go under federal ID program that's what it is a national ID card and I was
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:19.840]  like but the illegals are exempt from it everywhere so what's the point they
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.080]  always sell it oh yeah let's biometrically for our license that'll
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:26.840]  stop all the illegals the banks and the police all accept the console of
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:30.760]  matricula that you can get out of a crackerjack box you can go to the
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:36.000]  matricula place and just get as many as you want and it's disgusting great
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.560]  point sir appreciate your call Patty in Texas you're on the air FEMA region 6
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:47.080]  go ahead. Oh no no no region 6 the great state of Texas sir the great state of
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:52.840]  Texas I've got a couple of points Alex one on the driverless cars and one on
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:58.960]  the next president. Go ahead. About 28 years ago I was dealing with some people
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:04.520]  and I don't know if you had any information on this but the driverless
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:08.920]  car research was done in the large part right here in Austin Texas. Yes I was
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:12.320]  and that's why they're rolling it out here and they're rolling out the tax
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:17.720]  you by the mile boxes start here we are a UN model city officially. Dr. Frank
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.280]  McCullough over the University of Texas at the Center of Transportation
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.720]  Research. I want to hear this. Start over Patty this is interesting. Oh yeah
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:32.320]  I've been led into the DARPA areas of the psychology department and they're
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:37.160]  not doing psychology over there it's weaponization. About 13 years ago it
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:40.280]  was how they were gonna have retina scanners hidden that track your eye and
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:43.760]  what you're reading at Target and Walmart they've now been in about three
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:49.360]  years and they have the robot Obamacare kiosk now rolling out as well.

[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:10.360]  where it makes its own decisions based on sound logic.
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:16.360]  People want the godlike power of driving 100 miles per hour,

[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:46.360]  and walk around and accept everything.
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:53.360]  Now, it's a minority of people saying this, but yes, if the technology gets really safe
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:58.360]  and you want to be able to switch to driverless autopilot and do that, that's fine.
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:02.360]  But people are already using GPS and driving off cliffs and driving into rivers
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:04.360]  by the hundreds of years dying.
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:09.360]  The issue is the globalists that run the system admit they're setting it up
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:13.360]  to disempower humans ahead of the population.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:17.360]  This is a scientific military rollout on record.
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:20.360]  Do you get that through your head?
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:23.360]  And your response and your answer is yes, there are too many of us.
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:28.360]  Like you're pretending you're part of the elite because you've adopted whatever they want you to do.
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:34.360]  They see you as idiot, schmuck, moron, sucker, idiots.
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:39.360]  They see you as just total fools. You think you're part of it.
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:41.360]  It's like the devil's knocking on your door.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:43.360]  You're like, oh, hi, devil. I'm your friend.
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.360]  I'll open the door and the devil sticks a pitchfork in you.
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:49.360]  Why'd you do that?
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:52.360]  I like you. You people are pathetic.
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:56.360]  You're helpless and you're all going to UT or other universities
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  and 92% of you are never going to get a job that'll pay it off.
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.360]  There is no future for you.
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:06.360]  A world's being designed without humans.
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:09.360]  I'm going to say this again, jackasses, and I'm sorry to use that term,
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:12.360]  but it's the only parlance that fits.
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:17.360]  A world is being designed without you on record
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:21.360]  and you're ushering it in, begging for it and going,
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:26.360]  my gosh, if we'd just gone rid of old people, there'd be more positions for us.
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:30.360]  And we're going to send Joe Biggs back out with a petition to
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:38.360]  have folks above 55 be forced out of the workforce so they can get a job.
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:43.360]  And I am predicting that half of them will sign it
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.360]  to force 55-year-olds to lose their jobs.
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:51.360]  You can even throw in, give their pensions to them.
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:55.360]  They'll sign it because they are totalitarians
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:58.360]  and they're so jellyfish they don't even know it
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:02.360]  because they wouldn't they talk like this and walk around going,
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:04.360]  I'm so cool.
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:08.360]  So as long as you walk around going,
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:10.360]  everything's okay.
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:12.360]  You don't have to be intellectual.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:15.360]  You don't have to be smart, historically informed, tough,
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:20.360]  inventive, aggressive, dynamic, everything that makes humans cool.
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:25.360]  No, you've just got to sit around going,
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:28.360]  I mean, I could do that. I could walk around and go,
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:30.360]  I'm so smart.
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:32.360]  It's pathetic.
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  You people are a joke.
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:35.360]  You're chumps.
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:37.360]  You buy into everything.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:39.360]  Sorry, Patty in Texas.
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:43.360]  Tell folks about UT and the driverless cars.
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:46.360]  And then they take all the data that public research pays for
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:51.360]  and they give it to Google, the NSA, NASA front, and they roll it out.
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:52.360]  Go ahead.
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:54.360]  Yeah, true.
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.360]  The research, the major part of that research for driverless cars
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:01.360]  was done here in Austin, Texas at the University of Texas
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.360]  Center of Transportation Research,
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:08.360]  and it was done under the head of the center,
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:11.360]  an engineer by the name of Dr. Frank McCullough.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:15.360]  And the interesting thing about Dr. McCullough
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:19.360]  that you may already know is he's has connections to the Saudis.
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:24.360]  If I remember correctly, he is the engineer who designed and built
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:29.360]  the largest airport at the time anyway in Saudi Arabia.
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:33.360]  And the McCullough family still has connections to them.
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.360]  There's been a lot of research going on about that.
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:39.360]  And I was aware of the fact that UT did some of the first studies on it
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:41.360]  over 30 years ago.
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:44.360]  What I'm getting at is that I wouldn't be against,
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:46.360]  I'm not against vaccines.
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:48.360]  I know they're a real technology.
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:51.360]  But the globalists don't want us to get clean real vaccines.
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.360]  They don't want to tell us the pitfalls of clean vaccines.
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:58.360]  They have an agenda on record to hurt us.
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:38:59.360]  That's why I'm against it.
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.360]  I'm not against driverless cars if they get really safe in the future,
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:07.360]  except there's an agenda to force us out of our cars
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.360]  and to give us less for more.
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:13.360]  While the globalists drive around in giant armored vehicles,
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:16.360]  this is social engineering and it's dangerous.
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.360]  And we need to vote with our dollars while we still can
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:20.360]  to not go along with this.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:21.360]  Thank you so much, Patty.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.360]  Speaking of that, let's get to this report with Joe Beggs,
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:32.360]  where Austin Trendy's signed a petition to kill children after birth
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:35.360]  up to age five and it says it in the petition
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.360]  and the people read it and then sign it.
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:41.360]  And one woman gets upset and comes over and he explains,
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.360]  no, we're doing this to illustrate that there are real trends
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  being promoted by pediatric journals to kill children
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:51.360]  up to age three or even five and they say,
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:54.360]  well, the state will decide if their life has value.
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:56.360]  So when you hear this death with dignity business,
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.360]  if you're dying of a deadly brain tumor that's super painful
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:02.360]  or bone cancer and you want morphine to a level
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:05.360]  that'll kill you, make you go to sleep,
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:08.360]  then you could have some laws where the doctors give you
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:10.360]  whatever's needed for the pain.
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:13.360]  The problem is they take something that sounds reasonable
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:16.360]  and the state comes in and now in the Netherlands
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:19.360]  and other places they're killing folks that are viable.
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:20.360]  They're now starting to do this here.
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:21.360]  This is the plan.
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:22.360]  This is death panels.
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:25.360]  This is deciding, oh, you're a 50-year-old veteran.
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:26.360]  You got kidney failure.
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:28.360]  We're not going to take care of your kidney transplant.
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:29.360]  Just go die.
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  We're going to put you on a secret death list.
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:32.360]  That's what this is about.
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:34.360]  And Bill Gates, everybody's going around
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:37.360]  and giving these speeches about death panels
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:41.360]  where they say, we can hire tentators.
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:46.360]  We can hire tentators by not giving care to a patient.
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:48.360]  And so they introduce the idea that someone dies,
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:50.360]  you get something.
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  As if Bill Gates doesn't want to wipe out all you trendies.
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:57.360]  They hate you.
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:40:59.360]  I happen to know they respect me.
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:03.360]  I happen to know that the globalists respect people that fight them.
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:04.360]  And I don't want their respect.
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:05.360]  I could care less.
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:06.360]  These people are out of their minds.
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  But I mean, I call it chomping.
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:11.360]  And you guys like to be punked.
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  You like to be chomped.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:16.360]  I don't mean our listeners, but the people in this video.
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:18.360]  It is a religion.
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.360]  I'm just, well, I'm foreign of the FDA.
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:25.360]  So, so, ooh.
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:27.360]  Oh, they're so dangerous.
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:33.360]  And their ignorance and their weakness is so powerful.
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:34.360]  They have no life force.
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:35.360]  They have no will.
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:37.360]  They have no destiny.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:41.360]  They just, they have just come here and they're hordes of weakness.
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:45.360]  And they collapse one state and then like a horde of locusts,
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:50.360]  they fly to the next and land and then just start walking around
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.360]  bumbling in arrested development at about the sixth grade level.
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:56.360]  Talking about how smart they are all day.
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:57.360]  I want to throw up.
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:00.360]  Let's go ahead and go to this staff sergeant,
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:03.360]  former staff sergeant Joe Biggs goes out and talks to the new enemy,
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:05.360]  the invincibly ignorant.
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:06.360]  And I want to be clear.
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:08.360]  He thinks and says, you know, a lot of them are really evil.
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:09.360]  I agree.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:10.360]  Some of them have evil mindsets,
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:11.360]  but probably don't even know they're evil.
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:13.360]  More importantly, what's evil is their ignorance
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:18.360]  that they think submission to the system, compliance to the system,
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:22.360]  is the way to go when the system is so bankrupt and evil
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:25.360]  and so complex and they can't even grasp it.
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:28.360]  Because it wasn't on Family Guy or Adult Swim
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:31.360]  or it wasn't in the little cutesy shop.
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:33.360]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:36.360]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:38.360]  here at the University of Texas in Austin.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:43.360]  Now, there's a trend going around college campuses nationwide.
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:46.360]  It's all the new rave, post birth abortions.
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.360]  A lot of you probably never heard of that term.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:50.360]  I know I hadn't until yesterday.
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:53.360]  Well, post birth abortion is after the baby is born
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:57.360]  and up until five years old when it's able to make decisions
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:00.360]  or is self aware, you can still kill the baby.
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:02.360]  Now, I know that seems shocking.
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:04.360]  Why not? It's just a fetish.
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:07.360]  But there's a lot of college kids around the country
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:10.360]  who agree with killing babies up into the age of four or five.
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:12.360]  So I came out here today to find out
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:15.360]  whether or not UT agrees with post birth abortion.
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:17.360]  Let's go see what happens.
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:20.360]  A lot of people, they have botched abortions.
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:22.360]  You know what that is?
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:24.360]  And what this is, is a post birth abortion act.
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.360]  That racial, man.
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:28.360]  If you want to sign it or not.
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:33.360]  But you can take a look over it and...
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:35.360]  I don't like that person's evil.
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:38.360]  Just totally compliant.
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:46.360]  No, I can't support stuff like that.
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:48.360]  Why can't you support stuff like that?
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:50.360]  Because that sounds awful.
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.360]  Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:52.360]  Yeah.
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:54.360]  Well, thank you for being that way.
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:55.360]  One and extremist.
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:57.360]  Hopefully more people agree that.
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:59.360]  The more the merrier.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:01.360]  We have to say thank you for not wanting to kill five-year-olds.
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:03.360]  Or we can help empower women.
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:04.360]  That's not a hero thing.
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:05.360]  Hey there, how's it going?
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:06.360]  Hi.
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:08.360]  You want to help empower women?
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:09.360]  I'll just sign it.
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:10.360]  You'll just sign it?
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:11.360]  Okay.
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:12.360]  Well, it's all about empowering women.
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:13.360]  Drink some glyphosate.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:14.360]  It'll empower you.
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:17.360]  I'm just finding a paper.
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:18.360]  Nice shoes.
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:19.360]  It seems like you're hot in there.
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:20.360]  No.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:21.360]  They're cool.
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:22.360]  They're cool.
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:23.360]  Well, at least I'm alive.
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:24.360]  I made it.
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:25.360]  Yes.
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:28.360]  Unlike these babies who are going to die.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:29.360]  For this.
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:30.360]  But in what context?
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:31.360]  Can I do this?
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:33.360]  Post-birth abortion.
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:36.360]  Women who have botched abortions, sometimes they fail.
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:41.360]  And it's to give them the ability to go in ahead and go through with it after the baby's
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:43.360]  been born.
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:46.360]  Oh.
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:54.360]  So first of all, I can't even, I don't even have a comment on this.
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:59.360]  Hey, so nobody's made that decision.
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:00.360]  Thank you.
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:01.360]  Because guess what?
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:04.360]  You have three students that go to the school that think that's a good idea.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.360]  Guess what?
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:06.360]  They promote this.
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:08.360]  This is promoted on campuses.
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:10.360]  It's to give women the right to have abortions.
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:12.360]  This is what they teach in medical school.
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:14.360]  Yeah, they're just post-birth abortions.
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:15.360]  The board will decide.
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  So basically a lot of abortions get botched.
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:19.360]  They don't work.
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:20.360]  Yeah.
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:26.360]  So the baby gets born anyway, so it gives the mother the opportunity to continue on with
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:27.360]  it.
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:29.360]  It says up to age five in the end.
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:30.360]  What is it?
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.360]  It's to help give women the right to make the decision to have a post-birth abortion
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:36.360]  if they want.
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:38.360]  Oh, it's birth.
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:39.360]  Yeah.
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:43.360]  That means if there's a botched abortion attempt and it's still born, they can still do it
[02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:44.360]  right away.
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:45.360]  Okay.
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:47.360]  All right.
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:50.360]  It's just a post-birth abortion.
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:51.360]  What does that mean?
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:54.360]  What does that mean is if there's a botched abortion and the baby's still born, they can
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:57.360]  just do it right then, terminate immediately.
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:46:00.360]  They're not doing it right.
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:02.360]  Imagine if they start taking folks to FEMA camps.
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:03.360]  They're working on what you're not.
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:05.360]  Don't sign that petition.
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.360]  Ask them what you're signing.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:08.360]  I already know what I'm signing.
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:09.360]  Thank you.
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:12.360]  Go out there with a petition to put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:13.360]  I'm telling you, they'll sign it.
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:15.360]  They're making sure that you're not an evil person.
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:17.360]  Look, you have a lot of students here.
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:18.360]  That's freaking ridiculous.
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:19.360]  Yeah.
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:20.360]  It is, isn't it?
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.360]  Who would sign that without...
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:23.360]  No.
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:24.360]  Guess what?
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:29.360]  There's people who read this that says they're allowing kids up to five years old to be killed.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:30.360]  What?
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:31.360]  No.
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:32.360]  Look.
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:33.360]  This came out in a college fix.
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:34.360]  Please tell me that you do not agree with this.
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:35.360]  Of course not.
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:36.360]  I have a huge issue with this.
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:37.360]  No.
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:38.360]  That's why we're out here.
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.360]  Care about babies and five-year-olds.
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:40.360]  People are signing.
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.360]  These people are horrible.
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:42.360]  This is shit.
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:43.360]  She's freaking out.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:44.360]  Yeah.
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:45.360]  People all over the world...
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:46.360]  The university is promoting this.
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:47.360]  How dare her.
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:48.360]  No, it's not.
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:49.360]  You should feel that way.
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.360]  You know what breaks my heart every time someone signs this thing.
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:52.360]  What a bad person.
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:53.360]  Oh, man.
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:54.360]  Okay.
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:55.360]  So thank you for being a good human being.
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:56.360]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:57.360]  Thank you for not wanting to kill five-year-olds.
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:46:58.360]  What's your name?
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:46:59.360]  Mila.
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:00.360]  Mila.
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:01.360]  Nice to meet you, Mila.
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:02.360]  Do you support abortion?
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:03.360]  Yeah.
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:04.360]  Okay.
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:07.360]  Well, this gives women the right to have post-birth abortions.
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:09.360]  And you can look it over if you want or just sign away.
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:10.360]  What's up to you?
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:12.360]  So what are you going to school for?
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.360]  Nursing.
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:14.360]  Oh.
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:15.360]  Okay.
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:17.360]  Nursing means taking care of people.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:19.360]  What are you going for?
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.360]  What?
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:21.360]  Look at you.
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:22.360]  Oh, she's government.
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:23.360]  What's your aspiration?
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:24.360]  What's your aspiration?
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:25.360]  All right.
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:26.360]  Ooh.
[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:27.360]  Yeah.
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:28.360]  You're going to be honest.
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  She says I want to be a politician, not a public servant.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:34.360]  Well, that's what we need.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:35.360]  Thanks.
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:40.360]  She's going to be a politician.
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:43.360]  You killed children at age five.
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:44.360]  That's great.
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:45.360]  All right.
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:46.360]  I've got to write this down.
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:47.360]  Future politician.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:48.360]  I'm just reading it.
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:49.360]  Yeah, cool.
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:50.360]  Check it out.
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.360]  Okay.
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:52.360]  That's really weird.
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:53.360]  What?
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:57.360]  The person that signed before me has the same last name as me.
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:58.360]  Yeah.
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:47:59.360]  How do you say it?
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:00.360]  Bainter?
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:01.360]  Yeah.
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:02.360]  She's going to be a politician.
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:03.360]  You're going to be a musician.
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:04.360]  Yeah.
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:05.360]  You got it?
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:06.360]  You got it?
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:07.360]  You got it?
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:08.360]  Yeah.
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.360]  Seconds, come on.
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:13.360]  Just sign my petition to give women the right to have abortions if they want to.
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:14.360]  Go on.
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:15.360]  Hey.
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:16.360]  It's post-birth.
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:17.360]  Oh, boy.
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:27.360]  So that's Joe Biggs from Iraq and Afghanistan to UT, and I'm telling you just the mindless
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:29.000]  bots fluttering around.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.760]  No wonder the globalists prey on people.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:37.360]  We're going to go to a break and come back to Michael and then to Dan Mark.
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:42.360]  We've got preacher who's watching us on Roku right now, Tony and others.
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:43.360]  That's all coming up.
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.360]  There's so much news to get to.
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:47.360]  I haven't hit as well.
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:49.360]  Look at this headline.
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:57.360]  It will take 6.25 billion years, man years, to pay off federally mandated government liabilities,
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:58.360]  a mathematical impossibility.
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.360]  I want to try to get to that.
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:02.360]  That's just some of the news that we have here.
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:03.360]  We haven't gotten to yet.
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:16.360]  But before I go any further here today, please do not forget that I keep forgetting to take
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:17.360]  my daily regimen.
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:22.360]  So I just do it right here on air for TV viewers who are about to see this.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:24.360]  Radio listeners, go to infowarslife.com.
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:27.360]  Always forgetting to grab it from the counter over there.
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  I'm going to put a squirt of my super male vitality in there and that's always delicio show.
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:37.360]  You know, this winter time and all the stuff going on, I want to boost my immune system,
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:40.360]  Silver Bullet from infowarslife.com.
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:44.360]  And I want some survival shield, nascent iodine X2.
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.360]  That's absolutely essential.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:49.360]  Then I have the secret sauce that still won't be here for another week.
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:52.360]  They're telling me it's behind coming in.
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  Can't announce that product yet.
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:58.360]  Some fluoride shield, chelating detoxifier, doesn't just go after fluoride.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:06.360]  And then I've got my lung cleanse, three squirts on the tongue, and then an inhale
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  to get a little bit into your throat.
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:12.360]  And then I stir that baby up.
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:14.360]  Buon appetit.
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:16.360]  Buon viage.
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:19.360]  And I just continue to have more energy, more stamina.
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:23.360]  And I'm watching the weight melt off doing the same amount of exercise I was doing about
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:25.360]  a year and a half ago.
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:27.360]  And I've just been too busy to do it.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:29.360]  We are going to prove this.
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:33.360]  We're going to show me five years ago, two years ago, six months ago and now.
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:38.360]  And I'm going to be taking the shirt off because I mean, I'm not like in super shape or anything,
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:42.360]  but I mean, I've barely got a stomach anymore and I have just lost a ton of weight.
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:46.360]  I'm not very photogenic on video, but I mean, people can see the difference.
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:49.360]  You're really going to see the differences when we take photos the next few weeks because

[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:07.080]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore,
[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:10.400]  cutting edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar nine,
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:13.040]  and that's what you'll find at infowarslife.com.
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:16.480]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:18.200]  from the Infowars Life line
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:20.840]  because they are not of the very highest quality
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:23.360]  or because they're not 100% organic
[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:25.080]  or because they don't ask all
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:27.600]  of the strictest toxicology tests there are
[02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:30.040]  that we have listed at infowarslife.com,
[02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:32.400]  whether it's Survival Shield, nascent iodine,
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:36.600]  or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality,
[02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:40.360]  lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:44.160]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:46.800]  like they've done the thousands of other customers
[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:48.880]  that have visited infowarslife.com
[02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:51.320]  and believed in us and tried the products.
[02:52:51.320 --> 02:52:53.800]  Folks, check out infowarslife.com today
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:56.640]  and the entire line of groundbreaking,
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:59.400]  cutting edge, hardcore products.
[02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:02.640]  This alert just came in.
[02:53:02.640 --> 02:53:05.160]  This special announcement is for business owners
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:07.000]  and leaders of organizations
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:10.200]  who've been waiting for the right time to build.
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:12.160]  General Steel has made it impossible
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:14.240]  to wait any longer with rock bottom prices
[02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:16.120]  that could save you thousands.
[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:17.440]  That's right, General Steel,
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:20.120]  America's leader in pre-engineered structures
[02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:23.240]  is offering buildings at prices you will never see again.
[02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:24.520]  Don't miss these prices.
[02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:27.320]  A 50 by 100 for $35,000.
[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:30.760]  You heard right, that's 5,000 square feet for $35,000.
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:32.760]  Manufacturers, if you need a larger building,
[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:36.680]  try a 100 by 100 commercial building for 129,000.
[02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:38.680]  You can't afford to rent with these prices.
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:40.960]  Imagine a 70 by 100 foot church building
[02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:44.240]  for under $69,000 with the economy improving
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:46.640]  and interest rates still at historic lows.
[02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:48.000]  You can't afford to wait.
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  So call 866-91-Steel.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.800]  Lock in your price now.
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:55.280]  Call 866-91-Steel.
[02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:59.280]  That's 866-917-8335.
[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:25.560]  New article out by Kit Daniels states the obvious,
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:27.720]  but it's important because it links through to the data
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:29.040]  and the proof.
[02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:32.240]  Illegal alien voters could swing close elections
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:33.960]  to Democrats.
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:38.560]  Or the headline could be criminal conspiracy by Obama.
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:40.160]  Illegals are a secret weapon.
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:42.400]  There's that special report.
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.000]  Trendies want to end human driving.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:47.480]  See the full video up at infowars.com.
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:52.200]  Poll 71% back mandatory Ebola quarantine in US.
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:58.280]  The last quote, moderate mercenary group in Syria
[02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:02.680]  surrenders to al-Nusra, which is really just al-Qaeda.
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:05.800]  CDC to purchase 1.4 million surgical gowns
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:10.080]  as Ebola concerns grow, but not to lack of the election.
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:12.240]  Then we're gonna find out what's really going on.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.000]  I hope that it's not spreading, but I tell you,
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.680]  it's suspicious.
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:17.920]  And then of course, that other article,
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:20.880]  Samsung Smart TV records personal conversations
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:23.280]  and sends it on to Samsung and other parties
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:25.160]  and says watch what you say.
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:26.880]  Now that's what you expect when you open up your TV
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:28.080]  and get your owner's manual.
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:30.000]  By the way, we're recording you and monitoring you,
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.680]  watch y'all, which is saying your own thing very much.
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:36.720]  And then it's, ooh, a shocking statement.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:38.800]  The founder of the weather channel has come out
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:40.800]  and said manmade global warming is baloney
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:43.400]  after the UN came out and said we're all gonna die.
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:48.480]  The UN admitted in early documents in the 60s,
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:49.720]  they were gonna say global cooling
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:51.480]  and then global warming was a reason
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:52.320]  for global government.
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:55.600]  They admit it's a fraud, but they wanna arrest you.
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:57.600]  They wanna pass laws that you can't say
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:58.640]  it's not true.
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:01.280]  What a group of out of control totalitarians.
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:04.000]  They say and do things and then you talk about it
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:05.960]  and then they want you arrested.
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:10.280]  Truth Revolt put out an article quoting the author
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:12.520]  of Gone Girl, which is a pretty scary movie
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:15.880]  based on the book, where she was quoted in the book
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:18.880]  talking about sexual experimentation.
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:22.000]  Well, they quoted the book and so the lawyers
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.360]  were threatening to sue him saying it defamed her.
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:27.840]  I mean, this is the bizarreness of this.
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:31.400]  Herman von Roopie, the head of the EU announces
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:33.720]  we want global government and global tax.
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:35.480]  Then you quote it in the Southern Barbery Law Center,
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:37.280]  puts you on a list as a terrorist.
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:40.520]  It's just what they do.
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:42.680]  They just think they control reality.
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:44.040]  I believe it's bullying.
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:46.920]  Let's talk to Michelle or is that Michael?
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:48.760]  I can't read anymore across the room.
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:49.840]  Lights are too bright.
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:53.120]  Michael, you're on the air from FEMA Region 10.
[02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:55.400]  I guess that's a former Oregon or Washington.
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:56.360]  Go ahead.
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:57.920]  Former Oregon.
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:56:59.440]  Go ahead.
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:01.360]  Thanks, just had my daily dose of X2.
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:02.280]  I want to thank you for that.
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:03.960]  As you alluded to earlier, Alex,
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:06.560]  Hollywood has already shown us a possible future
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:10.520]  with the robots and machine quote unquote loving us.
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:12.920]  In the movie Wally, I'm sure everybody's seen that.
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:14.040]  Yes.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.040]  And then Oregonians tomorrow are voting on both GMO labeling
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:22.920]  and legalizing marijuana at the same time.
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:24.920]  Well, try to get everybody out on that.
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:27.320]  Some of the liberals end up having some good issues
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:29.360]  and decriminalization is good.
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.520]  And I think obviously labeling is good.
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:33.920]  So there's some things the left does that are good,
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:36.520]  but notice Obama and his administration
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:38.440]  has been trying to block labeling
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:41.360]  and has been trying to block decriminalization.
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:43.680]  So again, why is the Lord and the Savior,
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:47.440]  Jamie Foxx's words, not backing grassroots liberals?
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.160]  That's a good question because the amount of money
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:53.680]  that's actually coming into the state of Oregon
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:57:57.040]  to combat GMO labeling and combat legalizing marijuana,
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:58.360]  guess where it's coming from?
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:00.040]  It's coming from the liberals.
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:01.560]  That's right, because they're not liberals.
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:04.600]  They are on fire, tyrants,
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:07.320]  and they've got all the well-meaning liberals below them
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:08.600]  going, well, I know they're not pro,
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:10.240]  but they're better than Republicans.
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:14.200]  Look, the worldwide, the globalists use liberalism
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:16.360]  to take over, okay?
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:19.360]  And so we'll use whatever system there is to block it.
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:20.520]  God bless you, appreciate your call.
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:22.200]  We're gonna go to break, do some overdrive.
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:25.160]  Dan in Canada and others, preacher in Texas.
[02:58:25.160 --> 02:58:28.280]  We're gonna go to you guys straight ahead.
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:30.600]  We should be able to go to Dan, preacher, and Tony.
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:32.800]  I don't know about Mark, but we'll try.
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:36.120]  Stay with us, infowars.com, forward slash show

[03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:17.080]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:20.600]  With your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:22.240]  from the front lines.
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:24.800]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:27.080]  you are the resistance.
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:28.320]  I'm gonna go to bed early tonight.
[03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:29.160]  I'll be honest with you.
[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:30.840]  I had trouble sleeping last night for some reason
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:33.160]  that never happens to me, very rarely.
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:34.800]  I don't know if it's ever really dingy today,
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:37.880]  but I just feel like I'm kind of mailed in the broadcast.
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:39.400]  It was overall good, I think.
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:42.160]  But I'm gonna be back super hard hitting Lord willing tomorrow.
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:43.840]  I better be.
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:45.400]  It's a baramade in the afternoon,
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:47.400]  so I'm gonna be hosting off and on like six hours
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:50.480]  of live coverage, Natalie News tomorrow night as well.
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:53.840]  So that'll be nine hours tomorrow for old, old, old,
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:55.400]  old Mr. Jones.
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:58.600]  Dan in Canada, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:00:59.440]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:00.800]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:03.360]  I've been trying to get through to you for months.
[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:04.880]  Well, here you are front and center
[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:07.080]  talking to the pumpkin head.
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:09.200]  Okay, dude, I totally dig your show.
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:11.320]  Like I share it to my wall every day.
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:12.360]  Thank you.
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:15.080]  And it gets out to over 200 and some thousand people,
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:17.080]  even gets to Russia on my wall.
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:19.440]  You talking about Facebook?
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:21.840]  No, I use it on Gmail plus.
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:23.000]  Good.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:24.800]  Good, so it gets out there big time.
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:28.200]  So Alex, I was at MKUltra test day.
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:30.360]  Mind control?
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:32.960]  I know that Canada had more MKUltra victims
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:35.240]  in the U.S. according to declassification.
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:37.960]  Yeah, and they used psychotronic weapons on me.
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:40.120]  You tried to drive me, not say.
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:45.000]  Well, are you officially ever adjudicated to be in MKUltra
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.560]  or do you believe you were in MKUltra?
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:48.160]  Fever or anything like that.
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:50.240]  They just, I was in the federal prison system
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:52.320]  and they just went after me to drive me crazy
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:54.720]  and they beat me 65 times after death
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:57.080]  and they broke all my bones.
[03:01:57.080 --> 03:01:58.560]  I'm handicapped now, eh?
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:01.040]  From the beatings?
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:04.200]  Wow, well listen, brother, send us some info on it.
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:07.240]  I'm sorry to hear that, but just keep spreading the word.
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:10.800]  Yeah, these prisons are factories of evil.
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:12.280]  Let's talk to Tony in Arizona.
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:13.200]  Tony, go ahead.
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:18.200]  Okay, Alex, I had a couple of things.
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:20.440]  First of all, I just have a comment
[03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:22.400]  in regards to the Ebola virus.
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:23.240]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:27.080]  I work in an apartment complex in Chambers, Arizona
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:30.400]  where they're bringing in refugees from Africa,
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:33.800]  Liberia, all over, undocumented, nothing,
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:36.600]  bringing them in and they get to live here for free.
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:39.200]  Completely free.
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:41.280]  You know, you ought to do a secret report on it
[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:45.200]  or send us tips at whistleblowers.infowars.com
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:46.520]  and if you can tell us what to show
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:48.080]  and what to do, we'd send a reporter out there,
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:52.280]  but yes, I know a lady, family, friends as I was a baby,
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:56.920]  who manages some of the biggest apartment complexes in Texas
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:02:59.400]  and they were sent to meetings about six years ago
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:03.080]  and they told them, we're gonna secretly go government housing,
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:05.480]  we're only supposed to give it to illegals,
[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:09.120]  we're gonna kick out all citizens and so it began
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:11.440]  and so are you saying that's what's happening
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:12.640]  where you're at?
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:15.640]  It is, I have video proof of them bringing them in,
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:19.440]  I have video proof of a guy who they quarantined
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:22.240]  because there was an Ebola scare here
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:26.240]  and the CDC made a sign, a confidentiality agreement
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:29.040]  saying that if we went to the media anywhere,
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:31.840]  we could be fined up to $5,000 in five years in prison.
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:33.880]  Yeah, notice, they make you sign something
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:36.320]  when you had rights and by the way,
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:38.520]  there's not prison time for violent and confidentiality
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:41.000]  order and if you agree to that and it's criminal
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.640]  what they're doing, it doesn't hold water,
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:46.400]  but I wanna get your name and number off record,
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:49.080]  I wanna have one of the reporters talk to you
[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:51.200]  but there's more than one way to skin a rat
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:54.320]  and so we can check this out but we know this is going on.
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:56.080]  Tell us specifically what's going on
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:58.000]  at the apartment complex.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.720]  They've brought in people from Liberia,
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:04.400]  they have like a specific classroom here in the office
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:06.920]  where they bring them in, they kind of go over
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:09.800]  what to say, what kind of paperwork to sell out,
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:11.960]  Liberia, Africa, all these different places
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:14.440]  where they come in and they literally,
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:16.720]  they're teaching them what to say, what to write,
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:19.040]  like half these people don't even know how to
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:20.880]  write their own name on their own.
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:22.200]  Perfect voters.
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:23.040]  And so who's doing this?
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:25.280]  The Feds, the CDC, who's doing this?
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:26.680]  They're the Feds, they have to be
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:28.840]  because every single apartment complex
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:31.520]  managed by this company literally
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:33.440]  lets nothing but refugees in.
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:35.680]  Now I hear you say the name of the company.
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:37.200]  It's called Billmore Properties.
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:40.960]  Okay, give us the name of the apartment complex
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:43.560]  and we'll send people out there.
[03:04:43.560 --> 03:04:45.600]  Chandler Village Apartments.
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:46.520]  If you are reserving-
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:48.240]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:49.360]  God bless you all, sir.
[03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:51.560]  We're gonna put you on hold, get your info.
[03:04:51.560 --> 03:04:53.120]  This is going on everywhere, I already know it is
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:55.000]  but we need to illustrate.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.320]  Remember they were gonna have whole resorts for the illegals?
[03:04:57.320 --> 03:04:58.880]  It's a total implosion plan.
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:05.880]  It's going on right now.
