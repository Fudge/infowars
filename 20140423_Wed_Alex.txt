[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:45.200]  Texas Alex Jones my friends it is Wednesday the 23rd day of April 2014 I

[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  three hours Doug and Joe Hagman father and son will be joining us from
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.600]  Homeland Security US calm to break down what their latest analysis and intel is
[01:00.600 --> 01:07.520]  on the economy the Russian situation what's happening with the BLM and more
[01:07.520 --> 01:16.880]  so that is all coming up today they will be joining us in the third hour I I do
[01:16.880 --> 01:21.120]  want to work towards being calm today and covering as much news as I can and
[01:21.120 --> 01:26.080]  not being so preachy but we'll see if that we'll see if that indeed happens
[01:26.080 --> 01:33.320]  obviously the rest of situation is deteriorating very very quickly and
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.440]  really the article that needs to be written that needs to be gotten out to
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.520]  the people of the world not just the US is the timeline of the Ukraine crisis the
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.320]  State Department admittedly spending five billion dollars to destabilize Russia
[01:47.320 --> 01:52.160]  overthrowing the elected government attacking the police and military who
[01:52.160 --> 01:59.480]  were not doing anything calling it a peace revolution so that the EU can come
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.200]  in and suck the country dry and then Russia grabs its gas pipelines and
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.880]  military bases in the area traditionally part of Russia and then masses
[02:09.880 --> 02:15.160]  troops knowing that NATO's massing troops and mercenaries there we reported
[02:15.160 --> 02:20.120]  on that a month ago we reported on it days before it was in mainstream news the
[02:20.120 --> 02:27.160]  CIA director was in Kiev the capital of Ukraine the media denied that they
[02:27.160 --> 02:31.680]  denied that there were US troops or mercenaries massing and then today it's
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.240]  like oh by the way we're moving into Poland and other surrounding areas
[02:36.240 --> 02:45.800]  preparing to engage Russia and then you've got Lavrov the foreign minister
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.040]  and we're gonna play this audio and video coming up saying if you engage any of
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.680]  our troops we're going to militarily respond I mean this is beyond Cuban
[02:56.680 --> 03:03.680]  Missile Crisis type stuff and the average American literally has no idea even
[03:03.680 --> 03:08.120]  where Ukraine is there's no idea who the players are and again I'm not saying
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.560]  Putin's an angel all the Russians are good the fact is the globalists are the
[03:12.560 --> 03:17.240]  ones starting the war in Syria starting the overthrow in Libya starting the
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.000]  overthrow in Egypt starting the overthrow in Serbia starting the
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.920]  overthrow Ukraine you name it using al-Qaeda and we just played video on
[03:29.920 --> 03:33.720]  Monday we're gonna play it again coming up of real al-Qaeda with their al-Qaeda
[03:33.720 --> 03:45.640]  flags launching high-tech modern surface-to-air missiles surface-to-air
[03:45.640 --> 03:52.480]  missiles at helicopters and jet aircraft of the Assad regime and our media is
[03:52.480 --> 03:55.760]  acting like this is some type of wonderful deal here's the daily mail
[03:55.760 --> 03:59.320]  though telling the truth about it today Benghazi attack could have been
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.920]  prevented if u.s. had to switch sides in war on terror and about 500 million of
[04:04.920 --> 04:12.040]  weapons to reach al-Qaeda militants reveals damning report and we're going
[04:12.040 --> 04:19.640]  to go over this report and the different CIA officers and others that have gone
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.240]  public they didn't switch sides criminal elements that have hijacked the
[04:25.240 --> 04:31.800]  government have always been sock puppeting and funding and opening the
[04:31.800 --> 04:38.120]  door for and shepherding and giving aid and comfort to al-Qaeda that's why I
[04:38.120 --> 04:45.180]  coined the term before 9-11 six months before of al-CIA
[04:45.180 --> 04:54.240]  duh al-CIA duh and al-CIA duh the CIA is not American it's banker it's foreign
[04:54.240 --> 05:01.020]  bank it's British Empire we'll be right back stay with the globalists have
[05:01.020 --> 05:04.920]  controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding
[05:04.920 --> 05:08.880]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major
[05:08.880 --> 05:14.080]  networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has
[05:14.080 --> 05:18.520]  become a political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC
[05:18.520 --> 05:21.840]  tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our
[05:21.840 --> 05:25.880]  kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[05:25.880 --> 05:28.880]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.040]  important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.920]  the true media the establishment dinosaur press is dying we are in an

[08:44.400 --> 08:51.160]  the political class needs crises to stay in power and expand their power
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.440]  Vladimir Putin and some of the hardliners in the Russian government will
[08:57.440 --> 09:03.160]  become more entrenched in Russia and more powerful because of other
[09:03.160 --> 09:11.360]  kleptocrats in the West George Soros and others heading up NATO destabilizing
[09:11.360 --> 09:15.920]  Ukraine overthrowing the elected Ukrainian government and when Russia
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.600]  responds to secure its holdings in the east only a small portion of the nation
[09:22.600 --> 09:30.240]  when NATO is seized over 90% it is then billed as a Russian invasion and a new
[09:30.240 --> 09:39.000]  Cold War has officially been launched US troops mercenaries NATO troops have
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.560]  been in Ukraine the entire time they are now moving into Ukraine and Poland and
[09:44.560 --> 09:51.160]  missile systems are being aggressively brought in to encircle Russia extreme
[09:51.160 --> 09:58.080]  provocation I watched this morning on television on the Communist News Network
[09:58.080 --> 10:07.480]  CNN the three-star US general assigned to NATO with US troops under NATO flag
[10:07.480 --> 10:16.480]  pouring off of transport aircraft in Poland now the Russians two weeks ago
[10:16.480 --> 10:20.320]  said the CIA director was there they're getting ready to launch an offensive
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.720]  against us on our border our controlled media said that wasn't true then
[10:25.720 --> 10:30.440]  suddenly shootings began bombings began and it was confirmed a CIA director was
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.800]  there to basically command the next phase of the operation to try to create
[10:35.800 --> 10:41.120]  provocations using low-intensity asymmetrical warfare to get the
[10:41.120 --> 10:46.600]  Russians to respond so that the media can say oh my gosh the Russians are
[10:46.600 --> 10:54.360]  attacking us I guess so some new physical theater war can start with the
[10:54.360 --> 11:00.840]  Russians I mean I guess that's the real aim here the problem is the Russian
[11:00.840 --> 11:08.160]  government is autocratic corrupt has a lot of serious problems but compared to
[11:08.160 --> 11:12.000]  the globalists and the banksters that run Europe in the US the Russians are
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.280]  promoting pro-family the Russians are promoting having children the Russians
[11:16.280 --> 11:20.040]  are promoting low taxes in fact they have lower taxes than us on average now
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.680]  the Russians are trying to reform themselves and by the West attacking
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.520]  them it will now in those reforms as Russia becomes hardline they don't want
[11:29.520 --> 11:34.320]  to renaissance in Russia and that's what this is all about war is good for
[11:34.320 --> 11:40.360]  autocrats and insider traders and defense contractors in big banks the Rothschilds
[11:40.360 --> 11:46.800]  famously in a series of European wars over a 200-year period from the 1700s
[11:46.800 --> 11:54.120]  right into 1900 famously would finance all sides of a war and sometimes you'd
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.480]  have up to four sides there wouldn't be just two sides they would finance all
[11:57.480 --> 12:03.080]  sides and they ended up ruling financially all of Europe and still do
[12:03.080 --> 12:10.200]  to this day the UN the carbon trading companies the big investment banks you
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.120]  name it Rothschilds are at the center of every one of them so are the Rockefellers
[12:15.120 --> 12:22.240]  the kings of the US oligarchs every time Russia arrests an oligarch they laugh
[12:22.240 --> 12:25.960]  at Putin and say you can't get our holdings are our money and it comes out
[12:25.960 --> 12:29.800]  in the London newspapers that indeed it's a Rothschilds front company the
[12:29.800 --> 12:33.760]  Rothschilds sued over newspapers reporting on this and lost the lawsuit
[12:33.760 --> 12:43.600]  and the judge said this trial found that you do you are puppet masters this
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.200]  trial found that you are running front companies
[12:48.200 --> 12:58.240]  and it is the same story happening again and so the West gets to have more
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.320]  defense spending more police state now a new anti-Russian sentiment and the
[13:02.320 --> 13:05.520]  Russians they don't worry about not having enough food or not having enough of
[13:05.520 --> 13:09.560]  an economy growing they can now say the West is causing it which is actually
[13:09.560 --> 13:17.360]  true but it will now kill reforms in Russia and so we march further into the
[13:17.360 --> 13:24.120]  dark ages here here's the headlines Pentagon deploying troops to thwart
[13:24.120 --> 13:32.280]  Russia USA today US troops arrive in Poland for exercises across Eastern
[13:32.280 --> 13:37.680]  Europe amid Ukraine crisis commanding general says that it's quote to send a
[13:37.680 --> 13:45.240]  message to Russia and to counter Russia US moves troops to allies near Russia
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.640]  as tensions flare in eastern Ukraine Wall Street Journal Kerry tells Russia of
[13:50.640 --> 13:56.480]  deep concern over Ukraine pro-russia insurgents hold US journalists captive
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.680]  so it's it's now accelerating the Russians will fight back and their
[14:01.680 --> 14:07.080]  their Russian enclaves will start getting aggressive yeah holds journalists
[14:07.080 --> 14:13.320]  captive bet their journalist all right yeah right let's continue here ladies
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.640]  and gentlemen Russia says conducting military drill again near Ukraine they
[14:18.640 --> 14:23.060]  built up they say 40,000 more like 200,000 trips one I've seen on the
[14:23.060 --> 14:30.600]  border including rolling in on record new medium and long range mobile ICBMs
[14:30.600 --> 14:38.880]  with Merv tips multiple reentry devices multiple warheads and dummy warheads to
[14:38.880 --> 14:47.400]  defeat space-based lasers and ground-based lasers and missile interceptors
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.360]  here is NPR acting like Putin's running everything it isn't on the defense it
[14:52.360 --> 14:56.920]  isn't being defeated right now Putin's chest moves in Ukraine brilliant tactics
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.720]  but bad strategy question mark let me explain who is on the offense here
[15:02.720 --> 15:09.120]  ladies and gentlemen the big banks that conquered the United States and are
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.840]  taking all of our land and raising taxes until we go bankrupt we are under
[15:13.840 --> 15:19.000]  attack by the very same people attacking the Russians and the reason the
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.560]  globalist keep winning is their masters at playing us off against each other I
[15:22.560 --> 15:25.880]  keep saying I'm gonna play this again well you guys queue up the from Russia
[15:25.880 --> 15:31.520]  would love Simon's fighting fish piece I'm gonna play that again because that's
[15:31.520 --> 15:36.240]  what this is all about this explains everything this is the globalist system
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.040]  they sit above the nations driving us into debt playing us off against each
[15:40.040 --> 15:45.160]  other when we should be in absolute collaboration with the Russians with
[15:45.160 --> 15:51.240]  technological next-level systems of energy space exploration everything the
[15:51.240 --> 15:56.280]  United States is natural partners with the Russians we owe the Russians an
[15:56.280 --> 16:04.600]  absolute debt of apology for with the British intelligence in 1917 declassify
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.880]  this is mainstream news look it up 25 million dollars in gold brought in by
[16:08.880 --> 16:17.480]  Joseph Stalin the head bank robber and money collector for vi Lenin and bringing
[16:17.480 --> 16:24.680]  in upwards of 100,000 US cheap debt soldiers who spoke Russian first and
[16:24.680 --> 16:31.360]  second-generation Russian immigrants out of New York City and other areas to
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.120]  invade Russia and overthrow it and then why I think the left in this country
[16:36.120 --> 16:42.280]  supported Lenin and Stalin because they came from us just like Hitler came from
[16:42.280 --> 16:48.640]  us everything comes from England and the United States look at England in the
[16:48.640 --> 16:55.360]  U.S. today it runs the world the language runs the world haven't people
[16:55.360 --> 16:58.520]  figured that out I'm not demonizing England in the U.S. England the U.S. are
[16:58.520 --> 17:02.920]  wondrous rich cultures of good people but because we were smart vicious
[17:02.920 --> 17:08.000]  aggressive the evil got control of us and has been using us to build their
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.280]  world government while they prepare us for destruction you don't just think
[17:14.280 --> 17:17.440]  they want to overthrow Assad and kill everybody do you because he's a
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.400]  industrialized area and because the women don't have to wear hoods over their
[17:21.400 --> 17:25.320]  heads they're wearing hoods on their heads now in al-qaeda held areas here is
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.400]  the London Daily Mail Benghazi attack could have been prevented if U.S. had
[17:30.400 --> 17:33.560]  to switch sides and war on terror and a lot of 500 million of weapons to reach
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.920]  al-qaeda militants reveals damning report you know we told you about that
[17:37.920 --> 17:41.400]  before it even happened but it was coming and now they admit Benghazi was a
[17:41.400 --> 17:45.880]  missile transfer do you understand what a fraud this is folks it's not US
[17:45.880 --> 17:52.880]  support it's globalist support for al-qaeda using the US as a membrane as a
[17:52.880 --> 17:58.360]  fence as a foil as a go-between we either learn how they're dominating us the
[17:58.360 --> 18:02.120]  global technocrats that are eugenicists that's their identity that's their
[18:02.120 --> 18:05.760]  ideology we either learn the real enemy's identity and how they're play it's
[18:05.760 --> 18:08.880]  like an alien might as well be aliens for other planet I'm not actually saying
[18:08.880 --> 18:12.440]  that's what it is I'm saying think of it like that the globalist how would aliens
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.520]  take over the planet they would play us off against each other let's let's
[18:16.520 --> 18:20.200]  explain what the globalists are doing playing us off against each other with
[18:20.200 --> 18:25.880]  this James Bond clip here it is fighting fascinating creatures brave but
[18:25.880 --> 18:33.360]  of the whole stupid yes except for the occasional one such as we have here
[18:33.360 --> 18:47.040]  let's the other two fight he waits waits until the survivor is so exhausted
[18:47.040 --> 18:55.960]  that he cannot defend himself and then like specter he strikes I find the
[18:55.960 --> 19:00.680]  parallel music our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the
[19:00.680 --> 19:09.480]  Russians just for amusement number three come in Cronstein sit down number
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.440]  three while we listen to what number five is devised for us all right that's

[24:26.200 --> 24:31.920]  all more proof and a signpost that we are entering a contrived orchestrated
[24:31.920 --> 24:38.280]  global crisis but the Davos and Bilderberg group on record plan to ride to
[24:38.280 --> 24:45.040]  world government and total control under a technocratic surveillance grid

[25:16.040 --> 25:19.200]  they're getting ready to go fully operational with homeland security as
[25:19.200 --> 25:23.200]  the domestic Stasi force that it was built to be they even hired the former
[25:23.200 --> 25:26.840]  head of the Stasi Marcus Wolfe to consult for two years when I first heard
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.600]  that in 2003 on the radio from a guest host or a guest I had on I didn't believe
[25:32.600 --> 25:38.080]  it Al Martin was covering it investigative journalist and I went and
[25:38.080 --> 25:41.080]  looked it up and actually found a homeland security document and
[25:41.080 --> 25:45.760]  congressional you know links where they were funding hiring him as a consultant
[25:45.760 --> 25:51.720]  I mean hired the former head of the Stasi to consult for two years he died
[25:51.720 --> 25:57.640]  after that here's the headline Louisiana creates database of citizens who
[25:57.640 --> 26:02.560]  represent a risk to the state. Texas tried to pass the database like this about
[26:02.560 --> 26:05.480]  four years ago that quote if you've been critical of the government you'd be in a
[26:05.480 --> 26:09.000]  database when you were pulled over so there you go and it admits they track
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.120]  everyone and watch everyone basically with NSA software we're gonna play that
[26:14.120 --> 26:18.280]  video coming up here's another one that dovetails with that New York Homeland
[26:18.280 --> 26:23.140]  Security encourages businesses to snitch on preppers as terrorists purchasing
[26:23.140 --> 26:27.320]  MREs flashlights or ammunition is suspicious activity that's why I've
[26:27.320 --> 26:31.800]  seen articles in mainstream news in New York State and New Jersey where on one
[26:31.800 --> 26:39.160]  case an old guy bought 500 rounds of 22 that's what it comes in and the FBI came
[26:39.160 --> 26:43.080]  to his house to see why he got it and it's just to create the impression that
[26:43.080 --> 26:47.460]  that's illegal or terrorist and to get you used to men coming to your house you
[26:47.460 --> 26:51.900]  know the government funds al-Qaeda and opens the borders up and launder hundreds
[26:51.900 --> 26:56.160]  of billions a year and drug money publicly but if you buy MREs or candles
[26:56.160 --> 27:04.560]  or flashlights or whatever we're gonna come visit your house we're gonna come
[27:04.560 --> 27:08.760]  ask you questions we're gonna know you're buying guns we're gonna come ask you

[36:27.480 --> 36:31.480]  on preppers as terrorists we have video with that Homeland Security to purchase
[36:31.480 --> 36:36.960]  25 million more shotgun rounds more in the geopolitical news China challenges
[36:36.960 --> 36:42.200]  Obama's Asia pivot with a rapid military buildup mainstream media reports on
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.960]  criminal interest in the US arming Alcada with missiles that's in the
[36:45.960 --> 36:50.400]  Daily Mail and we've got TSA agents groping two and six-year-old children
[36:50.400 --> 36:54.480]  even though they claim they've stopped that and speaking of that Brian Singer
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.760]  sex abuser names three more Hollywood bigwigs in lawsuits we've got a special
[36:59.760 --> 37:08.760]  report coming up on that there's no doubt Hollywood is absolutely filled with
[37:08.760 --> 37:16.080]  sexual abusers of men women children you name it I have been contacted over the
[37:16.080 --> 37:21.880]  years by some of the people that are now going public and I'll just leave it at
[37:21.880 --> 37:26.760]  that and I don't have the lawyers or the time to prove what they're saying and so
[37:26.760 --> 37:30.720]  I passed on breaking all this not with this particular guy but with some of the
[37:30.720 --> 37:34.240]  other people I'll just say that some of the names listed in the John Bounds
[37:34.240 --> 37:39.560]  report that's coming up are people that have contacted us and reportedly they've
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.760]  been killing people that report on this and that's not why I haven't reported on
[37:43.760 --> 37:49.400]  it it's just that I can prove that the government's buying 2.6 billion rounds of
[37:49.400 --> 37:53.760]  ammo and thousands of armored vehicles but the media says I'm lying I can prove
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.760]  under the emergency centers establishment act they built FEMA camps but
[37:57.760 --> 38:01.400]  the media says I'm lying even though it's documented I can prove that they
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.800]  ordered to stand down at Benghazi but the media says that didn't happen I can
[38:05.800 --> 38:11.760]  prove that there's a $5,000 fine per employee that you have in 2014 if you
[38:11.760 --> 38:16.240]  don't get insurance for your employees or lay them off or cut their hours but
[38:16.240 --> 38:19.000]  the media says that's not true even though it's happening and in the bill I
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.480]  can prove there's death panels they say they don't exist I can prove under the
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.120]  night stalkers Fort Campbell Kentucky and other secret FEMA programs there are
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.960]  black helicopters that are radar resistant with a special paint that's
[38:33.960 --> 38:38.200]  been declassified for 20 years but the media says it doesn't exist so real
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.720]  stuff we can prove people aren't ready for so I'm just gonna be honest with you
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.380]  this is one of the things that I mean I remember I remember it's got to be 10
[38:47.380 --> 38:55.720]  years ago David I call the show saying I know BBC presenters that rape children
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.240]  and their dead bodies and I know a member of parliament who became prime
[39:00.240 --> 39:03.960]  minister who slits children's throats when this person delivers them and this
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.200]  person hangs out with the royal family and brings them children and David was
[39:08.200 --> 39:10.840]  about to say their name on there he told me off air and later on his own
[39:10.840 --> 39:16.080]  website said Savelle Jimmy Savelle and I'm like people heard these interviews
[39:16.080 --> 39:20.520]  these interviews are online I'm like uh-uh no names no no because I mean it
[39:20.520 --> 39:29.520]  just sounds insane all turned out to be true I mean he said Jimmy Savelle ten
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.000]  years ago by name was having sex with kids delivering them to the royal family
[39:34.000 --> 39:45.960]  slitting their throats on and on and now most of that has come out so I don't
[39:45.960 --> 39:52.640]  even know what to say anymore I have trouble wrapping my mind around all
[39:52.640 --> 39:59.680]  this so that's coming up as well and we've got a Pentagon plans to replace
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.520]  flight crews with full-time robots that's a headline of the Washington Times
[40:03.520 --> 40:12.040]  DARPA said back in 2000 that by 2020 there will be no combat aircraft in the
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.120]  Air Force the the army and Marine Corps will still have some ground attack
[40:16.120 --> 40:20.200]  aircraft that are human piloted but that'll be vestigial there will be no
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.120]  combat aircraft with humans flying them and the drones will be autonomous it'll
[40:24.120 --> 40:30.360]  be no more metals for the drone pilots and so there's that article I got
[40:30.360 --> 40:37.960]  another one here Pentagon scientist shows off life-size robot was with the sec
[40:37.960 --> 40:44.600]  deaf Chuck Hagel firsthand look at the Terminator style robot that's a quote
[40:44.600 --> 40:51.280]  from the Pentagon Terminator style and again that robot you're looking at is
[40:51.280 --> 40:55.240]  at least a 20 year old design just for all the boys and girls out there I was
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.720]  brought up speed on these robots in 1999 by a Marine Corps officer and then
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.440]  later I was able to verify through open intelligence that what he told me was
[41:04.440 --> 41:10.240]  accurate and a lot of this is shy ops ladies and gentlemen they actually have
[41:10.240 --> 41:15.160]  robots that look like Terminator more like the one that you see in the in the
[41:15.160 --> 41:18.680]  last one where it's a more primitive one marching down the street and they even
[41:18.680 --> 41:27.120]  have skull heads to terrify the public in fact this one being rolled out has more
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.440]  of a menacing face but they're going to phase in for the public now the skull
[41:31.440 --> 41:34.800]  faces and the rest of it just to purely terrorize you and your family
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.760]  Japan's already deploying six years ago robots on the streets now New York has
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.520]  announced they're deploying robots little little robots that look like what's
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.880]  the doctor who things that say exterminate exterminate the Daleks they
[41:49.880 --> 41:52.880]  look like Daleks that was in the news last week with their domes and they
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.520]  cattle on you and report on you and shout orders at you that's just preparing
[41:57.520 --> 42:03.120]  you with something non-threatening till they put well robots that look just like
[42:03.120 --> 42:08.880]  the combat robots they have in the latest Robocop in fact that's exactly what
[42:08.880 --> 42:14.760]  these big combat robots look like is the robots out of Robocop so we're gonna be
[42:14.760 --> 42:20.360]  getting into that for you and again they don't need you anymore as soon as the
[42:20.360 --> 42:25.640]  robots are brought online you're not needed anymore and as soon as they have
[42:25.640 --> 42:30.680]  robots working on robots which a bunch of companies already have it's it's game
[42:30.680 --> 42:35.120]  over because you're seen as an infestation on the earth you've been
[42:35.120 --> 42:39.080]  taught you're an ugly infestation so most people now want to die and believe
[42:39.080 --> 42:42.480]  it's good and have been taught how wonderful it's gonna be when the humans
[42:42.480 --> 42:47.440]  are wiped out so you've been given a subconscious and conscious preparation
[42:47.440 --> 42:53.000]  for all this for you and your family okay so I said I want to get back into

[47:28.360 --> 47:33.120]  second hour and then we're gonna run out of gas here and you know crash
[47:33.120 --> 47:36.320]  basically we don't do that yeah I want to get into the police state news we'll
[47:36.320 --> 47:39.480]  do that the next segment then give the number out cover other news take your
[47:39.480 --> 47:45.120]  calls the next hour as we realize this panoptagonic system of surveillance is
[47:45.120 --> 47:49.120]  designed for us and to quash and shut down political speech but before we go
[47:49.120 --> 47:56.440]  any further this is Lavrov he is the Russian Foreign Minister and really the
[47:56.440 --> 48:02.240]  right-hand man to Putin and he says Russia will respond if each of Ukraine
[48:02.240 --> 48:08.280]  is attacked and you have to understand folks that the Rothschild Rockefeller
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.240]  runs CIA British Intel runs CIA it's not American that's had a shadow government
[48:13.240 --> 48:19.320]  place since 1947 with the National Security Act they are openly attacking the
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.200]  paramilitary forces the five or six Russian towns that are almost completely
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.400]  Russian that it basically said we don't want to be ethnically cleansed by the
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.680]  pure Ukrainians they've got a reason not like Russians I mean I'm not getting
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.560]  the middle of this I'm not taking sides and but the point is the West is
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.440]  fomenting this and so the Russians are saying you try to take our areas we're
[48:40.440 --> 48:44.080]  going to fight back so that this this could explode anytime this is a very
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.440]  serious situation officer there explain that to you and I told you how this would
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.200]  go and it's starting to go that way that this is a terrible situation and it's
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.000]  what you expect when the world's on the edge of international crises and
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.680]  financial collapse you expect the globalist to start a war that's what I
[48:58.680 --> 49:02.600]  and Gerald Salente and Ron Paul and so many others have told you the globalist
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.520]  are pathological they do the same things over and over again the more
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.440]  criminal the more mentally ill you are the more you're set in a pattern let's go
[49:10.440 --> 49:16.040]  ahead and go to the Russian foreign minister if we are attacked we would
[49:16.040 --> 49:21.800]  certainly respond if our interests legitimate interest the interests of
[49:21.800 --> 49:27.800]  Russians have been attacked directly like they were in South Ossetia for
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.920]  example I don't see any other way but to respond in full accordance with
[49:32.920 --> 49:37.800]  international law Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.040]  Russian Federation the only thing I would like to highlight at this stage is
[49:42.040 --> 49:49.000]  that the Russian troops are on the Russian territory the requests for
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.360]  inspections under the so-called Vienna document of 2011 and under the Treaty of
[49:55.360 --> 50:02.160]  the open sky they all have been granted the inspectors visited the areas of
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.880]  deployment of the troops participating in the training exercises the planes
[50:08.880 --> 50:16.600]  overflight the areas of exercise and no one but who participated in the
[50:16.600 --> 50:22.360]  inspections including the Americans Ukrainians and Europeans ever brought up
[50:22.360 --> 50:27.520]  any fact which would indicate that Russia was engaged in some dangerous
[50:27.520 --> 50:33.640]  military activity all right he said that in English is a message to the West
[50:33.640 --> 50:42.800]  okay George Soros in Hillary Clinton and John Kerry started this and so under
[50:42.800 --> 50:47.240]  common law they're wrong and guess what they're running our country they're on
[50:47.240 --> 50:53.040]  the Russian border stirring stuff up trying to create a political crisis so
[50:53.040 --> 50:56.440]  they can get a big bail out of Europe out of the economic devastation that
[50:56.440 --> 51:01.640]  happens a new Marshall plan that that's bottom line silver has always been

[52:03.120 --> 52:07.160]  about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[52:07.160 --> 52:11.160]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[52:11.160 --> 52:14.680]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out
[52:14.680 --> 52:19.520]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for Patriots
[52:19.520 --> 52:24.080]  was born by Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.640]  they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard

[54:59.160 --> 55:04.040]  Oklahoma border you've got 50 plus legislators meeting last weekend in
[55:04.040 --> 55:07.960]  Salt Lake saying let's move to take the federal land and give it to the states
[55:07.960 --> 55:11.680]  and the people it's happening we have the moral authority not a bunch of foreign
[55:11.680 --> 55:14.680]  banks that run the federal government and then through that want to steal all
[55:14.680 --> 55:22.160]  the land we have to say no we have to stand up we have to be radical in the
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.560]  face of radicals because we're not radical radicalism and defense of
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.080]  liberty is no vice extremism and defense of liberty is no vice Murray
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.040]  Goldwater we're not the radicals but if they're radically attacking us we have
[55:35.040 --> 55:41.760]  to radically stand up against them that's the measured response and call them
[55:41.760 --> 55:45.600]  out stop letting them have the moral authority they're building a criminal
[55:45.600 --> 55:49.200]  grid with Republican and Democratic leadership to suppress political
[55:49.200 --> 55:52.880]  speech free speech zones IRS shutting down pro-life groups and
[55:52.880 --> 55:58.040]  conservative groups this is oppression and if they get away with this then it's
[55:58.040 --> 56:04.120]  NDAA now here's part of the video up on info wars.com that is from the company
[56:04.120 --> 56:08.200]  itself but folks online have added close captions to it describe the pitfalls
[56:08.200 --> 56:12.840]  Louisiana creates database of citizens who represent a quote rest of the state
[56:12.840 --> 56:17.120]  not that you've committed a crime or you say or do something no we're gonna they
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.240]  going to say we're watching everything you do and seeing if you're a risk to
[56:20.240 --> 56:24.320]  the state see now the government's about who's a risk to the state not about
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.320]  who's a risk to our liberty and then New York Homeland Security encourages
[56:28.320 --> 56:34.440]  businesses to snitch on preppers as terrorist purchases of MREs flashlights
[56:34.440 --> 56:38.720]  ammunition as suspicious activity as Homeland Security buys 25 million more
[56:38.720 --> 56:44.320]  rounds of shotgun shells let's go to this promo video where they're promoting
[56:44.320 --> 56:49.920]  what the state of Louisiana is rolling out here it is when we built our system
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.680]  we decided instead of providing an agency-specific solution that we would
[56:55.680 --> 57:00.040]  instead create a centralized data warehouse applying the SAS fraud
[57:00.040 --> 57:06.680]  framework there and allow every agency within state government to operate like
[57:06.680 --> 57:11.160]  a hub and spoke type system where they would all send in their data by the
[57:11.160 --> 57:15.880]  centralized data warehouse data back at up five seconds see I'm gonna analyze
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.600]  this whole thing in the next hour after calls it's an arms race a police state
[57:20.600 --> 57:24.840]  race a control freak race a pedophile race in the public schools in the system
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.240]  a power grab race now the states with the threat fusion centers are all having
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.880]  private companies directed by the government and in regard to deploy NSA
[57:33.880 --> 57:39.480]  grids to the ground and then give you access to it so see the way they make
[57:39.480 --> 57:42.360]  sure that you can never get rid of the surveillance status they start handing
[57:42.360 --> 57:48.400]  it around to everybody but when you accept the system you're now buying into
[57:48.400 --> 57:52.640]  it as well let's go back to the piece where they would all send in their data
[57:52.640 --> 57:57.880]  by the centralized data warehouse and getting data from those multiple sources
[57:57.880 --> 58:02.080]  it would allow each participating agency who was seeking to detect fraud within
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.440]  their agency to create that comprehensive person profile and look for
[58:06.440 --> 58:09.240]  anomalies
[58:10.680 --> 58:18.640]  the beauty to me behind the solution that SAS provided was that they were able
[58:18.640 --> 58:26.000]  to take a state that was data rich and solution for and compile aggregate all
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.960]  of that data into a single location so that we could then have multiple
[58:30.960 --> 58:35.840]  applications folks this is government making money members of the
[58:35.840 --> 58:41.600]  legislature involved with the companies spying on everyone thank you for the
[58:41.600 --> 58:45.640]  next hour coming up folks stay with us we've got the pedophile reports out of

[58:51.200 --> 58:55.080]  contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties this year alone

[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.760]  Russia situation is US troops began massing in and around Russia Dutch
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.920]  scramble fighter jets after Russian bombers approach AP the Dutch Defense
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.600]  Department says several NATO member countries scramble jets today after a
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.240]  pair of Russian bomber planes approach the airspace over the North Sea the
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.360]  Dutch Ministry identified the planes the two Russian TU-95 bears and said it had
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:35.520]  launched two F-16s and a vocal airbase to intercept them the Russian jets were
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.920]  escorted by aircraft from the Netherlands Britain and Denmark until they
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:46.280]  departed so that's the ongoing escalation ladies and gentlemen continuing
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.280]  here we're going to get more into exclusive Texas AG Abbott to BLM come
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.760]  and take it that's from right Bard Republicans warn BLM eyeing land grab
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.400]  along Texas border we have the official letter up on info wars.com from the
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.120]  Attorney General they'll try to get him on the show I know he's been on years
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:11.920]  ago the name back when he was a state rep so we've got that news again I just
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.680]  mentioned this but I want to get your take
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.240]  specifically on the Russia situation and the Ukraine situation where do you
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.800]  think that's going how do you think we fix this and deescalate it because stage
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.920]  one is say they want a new Marshall plan to prop up Ukraine after they
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.320]  overthrow it destabilize it as a new banker bailout in Europe by another
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.360]  name and then it's also meant to destabilize Russia put missiles on their
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.920]  borders starting to Cold War what do you think about that I want to hear from
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.920]  military personnel because when this all started in the last three months we
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.440]  said you know Russia would take those areas on their border then they would
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.400]  send in Ukrainians against them pro-west Ukrainians pro-saurus Ukrainians and
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.400]  that that would then escalate the Russians will start fighting back and
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.640]  then if the West got heavily involved with military action or advisors the
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.680]  Russians may start launching attacks with their regular military and then all
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.360]  hell is going to break low so this is a very volatile situation this is not
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.640]  Iraq or Libya where the the controlled us the occupied us with the
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:21.680]  collaborators just you know goes into some third world country and puts
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.080]  al-Qaeda on the ground and murders everybody and then the public so dumb
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.280]  and disconnected from reality you know they think that the government's
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.640]  fighting al-Qaeda this is the Russians despite all their problems their
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.880]  sophisticated civilization have a lot of high-tech weapons and will tend to
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.280]  fight back which I know is the arts crime according to George Soros folks
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.600]  didn't fight back too much when he was in Romania running the Nazi squads to
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.800]  hunt down Jews and steal their goods that's why it's ADL awards if you're
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.800]  against that type of thing you get attacked by the ADL not even joking
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.120]  when I say that it's so bizarre how sick the society is and now Soros is
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.720]  backing Nazis again the main group leading the Ukrainian opposition the
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:10.200]  Russians is a ultra-national socialistic our media calls them right wing Nazis
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.320]  including the vice president and it's not even in our news it's just I saw a
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  singing in article the other day about why the West is is trolling al-Qaeda and
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.520]  the articles we're working with them because you know it's best to talk to
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.920]  them and yeah we're using them against Syria because you know they're kind of
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.800]  nice guys now soon it'll be you're a traitor for not supporting al-Qaeda
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:39.880]  Jones you piece of trash what's next you're not gonna support the

[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.520]  to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.960]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within

[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.520]  this is an incredible escalation coming up I want to get into Pentagon plans to

[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.640]  report that's the daily mail I know you've heard that a lot here but now this
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:41.240]  is in big mainline publications and a video and audio we're gonna play TSA's
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.200]  back at it groping your two-year-old babies and at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:51.640]  after we take some phone calls Brian's singer sex abuse accuser names three
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.200]  more Hollywood bigwigs in lawsuit John Bown Fowler report called triple X X
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.600]  men for the nightly news last night I want to air that here and give you my
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:06.880]  take on this situation and again some of the big hollywood people that have gone
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.320]  public saying this have contacted our office three years ago two years ago but
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:17.320]  they didn't have proof and I'm not gonna break allegations if there's not proof
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.880]  the police though won't do their job that's coming out the FBI and others so
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.440]  that's why it's hard to vet all this but when you find out that these guys are
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.960]  friends with admitted convicted pedophiles it starts looking real bad
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:40.320]  starts looking real bad and you know I've been at big Hollywood parties and
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  things that's why I don't know I've been out there in years and I won't go out
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.760]  there probably ever unless I've got to be in some big you know TV show or
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.560]  something I think's worthwhile but I mean big parties and so he's like that
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.920]  guy's a total creep and like what do you mean just oh man he's you know and that
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.240]  guy that guy likes kids and that guy likes kids and I'm like I don't want to
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.360]  hear this I don't want to hear this and that's why I won't get anywhere near
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:08.640]  there folks and it's it's it's it's sick and then you look at all the British
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.320]  ministers getting caught there's a reason all this is coming out now though
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:18.120]  folks I believe not the people bringing it out I think they're good but the
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.240]  reason it's being brought out right now is to blackmail and keep Hollywood on a
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.440]  short leash that's why they get these people to compromise themselves Bohemian
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:31.760]  Grove you name it and the Jimmy Savelle in England you know David Ike was naming
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.000]  names ten years ago on my show and I said do not name names because even though
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.400]  the guy looked like the archetype of a pedophile the archetype of a disgusting
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.960]  degenerate you know David Ike was saying they were bringing kids into the
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.400]  prime minister's office to slit their throats and then now it's all coming out
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.200]  so I'm gonna cover that at the bottom of the hour and then we'll continue with
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.920]  your calls the toll-free number to join us on the issue of Russia I want to hear
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.840]  from military former military current military or Ukrainians Poles Germans

[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.740]  in living Ukraine now that the Russian Foreign Minister saying if you attack
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.240]  any Russian held cities that we say are ours in each in Ukraine we're gonna
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.120]  respond military action in Europe just like we did in South Ossetia they rolled
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.880]  mobile ICBMs in and he went on television with the chairman of their
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.800]  joint chiefs and said we're gonna start targeting NATO bases with nukes in one
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.840]  hour pull back and NATO pull back I mean this is crazy and I'm not on the Russian
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.720]  side I'm not on the George Soros side I'm nothing against the Western
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.720]  Ukrainians that have big beasts with Russia or the Russian Ukrainians who
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.680]  have big beasts with the Western groups I'm not in the middle of this tribal
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:52.280]  warfare I don't have any Ukrainian blood in me I'd be happy to they're really
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.520]  good-looking people the point is is that I just look at it objectively and
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.440]  geopolitically and say is it a good idea to stir up this hornet's nest and who
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.680]  stands to gain who's at the middle of it George frickin Soros again the same guy
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.320]  who wants my guns the same guy funding media matters that wants to shut down my
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:21.960]  free speech the same guy who was a Nazi collaborator so he gets ADL awards I mean
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.280]  I'm sick of the ADL I'm sick of George Soros I'm sick of
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.960]  authoritarian's masquerading as as the humanitarian's the Southern probably

[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.760]  I played a compilation of some of the clips the 15 minutes I want to play
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.320]  five minutes of the intro of the demonization of liberty movement on
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.280]  MSNBC where they call us insurgents terrorists you name it demonize
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.160]  there's even a press because remember we now have all these Clinton documents
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.120]  were in 93 they were trying to shut down the Western Journalism Center and
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.200]  media bypass they are authoritarians they said we can't have Americans having
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.320]  alternative information now is that liberal no it's authoritarian and some
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:07.200]  of the best people in this country are liberals who really mean well just like
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.640]  some of the best people in this country are conservatives who mean well and
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:14.400]  you're led by two evil parties it's time to support the Bill of Rights not a
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.640]  party name let's go to the first five minutes of the report because it's some
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.840]  of the most incendiary rhetoric ever out of the White House run MSNBC good
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.200]  evening from New York I'm Chris Hayes the standoff between Nevada rancher
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.160]  Clive and Bundy and the federal government is not over yet Bundy still
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.320]  refuses to pay the million dollar you ran everybody out of business with those
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.240]  fees the federal government and now after an aborted attempt by the Bureau of
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.120]  National Judge ruled it was designed to bankrupt everyone Bundy tells conspiracy
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.880]  theorist and radio host Alex Jones anyone that questions them looking for a
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:52.760]  civil war is a conspiracy theorist quote not in a negotiating mood we're not
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.800]  doing them negotiate with big we're not gonna negotiate with BLM we're only
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.800]  going to back up and strengthen our county sheriff and hope he does his
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.160]  job keep in mind the county sheriff's job according to Clive and Bundy involves
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:10.320]  disarming federal agent they never let feds in before 20 years ago with Nevada
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.800]  State Assemblywoman Michelle Fiori who was attending a celebratory barbecue near
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.360]  the Bundy Ranch and who came on this show to express her solidarity with the
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.800]  Clive and Bundy family and his armed supporters do you recognize the authority
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:29.840]  of the federal government oh I recognize the authority that they they
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.000]  believe that they have I just question it don't come here with guns and expect
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.120]  the American people not to fire back well might not surprise you to hear that
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.840]  that was talk from an event it's not fair we come in taser people and point guns
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.520]  and say we're gonna kill them and beat people up and put them in free speech
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.520]  pens for no reason and act like goons in North Korea and they're saying they
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.920]  might stand up against us that's not right we're supposed to be able to do
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.120]  like we did in Russia and just walk around kicking everybody's brains out
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.220]  while they sit in the fetal position this isn't fair why I was trained by the
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:08.360]  CIA like Rachel Maddow and and Anderson Cooper to run game on the slaves but
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.440]  they're not listening to me I'm a chicken-necked little coward that's why I
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.400]  joined the CIA he says let's go back to him
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.440]  out of state legislator you probably never heard of until Friday night it's
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.240]  something of a game changer when Nevada Republican United States senator starts
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.920]  chiming in that's right what senator read me called this domestic terrorists I
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:34.120]  call patriots Nevada's Republican senator Dean Heller believes the Bundy
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.640]  ranch supporters are patriots he's talking about the hundreds of militia
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.680]  members and states rights activists who stood with Nevada rancher Clive and
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:47.520]  Bundy and against the federal government Heller says these men and women are
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.960]  patriots so does the website info wars a paranoid online haven run by Alex Jones
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.160]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist whose stories often make their
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.600]  way from his website info wars where on any day you can find headlines about
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.360]  vaccines mass fluoridation and the 9-11 cover-up into the so-called mainstream
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.200]  GOP establishment Alex Jones was a champion of Clive and Bundy from the
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.600]  very beginning because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to to not be you know
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.160]  have his grazing rights stolen notice they're playing cuckoo bar music the story and
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:29.800]  it made its way onto Fox News's airways next thing you know so-called mainstream
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:35.120]  Republicans are calling people like this patriots what senator read me called
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.640]  this domestic terrorists I call patriots but the Alex Jonesification of the GOP
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.520]  is much bigger than the Bundy ranch take Greg Brannett tea party Republican
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:49.720]  candidate that's enough in North Carolina look look the whole thing's up on info wars calm
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:55.040]  we're sick of being pushed around we're sick of being treated like slaves we
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:02.320]  don't want to live in North Korea we do not want to live in Uganda I mean that's
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.480]  what all this looks like you ran everybody off federal judge Jones ruled
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.200]  last year the BLM's own goal and this has come out in their memos is to destroy
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.520]  all the ranchers they want everyone off the property and then they've got Rory

[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.840]  generally of your colleagues in the armed services sir oh I'd rather not
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.080]  speak on the behalf of that but I will say I've never seen such a complete
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.520]  utter brainwashing take place in my lifetime it every other person I see is
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:15.320]  not capable of profound or abstract thinking and it's just frightening to
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.480]  see what's taking place you know that the First Amendment the right to do
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.320]  process the right to search and seizure every US Constitution amendment is being
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.960]  stripped right before our eyes and what is it going to take the wake people up
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.360]  well that's the issue we had some wonderful government that was doing
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.040]  good and protecting our rights and they said Russia was bad I'd be apt to
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.200]  believe them but the government just lies on every front it's illegitimate
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.400]  and now let's get ready to start war with Russia not a good idea and I've got
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.600]  friends that are like Alex I like your show but Putin's bad and he's he we got
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.160]  to do something about him and it's like this primitive thing that we got to have
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.680]  a war we got to have a war and I guess they think it's gonna be like blowing up
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.680]  Iraq or something then it'll be something you eat pizza and you know
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.440]  watch on television that's not that's not gonna be the case we get into war
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:08.360]  with Russia and and we're bankrupt go ahead what's your take on the Russia
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:15.400]  situation well it's very profound I've been in Ukraine and I've traveled there
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.480]  but to the extent I'm not an expert matter to elaborate on that I will say
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:26.600]  that Eastern Ukraine is very pro-Russia and then of course Western Ukraine's
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.400]  like play contrary but I haven't been in the region in about a year and a half
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.040]  so I hear you and I appreciate your call interesting points about folks being
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.480]  brainwashed Dallas in Oklahoma is calling wants to talk about the armed

[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:53.040]  that well Alex I just first would like to thank you for your efforts we
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:58.720]  appreciate it here in Oklahoma and I hope everywhere else your voice for us
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:05.520]  for the people and it's it's people are waking up I see it around me I see it in
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.320]  my own family and it gives me great hope for things to come this thing in Russia
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:14.160]  that we're speaking about is that was first started by us like most things
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:21.000]  are back in 1964 I fought for my country back in Vietnam and you know learned a
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.080]  lot of things there and absence and it follows all the things that have happened
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.280]  the Oklahoma City bombing and everything in between and got the facts and not the
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:38.720]  relies but I guess the main thing I wanted to call about this to thank you
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:44.240]  for for keep putting this out there for people because it's so important what
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.800]  you do is so important and thank you for it and there are people like me out
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:54.360]  here listening daily and we subscribe to your products and we try to help as we
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.480]  can we're just simple people who do the best we can and try to help as we can
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:05.480]  but but the government still knows I think that we're out there and when
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.120]  this when this when this thing comes down we'll be there one thing I would
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:15.120]  like to ask you Alex about is that I feel it's coming I'm afraid I hope not
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:21.840]  and I pray daily because the Lord's only can save this country but I would like
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:27.120]  to know if there's some way that you and John McAfee somebody like that could
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:30.400]  get some way where when they do cut this thing off to where we can still get
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:36.000]  hold of you where we can still stay in touch with each other well we've talked
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.920]  a lot about alternative communications I'm on WWCR global shortwave we could
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.720]  do a phone line to them I've already covered every angle of what the
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.320]  globalists are up to people should archive on hard drives everything we
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.960]  have they should have CD burner backups if the globalist stage a false flag and
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.600]  shut the internet off people don't need to wait they need to all do print-ups
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.320]  pointing out that it's a staged event pointing out that giving up our
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.840]  liberty isn't the answer and post them like the French resistance everywhere
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:10.240]  and just resist the enemy the literal collaborator foreign banking cartel
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.240]  takeover they want us to be distracted by the Russians and people while the
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.760]  globalists have done everything they can to shut this country down but you're
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.240]  absolutely right they know we're beating them peacefully politically and there
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.120]  is a huge awakening happening they're not going to let that happen they're
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.400]  gonna stage stuff pain us as the terrorist that's why I'm very glad that
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:35.960]  the shooting order didn't start in the Monday situation but at the same time
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.160]  we were clearly in the right there so if it's going to start let it start
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:45.840]  somewhere real and not some stage deal like an Oklahoma City part two God
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.040]  bless you sir appreciate your call but I don't deserve the credit we're just

[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.200]  at 40 after and I'm going to dovetail it with some of the surrounding
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:10.200]  corollary news reports dealing with the pedophile rings and the people getting

[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.760]  u.s. troops begin massing in areas all around the Russian controlled areas of

[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:46.240]  videos up on info wars dot com he said in English if a tax continue on Russian
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.480]  held areas Russia will respond militarily as we did in South Ossetia and
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.320]  that will be a full invasion and then rolling ICBMs on mobile launchers in and
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:00.960]  there he said we'll respond as we did in South Ossetia they responded there by
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.680]  rolling the missiles in and saying we are targeting NATO bases with thermal
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:11.240]  nuclear weapons so it's a horrible situation I just don't want to see it
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:18.080]  happen it's like getting too tough guys you know out in the street ready to kill

[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.720]  geared up and dressed up like the army ready for war with us so the globalists
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.280]  can sit back and watch this tear the country apart only way they're gonna
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.520]  have this socialist conversion to the country do we have to do this let's go
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:49.520]  to your phone calls Woody in Washington retired police and military family
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:55.440]  your take on this hi hi Alex well I have three different angles that I'm
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:00.520]  looking at this the first angle is historical fact we've had two world
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:06.800]  wars in each war the the seeds were laid before the wars broke out and I
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:12.120]  particularly have to say I have to say you're you're having Joe Scalcin on your
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:15.920]  show several times and listening to what he talked about on how the world war
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:22.080]  three scenario would unfold is pretty accurate and I think if you take a
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.600]  historical perspective now I'm old enough to remember what the Cuban missile
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.880]  crisis was like I was seven years old and I remember everybody talking about
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.760]  we're all gonna die the Russians are gonna bomb us and and nuclear bombs are
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:40.120]  gonna destroy cities and everything and imagine if we had who we have now
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.840]  president instead of John F Kennedy what do you think would have happened well
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:49.240]  he blocked the joint chiefs has been declassified fired LL Lemnitzer called
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.560]  the Russians and said look there's about to be a military coup if you don't back
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.400]  off they're going to nuke you will pull our secret nukes out of Turkey back off
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.400]  now and the Russians didn't want nuclear war as evil as their government was they
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.920]  backed off the CIA called it treason and blue Kennedy's head off pretty well
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.360]  sums it up so we need to be mustering the same type of willpower that we did
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.600]  to stop the Syria situation from going to a shooting war we need to be doing
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.120]  that right now we all need to be pulling our our phones out of our back pockets
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.400]  and calling up our senators and our congressmen and demanding that we not
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.480]  be escalating the situation that we get out of the Ukraine like Ron Paul said I
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:32.600]  agree and the Russians need to show major restraint as well overall they've
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:39.280]  been showing it and now the CIA is launching these paramilitary attacks on
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.600]  Russian-controlled police stations and things just look at it to South Ossetia
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.800]  and Lavrov came out today and said basically if that continues we're
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.720]  going to attack you so it's just total insanity and I appreciate your call
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.520]  great points Diane in Texas you're on the air a reporter whistleblower on
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:02.880]  military and Ukraine you say go ahead Diane hi Alex what I have to report on
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:08.360]  is I've been trying to get ahold of you since I literally had to flee out of
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:16.720]  Las Vegas for my life because I was all set to expose them on live TV the city
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:24.040]  council and their and their part in supplanting these unmarked military
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.440]  bases that are up there in Las Vegas my issue is if somebody threatened me I
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.360]  would just lock and load I've been threatened thousands of times no
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:35.160]  exaggeration hundreds of real threats why did you leave Las Vegas with someone
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:41.400]  threatened you they had six cars that were like federal they had federal
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.880]  numbers on the front no license plate and I've been threatened by the feds
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.720]  well I'm I was disguised myself to see if they were going to the if they had
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.240]  well I tell you what you should do you should write this up in an email I said
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.000]  at the show tips at info wars.com with the proof of the bases or whatever you've
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.160]  got and my reporters will look at it and they think there's anything there they
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.320]  will call you back but you know there's so many federal cars and everything
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.560]  nowadays or you know could be meter maids or something I'm not seeing your
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.080]  paranoid but you know you were about to expose all this stuff and you think
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:17.800]  people are coming after you the wicked flea when done pursue and so many
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:21.360]  activists won't get involved because they're so scared to death we out
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.320]  number the bad guys most feds are not evil people they have corrupt units and
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:31.160]  things but my god they haven't taken me out yet they I'm only they're gonna take
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.400]  you out for exposing corruption so what we need is to have courage look look
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.400]  but talk about taking people out on the cover right now I appreciate your call
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:45.160]  Diane now I want to get into a report that John
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.360]  mown filed for the info wars nightly news there's weeknights seven o'clock
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.400]  central eight o'clock Eastern five o'clock Pacific six o'clock mountain
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.680]  or Montana time I want to get into this and I want people to understand that
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.920]  before I air his three-minute report I want to just give you a small smattering
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:12.400]  off the top of my head during a segment earlier during a break just to back up
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.160]  the rest of the story in about two minutes I told them to pull these
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.840]  articles this is what I pulled in two minutes off the top my head just to add
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.880]  some other pieces here so we're not talking about this in a vacuum the
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.960]  number one thing that cements the globalist together when you get to the
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:39.840]  bottom line is pedophilia I have seen no exaggeration in nineteen years on
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.280]  air thousands of news articles out of the sunday times of London and
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:54.120]  lefiguero of France and or Spiegel where there'll be huge riots in different
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.600]  European countries sometimes two million people on the streets and in places
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.640]  like Denmark you look at the famous cases where they'll find little kids in
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.680]  dungeons a bunch of them dead some of them alive run by the national judges and
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.040]  the national police chief with snuff films and the washington times exposed
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.760]  the finders case run by the CIA in DC with satellite uplinks and all the snuff
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.800]  films and dead little kids and the FBI came in and shut that down first the
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.520]  FBI exposed it because they caught a van full of kids being transported to
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.040]  Florida the FBI raided it and the CIA came in with the FBI higher levels and
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:33.480]  shut it down I mean this was in the washington times I interviewed the FBI
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.880]  agents involved folks that were in there they said it was just unbelievable and
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.280]  then they were under national security block from releasing all they could talk
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:49.440]  about is what was first in the news so so when I see a story about pedophilia in
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:56.280]  Hollywood dealing with 10 12 14 year old boys that's bad that's terrible that's
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.400]  horrible on the casting couch and that's why I want to allow my children to be
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.640]  involved in acting or show business it's a just a horribly nasty evil culture on
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:17.320]  average but when we start talking about all this breaking with Brian's singer
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.800]  accuser names three more Hollywood insiders and new sex abuse case you
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.760]  know the former head of Disney the list goes on and on we're about to go over
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.680]  all that in a moment name names of who's alleged to be a pedophile and who's
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.560]  been admitted to be a pedophile the thing is these guys associate with known
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.120]  pedophiles and you look at Jimmy Savelle and the rest of them and all the
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.360]  deaths surrounding him and the royal family I'm gonna cover some of that and
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.680]  then they get the John Bounds article the point is it's not just children I
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:53.800]  remember in 2008 an article on the Sunday Times of London about Burgundy
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:01.360]  France and a national park castle was a Rothschild former castle where women
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.840]  escaped from a dungeon who looked like concentration camp victims went to the
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:08.920]  local regional police office they raided it found all the dead women other
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.960]  women in cages at the castle people ought to look this up I'm just telling you
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.160]  just a few of the hundreds of cases of literally thousands of articles and then
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:24.880]  it got declared national security and shut down I mean when you see movies like
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:32.000]  hostile and all this that's what the globalists are really doing folks they've
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.600]  got trillions of dollars stolen they were into evil and psychopathic and have
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:41.040]  no qualms about killing a million plus Iraqis just to get their oil and for
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.680]  weapon sales or destroying Libya for al-qaeda or destroying Syria and de
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.520]  destabilizing the whole country they it's not they don't have qualms they
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:59.600]  enjoy it so you have to understand the entire system is filled with scum and
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:05.320]  it runs from yes men and people that just serve authority who are stupid to
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:11.720]  mercenaries control freaks sickos sadist right up to the top pedophiles
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:17.480]  psychopaths mass murderer types until you reach the very top and they are
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:22.760]  absolute worshipers of total death and destruction nihilists who want planetary
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:27.920]  extinction when you read their poetry and writings but the very top is just
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.720]  like the entity from the fifth element that just you know is working through
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:41.440]  Zorg and and just wants to come destroy the earth I mean basically that movies
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:51.320]  telling you something and all you Zorg wannabes need to understand what you're
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:56.440]  opening the gates to will destroy everything if it has its way now I
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.520]  understand I'll be clear I always feel like I'm not doing something justice
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:04.880]  because to come on the air and say pedophile rings run the planet sounds
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:08.000]  pretty wild but you notice it just keeps continuing to come out and they
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.560]  infiltrate every institution the Catholic Church Penn State of course it
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.520]  turns out a bunch of the faculty was involved in a cover-up you don't think
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:23.240]  Sandusky was raping little kids in there in broad daylight at noon on a
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.080]  Saturday and it wasn't authorized Sandusky through his charity was
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.120]  supplying small children who were troubled so they could deny they had
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.280]  problems to the elite you notice a bunch of Homeland Security people are
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.200]  involved you notice they keep getting busted with little kids and they'll burn
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:45.120]  a few just to scare their own people or they'll burn innocent people occasionally
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.200]  this is how they operate most the Pentagon's had child porn loaded on its
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.920]  computers and they tell people just do what you're told you won't get in
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.280]  trouble but I didn't look at the porn doesn't matter we could jail you if you
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:02.800]  don't do what you are told I was told 15 years ago by former CIA commander and
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:09.800]  former senator John DeCamp that Penn State and the Boys Town was a pedophile
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:16.200]  ring it later all came out let's get senator John DeCamp back on who exposed
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:21.200]  the Franklin cover-up my point is is that I'm an expert on this and I can
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.120]  tell you Dinecore runs child kidnapping worldwide it's come out in Congress and I
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.240]  was death-threatened when I was first breaking this eight years ago very
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.240]  serious death threats they were giving me stuff on the phone and in parking lots
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:36.160]  threatening me that they would only know if I was under surveillance they said
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.920]  we're gonna kill you if you don't shut up well I doubled down
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:49.280]  Dinecore is the biggest CPS contractors in the country they run most of CPS in
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:55.520]  Texas private contractors that's the fact look it up so let me just show you a
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.280]  snapshot of what I had them print during a three-minute break earlier in the
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.840]  hour I threw off some names said pull it up they pulled up what I said this is
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:08.160]  just a small smattering we're gonna skip the network break it's too important
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:14.200]  Stuart Hall's sentence for sex attacks on girls is doubled to 30 months court of
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.720]  appeals rules former BBC broadcasters original 15 month jail term was
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:27.520]  inadequate reportedly raping hundreds of girls named by David Ike who worked at
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:34.600]  the BBC more than a decade ago let's continue experts pedophiles in Hollywood
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:38.800]  even bigger problem than in Corey Feldman's day Corey Feldman's gone
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:45.160]  public his friend was reportedly killed we've been contacted by Corey Feldman
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:49.760]  before his book even came out and we talked to him and I just said look bring
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:53.440]  your book out then I might have you on and it's just because I'm not doubting
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:59.800]  you it's just that I've got huge issues to cover and I can't get destroyed for
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.040]  something that I can't prove well now he's come out nobody sued him over it so
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.920]  we're ready to have Feldman on that contact and we contacted us two years
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:11.640]  ago let's get him on who wants to come on Peaches Geldorf faces police
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:18.800]  investigation after naming moms who allegedly offered babies for pedophile

[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:46.120]  three more Hollywood bigwigs in lawsuits you look at the players you look at
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.160]  their whole history yeah I look at this guy's testimony I believe he's telling
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.120]  the truth but I can't prove that it's still alleged except for some of the
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:58.680]  people connected are convicted pedos you take one look at them they got that
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:09.640]  look in their eye now before I get into that look at this right here you've got
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:13.640]  celebrity arrest could soar after horrified police discovered Jimmy
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:21.000]  Sevelle's secret lair at record shop a secret dungeon behind a fake wall then

[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:42.800]  uncovered see all the deaths I can keep going I could keep going see here's the
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.880]  problem of covering any issue people think oh that's just your opinion
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.840]  pedophile rings run things they've continued to find dead babies of children
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:56.480]  dead babies and children in and around Sonoma County that bohemian grove you
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:02.520]  know I was there two years ago with the history channel and Metzler's decoder I
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.280]  think it's called I was on a couple episodes I only watch one of them I'm
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.280]  on a whole bunch of those shows don't watch hardly any of them and we're in
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:15.600]  enough theater during the day and they've got the plastic original alien one
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:23.760]  of five from the movie Alien 1977 or whatever 78 and then that's in there and
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:26.720]  the place is really dark as a horrible vibe and the people that are working
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.160]  there go we're lawyers for the locals and we know who you are and I'm in there
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.960]  you know with the grove leadership and I think you're the problem and I told them
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:39.800]  I said we're supposed to infiltrate today they already know everything they're
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.480]  gonna come after us I said you're in a major nest here I go look at all the
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.880]  satanic stuff in here I go look at how they're looking at me they are mad you're
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.440]  in here interviewing me we weren't even talking about how we're about to
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:56.720]  infiltrate and the director was wearing a CIA hat and messing with me the whole
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.560]  time and and and then we go down the river to infiltrate and they were
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.960]  waiting for us when we got there and they all got arrested and I said I'm not
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:07.720]  going to jail I jumped in the river got out of the kayak swam underneath when the
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.200]  police cars were on the other side holding my cell phone up the whole
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.840]  time so I could call Aaron Dykes to come pick me up on the side of the highway
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:19.800]  so you know I got away I didn't know you're stinking jail anyways long story
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:22.520]  short then they made them basically whitewash the whole piece so they
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:25.760]  wouldn't charge them with trespassing and I think that was all staged we were
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:32.520]  led right into it the point is is that sounds crazy what I was describing it
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:39.320]  was really dark place man and most the town is operating for them they're in
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:49.720]  they're in Sonoma they're in they're on the Russian River and it's the same
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:55.400]  deal and little kids get found dead all all the time around there some famous
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:01.120]  cases with Paula Claus and others and then you get the reports out of the
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:08.720]  Franklin cover up of the snuff films it's just I just can't handle it and you
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:16.160]  need to understand folks we're dealing with pure evil here and basically when
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:24.160]  you're in the town right outside the Bohemian Grove there in Monterio it's
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:30.160]  like you're in the little town below Dracula's Castle but they've all been
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.360]  bitten or most of them have I mean I had a fire department this is on video in
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:41.000]  an expanded Bohemian Grove order of death we put out you get the DVD at
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.080]  m4wars.com it has both the original film the new one on it and you see the fire
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.920]  department they find out who we are they bow up and it's the same deal I mean
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:55.120]  you're in a restaurant they go you're Alex Jones they go we don't like you
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.800]  we're not serving you get out of here and we're like our cameras in the car and
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.360]  I should have just confronted them I mean it you go to that town they work
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:07.160]  for the castle up on the hill and they know it and nobody wants to talk about
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:10.920]  the dead kids nobody wants to talk about the satanic rituals nobody wants to
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.400]  talk about it and then people make jokes about it and go oh there's nothing
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:17.880]  going on there well yeah during the two weeks that it officially goes on most of
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.640]  people there aren't devil worshipers or pedophiles but they get all the actors
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:27.280]  and directors and the people they're into to come there and they ship in male
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:32.120]  prostitutes and top gay porn stars that's in the news watch my films and
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:37.280]  they they do you'll have gay sex there and that's just the intro into it though
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:44.000]  and then they break off go to other camps in the area and so that's the
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.560]  gateway into this whole situation and anybody that tries to expose it ends up
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:58.520]  dead and this is how this pedophile cult of devil worshipers they're not just
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.880]  pedophiles they're usually devil worshipers it's come out Savelle was at
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:10.440]  others with secret dungeons and they think this country is theirs and not all
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.800]  the CPS most social workers are actually good people I've run into the people that
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:17.160]  help old folks and others are social workers that help teenagers usually pretty
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:21.320]  nice but statistically in criminology handbooks will admit this if you take
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:25.440]  criminology people that try to work around kids have the highest instance of
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:32.200]  being pedos because they're then in the system and know how to cover it up
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:38.160]  truancy officer CPS you name it these are the people statistically the ones
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:42.080]  that are in control of the kids you got to watch now let's go to John Bounds

[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:40.280]  make about the global pedophile Luciferian devil rings running the
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:45.560]  planet is that top psychologist have said this you can pull up the news
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:50.480]  articles that the TSA grouping of children is pedophile training and
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.360]  should be illegal it is illegal say the Texas tried to enforce the law the fed
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.680]  threatened to blockade the state and that's why this new video up on drugs
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:05.000]  report dot-com from info wars dot-com is so important TSA agents pat down two
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.040]  and six year old children and it's continuing even though they said they
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:14.120]  stopped so there you go they kind of backed off for a while they're back and
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:18.600]  I'm not saying the TSA people that do it are all pedophiles I'm saying the
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.200]  practice is a joke and a fraud when the government runs al-qaeda here's the
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.640]  Daily Mail article Benghazi attack could have been prevented if US hadn't
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:31.320]  switched sides in the war on terror and allowed 500 million of weapons to reach
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:35.400]  al-qaeda militants the government arms al-qaeda but says your two-year-old
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:40.360]  diaper has to be checked this is about training you that you're a prisoner
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:45.240]  period and it's run and it's a directive that comes from the pedo run
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:50.800]  federal government this country's in deep trouble this world's in deep trouble
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.080]  but it's so horrifying and so evil people come face to face with it and we
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:01.120]  can't admit it let's talk to Bob in Michigan Bob you're on the air thanks
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.240]  for holding retired military wants to give us your take on Ukraine thank you
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:11.480]  for calling a Ukraine is a is a big incident certainly but as the has you
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:16.480]  brought up many times they do one thing and distract you from something else that
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:22.240]  I I swore that oath to the Constitution and they're looking and I would really
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:27.800]  like all the all the shows especially shortwave and everything to watch
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.520]  constantly the assault on the Constitution they are looking they have
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.920]  the number of states on board right now for a constitutional convention which
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.800]  would put the entire Constitution up for revision and you've got the former
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:45.480]  Supreme Court justice last week saying time to get rid of it it's outdated but
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  what part is outdated the first amendment free speech what the right of
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:53.920]  privacy the fourth states rights I mean what's so bad in this Constitution that
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:57.040]  they're pushing a concon and I get conservatives or libertarians using a
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:00.560]  concon to try to reverse a bunch of bad stuff but we already have the
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.440]  Constitution to block it we're just not enforcing it I just want to keep this
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.280]  in front of a front of your listeners that are very well educated and alert do
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.800]  not let this proceed because what's going to happen is we're gonna all these
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.240]  things that the Bundy's are using the states rights the 10th amendment the
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:23.480]  second amendment all the really important things here they're all
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:28.120]  important that's my point and you're gonna get a bunch of flaky people out
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:32.760]  there they're gonna start telling you that this Constitution is you know a
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:37.960]  living document no it's carved in stone just like the scriptures that's where it
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.280]  is for me and and I just I don't I just want to put that out there and let
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.560]  everybody hear this one more time because with all these things distracting
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:55.000]  us let's not let the prize the gem that we have be be compromised in any way
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.280]  sure you're paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson let no one approach the precious
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:01.400]  jewel of liberty our Constitution Bill of Rights thank you so much for the
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.120]  call great points Bob we're gonna break them back with Bob Xander Kathleen and
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:09.320]  Bob I pushed our guests back six seven eight minutes so I can try to take more
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.640]  your calls then we'll continue with your calls I don't get to you but the
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.000]  Constitution is biblical the Bill of Rights is biblical not because it's
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  biblical but because it's based on biblical ideas and the Ninth Amendment
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.160]  points out that the rights come from the people the people are the boss and the
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:33.080]  government cannot do anything to invent a tyranny upon the people it's a
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:37.400]  restatement of the Declaration of Independence and so yes the Tenth and
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:42.560]  Ninth Amendment point out that it's prima facia rights from the people the

[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:12.920]  published in the Daily Mail on our own government openly arming al-Qaeda that is
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:18.520]  all coming up with our guest also there's a story up on CNBC it's in the

[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.920]  titled the growing perils of a cashless future CNBC tells you oh it's so
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:31.920]  horrible it allows all your data to be stolen that's the point keep using cash

[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.440]  they can tax and control it so that's coming up I want to run through your
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:58.400]  calls real quick right now before we go to our guest Bob worked in defense wants
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:03.600]  to talk about Ukraine and that escalation what's your take on it well
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.080]  first of all I've worked in fence for many years and you know I've been with
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:13.280]  military generals and presidents current and retired and what you say here it's
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:20.320]  fairly simple contracts very very simple if you look at the situation here if
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:26.560]  you go back to your agenda 21 to depopulation program this is all part
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:31.680]  of depopulation first of all number one these wars are scripted okay before all
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.120]  these wars broke out both president Putin and president Obama met in a room
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.920]  and they're shaking hands hugging kissing literally before this happened
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:44.240]  it's a big roost US made an agreement for NATO forces of special forces from
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:49.120]  America the destabilized region by shooting people and then have you have
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:52.680]  us going as a bad cop and then the good cop comes in the rushes come in the same
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:57.760]  the day we made deals with through our I agree with you that that's been done in
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.400]  the past and that then like the secret deal between Hitler and Stalin to divide
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.600]  Poland which is now on record and was on record after World War two that
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  happened and that is the pattern of history but what do you say about Georgia
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:16.560]  then what do you say about the attempts by NATO to destabilize Russia itself and
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.800]  overthrow Putin well yeah they're there at the very beginning what we had we had
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:27.680]  cold wars and a medium-hot wars and for just certain we're playing games of
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:31.720]  technological on moving the thing is there's this code name called coded death
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.560]  I mean that coded death is called game of death where in fact Russia we're
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:39.840]  monitoring Russia and their secret moving of the atomic weapons basically
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:45.520]  it's a chessboard they're using these pines as they call them moving atomic
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:50.680]  weapons in other countries basically I like you know it can we say the country
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:53.800]  but the country that we've been invading sure you're talking about secret
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:12:01.040]  secret caches of weapons to be used by sleeper cells that too and basically it's
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.080]  used for we can in our national defense structure we have is we have a countdown
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:10.600]  timer as defense the retaliation retellatory offenses it's it's called
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.920]  secondary second timing it's Russia's thing Russia has us on our clock is they
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:22.760]  have us on 15 the 13 minutes and hit us and then we have a you know we beat
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:27.040]  them by minute okay Russia's been secretly placing atomic weapons hidden in
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.520]  other countries to hit us first and be able to get a strike first that's what
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.200]  Georgia was about they were moving into clear weapons in certain areas that
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.200]  threatened us like we had nuclear weapons we have weapons in Israel and all
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:42.160]  over places so it's basically moving atomic weapons in to see who could
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:45.840]  strike you first to keep people in check but what's going on right now is
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:50.120]  agreement between US government and the Russian government in order to destabilize
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:53.880]  these certain regions to keep this game that shut down this game that's been
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:57.040]  going on for a long time well you should write an article about it under a
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.720]  numb to bloom send it to us we'll look into it that all sounds accurate is one
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.280]  level where they have fake diplomacy and then kind of wink wink will allow this
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.520]  deal that's what Saddam Hussein was told on video by US Ambassador April Gillespie
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:13.840]  he'd been told wink wink attack this country wink wink attack Iran he was
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:18.640]  told okay you owe us 35 billion stop over pumping you know and lower in the
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.040]  price of oil will let you take Kuwait and he said I'm gonna invade then and
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.840]  she goes we will not get involved in her Arab affairs he smiled said thank you
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:31.000]  and invaded Kuwait two weeks later I mean he worked for the CIA they set him
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.360]  up so the problem is they could be telling Russia that and telling Iran
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.840]  that because I know there's double dealing going on like Iran Contra
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.640]  you're absolutely right it's just at the end of the day it's not for the
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.160]  American people's interest it's dangerous it will bankrupt us and I'm
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:51.280]  against it do you agree with that Bob or think that statement's incorrect yeah the
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.080]  thing is you know there there's a group and it is trying to actually globally
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:01.360]  crush the global economy right now and it's sort of ironic that last year to
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.080]  the data was on your son April 26th of second of last year and I stated that
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.840]  the events that we're going to take place I said each president has their own
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.960]  paperwork that's hanging to him with what they're supposed to do and they're
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:18.000]  basically supposed to shut down our you know shut down petroleum that shut down
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.240]  the power grid and then I said I said on your show before this happened I said
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:25.360]  they're gonna tack the farce and then we're gonna fight back and what happened
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:29.520]  in Nevada there well no I mean I mean that's agenda 21 and that's the
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  rural affairs Commission at the Pentagon's over in Northcom run by Obama the
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:37.360]  executive order he signed last year is to shut down the farms and ranches in
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:40.720]  America to make us dependent and they're doing it and the and they're
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.880]  getting savage in their attacks the American people have to realize this is
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:49.280]  not our government this is a foreign corporate occupational system I appreciate

[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:38.640]  rice for Canadian free press info wars.com you name it so Mr. Hagman and
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:42.520]  Mr. Hagman good to have you both on what do you want to tackle first I want to
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.120]  get into Russia I want to get into the latest info you've got on the public
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:51.000]  rollout declaring that gun owners and conservatives libertarians are the new
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.960]  mission that's now official and I want to get into the this new report put out
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:16:01.120]  by more than 50 former CIA and other folks saying that indeed Benghazi was a
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:05.920]  weapons transfer to Al Qaeda and that our government's quote switch sides to
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:10.960]  fully work with Al Qaeda publicly I'm now seeing articles and CNN AP about how
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:14.920]  good Al Qaeda is and we should have been in nice to them all along and they're
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.720]  really gonna help us and they're good guys now I mean this is how dumb the
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:23.440]  globalist think we are so guys good to have you on with us Alex thanks so much
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:27.120]  for inviting us back or inviting me back and of course as my son Joe we work
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:32.040]  together thanks for having us but Benghazi I think is the key issue here
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:36.880]  because it does relate to Russia we've got a lot of information on that yeah
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.600]  my father here has been on top of the Benghazi situation since this happened
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:47.920]  on September 11 2012 and has been calling it for what it was you know a gun
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:52.320]  running operation to help Al Qaeda fighters the US backing Al Qaeda and
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.440]  now they've you know come out and done so and why are you on America I mean isn't
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:59.960]  fighting for Al Qaeda the American way now wouldn't John Wayne support them yeah
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:06.280]  yeah exactly you know it seems that way Alex we if I remember correctly right
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:11.920]  after I issued my initial report about Benghazi appear on your show you invite
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:15.920]  me on your show we talked about this very issue everything that that we talked
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:22.640]  about in your show back in I don't know late 2012 has come out in this in this
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:27.600]  investigative report the fact that this seditious treasonous activity the fact
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.640]  that we bankrolled the weapons we bankrolled over a half a billion dollars
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:40.480]  of weapons and and and also leverage those weapons to really a billion maybe
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:46.480]  even five or ten billion and that went to Syria to fight in Syria Alex this is
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:52.360]  the most seditious seditious and treasonous criminal act violation of
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.040]  interval and there's a lot of people have really got to understand that the
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:04.320]  the depth of this this not scandal but crime well for me this kind of stuff's
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:08.000]  gone for a long time behind the scenes now they don't even care and do it
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.800]  nakedly why are they so arrogant well because no one's questioning them and
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:18.160]  Jo and I talked about this all the time on our show no one is questioning this
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:22.960]  the media is compromised I mean who in the media aside from you and the new
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.040]  media the alternative media has even questioned only UK news and drugs is
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.760]  linked to it right now that's it exactly exactly they've listed the
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:34.920]  alternative media as a the Department of Homeland Security in their 2009
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:39.200]  extremist lexicon listed the alternative media as a possible domestic
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.240]  extremist anything that differs from the mainstream media that's promoted in
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.800]  the major six networks that's right we're gonna go to break her own but I
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:51.280]  want to come back and I guess get into this report first then I want to get
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:56.560]  your take on Ukraine I want to get your take on the open rollout I mean what's
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:00.720]  it like both fragments briefly to see everything we've talked about now just
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.520]  open just this mainline oh it's incredible we talked about this all the
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.280]  time I mean it's like living in the probably the house you called it long
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.240]  ago others go long ago it's not surprising to me because I've been
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:18.480]  listening to you for seven eight years and listening to my dad and before we
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:22.280]  even got into this seeing it roll on I was just understanding and seeing what
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:27.040]  research has been accomplished coming to fruition why are the elite so
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:31.640]  confident I mean I guess they they don't control the media the alternative
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:35.920]  media is bigger than the dinosaur now I guess they're in make-believe land
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:40.360]  they're a realistic programming resistance is futile and what you believe
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:44.240]  that you can't defeat city hall you've talked about it of course that's you
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:47.680]  know that that's why they're so confident absolutely it's a confidence game

[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:18.960]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time you know I'm gonna ask the
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:23.280]  Hagmonds about the pedophile networks seem to be running the planet you look at
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:26.920]  all the sexualization of children you look at the attacks on children look at
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:30.960]  the media it's when you understand it's a pedophile network I covered that last
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:34.960]  hour with the John bound special report I'm just throwing that out now so the
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:37.920]  Hagmonds don't forget to give me their take on that that's a question I've
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.200]  never asked them and the reason I like having the Hagmonds on is that they
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:44.200]  really do have a lot of great sources they've given us a lot of intel that
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:48.040]  turned out to actually be accurate or came true so I want to get their take
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:52.560]  on what does it signify that the Daily Males reporting quote Benghazi attack
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.440]  could have been prevented if us had to switch sides in the war on terror and
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:25:04.320]  allowed 500 million of weapons to reach al Qaeda militants reveals the damning
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:08.400]  report and again we got Doug and Joe Hagman on both private investigators a
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:11.880]  citizen's commission on Benghazi a self-selected grip of former top military
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:18.200]  officers CIA insiders think tankers declared last night in Washington at
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:22.360]  the press club that a seven month review of the deadly to 2012 terrorist attack
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.120]  has determined that it could have been prevented well yeah they ran it if the
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.520]  US hadn't been helping to arm al Qaeda militants through Libya a year earlier
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.040]  and they go over to say our government's quote switch sides and openly
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:38.360]  working with al Qaeda now again we already know this but to have this at the
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:43.640]  press club to have this on drudge to have the American people and senator
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:47.240]  Paul say we're not on the side of al Qaeda we're not their air force senator
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:52.760]  Cruz said that as well it really now that this is being openly debated this is
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.600]  the I remember four years ago Bilderberg was throwing fits internally back when
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:00.600]  Tucker was still alive and we had contacts we still have some but they're
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:04.320]  on the outside that they brought this up at Bilderberg the fact that we were
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:09.000]  exposing that the West runs al Qaeda so gentlemen break down how big this report
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.640]  is well Alex I'll tell you it's everything and this report that was
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:19.760]  released by the by the citizens committee on Benghazi there's nothing to
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:24.440]  this report that we have not already talked about exposed this has there's
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:27.960]  nothing that they really added to this report it just confirms what we've
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.440]  talked about but but here's how big this is and people really need to
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:36.480]  understand this Gaddafi was cooperating that coffee was a great great guy but he
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:40.480]  was cooperating with us with our intelligence agencies and this whole
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:44.440]  thing with Benghazi was a was intelligence back Western intelligence
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:49.440]  back it was a it was part of this planned American spring people think
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.720]  American spring was was not planned it was planned but but we took spring that's
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:59.040]  now admitted by Bilderberg and Google at the hotel in Wattford right exactly so
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:03.000]  the bottom line on this really quick here is the fact that Steven's came in
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:09.240]  like on the ball of the Titanic you know with a hundred or so assets with CIA
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:12.880]  assets and operatives and that type of thing in the Libya while Gaddafi was
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:17.400]  still alive thinking that in fact that we could be very well cooperating with
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:22.560]  them our intelligence agencies are armed the very people that took him out he was
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:28.800]  taken out the whole process was to arm the Syrian anti Assad rebels we talked
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.520]  about this on your show right after it happened the army anti Assad Syrian
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:38.400]  rebels including by the way with chemical weapons and of course what happened
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.520]  was the Turkish ambassador it was notified by the Russians and the Russians
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:46.960]  notified Turkish they said hey wait a minute you guys are training with
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:51.800]  chemical weapons and munitions and such on our soil or on our border here you
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:55.080]  gotta stop that you tell Steven's gotta tell the Americans stop that so the
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:59.360]  Turkish ambassador came to Benghazi to meet at the CIA compound and never
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:03.040]  consulate it was an embassy was a CIA compound operations under the biggest
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:07.480]  one in North Africa and told him look you got you guys the Russians have
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.840]  satellite overheads stop what you're doing all of these weapons coming into
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:15.440]  Libya it's like the homie Michael Reagan said this in his report they hope
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:19.760]  she been trail across northern Africa in building on a kernel of truth that
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:25.000]  appeared in American thinker exactly as it happened and of course Gaddafi was
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.360]  was taken out before that the bottom line is we are arming the Syrian rebels
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:34.280]  think of Bay of Pigs Al-Qaeda now runs Libya it's running Syria they
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:39.160]  destabilize the whole region in order to try to reorganize it under this order out
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:43.400]  of chaos absolutely they've done a fantastic job that's right they need
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:48.600]  them there so they can take our liberty exactly exactly and Ukraine you
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:53.000]  mentioned Ukraine what's going on in Ukraine if people don't think that Putin
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.280]  knew exactly what was going on in Libya of course he knew exactly what was going
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:03.640]  on and that's why Benghazi happened but his response of course was Benghazi we
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:07.920]  opened up another front against Syria by the way another front has been opened
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:14.280]  with ISIS and that name Alex ISIS the Islamic Society of up there
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:19.240]  with ISIS the terrorist group ISIS people you obviously you know the
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:23.720]  significance of ISIS the name and the Illuminati but that said another front
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:30.040]  in Syria was open and of course now Putin is reacting to what's going on in
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:36.920]  Syria so this is a game at multiple levels between the Americans the Russians
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:40.840]  the West and the Russians but at the at the end of all of this and people don't
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:44.920]  remember this it's all frustrated by the locals by the Illuminati stay there

[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:15.120]  networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has
[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:18.480]  become a political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:22.880]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:26.920]  kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:29.920]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:34.440]  important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the

[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:11.480]  holding I will get to your calls okay but I want to you know try to get back
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:15.280]  to these guys because your topics are on topics you can ask questions to them
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:18.880]  or make your statements but when we do go to your calls to try to move through
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.320]  them quickly looking at this whole grand chess board and they admitted it's a
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:29.560]  proxy war Brzezinski does against Russia China now challenges Obama's Asia pivot
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:33.520]  with rapid military buildup the conflict with China and Russia is real at one
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:40.120]  level but as you were saying in another there are Illuminati globalist chaos
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:45.200]  agents specter agents hydro agents you can call them whatever you want you
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:48.920]  see that out there in the culture the Illuminati is telling you how they really
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:53.560]  run things evil agents within the systems playing countries off against each
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:59.800]  other creating crises creating wars creating evil trades in the slave
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:04.360]  trade of children you name it and then using the crises they create to set up
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:08.640]  police states to take our liberties just like the drug war where is it going
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:13.840]  next from your intel and as this huge awakening happens and as the military
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:17.440]  does the right thing and the police are the right thing and come out with all
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:22.120]  this data and and and as this and as our military says no to an attack on Syria
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:27.080]  and as the chemical attacks get exposed as being launched by Saudi Arabia and
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.000]  the globalist everything they're doing is blowing up in their face so what are
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.720]  they doing doubling down Ukraine what's the higher level to this I want to get
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:43.760]  Joe Hagman's take on this as well as Doug's but Doug first break down your take
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:48.240]  on what I just said yeah first of all and I think it's important to note that
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:52.720]  if anyone questions ever questions the fact that we know we've had deep insider
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:59.280]  sources I think this this bears out our information that the Benghazi report
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:04.080]  now having said that what happens next according to the very same sources that
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:07.920]  that provided us the information about Benghazi and what really happened there
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:13.480]  here's the deal Alex and and and both of us had that research this and believe
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:17.640]  this to be true based on what our sources said in our own research the
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:22.920]  actual intent here is to take down these at the US dollar I mean they're gonna
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:27.360]  kill the dollar and I've written about that Alex we've talked about it Joe's
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:30.600]  written about it you wrote about that six months ago now Soros is saying
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:35.080]  Ukraine will kill the dollar and he's betting against it exact and that's
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:39.280]  that's the ultimate game because we know what's the dollar back by it's not
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:44.640]  backed by gold silver is backed by the promise of the free flow of energy from
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:49.520]  the West it's our military that's what it's backed by and land well that's true
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:53.360]  it's collateralized by our land and this also connects to the bundies to the
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:58.040]  buddy land grab dude Joe had done a lot of research I cover the fact that
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.480]  but you know China is involved in this as well if the collateralization but
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:07.040]  the bottom line to answer your specific question is they're going to take down
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:11.440]  the United States dollar that's the ultimate objective yeah and and they
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:17.560]  want to do so in order to bring a complete destruction and lack of any
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:21.680]  type of authority so that people are begging for the authority to be brought
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:26.440]  back in to be have order restored so they can set up their end game system
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:30.840]  which is the you know the micro chipping the electronic health information
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:36.440]  data electronic currency medical records everything on one chip as you know
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.080]  many of your guests have come on and talked about this is the end game total
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:44.840]  control of all your resources your habits monitoring everything you do with
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:48.760]  one specific piece of technology well they admit that in Europe they want to
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:52.680]  collapse Europe the big central banks do and then have a Marshall plan to fix it
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:56.920]  and Ukraine's the cover for that but separately they want to force Europe to
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:01.400]  buy US gas which would prop up the dollar how does that fit in because that
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.920]  contradicts the move like on one hand they're trying to kill the dollar with
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:07.720]  QE unlimited but on the other hand they're trying to prop it up what's
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.960]  happening there well we'll think of it this way Alex think of it as being as
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.480]  the United States being the Titanic the other the US dollar being the Titanic
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:22.320]  they want the entire ship filled the capacity and few lifeboats no lifeboats
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:25.720]  they're gonna send the Titanic out so what they're not with what they're doing
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:30.320]  right now is is there attempting to get as many people on board this this like
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:34.840]  the stock market yeah exactly let's bring them in and we're not done plundering
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.240]  you yet it's a Ponzi scheme it's a it's a big it's a big game so the more that
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:43.000]  come in at the end the more money that they can plunder the more wealth they
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:46.880]  could take over and that's the problem and that's why cloud and Piven they're
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.000]  admitted plan bankrupt us to socialize us and to condition us that's why they're
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.160]  running around like gremlins like a pack of 85 trillion gremlins shutting down
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:59.640]  and butchering every business they can every farm every ranch every factory
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:03.680]  every power plant they are just shutting everything down obama care is meant to
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:08.240]  bankrupt all the small businesses cut people down to 20 hours death panels
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.240]  absolutely while they buy armored vehicles tanks weapons and prepare for
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.560]  war with the veterans they know aren't gonna go along with us homeland security
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.320]  is purchased another 25 million shotgun rounds you got the post office buying
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:25.640]  bullets all these governmental agencies are buying ammunition and stockpiling
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:29.360]  them for what they obviously know that there's a there's a purpose behind it
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:33.200]  they're not doing it to drop up the price of ammunition so we have to look at
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:38.400]  the deeper issue and and say why are they doing this well it's either for
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:44.520]  planning on using them against people invaders or yeah American people your
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.360]  dad said two years ago on the show 2012 that your homeland security source said
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:52.040]  they would turn on the race war and that they really did that since then it's
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:55.240]  very clear they're doing it what else should we look for according to your
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:59.920]  own research and sources because you've got some of the same sources we do how
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:03.120]  are things going for the globalist right now though because they are being
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:09.040]  exposed well one of the biggest setbacks for the globalist was the exposure of
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.480]  what happened in the gauze they didn't win in Syria now that doesn't mean they
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:17.680]  didn't stop trying they're still trying in Syria and of course that opened up
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:23.520]  Ukraine but the but what they're doing is they're setting us up here for the
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:30.600]  well to answer your question they're trying again in Syria they are now
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:35.800]  opening up different fronts as Ukraine they are going after the dollar but
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:39.520]  but they've been kind of pushed back you know we made a difference Alex you made
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:43.720]  a difference your exposure to Benghazi our exposure Benghazi we made a difference
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.160]  in Syria and I think we can we still need to keep the pressure on the line and
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:54.040]  keep pushing and keep informing because we can expose these people and they
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:57.760]  don't I mean they're like cockroaches as you pointed out before they don't like
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:02.200]  the light if we shine the light on them I'm gonna tell you we can win some battles
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:06.120]  of course ultimately we you know they're never gonna stop pushing for their
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:09.960]  overall agenda but what we can do is always buy time and time can be a
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:13.800]  precious commodity especially when we're so seeming to be so short on it and
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:17.560]  things seem so dire all the time we can get we can get more people to
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.240]  understand what's going on more people can be prepared mentally physically
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:25.400]  spiritually and and that's what we need in order to prepare for what's coming I
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:30.840]  agree to recognize the threat and who it is use Putin double dealing with the
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:33.680]  globalist they're now threatening to grab his Swiss bank accounts they're
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:38.880]  saying I don't know that stories of propaganda story in and of itself
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:43.280]  implying as all these Swiss bank accounts to create internal problems for him
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:48.160]  but who is Putin and what is Russia in your view in the overall chessboard
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.800]  versus China well I'll tell you we were just talking about this yesterday might
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:57.720]  be real quick and then I'll turn to Joe is this Putin is in partnership with
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:03.240]  Obama at a higher level of course that the lower level we're seeing the circus
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.800]  play out and of course Putin don't forget his is a billionaire based on his
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:13.800]  oil holdings so whatever he has certainly he's in good shape and he's kgb
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.480]  and will always be kgb so we have to remember that the bigger question I
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:24.120]  think is who is Obama and I believe all these leaders are just basic puppet
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:29.000]  talking heads while each country these elitists have no a legion or these
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.360]  elitists have no allegiance to any country whatsoever they use the country
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:37.560]  says chess pieces on the chessboard as you said the grand chessboard and what
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:40.400]  they're going to do is use Russia they're gonna use China they're gonna use
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:44.040]  whatever nations they can to destroy and he stabilize America they're gonna be
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:48.480]  stabilized Russia and China eventually as they want to bring in this one world
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.360]  order that is their stated goal and has been their stated goal how do we get
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:55.880]  their admitted philosophy of playing all the sides off against each other where
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:59.800]  they sit on top of us how do we get that across to the police and military
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:04.840]  because inner the domestic operation it's been clear for at least 15 20 years
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:09.080]  they've been scripting civil war Obama's been scripted as the new Lincoln I
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:13.040]  don't think that's gonna fly who will you know crush the evil racist states
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:17.040]  none of that's working anymore but it doesn't matter they're still deploying
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:20.360]  the armored vehicles the high-tech surveillance now all the manuals come
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:23.480]  out on a weekly basis not a monthly where they're training to crush the Tea
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:28.920]  Party veterans gun owners I mean I hope the military and police know even though
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.920]  they could certainly fight hard they couldn't defeat the Iraqis who were
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:36.480]  gonna be nothing compared to the veterans of this country I've looked at it
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:42.160]  from every angle I've war-gamed it the enough if 1% of the American people that
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:47.840]  are gun owners of say 170 million fight back and most of those are veterans
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:53.080]  that's 1.7 million combatants if you kill one government operative that wipes
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:57.760]  them all out military police everyone basically dead I mean it's easy it's like
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:02.680]  moose hunting you'd have to have you know a lottery to refer to you know you
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:06.320]  couldn't even find someone to kill if you wanted to if people actually go out
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.000]  and start killing I don't want that to happen because the globalists want us to
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:17.200]  wipe them out it's public under the I-4 and under the NLE09 through NLE 14 was
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:20.600]  that it was a classified live this year but we still got some of it they
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:24.960]  openly are ready to then pour in foreign troops I mean I hear the old-timers
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:28.280]  military men go they're planning to use Chinese troops like oh shut up they
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:31.640]  actually talk about using Chinese troops to quote secure their national
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:38.400]  debt so we how do we stop the civil war because I mean or we all just go like
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:42.560]  idiots march out and kill each other well unfortunately the biggest question I
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:45.280]  have is what you asked there in the beginning is how do we bridge the gap
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:51.840]  between helping people understand who are politically ignorant right now and
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:55.680]  ignorant of what's going on how do we bridge the gap to help help these
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:59.640]  people understand what is going on and you know there seems to be a few tight
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:03.120]  different types of people some that take to it slowly some that don't want to
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:07.080]  hear it and some that will never understand it until there's that boot
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:11.920]  that kicks down their door exactly so it's right before showtime if I could
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:16.640]  just slip this in a very important piece of information I got there's a gentleman
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:20.560]  by the name and I can verify this and I've gotten the authority approval to
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:24.400]  use his name at the Bundy Ranch with gentlemen by the name of Jerry DeLemus
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:28.880]  is there they and I'm not sure that we didn't catch the first part of your show
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:34.680]  we were in transit to the studio but the fact of the matter is the information
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:39.160]  we have is that there is some sort of activity perhaps as some sort of service
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:45.000]  of legal process to be done against the Clive Clive and Bundy and his fan or his
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.280]  family members of his family Jerry DeLemus wants so who's at the ranch right
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:56.520]  now wants people to know that they will not put up obstruct in any way shape or
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:02.600]  form or in any way put up any force against any law enforcement officers
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:08.320]  who are right now or in the future and intending to serve any lawful or legal
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:14.320]  legal service of process or warrant or whatever they will cooperate there's a
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:19.080]  propaganda war going on here the government is saying look you know these
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:22.120]  these patrons out there with guns they're gonna shoot you if you go so they're
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:27.120]  using the loaded sovereign citizen term nothing a sovereign citizens but it's a
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.360]  southern property law center term to say that they're gonna kill any fed they
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:34.320]  see when it was the feds pointing the guns not them they've said we will take
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:40.520]  the process are you getting that they can false flag the servers well yeah and
[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:47.600]  that's exactly exactly exactly what's being set up here this is as much of an
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:53.400]  info war propaganda war as anything else that we are the second amendment
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:59.160]  constitutionalist gun toting Bible carrying people we are being set up
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:03.840]  before the demonization look what you did look what you oh no I undoubtedly
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:08.160]  know that they can spin this against us if it goes sideways and that's why Glenn
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:11.600]  Beck is now saying has nothing to do with it my deal is they're pointing guns
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:15.320]  they're attacking people with dogs they're out of control how can you put
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:19.600]  down people with their guns with them at their sides marching towards the feds
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:23.600]  you have to say these are honorable people at the same time I don't want
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.000]  this to go physical and I'm on record saying that but I think Reed and them
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:33.480]  have a big problem too because if they do try to stage something it's not gonna
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:36.480]  go the way they want I mean I think the globalist do you think the globalists
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.200]  are ready for the Civil War to start is that what you're saying well what I
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:43.480]  think is the globalists have all their pieces in place and they've had them in
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:47.200]  place for a while from what I can tell and if they wanted to start something
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:50.280]  and if they wanted to actually start the Civil War they've couldn't that they
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:54.520]  could have did it you know five years ago but they haven't so the question is
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:59.160]  why haven't they started to implement their their hardcore plans if they can
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:02.280]  there is still something that they're waiting for is there still something in
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:05.920]  need what is it that is holding them up or what is stopping well I think it's us
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:08.800]  I think it's the fact that the alternative real new media knows their
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:12.520]  game plan and just like the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman went to Obama the
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:15.440]  night before the attack on Syria that's been confirmed and said the military
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:18.760]  will not stand for this I think the military and police in fact I know the
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:23.920]  military my gosh it's like 90% an hour awake that I talked to are you totally
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:28.600]  are aware of everything I mean they live in this they're not stupid what's your
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:34.600]  take on that Doug well look I think I think that the the penetration the
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:39.600]  information penetration is getting out there I think that that we are we are
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:45.080]  making a difference Alex and thank you for making a difference I think it's
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:48.640]  so important but the bottom line here you asked a question just earlier what
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:53.000]  are they waiting for or you know what what's what could happen next let me go
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.680]  back to that taking down of the dollar because once that happens what will
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:00.680]  happen here there's going to be chaos there's gonna be a little bit happen to
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:04.040]  Walmart you pointed out and they don't want to take the blame for the collapse
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:07.640]  they'll start a civil war right as that happens blaming the collapse of the civil
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:12.880]  war it's exactly it's it wasn't us you know they and that's the whole thing of
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:16.960]  gee whiz it just had to happen and it certainly wasn't us we didn't want this
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:20.960]  but that's what they're counting on they're counting on people you know
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:24.560]  what this is like Doug this is like a car wreck have you ever been in a car
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.680]  wreck and things going to slow motion it's like you can't believe a car just
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.160]  round of red lights about the t-bone you and then it hits and you're in slow
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:36.480]  motion and you feel your you know leg breaking or whatever your head slamming
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:41.400]  into the windshield I can't believe it's this crazy and history's about to
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:46.960]  repeat there's got to be a way to stop this one thing we do to mitigate and to
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:51.280]  help ourselves is to help each other and to reach out to our neighbors to our
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:55.080]  families and even if they don't believe us or think you're crazy however the
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:58.860]  relationship is just say look you know if things go bad this is the way it is
[02:49:58.860 --> 02:50:03.360]  get extra food extra preparations be in a position to help people and bring
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:07.140]  them together so you can yeah and then meanwhile Homeland Security saying if
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:10.080]  you got food or guns you're a terrorist they're actually we have that article in
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:13.520]  info wars calm they're literally going to come to our houses and start stuff

[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:22.320]  people exactly and you know people listening is right now might think well
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:27.520]  geez we know all of this well you know in a lot of ways yeah but you need to
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:31.600]  reinforce this as well because the more that we talk about this the more that

[02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:37.480]  Rancher Clive Bundy how how cryptic but most the comments are calling Rita
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:40.680]  Trader and pointing out that he indeed is in business with the communists
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:45.720]  Chinese to take over the whole area let's go ahead and go to the phone calls
[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:53.200]  for our guest Doug and Joe Hagman and let's talk to Kalen in Florida go ahead
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:57.880]  you're on the air what's your take on this whole situation hey I'm Doug and
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:02.040]  Joe a longtime listener first-time caller my name's Kalen for us I ran for
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.360]  US Congress in 2012 as a libertarian to try and restore the values that made
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:11.840]  America great and those values are now all but gone your your guest I believe
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:16.520]  was Doug mentioned demonization just look at what they're doing to the troops
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:21.200]  themselves if you look at for example the free Cody frets campaign on
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:25.240]  Facebook and Twitter I can give you a link to it at the end my brother Cody
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:29.440]  frets and thousands or maybe even tens of thousands of other veterans like him
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:34.360]  are currently being persecuted by the army it's it's been reported and the
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:39.280]  army times and elsewhere these guys served honorably in the front lines in
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:46.080]  Afghanistan war at point blank range they came back most of them with PTSD and
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:50.440]  TBI yes they're being totally demonized that's why we hired Sergeant Joe Biggs
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:53.760]  he's now a reporter here full-time in Austin he's a great reporter has a lot
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:57.760]  of courage and you know he's also a veteran and of course helped expose the
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:04.000]  murder of the Rolling Stone writer his good friend mr. Hastings but but I hear
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.560]  you and I appreciate your call we got to move quick what is your take on the
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:10.960]  open demonization of the veterans I mean that ought to show everybody that works
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:14.440]  for the system how much these globalist cowards hate the people that have
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:19.600]  actually helped build their empire well research is just done just completed
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:25.440]  that this week look they're they're they're making the military first of
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.580]  all they're taking away a lot of the troops we have to ask why I mean they're
[02:56:29.580 --> 02:56:32.640]  cutting back on the troops are cutting obviously you reported not on the
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:35.640]  wasteful jets and stuff they're just getting rid of the troops you know right
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:39.280]  well the Pentagon announces they're going to robots but go ahead well yeah
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.080]  there's that transhumanist aspect to this that you talked about as well but
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:48.360]  it's interesting because now we are wussifying I don't know what other word
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:55.000]  to use the military with these with the the homosexual militant radical agenda
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:00.120]  against the military or in with the military so what is what has happened
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:04.640]  over the last what the 10 years the things you found it were just absolutely
[02:57:04.640 --> 02:57:08.800]  astounded me with respect to what they're doing during military in terms of
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:13.480]  defanging our abilities at least our combat abilities and not only with the
[02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:17.560]  army and the Marines that's having suicides at all times highs you have no
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:21.320]  special forces that's come out having suicides at all time high that's right
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.000]  and the way that the over 50,000 veterans are homeless here in this
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:29.200]  country it's incredible the globalists are stripped down in the country they're
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:33.120]  using it's like a toilet zander in Minnesota you're on the air go ahead
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:38.760]  hey I just wanted to relay a little African proverb to you in regards to
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:44.840]  Ukraine the proverb goes that when two elephants fight it's the grass that
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:48.760]  trampled and I think that's what the store for the Ukraine US that's right
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:53.240]  more wars more conflicts not good we want Ukrainian for the Ukrainians get out
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:57.400]  Russia get out NATO but NATO grabbed 90% of the country and acts like Russia
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:05.280]  started it that's why it's a fraud the shadow of history casts a long or the
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:09.920]  history cast a long shadow into the future and I think we have to keep that
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:12.440]  in mind I think we have to look back I agree that was a great point with the
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:18.080]  call or anything else Andrew yeah but your guess was talking about something

[02:58:25.240 --> 02:58:31.360]  matters it's what you see I think a lot of the brainwashed masses they have
[02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:35.000]  seen the property they've looked at the problem but they really don't see it for

[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:43.960]  9 9 2 3 1 let's go ahead and talk to Xander in Minnesota Xander finishing up
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:47.360]  your point you're saying people you know what the problem is they don't know what
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:53.920]  they're saying what is the problem well I think it stems mostly from this
[03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:59.840]  labeling society we've developed is systematic where it's kind of do you
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:03.360]  remember that drunk Australian caller they're called a couple weeks ago do
[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:08.080]  you remember him yes of course I think he was trying to articulate that
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:14.160]  systematic issue which is where the powers that be now are just trying to
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:19.960]  put everything into nice and neat boxes to categorize everything and MSNBC just
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:24.760]  came out and said it's racist if you don't support carbon taxes I mean it's
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:27.600]  like if you don't like all your food tastes it's racist it's just mindless
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:33.360]  buzzwords that create an emotion that's in 1984 with Ingsock where they reduce
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:38.200]  the language tour you can't even talk to people I agree that it's just a bunch
[03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:45.600]  of gibbering childlike idiots go ahead yeah and you know at that there's a
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:51.600]  certain point where people have to come to realize and accept that the way it is
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:57.320]  the way it is then you know no matter how many ways you use your reason and
[03:01:57.320 --> 03:02:02.520]  rationale to bend and contort the fact you know when there's gonna be a barrel
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:05.400]  pointing in front of your face you're not gonna be able to make it into a
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:10.560]  smiley face well that's right and they've learned to just spin everything and
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:15.680]  call an occupation you know security when it's martial law great points let's
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:20.040]  get a take from the Hagmans on that before we go back to more calls they
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.320]  really are kill it they've killed the language you know I've reviewed
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:28.360]  references several times if you look at a English test from the 1850s and you
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:31.640]  try to give it to a graduate student in college today that they would you know
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:36.200]  fail at miserably they've done people down through you know the use of
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:41.360]  vocabulary and now with the name-calling and labeling and marginalization
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:46.680]  they've tribalized things as you've put it well I mean look at MSNBC they said
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:52.320]  quote I influenced the Boston bombings and I'm deeply racist and show no proof
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:57.440]  I mean if I said that somebody said something I would play it or I would show
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:03.600]  it I mean they just say he's racist and he's a bomber and what's even worse is
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:08.920]  is the viewers the majority of viewers take that as basically the gospel yeah
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:14.720]  exactly and yet Tom Collins of the Clark County Commissioner has the
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:20.080]  audacity and apparently the immunity to make a
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:23.920]  terroristic threat against the Patriots at the Bundy Ranch and suffer no
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:29.320]  consequences I mean it's ridiculous out of space oh yeah no I've had like ABC
[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:32.760]  camera guys that physically attack me and they don't get in trouble but if I
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:36.720]  yell at them I go to jail it's just this attitude of where the system will do
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:39.880]  whatever we want and people don't get when there's no justice everybody gets
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:44.080]  screwed look at the prosperity going out the window right now as we go under
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:49.400]  tyranny all these minions of the system have got a rude awakening gentlemen yeah
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:54.000]  you mentioned justice you know I heard an attorney tell me the other day the reason
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:57.800]  lady justice is blindfolded it's not because justice is blind is because
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:01.120]  she's crying her eyes out exactly gentlemen I want you to host the next

[03:08:17.440 --> 03:08:22.160]  security us.com we're gonna be taking some calls and infowars.com is the
[03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:26.560]  website and first we're gonna hit the story here Russia yeah before we take
[03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:32.480]  calls Alex Mitchell this before he left the RAF the Royal Air Force jet
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:38.400]  chases Russian planes away from the UK to Russian planes were turned back as
[03:08:38.400 --> 03:08:43.160]  they approach Scotland with jets from the Netherlands and Denmark also
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:47.160]  scrambled interesting as we look at those we just talked about what's going
[03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:50.040]  on over there wonder if this is something serious more serious than the
[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:53.320]  war games that are going on or if this is something separate but let's go to the
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:09:02.400]  callers we're first going to go to Joe Joe you're up hello guys hello there I'm
[03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:08.160]  currently in Canada and I understand that you know eventually you know most of
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:13.560]  that most of the players in in this scenario seem to be you know from the
[03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:19.120]  big from the big superpowers and you know eventually the corrupt under agents
[03:09:19.120 --> 03:09:24.800]  that operate behind the scenes and actually dictate and and make the calls
[03:09:24.800 --> 03:09:30.760]  for for what happens and you know of course the the ruses that are put out to
[03:09:30.760 --> 03:09:36.640]  the general public to to mislead and to to guide them into the way that they
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:43.320]  would have us think things are going down what I really seem to notice here
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:50.000]  that I believe that Canada has a much bigger place and part in what's going
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:56.360]  on and actually is being noticed I believe that you know I mean we're a
[03:09:56.360 --> 03:10:02.920]  huge country we have incredible resource which is being exploited from us you
[03:10:02.920 --> 03:10:07.960]  know at incredible rate I mean a pipeline that's twice as tall as I am of
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:13.960]  water alone that's being you know pumped to the states we built it we supply it
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:23.280]  we generate zero income from it I mean this part and Joe of course you're
[03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:26.240]  going to enjoy being part of the North American Union which is going to be one
[03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:31.800]  of the trade zones of the New World Order right and thanks for your call Joe and
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:37.480]  you're exactly right Canada and its middle class is now you know just as
[03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:41.160]  suffering as badly as the United States middle class the economies are so
[03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:45.400]  intertwined Canada is going to be feeling the damage of whatever the US is
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:50.440]  feeling when the US is attacked financially or by other means Canada is
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:55.160]  going to be feeling the same effects we are absolutely and I just want to remind
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:10:57.440]  people you didn't tune into the wrong station
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:01.840]  Doug and Joe Hagman temporarily taking the seat of Alex Jones for the last
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:06.320]  segment for the last portion of the show here exactly instead of spending the
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:12.840]  top 40 let's go to Roger Roger you're up on the Alex Jones show yeah Mr. Hagman
[03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:17.480]  the way we beat the New World Order crowd we had to do like what that movie
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:21.840]  freedom of fashion with Aaron Russo we had to quit the funding these gangsters
[03:11:21.840 --> 03:11:26.680]  because if people keep on funding the New World Order crowd they use our money
[03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:30.760]  as a weapon so I encourage everybody what we need to do is we need to quit the
[03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:35.280]  funding and the IRS so that way they can't they get the money to use against
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:37.920]  the sort of fun all their programs use against us
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:43.960]  Roger you're exactly right freedom to fascism is a great documentary I urge
[03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:49.200]  everybody to check that out with the late Aaron Russo who does an exemplary job
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:54.200]  of showing the holes of the IRS and the tax code and what people can do to get
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:58.040]  around that anything else today Roger before I let you go
[03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:03.080]  I want to say guys keep up the good work and I God bless you guys
[03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:08.040]  God bless you all all righty let's shut down your you're listening to in full
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:13.320]  Wars Alex Jones temporarily stepped away Doug and Joe Hagman manning the helm
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:17.520]  until his return Melvin you're up next on the Alex Jones show
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:22.960]  yes Doug and Joe thanks for taking my call several of us are noticing that
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:27.160]  there's been an increase in the number of elites and globalist leaders that are
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:33.480]  looking old and getting sick and tired and mentally starting to decay even die
[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:36.880]  we're starting to notice this with some of their family members now no names
[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:41.280]  need to be said that's kind of below the belt here but what we're wondering is and
[03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:45.600]  if Alex we'd like to get this to his producers and him as well so some of us
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:48.560]  might have to call back in we're wondering if this could be a little bit of
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:52.960]  divine intervention from up above here where maybe the good Lord is starting to
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:12:56.000]  put the pressure on some of these folks that are doing the largest amount of
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:01.040]  evil this would be a bombshell because it as you would look at acts of God like
[03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:04.360]  storms and whatnot this would be surgically starting to make a move
[03:13:04.360 --> 03:13:08.840]  almost like in the scriptures would pass over with the 10 plagues and such are
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:13.000]  you guys seeing any of that and and that's the question for Alex we have to
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:17.080]  call back in on it but we're starting to the last few months some of you see this
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:22.720]  I'd like to get your you know intake on this and see if anything is can be
[03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:25.640]  tracked to see if that's in fact happening because we don't have to do this
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:29.440]  alone once the good Lord gets involved we'll be along on the coattails he
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:34.240]  certainly knows good from evil and let's see if we've got another Noah or some
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:37.120]  kind of a situation like a Passover coming up like to get your thoughts on
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:42.480]  it thank you Melvin for bringing this up you're exactly right the Lord is is
[03:13:42.480 --> 03:13:48.520]  separating his people into where he needs them and is putting the the brakes
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:52.400]  the oppression on the people who are bringing the oppression to us and giving
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:55.800]  us time and what we need to do is continue to pray and continue to seek
[03:13:55.800 --> 03:14:01.200]  the Lord and concede to continue to seek his help in in this fight because
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:05.840]  without him all is lost you know there's nothing that we can take away from
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:10.000]  this world we're essentially here in this time and place in history because the
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:13.760]  Lord wants us here for a reason and without him we have nothing and he is
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:17.040]  our only hope and we know that the battle is already won and without his
[03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:20.620]  intervention I think we would have been toast a long time ago so we got to keep
[03:14:20.620 --> 03:14:24.400]  praying we got to keep the hope up and we got to keep looking to the Lord as our
[03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:27.160]  solution and thank you for bringing that up Melvin and thanks for your call
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:32.560]  yeah absolutely my friend and I do believe that that we do have some time
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:39.080]  here and we you know a good friend of mine intelligence as I always said you
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:46.520]  know a wise man sees trouble and gets out of the way or uses his time wisely to
[03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:52.040]  prepare it I think now is the time to make your preparations to to walk in
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:57.440]  deliberately to the lifeboat so to speak and and and there's nothing to be
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:02.400]  gained by screaming yelling and and losing your mind we have to do is we
[03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:06.280]  have to anticipate trouble get out of the way but we also have to prepare and
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:12.280]  Joe you're right is in terms of the the salvation aspect Mike you're up next on
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:17.800]  in full wars the Alex Jones show Doug and Joe having sitting in relatively
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:22.920]  speaking hey Doug and Joe thanks for taking my call you guys are doing just a
[03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:28.640]  phenomenal job I wanted to just speak on on two main issues basically Russia
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:33.560]  Ukraine and also seeing that our Lord and Savior if that's what we have to
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:39.720]  call him now he's come out basically defending the Senkaku Islands that are
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:46.280]  held I guess could argue by Japan I just see a lot of inflammatory you know
[03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:50.640]  comments being thrown out you know a lot of the actions by the US are
[03:15:50.640 --> 03:15:55.520]  disgusting me and the powers that be want to just get your thoughts on the
[03:15:55.520 --> 03:16:00.360]  Japan-China situation I know our president is over there right now also
[03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:04.020]  wanted to get your thoughts don't know if guys that follows the export import
[03:16:04.020 --> 03:16:09.080]  bank basically it's corporate welfare at its finest and this would like people
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:13.680]  to look into that issue it expires September 30th don't know what they're
[03:16:13.680 --> 03:16:17.840]  gonna do with that and again just wanted your guys to do on that all right
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:23.240]  Mike with respect to the Japan and China situation think about it this way we
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:28.040]  had that we talked earlier with Alex about what the end game objective is or
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:33.680]  at least one of the stages of the hinge moments in history and that's the take
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:37.640]  down of the US dollar and the US dollar of course is backed by our ability to
[03:16:37.640 --> 03:16:42.480]  protect the free flow of oil to the Western Western world well when we have
[03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:49.880]  to for example send military naval assets air assets military assets to watch
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:58.920]  to surveil to watch over the Japan and China situation Japan the ally of
[03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:04.880]  course that's for us our resources very thin when it weakens our ability to
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:09.920]  to protect the dollar so also we're seeing China China maneuvering with
[03:17:09.920 --> 03:17:13.280]  Japan seeing what they can get away with what they can't get away with gaging
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:17.560]  the reactions of other countries NATO and their other countries and other
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:22.720]  their allies as well as when they make these moves and seeing what will happen
[03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:26.600]  and what the rhetoric will be when they have these little disputes and Mike
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:29.280]  thanks for the call I'm gonna get one more calling before the break we got a
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:35.560]  ham joining us next Pam welcome to the Alex Jones show hi this is a retired
[03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:40.680]  Army Captain Pamela Burnett it actually interviewed me regarding illegal
[03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:46.840]  destruction of Obama's mother's passport records my book Obama never vetted the
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:53.600]  lawful president the national security loopholes that endanger America and Pam
[03:17:53.600 --> 03:17:56.520]  let me just say you're a wonderful Patriot thank you for your service the
[03:17:56.520 --> 03:18:00.320]  interview was great by the way want to talk to you some more but didn't mean
[03:18:00.320 --> 03:18:07.480]  to interrupt go ahead yes it's nice to speak with you again Mr. Mr. Hagman I
[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:14.880]  was calling today because I highly advocate that to stop World War 3 which
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:20.000]  the globalists are pushing hard for right now is that we have to the puppet
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:25.120]  head of the criminal globalist snake Obama must be removed from by
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:30.560]  impeachment from the Oval Office I believe we have to put the globalists on
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:42.840]  the defense and diffuse the situation I agree with Mr. LaRouche is LaRouche is
[03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:51.120]  the only organized body that's pushing for impeachment of Obama the impeachment
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:55.040]  requires and you know we've got we were short of getting short of time but the
[03:18:55.040 --> 03:19:00.160]  Pam impeachment would require cooperation of the House and Senate and I
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:04.880]  gotta tell you where have we seen any inkling of potential cooperation with
[03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:09.440]  them they're on the bowl to their part of the mob well what about what about a
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:14.560]  recollection what about criminal charges you we have that Benghazi report how
[03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:20.960]  about taking Obama and Hillary Clinton to the international court and hey why
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:25.720]  not that for the war crimes that they're responsible for just the thought we
[03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:36.360]  agree with all that also the thing that that all of us can agree on even some
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:41.200]  progressives and liberals can agree that Obama has has done impeachable
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:46.080]  offenses and I'm just saying hit it hard pick your impeachable offense and hit it
[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:50.160]  hard call your congressman every day see what they're doing to impeach Obama
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:54.400]  yeah that's the great advice folks listen to the Alec film show with your
[03:19:54.400 --> 03:19:58.720]  guest host Doug and Joe Hagman Pam that was a great call thank you look forward
[03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:08.440]  to hearing from you again soon
