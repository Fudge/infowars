[00:23.120 --> 00:31.280]  very big broadcast lined up for you today if you go to the top of DrugsReport.com you see that
[00:31.280 --> 00:37.840]  Jade Helm is the top story Texas bristles at Obama invasion fears fester Rand Paul plays down
[00:37.840 --> 00:46.240]  comments on military exercise governor working to calm the public I just so happened as fate would
[00:46.240 --> 00:55.040]  have it to be downtown this morning and I ran into Daniel Hodge the chief of staff for governor
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.560]  Greg Abbott and I talked to him a few weeks ago but then I just so happened to run into him and
[01:00.560 --> 01:06.960]  talked to him for a few minutes we're picturing him there behind the governor from the Texas Tribune
[01:06.960 --> 01:10.960]  photo and I said what do you think of this whole Jade Helm then he said well we just put out the
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.040]  facts we're going to guard people's basic rights and we're just moving on the media wants to make
[01:15.040 --> 01:18.880]  stuff up they can we're going to worry about the new legislature and trying to get more jobs to
[01:18.880 --> 01:25.200]  Texas and to keep taxes low and I went on to talk about the hoax they ran claiming that I wouldn't
[01:25.200 --> 01:32.320]  show up for this week with George Stephanopoulos he had a fill in yes yesterday as if I wouldn't
[01:32.320 --> 01:40.400]  show up to a live TV program they said it was live they backed out of it they said taped I said no
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.560]  then they sent a car right before one text sent an eco a text 45 minutes before saying where is he
[01:48.000 --> 01:57.440]  just classic this is the type of dirty tricks these people run I will go on ABC CBS NBC Fox MSNBC
[01:57.440 --> 02:05.120]  CNN any of these dinosaur media corporate outlets anytime live everybody knows that and I will clean
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.040]  the floor with you just like I did Pierce Morgan and you know what happened to him and it became
[02:11.040 --> 02:17.680]  the biggest as voted by CNN and the LA Times and others the biggest news event the biggest
[02:17.680 --> 02:25.680]  particular news on the news the biggest freak out you can pull the articles up in that year 2013
[02:26.400 --> 02:32.000]  it was on every major channel for weeks his ratings bumped for a week and a half from a
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.360]  million and a half to over three million and then he went into freefall because they can't handle it
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.520]  there was a whole another segment coming up and they kicked me out had security thrown me out
[02:44.240 --> 02:51.200]  because I cleaned the floor with him but it doesn't matter they just claimed that I'm afraid to
[02:51.200 --> 02:58.240]  debate them hilarious absolutely hilarious now what's not hilarious is breaking and is coming
[02:58.240 --> 03:06.960]  up at the start of the next segment ISIS terrorists threaten london attack and I've explained to folks
[03:06.960 --> 03:14.240]  I was there days after the 7 7 bombing in 2005 that was a pure patsy event with folks taking
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.240]  part to drill who they set up and then later executed because some of them figured it out
[03:19.040 --> 03:22.320]  and I made a whole film about a terrorist storm detailing it and proving it
[03:22.320 --> 03:29.920]  ISIS is different the west funded with billions of dollars the last five years and recruited
[03:29.920 --> 03:35.360]  hundreds of thousands of jihad fighters funded by Saudi Arabia and others in Qatar they allow them
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.520]  to fly all over the world and to recruit and operate and I've been predicting for four years
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.520]  at nauseam every week maybe somebody will put the clips together where I said we're funding
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.720]  them in Benghazi and Libya or funding them in Syria it's going to blow back with attacks on
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.920]  the west and they're going to use those attacks to take our liberties I have said it not hundreds
[03:57.920 --> 04:07.920]  but probably 500 times Paul Watson joins us from London with these new developments they've got
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.960]  photos of explosives where they're going to hit their main recruiting base is London they've
[04:12.960 --> 04:19.280]  been protected by mi6 this could be used to bring in real tyranny now that said something I was able
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.320]  to pull up this morning that we predicted and laid out and it's not about saying oh look we were
[04:24.320 --> 04:29.440]  right it's about letting folks know that we're not making this stuff up it's not about counting coup
[04:29.440 --> 04:35.040]  or keeping score shy hershes come out says the White House is lying about the killing of bin Laden
[04:35.040 --> 04:44.400]  and I happen to have all the videos and news articles we did on May second the day after
[04:44.400 --> 04:52.480]  Obama said this in 2011 and so those clips are coming up and then I said exactly what really
[04:52.480 --> 04:57.840]  happened and have the Navy SEAL families on and then we talked to Cy Hurst by the way he called
[04:57.840 --> 05:03.120]  us or emailed us about all this and now for a news story that you won't hear on the big

[11:37.040 --> 11:42.080]  about writing an article about this i won't even talk over the telephone about my sources
[11:42.080 --> 11:51.840]  this is very dangerous i just want you to know that this is in a game and this is kind of stuff
[11:51.840 --> 12:02.000]  you get killed for the good news is a lot of these navy seal families are now public not just
[12:02.000 --> 12:11.440]  telling us privately or telling my family things privately i have this from multiple sources myself
[12:11.440 --> 12:17.200]  and through family in the military i'm just going to stop right there i'm going to stop right there
[12:20.800 --> 12:24.560]  but they killed those seals on that helicopter they got rid of them that's when the family a
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.400]  few months later started going public i was sought out some of the families we had on later
[12:30.400 --> 12:39.440]  and they concurred they said yes the word is that bin laden already died of kidney failure in 2002
[12:41.600 --> 12:45.200]  and this is what you heard from insiders is like pacenic and others as well
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.600]  steve pacenic counsel and foreign relations and
[12:51.600 --> 13:02.560]  that there was a bin laden double in a pakistani safehouse basically on house arrest
[13:02.560 --> 13:09.200]  a half mile from their main national military headquarters and there was no firefights no
[13:09.200 --> 13:14.400]  nothing the seals were sent in and they killed the double they began to question it with this
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.720]  body on board the helicopter one helicopter was blown up trying to get rid of the seals
[13:18.720 --> 13:23.680]  to confuse things and then they had to get rid of the rest of the team that was sent in
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.760]  a few months later with the helicopter that was set up to go into the ambush and to be
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.560]  blown up as well and i was told directly by navy seals i'm just going to stop right there
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.400]  that they knew there was a bomb on board and their superiors were telling them
[13:38.400 --> 13:45.440]  them oh al qaeda must have gotten a bomb on board at your base
[13:46.960 --> 13:53.840]  so i broke all this down in fact when i learned this i shot a video in my car leaving the meeting
[13:53.840 --> 14:01.680]  i was so concerned and that video is up on info wars dot com and you notice now i told you the
[14:01.680 --> 14:07.680]  situation room video was fake i told you they didn't have live feeds i told you uh that it
[14:07.680 --> 14:14.640]  was all scripted i told you that there was no burial at sea and then a court marshaled
[14:15.680 --> 14:18.960]  over a hundred people on the boat who've gone public and said there was no burial
[14:19.680 --> 14:25.360]  it was all fake stratford emails got hacked stratford for the cia was on the job trying to
[14:25.360 --> 14:31.440]  discredit me they did that with a cast sunstein cognitive infiltration move having their operatives
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.040]  claim that i work for them to cover the fact they were trying to bring me down i mean i live a
[14:37.040 --> 14:42.160]  cloak and dagger life and i'm not looking for trouble i'm not looking for revolution i just
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.640]  want my republic back i want my bill of rights back i want to process back i don't want special
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.600]  interest hijack in the country signing us on to tens of trillions of dollars that aren't our debt
[14:51.600 --> 14:58.160]  and sink in the republic and there's all these enemy programs trying to misrepresent who we are
[14:58.160 --> 15:05.520]  and what we say because the government listens to us good people in the military in the congress
[15:05.520 --> 15:12.320]  in the state houses listen you got everybody from rand paul to ted cruz to chuck norris to governor
[15:12.320 --> 15:18.240]  abbott coming out and agreeing with me and saying yes there's a takeover of our military
[15:18.240 --> 15:23.200]  they're being developed for a mission against the patriots louis gohmertz said it the congressman
[15:23.200 --> 15:29.120]  chuck norris you name it that's why we have a concern because they admit the main mission
[15:29.120 --> 15:35.040]  training is shifting to domestic and on the jade helm website they admit that it's about
[15:35.040 --> 15:40.480]  conquering human domain sociology anthropology to understand their future adversary that's what
[15:40.480 --> 15:48.160]  they're training for america of course it has dual use but that's what's happening and we're
[15:48.160 --> 16:05.920]  forcing a debate about it so i'll break all this down coming up
[16:05.920 --> 16:11.040]  and i've said this many times i'm in over my head and we're all in over our heads i mean
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.640]  there's no way to track all of this now i do want to get the article up on info wars dot com
[16:16.640 --> 16:21.760]  as a featured story i came in before the show and it was about 45 minutes ago i gave the directive
[16:21.760 --> 16:28.640]  to flashback our our our articles and our videos from day one from day two to be technical i need
[16:28.640 --> 16:34.000]  to get those up on info wars dot com and then i need to get it tweeted out to everybody on the

[19:01.600 --> 19:09.120]  garland attack last week texas attack that hashtag was tweeted out by an individual linked to the
[19:09.120 --> 19:14.880]  attack and twitter only suspended that account the day after these three individuals are tweeting
[19:14.880 --> 19:21.680]  out these threats since our story went up only one of them has been suspended one of them another
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.760]  one has blocked me so i don't know whether his account's been suspended or not it appears to
[19:25.760 --> 19:31.280]  be still be up and then there's another one who is still active and as twitter suspends these
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.200]  accounts new ones just keep popping up in their place so they're brazenly out there on twitter

[20:18.960 --> 20:24.000]  set up patsies and the government would stage them now they have their own jihadi armies they've
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.120]  allowed saudi arabia to fund who they allow to travel in and out of the u.s england and the
[20:29.120 --> 20:34.720]  rest of the e u uh... this is a real synthetic army and i think these threats should be taken
[20:34.720 --> 20:41.680]  very very seriously well here's the thing alex when we struck libya in two thousand eleven
[20:41.680 --> 20:47.120]  with the united states after that they brought across a load of these jihadists from libya
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.720]  the same kind who are now leading the charge for isis we had the video a couple of months ago about
[20:52.720 --> 20:58.720]  the the leader of the li fg fighting forces in libya which helped overthrow gaddafi is now
[20:58.720 --> 21:06.320]  leading isis in libya well some of those jihadists were brought across to great britain to be trained
[21:06.320 --> 21:10.480]  at military bases in britain there's all kinds of stories about how they were out
[21:10.480 --> 21:15.920]  raping people and all this kind of stuff so now we've got jihadists threatening attacks in london
[21:15.920 --> 21:22.640]  and again we go back to my video which i posted in the middle of december last year saying isis
[21:22.640 --> 21:28.320]  attacks on western countries were imminent up until then that only really been one incident which
[21:28.320 --> 21:34.480]  was the attack on the canadian parliament in october since then we've had paris we've had the
[21:34.480 --> 21:41.280]  sydney siege we've had cope and hagan and of course last week we had texas so again we put out that
[21:41.280 --> 21:47.040]  warning weeks before these attacks started taking place and now they're all over twitter again saying
[21:47.040 --> 21:53.360]  they're going to attack london specific locations taking photographs of the weapons and saying that
[21:53.360 --> 22:03.840]  this attack is coming soon and we know that the fbi had picked up these last two prison recruited
[22:03.840 --> 22:11.040]  american jihadists who were being directed by isis and by islamic state itself and now they're
[22:11.040 --> 22:16.560]  saying they've got them in 48 states they're ready to strike in 15 they're ready to strike because
[22:16.560 --> 22:22.800]  they've been allowed in paul how many times did we write or cover on the radio or the news where i
[22:22.800 --> 22:29.360]  said four years ago three years ago two years ago a year ago that this jihad army that the west is
[22:29.360 --> 22:35.600]  funded nato is supported and shawty arabia has trained and coddled along with turkey and others
[22:35.600 --> 22:41.040]  was going to start striking the west and that would be used to take our basic liberties in phase two
[22:41.040 --> 22:48.480]  of the fake terror war and now it's happened exactly as i shed it would and again listeners who were
[22:48.480 --> 22:55.040]  new need to see all this i have my limited crew busy working on new news we've tried for two years
[22:55.040 --> 22:59.920]  to create a radio log to write all this down we need to search about three years ago where i kept
[22:59.920 --> 23:04.560]  saying they're going to use jihadi groups out of the middle east now that are allowed to fly back
[23:04.560 --> 23:10.480]  and forth to attack this is now happening and the government thinks we're so dumb that they're now
[23:10.480 --> 23:15.760]  not going to get the blame for funding these groups to begin with uh the good news is i saw
[23:15.760 --> 23:21.600]  mainstream news articles this week admitting that our government helped create isis and then it's
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.720]  just a new offshoot of al-qaeda and and then how can we have new terror attacks when they're going
[23:26.720 --> 23:32.080]  to leave the border wide open and let these jihadis fly back and forth remember paul it was a swat
[23:33.280 --> 23:40.640]  who even fox news had just department officials on exposing the fact that the leader of the 77
[23:40.640 --> 23:49.920]  bombings of the patsy's was mi6 and was protected so it's just incredible paul uh that this is going on
[23:51.600 --> 23:58.400]  and you know alex even before um we started arming the the so-called moderate syrian rebels
[23:58.400 --> 24:05.360]  france while along the french um president admitted recently that he broke e you e u embargo
[24:05.360 --> 24:11.920]  laws to arm those rebels illegally before any of that happens so we know it was already going on
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.480]  before that now we have reports thousands of thousands of jihadists traveling from european
[24:18.480 --> 24:24.560]  countries to syria in iraq to join isis and of course thousands more are remaining here and
[24:24.560 --> 24:31.040]  they're going to be the ones that are carrying out these attacks it is a worldwide jihad directed by
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.280]  the globalist and when it's all done they'll be given the middle east as their reward to Saudi
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.680]  arabia and the globalist will be given the west who they've protected from the very terrorist
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.360]  that they helped wind up and release in our society i mean it's crystal clear and i go back
[24:47.360 --> 24:54.080]  to two and a half years ago when senator paul and senator cruz following our lead and our listeners
[24:54.080 --> 24:58.720]  lead i've got a brag folks it was us again just like jade helman initiated the national
[24:58.720 --> 25:06.240]  international debate we forced and the military joined us in in tweeting out thousands of images
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.680]  with with military including non-commissioned officers and officers holding up their their
[25:11.680 --> 25:17.040]  pieces of paper saying i will not fight for al qaeda in syria i will not fight for jihadis i
[25:17.040 --> 25:22.160]  will not fight to do this i will not be their air force so now they just rebranded as isis and
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.440]  islamic state they've launched all these attacks and i have predicted more than 500 times what is
[25:27.440 --> 25:35.120]  now happening i have literally just just just just just just just left signpost up and read flags
[25:35.120 --> 25:43.520]  to the thousand wins all of this at nauseam until everyone was sick of saying of of hearing it and
[25:43.520 --> 25:51.200]  now it appears that they are going to let these people launch this attack and then basically
[25:51.200 --> 25:57.200]  take our basic liberties so we need again to have the military on jade helman all of it come out
[25:57.200 --> 26:04.400]  and say with signs they're holding up we know jade helm is about going after the tea party
[26:04.400 --> 26:10.400]  we need to expose it and again they want to use the military to say how dare you be against the
[26:10.400 --> 26:15.840]  military no we're not against the military we're against a mission that's unconstitutional
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.680]  shifting gears paul i want to go back into al qaeda with their new name because the the public
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.680]  wasn't scared of al qaeda anymore so now they're supposedly killing all their leadership in the
[26:25.680 --> 26:31.440]  last few months to give us the new bunch of the new generation of al qaeda same flag same people
[26:31.440 --> 26:38.400]  same funders this time though it's a real proxy army but what do you make of the jade helm coverage
[26:38.400 --> 26:46.960]  now going into the stratosphere i mean bill marr the daily show it's it's everywhere and
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.480]  what does it sound to you the story i told you how i said no only do live okay you can do live well
[26:52.480 --> 26:57.600]  now it's not live we'll pick you up three hours before show time to tape it and i say no they
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.000]  don't respond back and then send a car 12 minutes before i mean what does that sound like to you
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.280]  well it sounds like they either screwed up or did it deliberately but the thing about jade helm is
[27:09.840 --> 27:15.200]  you know where is the left most of this you know most of these demonization campaigns are coming
[27:15.200 --> 27:20.320]  from the left people like john stewart and others who suddenly seem to not give a damn about
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.920]  militarization of police martial law there are several articles today stating that you know they
[27:25.920 --> 27:32.400]  were really up in arms after bosh began to take steps with the national guard to turn that into
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.400]  more of a domestic law enforcement unit now it's a total conspiracy theory that cannot possibly
[27:38.400 --> 27:44.480]  happen under obama so there's no concern whatsoever from the left about this and in fact now they're
[27:44.480 --> 27:50.800]  you know bringing up the conspiracy theorist trope to downplay any concern about this when we know
[27:50.800 --> 27:57.040]  that it's also dual purpose if you flip the jade helm map around to the side this is also about
[27:57.040 --> 28:03.120]  occupying countries not only in the middle east but also in eastern europe as we build up for this
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.440]  new that's right it fits perfectly over eastern europe it fits perfectly over the middle east
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.240]  everything the globalists do is multifaceted that's why they call it mastering the human domain
[28:12.240 --> 28:19.840]  and we go look at all those events on c-span and and and other platforms and it's an admission
[28:19.840 --> 28:25.520]  of the total takeover of the entire world the main enemy though being veterans gun owners and others
[28:25.520 --> 28:33.040]  and that's the problem that john stewart and stefanophilus and all of them have is that
[28:33.040 --> 28:41.760]  everybody who's informed has read the mainstream media's press saying thank god the pentagon's
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.080]  training to take on gun owners thank god they're training to take on the tea party
[28:46.080 --> 28:52.480]  and veterans thank god thank god the irs is auditing and arresting people who are conservatives
[28:52.480 --> 28:59.040]  see they have a problem msnbc goes on the year i've seen it three times and i barely monitor them
[28:59.040 --> 29:04.960]  i've actually seen it live three times then praise the irs persecuting i mean these people are
[29:04.960 --> 29:12.640]  flaming totalitarians and so everybody knows this is happening who has a brain and it transcends
[29:12.640 --> 29:16.160]  right wing or left wing paul i think they've jumped the shark on this
[29:18.880 --> 29:24.640]  well i mean look at how the left reacted to syria look at how they reacted to libya they were gone
[29:24.640 --> 29:32.080]  go for those humanitarian interventions now we have us troops training syrian rebels still
[29:32.080 --> 29:38.960]  this came out just last week to quote fight isis when the majority of those rebels went and joined
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.600]  juba al nozra and we're gonna talk about that yeah that's mainstream news but we said four years ago
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.240]  see everything we say it just keeps coming true because it was already true we know what we're
[29:48.240 --> 29:54.720]  talking about we've got our you know what we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and
[29:54.720 --> 30:05.360]  the gcn radio network texas rep louis gomert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually
[30:05.360 --> 30:10.960]  doing their job and addressing the concerns of their citizens gomert says he understands the
[30:10.960 --> 30:16.800]  concerns texans have about the upcoming jade helm exercise the congressman took particular issue
[30:16.800 --> 30:23.280]  with the maps labeling of republican majority states as hostile gomert called on the pentagon to
[30:23.280 --> 30:29.200]  change the map the names on the map and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely
[30:29.200 --> 30:34.560]  revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own
[30:34.560 --> 30:40.320]  states former texas governor and potential presidential candidate rick perry has some
[30:40.320 --> 30:45.920]  different thoughts though perry said it's okay to question your government but the military
[30:45.920 --> 30:51.600]  is something else lienne makati reporting for info wars nightly news to keep up with all of the

[31:03.760 --> 31:08.560]  it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true

[31:25.920 --> 31:31.040]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[31:31.040 --> 31:35.680]  working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that

[33:33.920 --> 33:38.800]  loyalty to the government when it deserves it if mark twain we're alive today i think he would
[33:38.800 --> 33:44.880]  quickly conclude that loyalty to our government lost its due right after 9 11 hello ladies and
[33:44.880 --> 33:54.720]  gentlemen i'm so glad that you could join us today for this wednesday july 25th 2001 broadcast
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.000]  tyranny is enveloping the globe and the united states is shining jewel the globalists want to
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.160]  bring down and they will use terrorism as the pretext to get it done look we've seen the news
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.720]  stories that you've wanted to blow things up that you have blown things up and that you're saying
[34:08.720 --> 34:12.800]  that four million of us are going to die we need marshal law and the associated press
[34:12.800 --> 34:18.240]  and one of your little drills you had and that we're aware of who the terrorist are if you pull
[34:18.240 --> 34:23.760]  this this can stop this hit larian rise stag event i want to put the toll free number up for congress
[34:25.520 --> 34:30.400]  and i won't want you to believe alex jones i want you to go get these news stories off my website
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.200]  i want you to call these major newspapers i want you to find out these statements were true
[34:35.200 --> 34:41.200]  by the white house about preparing for marshal law and i want you to let them know that if there is
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.440]  any terrorism we know who to blame we have a congress that has an approval rating that is no
[34:47.440 --> 34:55.280]  longer detectable by current technology a growing public awareness that the war of drugs has been
[34:55.280 --> 35:03.120]  manufactured by the cia and organized by the dea if you want to collect content on the american
[35:03.120 --> 35:08.160]  then a court order is issued they are not the national security agency is not listening to
[35:08.160 --> 35:14.160]  americans phone calls and it is not reading americans emails none of this programs allow that as a
[35:14.160 --> 35:19.760]  matter of fact the patriot act and that part of that 702 says it is explicitly prohibited by law
[35:19.760 --> 35:25.760]  that you can read and and and holy surveilled domestic uh email traffic in the united states
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.560]  even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded and the the storage
[35:30.560 --> 35:37.360]  capability of these systems increases every year consistently by orders of magnitude you simply
[35:37.360 --> 35:42.480]  have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody even by a wrong call and then they can
[35:42.480 --> 35:49.200]  use the system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made and attack you on
[35:49.200 --> 35:56.240]  that basis to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent life and paint anyone in the context of
[35:56.240 --> 36:05.440]  a wrongdoer government law enforcement namely the fbi nsa dhs and tsa illegally read our correspondences
[36:05.440 --> 36:11.120]  and listen to our communications while sexually fondling our families all in the name of national
[36:11.120 --> 36:17.680]  security which pitifully adds up to national insecurity we have a military that is exponentially
[36:17.680 --> 36:24.560]  raping female soldiers wives of soldiers and any female unfortunate enough to live near a military
[36:24.560 --> 36:32.080]  base i don't know how you can say that having 19 000 sexual assaults and rapes a year is disciplined
[36:32.080 --> 36:38.640]  in order i do not understand how you can say that of those 19 000 cases to only have approximately
[36:38.640 --> 36:45.280]  2400 even reported because the victims tell us that they are afraid to report because of retaliation
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.800]  and the blame they will get and the scorn they will get from their colleagues is order and
[36:48.800 --> 36:55.120]  discipline and i really cannot understand how 2400 cases only 240 of which go to trial
[36:55.120 --> 37:03.680]  can be resolved in you believing that that authority is giving you discipline there there is
[37:03.680 --> 37:14.880]  something that that seems odd about the the power to to reject findings that came out of a of a
[37:14.880 --> 37:23.200]  jury in the absence of of some major obvious problem meanwhile the quiet rollout of bill clinton's
[37:23.200 --> 37:30.640]  1033 program mushrooming into the ndaa has been building the militarized police force goiath while
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.840]  genuine usurpers beat down a path to the highest branches of our government but i welcome this
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.240]  kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook
[37:40.880 --> 37:51.840]  well i'm not a crook what is at stake is more than one small country it is a big idea a new world
[37:51.840 --> 37:57.840]  order the problem of the push precedence will be the emergence of a new international order
[37:58.720 --> 38:04.480]  within the next four years we will see the emergence of a new international that is only
[38:04.480 --> 38:11.120]  the first four minutes of a eight minute report that john bound did the air to the nightly news
[38:11.120 --> 38:17.040]  last week mark twain would be ashamed to be an american today it's on info wars dot com and we're
[38:17.040 --> 38:24.320]  going to tweet it out again at real alex jones there's another very important interview that
[38:24.320 --> 38:30.480]  leon macadoo did and then aired friday on the nightly news and that was oldest world war two
[38:30.480 --> 38:36.560]  vet in the world world's oldest world war two vet speaks out he talks about the second amendment
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.760]  you name it very interesting uh interview we'll get that posted and to info wars and facebook and
[38:41.760 --> 38:48.160]  twitter uh as well for tv and radio listeners uh shifting gears back into our top story
[38:49.360 --> 38:56.880]  it all ties together you have the west training the free syrian army which is 90 al-qaeda isis
[38:57.760 --> 39:03.680]  we've had colonel shaffer on others to document that uh now major think tanks i've got to hear
[39:03.680 --> 39:13.760]  my stack uh have come out brookings you name it uh and said yes we confirmed in fact here's one of
[39:13.760 --> 39:20.960]  them uh confirmed u.s operation rooms backing al-qaeda in syria u.s policy think tank brookings
[39:21.520 --> 39:28.080]  institution confirms that contrary to propaganda u.s saudi moderates and turkey katar islamists
[39:28.080 --> 39:35.200]  have been coordinating all along and then they're coordinating and commanding the groups in america
[39:35.200 --> 39:45.520]  the uk and the e u so do you understand i've told you this 500 times in the last four years or more
[39:46.720 --> 39:54.640]  500 conservative and now i said you'll see him hit schools convention centers shopping malls
[39:54.640 --> 40:02.560]  universities things like that and they won't have to have totally control groups these are
[40:02.560 --> 40:09.440]  mentally ill bots hired by the jihadi commanders who themselves are funded and protected by the west
[40:09.440 --> 40:16.800]  and who can fly all over the world paul this is reached outer limits on lsd this is reached
[40:16.800 --> 40:27.120]  twilight zone on pcp this has reached uh bonker land dmt crazy town uh that our governments would
[40:27.120 --> 40:33.200]  do this publicly thinking they won't get caught or get in trouble this is after the military
[40:33.200 --> 40:38.800]  figured out what was going on and said no two years ago they just changed the name to isis had
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.400]  them invade iraq to resupply with our military ordered to drop stuff to the curds but really it's
[40:44.400 --> 40:50.160]  to them i mean this is so transparent so obvious uh cy hersh came out two years ago and said the
[40:50.160 --> 40:56.880]  whole bin laden thing's fake didn't happen he got put under pressure so now he's come out the two
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.760]  time Pulitzer prize winner and said well you know they basically raided a safe house and you know
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.880]  shot him but nobody else shot at him and most of the story is not true and those are stage photos
[41:06.880 --> 41:13.520]  in the situation room blah blah blah no it's beyond that paul watson finishing up with this
[41:13.520 --> 41:18.000]  and getting into the huge news of isis saying they're about to hit with imminent attacks
[41:18.000 --> 41:27.760]  showing the bombs and the and the packaging of the the the the shrapnel weapons uh the the
[41:27.760 --> 41:34.720]  fragmentation devices that they're going to use this is unprecedented uh and do you think this
[41:34.720 --> 41:39.200]  is a western intelligence agency doing this to get more funding or do you think they're really
[41:39.200 --> 41:47.040]  about to green light their 200 000 man jihad force paid for by us british and e u taxpayers
[41:48.320 --> 41:52.160]  well there's kind of a disconnect isn't there alex where people say well
[41:52.160 --> 41:58.480]  you know isis doesn't exist it's all cia whatever but we created these people by training the syrian
[41:58.480 --> 42:03.440]  rebels in the first place some of whom went on to join juba al-nuzra who then pledged allegiance to
[42:03.440 --> 42:10.160]  isis so you can follow the trail what's now emerging is these images of explosives weapons
[42:10.160 --> 42:16.240]  and suicide belts aren't to be found anywhere else on the internet which suggests that these
[42:16.240 --> 42:22.000]  individuals on twitter didn't just grab these pictures from google images and post them on twitter
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.720]  the actual original images and then one of the accounts that's making these threats is reportedly
[42:28.720 --> 42:35.760]  affiliated with another individual or an account uh affiliated with the garland attack of course we
[42:35.760 --> 42:42.640]  know that threat was tweeted out 15 minutes before the first shots were fired so it appears
[42:42.640 --> 42:50.320]  that this is a genuine threat it's not just um wannabe isis sympathizers it's actual terrorists
[42:50.320 --> 42:56.240]  who are tweeting out these images of explosives uh most of the accounts have now been suspended
[42:56.240 --> 43:02.880]  uh since we put our article out but it's it's a drastic concern because we saw it happen just
[43:02.880 --> 43:08.080]  just over a week ago in garland and we had our facebook suspended it was going to be for a lengthy
[43:08.080 --> 43:13.920]  period but backlash they put it back up because we were exposing these grips i mean there's a clear
[43:13.920 --> 43:19.440]  bias against free speech and folks listen the government knows what's going on the establishment
[43:19.440 --> 43:24.800]  knows even the decompartmentalized you know you know groups out there don't really like what's
[43:24.800 --> 43:29.040]  happening it's very small criminal groups that are doing this and most of the government is
[43:29.040 --> 43:36.000]  compartmentalized the reason this show is so popular amongst government around the world is
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.200]  they know we know what we're talking about and imagine they can't go anywhere else and hear
[43:41.200 --> 43:49.360]  these real issues actually broken down but it's not because we're special it's because the mainstream
[43:49.360 --> 43:55.920]  media is bought and paid for and as the late gore vidal who i had the pleasure to interview five
[43:55.920 --> 44:02.320]  different times once in person an amazing mind to keep information from the public is the function
[44:02.320 --> 44:09.200]  of the corporate media gore vidal and boy talk about the apple falling far from the tree that's
[44:09.200 --> 44:15.520]  al gore's uncle uh but he exposed 9 11 as an inside job he exposed synthetic tear and how the west
[44:15.520 --> 44:22.000]  uh was funding jihadi groups and now it's all come out 14 years after we first broke it that
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.280]  saudi arabia bare minimum was protected and allowed the attacks of 9 11 to take place and
[44:27.280 --> 44:36.240]  financed them and for that i was royally demonized royally attacked i had the system go after me at
[44:36.240 --> 44:45.840]  every single level and i'm not here wanting you to say oh thank you you're a hero i want you to
[44:45.840 --> 44:51.360]  understand the intel we've got the understanding we've got the info we've got the narrative we've
[44:51.360 --> 44:59.760]  got is dead bang on we know the enemy we know who they are we know the globalist master plan we
[44:59.760 --> 45:04.080]  know their long-term program we know their tricks we know their playbooks we understand their
[45:04.080 --> 45:14.800]  operations and that's why every day 200 to 500 news articles misrepresenting lying building strawmen
[45:14.800 --> 45:23.920]  attacking us the globalist are really freaked out because they know that we got their number
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.880]  they know that people like cy harsh were in communication with us asking us questions
[45:30.880 --> 45:36.880]  about sources and things like that they know i've got real sources they've tried to dry them all up
[45:36.880 --> 45:42.640]  but people are just sick of it and are just are talking what do you think governor abbott knows
[45:42.640 --> 45:49.360]  what do you think senator cruise knows as much as i know they know even more and here's my job
[45:49.360 --> 45:56.720]  and here's paul watson's job and here's my great cruise job we're here to make it safe to talk about
[45:56.720 --> 46:01.760]  this stuff to hit the bar bar first to lead the assault team in the info war to take the machine
[46:01.760 --> 46:08.800]  gun nest the pillbox we're here to take the heat walk point come under attack hit it get everybody
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.680]  looking at the documents so that it's safe for everybody else to follow and that's fine i'm charging
[46:13.680 --> 46:21.360]  all the way in leading the assault but just understand we are the tip of the spear the very
[46:21.360 --> 46:27.440]  front line and if we can hold the globalist back and expose their programs and expose the
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.640]  private federal reserve and expose the globalist and get other talk show hosts doing it and other
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.440]  writers and research doing it they'll be so many of us will reach critical mass they can't stop us
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.320]  or shut us all down and ladies and gentlemen i believe we've already crossed that point
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.760]  and the enemy was arrogant and that's why they're freaking out right now and and listen i'm angry
[46:47.760 --> 46:57.680]  behind the scenes i'm frustrated i want to do a better job i want to reach more people i want to
[46:57.680 --> 47:05.200]  be able to give you all the research and data i want to defeat these people this is real this
[47:05.200 --> 47:11.600]  isn't a game it's not an act this is the real deal because i've looked at the enemy i've looked in
[47:11.600 --> 47:16.080]  the enemy's eyes i've studied the enemy paul watson spend a few minutes we're gonna let you go i
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.800]  appreciate your time and the great work you're doing you've been hammering out articles you
[47:20.800 --> 47:25.200]  you wrote a quick one while we were busy uh you know when you were on hold for 20 minutes
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.640]  seymour hirsch flashback bin laden raid one big lie we're also posting separately where we
[47:30.640 --> 47:38.160]  expose the full hoax uh of the bin laden killing we're going to post those interviews
[47:39.040 --> 47:45.200]  up to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com because quite frankly i like sir hirsch but
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.120]  we're the ones that expose it day two we're the ones that have the navy seal families on
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.960]  we're the ones that took the risk and uh we're just so conservative about ourselves here that we
[47:54.960 --> 48:01.360]  won't even ever ever talk about what we've done or what we've been right about there is a law
[48:02.160 --> 48:09.360]  that i can't break somehow like a force field to to to to to take where we said what was happening
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.800]  and and ever exposed that we were right but but we're going to break it today the the videos will
[48:14.800 --> 48:20.160]  go up in their own article on info wars dot com paul watch them before we go to break um
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.480]  the state of the world where do you think the elite are what do you think is unfolding right now
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.680]  well geopolitically they're pouring gasoline on the fire alex i mean look at this headline out of
[48:33.680 --> 48:40.880]  cbs from four days ago us troops begin training syrian rebels to fire isis after everything we've
[48:40.880 --> 48:47.520]  been through after the libya catastrophe after the near mutiny in the us military before the
[48:48.080 --> 48:54.240]  invasion the attack on syria which was stored at last minute they're still sending us troops to
[48:54.240 --> 49:01.200]  train these rebels flooding the region with weapons arming the rebels who have defected to isis and
[49:01.200 --> 49:07.200]  these other jihadist groups time and time again and then you look at what's happening in ukraine
[49:07.200 --> 49:13.840]  wall street journal last month reported us army starts to train ukraine units you actually dig
[49:13.840 --> 49:20.560]  into who these units are these brigades it's the as of battalion which likes to string people upon
[49:20.560 --> 49:26.960]  crosses and set fire to them we had the video last month literally nailing one of these
[49:26.960 --> 49:33.200]  separatist fighters to a cross setting fire to him as he burns to death those are the people
[49:33.200 --> 49:39.440]  that us troops are now training in ukraine they're doing the same thing with more bloodthirsty
[49:39.440 --> 49:46.000]  militants in syria so how could we be surprised that these attacks which thankfully in the case
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.600]  of garland have proven to be sporadic and limited so far but how can we be surprised that these
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.960]  attacks are now going to be hitting the west after our own governments have encouraged this for
[49:56.960 --> 50:03.040]  years and years at every single turn and the motive is let them attack have the mainstream media
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.280]  never point out that our own governments funded them created them protected them and allow them
[50:07.280 --> 50:12.160]  to attack and then bet your bottom dollar we're going to be attacked when more attacks happen
[50:12.160 --> 50:18.480]  paul uh for pointing out that our government allowed it to happen bare minimum and now these
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.840]  isis jihadists here's a tweet americans take pride in carrying handguns what's your little gun
[50:23.840 --> 50:30.240]  going to do when an iad ied explodes spraying shrapnel faster than sound so they're now um
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.280]  dehumanizing the second amendment they're total cowards and exactly our government's going to
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.360]  say roll over give your rights when we get attacked when we get attacked by their isis slobs
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.240]  we're going to hold our traitorous government accountable we're putting the narrative out now

[53:58.800 --> 54:07.360]  i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind
[54:08.960 --> 54:16.080]  there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions have an echo and so much space
[54:20.400 --> 54:24.640]  and when you're out there without care yeah i was out of touch
[54:24.640 --> 54:28.240]  but it wasn't because i didn't know enough
[54:31.440 --> 54:33.200]  i just knew too much
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.640]  i'm gonna be honest i was gonna tell folks a story about what happened at about 32
[54:40.640 --> 54:46.800]  after i'm in here during the break i'm looking at all this news i know the globalist plan i
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.040]  know what they're gonna do how they're gonna take us over how they're gonna enslave us i've already
[54:51.040 --> 54:58.240]  seen 80 of their plan put in place in the last 20 plus years and i just knocked my microphone right
[54:58.240 --> 55:05.440]  off the table and broke it just involuntarily because i'm so frustrated watching these crimes
[55:05.440 --> 55:10.720]  be committed watching our prosperity our security our freedom destroyed i have three children
[55:10.720 --> 55:20.480]  thank god we had a couple backup mics i mean this is real folks do you understand
[55:21.280 --> 55:30.080]  our government's been hijacked it it funded al qaeda to come in out of the east
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.040]  in Benghazi and to take over that country and to kill tens of thousands of innocent people
[55:37.040 --> 55:41.840]  to destabilize it destroy it and they go oh we screwed up that's the plan for the whole middle
[55:41.840 --> 55:49.520]  east that's the plan for year our government's putting radicals in they're giving the radicals
[55:50.080 --> 55:55.760]  they're bounty for being part of 9 11 and taking the blame for that false flag this is them being
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.400]  paid off saudi arabia being given the whole middle east who were british intelligence
[56:01.360 --> 56:04.720]  you can go to youtube and just type in alex jones breaks down history of the soddies
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.120]  from about a year ago and i go over how they took over the whole middle east how they were
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.840]  going to attack us what they're going to do in fact that's one place to find all this how in 1903
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.440]  they started by 1933 they had the whole middle east british intelligence funding them this is
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.440]  a plan paul watson's wrote about it we've broken it down and we're seeing it paul that's when i knew
[56:25.440 --> 56:30.480]  they were giving them real weapons recruiting out of the west letting them fly back and forth
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.120]  it was so clear how do they launch the next terror wave how do they make it bigger than 9 11
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.400]  well you just turn lose tens of thousands of jihadis in your country and then let them hit you
[56:41.920 --> 56:44.880]  paul do you think the establishment in closing can get away with this
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.560]  well yeah if they continue doing it i don't see what's stopping them i mean we've got politically
[56:52.560 --> 56:58.000]  correct concern about oh there are these thousands of young people impressionable young people going
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.040]  over to syria to fight for ices how are we going to get them back why the hell would we want them
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.880]  back that's right there's bbc articles about we need to bring back the jihadis and put them through
[57:08.880 --> 57:16.080]  a seminar to deradicalize them that's the cover to bring them back to attack paul it's amazing i got
[57:16.080 --> 57:20.720]  an idea i got an idea they're over there blowing up churches and killing people how about we grab them
[57:20.720 --> 57:24.080]  when they come back and if they've committed crimes how about we give them a trial and execute
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.640]  their ass for war crimes how about a nuremberg trial and how about a nuremberg trial for the
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.400]  people that trained them in our government how about that paul that's what sounds good to me
[57:34.320 --> 57:40.080]  and then the whole narrative in the media is you know pamela gallo was being provocative
[57:40.080 --> 57:45.440]  for drawing these cartoons it's not about the frigging cartoons when you've got ices members
[57:45.440 --> 57:50.880]  who are linked to the garland attack openly threatening to attack london giving precise
[57:50.880 --> 57:58.160]  locations and cnn's still you know impugning pamela gallo for holding this muhammad our exhibit
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.720]  so we're not we can't rely on the mainstream media to draw attention to any of this because they've

[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.240]  he's a friend of mine i've met him hung out with him been involved with him he's a very nice guy
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:45.680]  he's a trailblazer he's written a bunch of bestselling books the first one i read was like
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:53.360]  19 years ago i thought it was completely crazy and so much of it then began to come true uh he said
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:59.200]  and named pedophiles at the bbc here about 12 years ago and i delayed him i delayed him and
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:05.760]  said david you can't say names on air uh that haven't been caught yet uh and with the jimmy
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:12.560]  savel and others it all came out just as he said the hidden rooms the torture rooms the necrophilia
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.320]  all of it and it just goes on and on uh david ike was the top bbc presenter on entertainment and
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:26.640]  sports show champion uh golly he was the head of the green party a rising star uh until he
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.760]  had a vision and it took him years to extrapolate everything that happened in the vision when he
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.880]  was in peru say what you want about it a mega brainstorm of your atheist whatever the point
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:42.080]  is he's a very interesting individual and i remember reading one of his books i didn't forget
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.160]  which one about 10 years ago when i was starting to think maybe maybe this guy's on to something
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.200]  more than i thought he was saying the whole universe is a hologram held together by an
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.960]  artificial energy source well last year mit came out with these new dark matter sensors
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.720]  will pull those articles up and they said there's something artificial holding reality together
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.600]  another energy source much larger much more powerful and science daily wrote a new article
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.720]  about this a few weeks ago april 27th is the universe a hologram vienna university of technology
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.880]  and says that their mathematical equations but also models but also testing in the lab is showing
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:28.880]  uh that reality is a projection and so i wanted to get david ike on to talk about this to the
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:35.200]  bottom of the hour then we're going to shift gears into isis and global destabilization
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.640]  and the pedophile rings and what's at the bottom of the spider hole uh david ike dot com
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:48.400]  um is his uh website he's written 16 books uh and he is uh again on the year where this is
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.760]  first big book the one that i read was the biggest secret uh thank you so much for coming on
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.840]  pleasure alex uh there's a lot to get through where are you right now are you out there on the
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.960]  isle of man isle of whites um the um difference between the isle of man and the isle is the uh
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:14.320]  the isle of man has um uh it's a tax haven uh so the isle of whites not that's where i
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.800]  well it's it's certainly beautiful out there i haven't been in that particular area but i've
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.880]  seen videos of it david there's so much to get into i want to talk about the state of the world
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:29.200]  with you but let's talk about the state of reality well the thing is alex you know um i
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:37.440]  i've been on this just past 25 years um just uh about three or four weeks ago and i've had as
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:45.600]  much ridicule and condemnation from the alternative media much of it because i have from the mainstream
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:56.800]  media because my interest is not having a statue built to me or um being uh fated as as anything
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:04.400]  it is quite simple it is to get to the bottom of what the heck the hell is happening in this world
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:11.840]  and what this world is and when you do that it means all the shackles have to come off your
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:20.800]  mind your credulity and and you have to become open not to believing everything but open to all
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:29.280]  possibility and letting the information be your guide rather than preconceived idea and so that's
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:38.080]  what i've done i followed the information and it's taken me into some very uh on the face of it strange
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:46.640]  areas and to some strange and to many people extreme conclusions but i've said all along that if
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:58.880]  what you say has validity then you will eventually be shown to be in some kind of sense and so
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.080]  you know everyone in the alternative media has to take uh ridicule dismissal and condemnation
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:14.080]  to an extent because they are challenging the accepted pro brand norms that people are uh
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:22.320]  uh downloading out their lives from cradle to grave but if you keep going beyond where the
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.200]  majority if you like the mainstream of the alternative media is then you get the same
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:36.640]  treatment from them that you get from the mainstream media but like i say if you're interested in
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:42.720]  the rather than the popularity contest then you keep speaking your truth you keep researching
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:50.640]  your truth and if it is true then at some point it's going to be shown to be sold and what is
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:57.760]  happening now with some of these more uh these stranger areas of what i've been thinking about
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.920]  like the nature of the holographic reality that we live in is that mainstream scientific
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.000]  programs and studies there's another one at the university of bonnie and there are others around
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:19.280]  the world are concluding that actually the mathematics the science um puts the fact that we are living in
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:28.240]  uh a reality that is solid in the way that we experience it and we perceive it but actually
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:42.080]  not solid in its base form if you um look at uh um a ecosystem what you have um behind
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.840]  in here is a screen and on that's our words and there are pictures and there can be moving pictures
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:58.880]  um but that's not because the moving pictures and words and uh what have your graphics have
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:06.720]  actually been uh put into the computer in that form they go into this tower or they come off the
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:15.360]  internet in the form of electronic codes and um electronic um sequences to processes it's the
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:24.080]  computer that decodes the information into what we see on the screen which is very different to the
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:31.440]  form that it actually takes before it's coded and what we're uh what we call in the human body
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:40.640]  is a biological computer biological um in the sense that it's still a technological computer
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:48.960]  in the instead of like a desktop it takes data and it decodes it according to the way it's told to
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:56.960]  and and it's programmed to become a biological computer can take information and it can assess
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:03.440]  it and it can make decisions upon it which is the body's doing all the time what we call the immune
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:11.520]  system um is not something that we we have to um interact with all the time we don't have to we
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.240]  don't have to say oh immune system is something wrong down there with me leg and you go and have
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:25.760]  a look the immune system is constantly seeing the the body computer and it is making decisions on
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:32.560]  what it's going to do as a result of that otherwise we'd all be dead and so in the same way
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:41.520]  the biological computer we call the body is decoding information from this um this matrix
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.400]  this is logically in the end although much beyond any technology we can imagine this
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:56.960]  technologically generated information source and sources and we are therefore um seeing and appearing
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:03.840]  to experience a world that appears to be solid that appears to be three-dimensional but it's
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:10.800]  actually holographic and if you look at what holographs are that we actually combine the shops
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:17.280]  they appear to be three-dimensional but they're actually not the base form of this reality the
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:23.360]  base form of the body the base form of everything in this reality is an information field and
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:30.160]  and we then decode the information from that into an apparently three-dimensional world and
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:38.480]  a solid world which as quantum physics has absolutely shown to be the case a solid world
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:46.320]  that cannot possibly be solid now why is this important Alex it's because it's with this knowledge
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:55.360]  that those just deep deep in the shadows beyond the politicians beyond the um the bankers um
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:01.200]  in in in the way that they um operate the banking system beyond the corporation would you call them
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:11.040]  the visitors the well beyond beyond that which we we can see indeed within the human world beyond
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:17.520]  that we can we can see i mean the idea now among anyone with a brain on active duty that people
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.000]  who are apparently in power like politicians and presidents and prime ministers are actually the
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.200]  ones calling the shots it's completely untenable of totally ludicrous but what i'm saying is beyond
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:35.840]  that beyond what we see in the shadows they know the nature of our reality therefore they are using
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:41.680]  that knowledge i guess stay there your skype's cutting up a bit david it's an excellent point
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.640]  when to come back and recap that and then ask the question how are they understanding how the
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.560]  world really works manipulating it and towards what in because undoubtedly all the subliminals

[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:26.560]  worldwide it's alex jones we're talking about the mysteries of the universe and i remember
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:30.480]  over 10 years ago reading a david ick book and having him on and talking about a hologramic
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:36.320]  reality and an artificial hack holding it all together and then mit came out two years ago
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.160]  in fact i ought to google and find that article we're showing a few new ones today different
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.840]  universities saying basically the same thing that there's an artificial power source
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.920]  holding it all artificially together the dark matter and the different dimensional
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.480]  equations that are out there but regardless it's good to think about big things and transcend
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:02.640]  the little globalist who want to wall us in to an even smaller reality everything they do
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.840]  is about dumbing people down destroying their creativity their imagination and we can see
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:17.200]  this war accelerating a desperate attempt to ridicule questioning anything so i think david
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:24.000]  ike's very healthy uh in that he simply transcends their whole false debate
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:33.440]  this is a short segment long segment coming up david i've been researching this myself 25 years
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:41.280]  i've been on air 20 and the deeper i research it you just come to the realization this isn't
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.800]  even good for the elites as you said the super puppets the super class when you get to the
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:53.680]  bottom of the rabbit hole as far as i've gone it's a hatred of life a hatred of humans a hatred of
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:00.800]  anything wholesome and and and good and real sustainability uh it it's it's just blackered
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:08.400]  and hell uh it is it is a spirit of evil and if you're christian you say it's the devil if you're
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.720]  you know a hindu i guess something similar but but the point is it's real and there seem to be
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:21.040]  people that are energized possessed running that program in their mind and then you look at the
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:25.600]  research and i've infiltrated bohemian grove as you know i've covered skull and bones i mean
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:33.360]  i mean even an atheist would look at this and say these people really believe they're getting
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:39.520]  divine information from dark entities that that that want human blood in every culture and you've
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:44.240]  talked about that you've written books about that so regardless from a sociology anthropology
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:50.640]  perspective why does this keep manifesting and then you just go further but then say so many other
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:56.320]  things that i mean you were the first person i heard 20 years ago talking about pedophiles
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.280]  running england now it's confirmed now they say national security can't investigate uh i'm taking
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.120]  up your time here just just it just blows me away what are they trying to suppress what reality
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:13.920]  are they trying to suppress what's the in-game david uh ike right i'm on the phone now just uh
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.200]  you can see yes it's crystal clear now thank you sir audio yeah well just from what you've
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:25.280]  kind of listed there alex i mean i could speak for like two hours because there's so many elements
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:34.640]  to it but what you were talking about is summed up by a word i've used over and over over the years
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:44.800]  and that's inversion we are living in an inversion and therefore a world that could be about love
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:54.560]  uh that could be about harmony is inverted so it's about hatred it's about this harmony uh or that's
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:02.960]  what this uh network both seen and hidden is trying to create and so when you talk about
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:12.160]  these entities um which go under endless names i mean you know one of the frustrating things alex
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:19.760]  is when i hear people who follow various religions who who say you know things that i say overload
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.960]  and nonsense or is anti their religion uh they should they should read their religious books a
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:33.600]  bit more because um what um some cultures refer to and ancient cultures and peoples refer to as
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:41.920]  archons i.e. non-human entities manipulating our world through um these networks that we talk about and
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:50.000]  expose so the christians talk about demons exactly the same thing in the islamic belief system they
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.920]  talk about jinn same thing in in uh central america shaman talk about the flyers same thing in um
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:06.320]  at the zulu culture of south africa they talk about the chita hurry same thing it's an universal theme
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:17.520]  and what these entities another universal theme feed off is the energy of death and suffering um
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:24.240]  you know when that's your energy source what do you want to do you want to create more and more
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:34.560]  of that energy source so what happens you create a society a fake reality a a matrix that is designed
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:41.360]  and a hierarchical structure of power and in position that is designed to create maximum
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.320]  amounts of that energy well said david ike dot com we've got to go to break give me the form we
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:55.600]  come back 18 minute segment coming up we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:04.640]  radio network and now for a news story that you won't hear on the big pharma run mainstream media

[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:59.040]  what you see in the movie prometheus that's what mit and harvard even the new york times the majority
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:06.720]  of their scientists believe that the planet was terraformed that we were put here the elites believe
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:12.640]  that they're another species from us that's in the bbc and other major publications this is what
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:20.000]  they believe and then you've got david ike a top news presenter making millions of you know pounds
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.040]  over the years very successful a shining star in the uk media the head of the green party
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:35.360]  and he basically likes i guess you can say like sol of tarsus on the roads of the mascus gets knocked
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:40.560]  down heat stroke whatever you want to call it i want him to talk about that briefly and suddenly
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:49.280]  has all this information and again he didn't have a motive to do all this when he was already on top
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:55.760]  he was ridiculed for a decade intensely was like the joke he can tell you the story but i followed it
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:03.040]  and so regardless he's got amazing courage and so much of what he said scientifically
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.480]  politically has come true and i want to cover the waterfront because it's hard to get david
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.720]  icon he's a busy guy maybe he can stay a few minutes in the next hour but that was a short segment
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.200]  day but i want to give you the floor about what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole and then tying
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.200]  it in but but you look at the environmental movement it ignores genetic engineering it ignores
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:27.200]  the nuclear reactors 90% leaking a new one in the u.s had an explosion and they shut down a reactor
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:34.960]  it's not even hardly news uh the elite themselves don't care about the planet but they have a
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.760]  predatory hatred of their fellow humans and are teaching us that human life is worthless
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:45.760]  and teaching us not to stand up for each other and teaching us this inverse you know they say the
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:51.680]  star symbolizes a human they had two arms two legs the pentagram is a human upside down but
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:57.840]  they're selling this and i see this glare in people's eyes who succumb to the spirit of the world
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:05.520]  versus those of us that not that i'm perfect more and more are going towards love and and freedom
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:13.440]  and and compassion and being empowered so i see a an acceleration towards a a paradox where there's
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.480]  a huge amount of people awake and and intensifying their understanding but also a large group of
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:23.920]  people that are going to get crazier and crazier and more turned over uh to this crazed spirit
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:29.200]  david ike you've got the floor for the next 15 minutes thanks thanks alex i wish i had made
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:36.320]  millions the bbc uh uh but um yeah but she were one of the top people in the country according
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.320]  to mainline news articles yeah i i yeah but um yeah i was on the television a lot but um uh
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.880]  millions my goodness me uh you know i don't use to wear um bbc jacket small checks you know um
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:55.920]  but anyway um what we're talking about here is um i would suggest where um the alternative media
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:02.080]  needs to start turning its head because much of the alternative media now i'm not knocking it
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.920]  i mean hold my hand up anyone is putting out information that's suppressed and this network
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:11.680]  doesn't want out round of applause i say but much of it is walking around the edge of the rabbit
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:19.920]  hole it's not actually in it in it yet so deep uh does it go we have a situation where to answer
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:26.240]  your question and people say this all the time why would they destroy the planet why would they
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:35.120]  have the Fukushima's why would they be um filling our atmosphere with staggering millions and millions
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:43.600]  of times more radiation than there was 50 years ago um why are they creating this what transformed
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.480]  radiation atmospheric reality what about the chem trials and their part in all this what's
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:56.240]  going on why would they do this because um we have to i would suggest face the fact
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:04.400]  that we are being manipulated and this planet is being taken over this uh reality of ours is
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:11.360]  being taken over by entities that operate beyond human sight and human sight is so narrow it's almost
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:18.640]  laughable what scientists call visible light it's a tiny almost infinitesimal fraction of what there
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:27.760]  is to see and because we through these biological computers can only see a certain ind just ridiculously
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:34.880]  i can't tell you narrow frequency band uh which we see as a visual world um it means that anything
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:42.000]  that is on a different frequency to that band which is in effect everything else that exists um we
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:50.800]  um we can't see and these uh entities and this force operates outside of our most of the time
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:58.000]  outside of our frequency band that we can actually uh see but what it does because it's an inversion
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:04.800]  an inversion of the natural order the natural order is about love it's about balance it's about
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:11.680]  harmony so what we have is an inversion of the of the natural order that's their world i mean this
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:18.240]  is where the religions talk about you know the the the hell and all that stuff and what they're doing
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:27.120]  is seeking to change our world into theirs so they can take it over and what they've done
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:35.840]  up to this point is create a network of hybrid interbreeding bloodlines that we call royalty
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:43.200]  right back into history what what what why were the royals um of all the cultures um claiming the
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:50.160]  right to rule because of their bloodline because it was the bloodlines as they saw it of the gods
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.480]  which is how they perceive these entities and then uh when the um the people started to reject over
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.400]  royal dictatorship they went into the dark suits they became the bankers the major politicians
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.520]  they became the corporate heads they became the people that um run uh our society our world
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.600]  both in the in the world that we can see and in the shadows now from your view are they are they
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:22.000]  interdimensionally possessed like the bible would say or or are they actually genetically uh uh
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.640]  hybrids well um both for this reason um what we've got as i mentioned earlier what we've
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:34.800]  got to start to realize if we're going to grasp this um situation that we're facing is what we
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.880]  see as a three-dimensional world solid world i.e the body is a projection exactly what these
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.360]  scientists are talking about it's a projection it's a projection from the base form which is the
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:56.960]  energetic field um just as this uh these pictures on a computer are a decoded representation of
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:08.880]  information in other forms within the computer therefore um what um we are um experiencing
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:16.000]  is a fake reality because what we are um experiencing as the three-dimensional world
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.720]  is not the uh place of love and harmony and uh balance that it should be but an increasing
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:30.640]  inversion of it which is what the opposite of that because these uh entities feed off the
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:39.680]  frequency of death because everything has a frequency of suffering of um deprivation
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:46.080]  of fear this is the the major four letter word that controls the world it means that
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:53.440]  there to take over our reality they have to generate maximum amounts of that energy so they
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:00.560]  have structured society through these bloodlines that end up in the positions of power to create
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:08.640]  maximum amounts of that energy so look through no human history endless wars endless suffering
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:15.760]  endless deprivation hunger destruction getting more and more all the time and what they're doing
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:24.720]  is imposing their world their inverted world upon us and the more they do so the more power they have
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:31.760]  to influence this world because we're getting closer in frequency to where they are and so when you
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:40.880]  look at the word live what is the word live inverted written backwards evil what we call
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:51.280]  evil is just an inversion of the natural order of life of joy of love and the idea is that they
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:43:00.240]  eventually so transform our energetic frequency state that our world literally becomes theirs
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:07.760]  and they won't even need their bloodlines then um um what we've um what we need is like an avatar
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.080]  they've got humans that operate as their earth suits they want to change the atmosphere like
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.160]  terraforming us to then take over completely yeah i mean there are certain movies in fact more and
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.600]  more movies alex that actually mirror this um and and what's happening now classically what i'm
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:30.000]  describing in terms of this fake reality that we decode and and believe therefore to be real is the
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.720]  matrix the the world depicted by the matrix trilogy is absolutely the one that we live in
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:44.320]  in its theme and then you rightly talk about the avatar movie which again was mirroring reality
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:53.680]  what happened there you had the navi society the blue people society that was taken over by um people
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:00.960]  that looked outwardly as if they were the navi the blue people but actually within that form that
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:08.240]  out of form work was the force in the avatar movie that was taking over that reality and that's what
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:16.720]  we're experiencing and this is why i say um with as much um a passion as i could muster to the
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:23.600]  alternative media you know what's been done so far in uncovering the five sense level of this
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:29.520]  is brilliant fantastic round of applause you know punch the air let's have a cheer but if we're
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:36.080]  going to understand how we manipulated ultimately and therefore um create an understanding of how
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:43.760]  not to be in in deep in the rabbit hole we've got to start opening minds to the fact that what's
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:50.000]  happening with the banking system and isis and or engineered wars and engineered banking crashes and
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:59.120]  engineered uh uh political systems is the the play out the the projection uh which is there to
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:05.520]  manipulate our society within the holographic world that we experience but actually where it's
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:14.080]  coming from is beyond human sight and um this is very difficult for people to grasp because
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:20.800]  from cradle to grave all this stuff is really is ridiculed and dismissed as crazy now let me ask
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:30.320]  this question if um this stuff is so crazy why do these people in their satanic rituals and their
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:40.160]  secret society rituals the deep uh um extreme ones why do they um interact with another force
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:47.280]  beyond human sight they're interacting with what what christians call demons what uh the uh islamic
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:54.000]  world calls jinn they are interacting with these entities that's why they do it and in terms of
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:03.760]  possession everything is a frequency thus what your type of genetics is is dictating the frequency
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:12.800]  of your your your body your biological computer therefore those hybrid bloodlines that have a
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:20.400]  far far greater infusion of this arcon if you like demonic whatever you want to call it genetics
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:28.880]  in the hybrid that means that their frequency is much closer to that of these entities thus they
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:36.240]  become possessible on a scale that even the the massive humans are not possessible in that
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:41.440]  frequency so they're basically drivable they have the they have the software to interface exactly
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:50.720]  what these bloodlines are alex is basically a particular type of biological computer which
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:58.240]  allows these entities which have no empathy which feed off death which glory in death which love
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:07.120]  death for which death is their reality it they are vehicles for these entities to manipulate our
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:14.560]  world so when you look at these bloodlines and how they can create mass murder in what we call
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:21.760]  wars how they can do the the unbelievable things they do that create the the shocking unspeakable
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:30.400]  terror horror and suffering that they do and people kind of dismissed that you'll have come
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:38.240]  across this oh no they'd never do that no you would never do that because you have the ability
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:46.080]  to empathize you have the ability to take the an understanding of the feelings and and the
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:53.840]  suffering that your actions are making other people suffer once you are of a if you're like a
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:03.280]  genetic type and of a a consciousness this demonic consciousness you have none of those
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:11.120]  fail safe mechanisms of behavior not only do you not have empathy with the suffering you cause
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:19.360]  you love it because you feed off it and so these people are not seeing the world the way we see
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.360]  it look at bankers and the way they make people suffer all over the world by their manipulation
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:32.960]  of finance they feed off that and there's a word for it ask anybody go to the dictionary
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.320]  look up this word or go on the internet and look for a definition of this word
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:46.000]  and you will find that the definition of it is exactly the personality type that i have just
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:55.440]  described the word psychopath why do we have psychopaths running the world in all these areas
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:02.560]  all these institutions that dictate society why are we having alex more and more psychopaths
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:11.680]  systematically recruited into law enforcement to impose the will of the political corporate
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:20.160]  banking uh psychopaths upon the people because the psychopathic mentality is the mentality
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:25.840]  of these are contact demonic entities and it's just been transferred through for the reasons
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:31.440]  i talk about into our reality through these particular bloodlines which don't just operate
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:37.360]  in the elite they operate within human society as well now you've mentioned pedophilia because all
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:42.240]  these dots connect all these dots connect because if they didn't then it couldn't be true because
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:50.720]  everything connects in the end what um these entities are want to feed off more than almost
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:58.800]  more than anything else is the energy of children before puberty we see the uh the point of puberty
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:07.200]  as a hormonal change yes within the hologram where people uh see the body in terms of its
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:14.080]  physical functions on the hormone functions it is a hormonal change but the hormonal change is
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:21.440]  merely a holographic expression of an energetic change in the base field and thus what they want
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:27.360]  is the energy of children before that puberty energetic change happens and let me briefly
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.240]  stop you for a moment whether or not this is demonic spiritual or whatever for anybody out there
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:38.800]  it's a fact that every civilization ends up falling to secret society cults that demand
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:47.040]  burning or chopping or eating or or or cutting the hearts out of children every culture ends up
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:53.440]  being run by people that build temples uh generally pyramids and then want to do this to
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.680]  children whether it was in europe whether it was the middle east whether it was in africa
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:04.240]  whether it was in uh mesoamerica every culture ends up going to human sacrifice and the children
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.600]  are what are coveted so what is that what is happening i mean you can't deny that i mean
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.320]  normal people would never even think of such a thing and i have that question a and then be
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:21.760]  david i'm a very loving person i have an intense empathy but when someone messes with my family
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:28.560]  or someone when i think about these elites then i have fiery rage and you know the propulsion
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.440]  to strangle them uh now i understand that negative violent energy is bad and these and you know that's
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.560]  what the dark side's into but what would you call the energy on the other side to stand up and crush
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:47.520]  these people well you know um this this ancient theme throughout um uh history of uh cultures
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:53.520]  sacrificing young virgins to the gods well the gods are these entities and young virgins is just
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:52:00.800]  code for children for the very reasons i'm talking about and the reason alex that there is such a
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:07.200]  massively greater ratio i mean there are so many in the general population it's staggering but the
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:14.400]  reason there's a far greater ratio of pedophiles in the upper echelons that did i say upper echelons
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:22.880]  of society is because of their they are possessed people possessed entities possessed biological
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:31.440]  computers and while the uh the sexual actors going on with the child these entities are drawing off
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:39.360]  through the conduit if you like of of the uh pedophile the child's energy and it's not just in
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:45.280]  the modern world that you see this and and come across their vampires you look they're vampires
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:51.360]  they're energetic vampires now this that that's an interesting point for this reason what does
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:53:00.480]  satanists do they feed off blood they drink blood a blood is vital to them what does blood
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:11.920]  carry it carries the genetic code for a start but also the blood is a expression of the energy
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:18.320]  energy that i'm talking about like a terrorize a child first then slit their wrist and basically
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:23.120]  bleed them out over a several hours to get the maximum torture psychopaths talk about using
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:29.040]  somebody up and that and that horrifying them gives them an energy uh i mean undoubtedly this
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:36.720]  is going on yeah i mean when you when you look at what we call acupuncture acupuncture people say
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:42.640]  oh they put needles in the in the toe to to cure a headache it's nonsense so well no actually just
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:50.560]  ignorant mate what acupuncture is doing is um through the needles and other um uh processes
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:56.240]  it's balancing the energy flows through what are called meridians now these can be these can be
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:02.480]  identified these can be shown to exist they are the lines of energy going all around the body
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:09.920]  and because they go in in in circuits if you've got a block in the circuit that's in your foot
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:16.400]  that's where the block is it can affect the their head where where that uh circuit also goes through
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:22.240]  and so to take the block out of the foot or the toe or wherever can remove the the the effect
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.920]  which is the headache now what these meridian lines of energy are what the chinese called energy
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:36.400]  chi they are the energetic expression of the blood system of the arteries within the within the
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:44.400]  hologram and so what the satanists in our reality are doing are drinking the energy of that person
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:51.600]  via the conduit of blood while the entities beyond human sight some of them within these more
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:59.200]  extreme satanic rituals actually within sight of the of the satanists in the ritual i've talked to
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:03.920]  endless satanists who've described this manifestation of these entities and some of these really
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:12.080]  powerful rituals they are feeding off the energy of the person directly in an energetic form because
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:17.040]  they're taking the energy on another frequency beyond human sight and that's what they're feeding off
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:25.280]  and so when you have a war when you have what this isis organization is doing when you have
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:34.800]  suffering of of any kind um uh in the way that we see in this bloodletting what is a war it's a blood
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:44.800]  letting frenzy and what these entities are doing with that energy is feeding off it if we had a world
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:52.080]  of harmony of love of balance these energy these entities would not be able to exist here because
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:57.040]  their energy source well i've talked to a lot of veterans and a lot of from world war two on and
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:02.720]  they say they won't talk about it but they say during mass death the weirdest stuff goes on yeah
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:07.520]  and i would imagine that's because the energy is so much stronger in those areas and would it be if
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:13.120]  we could see like a bunch of vultures converging more of these entities in those areas yeah i mean
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:19.920]  yeah i mean you know there's so much art there's so much i mean i'm i'm not into uh what we father
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:25.920]  used to call bricks and mortar religion um and i'm not i wouldn't give what i i see either way i see
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:34.560]  the world a name but there is so much in religious texts which are which are ancient texts um uh
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:41.680]  that um are recalling and recording things that went on a long time ago which are actually telling
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:51.680]  the very story that i'm telling here but they don't uh people don't see that connection once you
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:58.320]  you read the stories from the point of view of what's happening now it all starts to make sense
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:05.360]  the reason these people don't act like what we would call humans these bloodlines these networks of
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:13.200]  uh of evil is because they're not like us they don't see the world like us if we could just
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:20.480]  see the world through their eyes for five minutes the whole world and everything that
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:28.640]  happens in it would suddenly fall into place we'd go oh i see it now that's why this is going on
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:38.640]  and and so it's you know it the idea that within this narrow band this ridiculously narrow band
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:44.640]  of frequency scientists call visible light that we can know everything whether it's mainstream
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:52.800]  or alternative or whatever is a form of extreme ignorance as well as a form of extreme arrogance
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:58:02.400]  thus whatever we know is what we know now or think we do there's always always vastly more to know
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:10.720]  and if the alternative media comes to a certain um list of conclusions and stops
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:17.040]  and won't go any further then they're not going to get to that point where we go beyond the
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:22.960]  movie screen that we see to the project that is projecting the movie well david ike here's what i know
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:26.640]  what the globalist is doing well what we can prove is so over the top and i want to keep you
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:29.280]  a little bit longer if you can do it to finish up and talk about what you're coming up next
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.320]  that the sky is already the limit and i want to talk i want to discuss with you some of those
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:38.400]  things we know are going on that are crazy and then ask you where you think it's all going david

[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:55.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.520]  so
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:22.800]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones i probably
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:30.160]  interviewed david ike it's not exaggerate 50 times in the last 18 years or so
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:35.840]  and i've had a chance to hang out with him a few times in person and he puts off a really good
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:43.360]  vibe i think david ike means what he's saying i think he is very eccentric uh and i mean that in
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:53.920]  a good way um and i think in my gut i know it's very healthy to just completely go a trillion miles
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.080]  out from this to look at it from way far back and then come back and look at it real close
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.440]  because i look at this world and let me tell you folks we're not in kansas anymore
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:12.000]  and i can't get the public to just admit what's real i mean what what's admitted in the five
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:20.320]  senses and then i just pick up the the the well i see the trail of destruction behind the globals
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:25.120]  but then i pick up on the way that they act the way they behave and i've been around a lot of their
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:30.000]  minions and it's like their minions aren't even really alive until they're doing something bad
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.840]  and then they kind of activate manifest and i bet it's even wilder than what david ike's saying
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:43.600]  i mean my gut more and more uh and it's never been wrong just tells me that we're in the middle
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:49.760]  of something so fantastic he'll be with us to 20 after this is a short segment david how is the
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:54.400]  fight going against the the psychopaths and their group consciousness if you look at it from an
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.680]  atheist perspective or you know from uh any other perspective regardless this is going on
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.080]  how is the fight going for human consciousness because they're really pouring it on right now
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:09.520]  to suppress people awakening and i think this was what you said 15 years ago is true i see
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:16.080]  this year and next year the next few years as a critical time yeah it's it's it is uh because
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:23.360]  in the end it's a choice people say how will it turn out well it depends on the choices that are
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:28.720]  being made what you will see now alex there's something i've been talking about for a long
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:34.880]  time and what we now see um i mean i was reading an article today which was basically asking the
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.920]  question uh what the heck is happening to the human race some of these extraordinary things
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:47.120]  going on with people biting people's faces often stuff like that it was talking about well going
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:55.360]  back to what i've been talking about here the awakening is the awakening to harmony it's the
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:02.800]  awakening to um to to balance and the more you awaken to that the more you open your mind and
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:11.600]  expand your mind uh the more you start to see the world in a greater and greater uh way in terms of
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:17.440]  seeing what's really happening it as opposed to what is um supposed to be happening and we're
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:25.120]  told is happening people start to see things and what do they say they say why didn't i see it before
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:32.640]  it's so obvious because your mind was closed before and thus when it was closed it was picking up a
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:40.480]  certain band of um perception and now you are expanding your mind and literally opening your
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:48.880]  mind to a greater possibility now you're picking up a much wider frequency of insight of possibility
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:56.160]  thus you're seeing things um differently but on the other side what we're seeing is people
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:04.960]  that are getting pulled more and more into this inversion becoming more and more an expression
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:13.200]  of that inversion so we're seeing i would if you people read my books in 10 15 years ago or 15 years
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:20.480]  ago they'll say i was talking about the the fork in the road the parting of the ways i'm we're seeing
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:25.440]  it those that are awakening to a greater understanding of the world and those who are getting more
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:32.080]  and more pulled into it and maybe next time i come on addicts we can um relate what i've said here
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:36.320]  to the transhumanist agenda let's do that we come back we've got 12 minutes when we come back let's
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:40.480]  just do a preview if you want to come back soon we'd love to have you davidike.com tell us about
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:44.160]  some of your new speaking engagements coming up people can find all that at davidike.com and
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.880]  Alex Jones of info wars.com but we're looking at the big picture here today pulling back getting
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:53.840]  david ike's perspective on the world and i'll tell you this it's a lot more accurate than what
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:05:04.560]  we're getting from people like uh you know pierce morgan there's no doubt that our country is in
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:11.200]  serious trouble right now and if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation well
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:17.120]  i'll tell you how when the democrats showed their true colors you got angry and you elected
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:23.040]  republicans and then when the republicans showed their true colors you got angry and elected
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:29.600]  democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:36.320]  were looking out for your best interest you acted like they were crazy but the real definition of
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:44.080]  crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results that's why it is
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:52.880]  vitally important that you wake up america and break the matrix info wars.com prisonplanet.tv

[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:29.120]  Well we're going deep down the rabbit hole today with david ike i'm your host alex jones david
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.640]  ike.com's website our sites are prisonplanet.com and info wars.com i've got a few geopolitical
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:39.600]  questions for david here in a moment we'll get him back soon if he'll come on and do a whole
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:44.880]  breakdown i know he does like 12 hour 10 hour seminars to thousands tens of thousands in some
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:50.400]  cases around the world and i think it's healthy because people need to break with the system i
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:57.680]  mean everything they do is about lying and hoaxing and deceiving and uh david you were talking about
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.680]  the fork in the road people are either really waking up or they're going deep into the mind
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:08.080]  control diabetes is up several thousand percent in the u.s spreading into europe i know it's not
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:11.520]  supposedly transmittable but the point is the things we're having put in our food and water are
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:20.240]  that that that help trigger it we've got so much happening we've got cancer exploding we've got
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:29.040]  just all forms of evil intensifying we've got in the media and the culture just selling the most
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:35.120]  horrible things and we're torturers of children are actually the good guys you can see the inverse
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:41.280]  taking action and you can't just chalk it up to deviance or to decadent societies going into
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:47.520]  decline this is a manifestation of evil and the churches won't fight it they're busy
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:53.120]  glitter bugging and you know teaching magical thinking to people that you know they'll tell
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:10:01.760]  god what to do and all this bizarreness what is it all headed towards david and are we winning
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.960]  as free humanity i mean if this was a soccer game a football game where are we well i'm
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:13.760]  having having just passed the point of 25 years on this journey and looking what it was like then
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.560]  to what it is now in terms of people being aware that the world's not like they thought it was well
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:28.320]  i mean we have made the most fantastic strides the most fantastic achievement in in what we've
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:34.800]  managed to do so far but where's it leading i mean it see because everything connects to everything
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:41.520]  else everything you everything you say comes in and connects somewhere so you know i've been having
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:52.560]  a chat today to a friend of mine who has studied dna and seen dna in various studies has been involved
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:11:01.040]  in and what he was saying is dna is definitely getting weaker and it's definitely mutating
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:06.480]  some things going on at that level big time i was reading a story uh was on my website and
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:12.160]  probably others too um i think it was yesterday where a study a scientific study mainstream
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:19.760]  has looked at the dna of the poor the urban poor as they call them in detroit and found that dna is
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:27.440]  being uh fundamentally affected to the point where it is um reducing more and more significantly
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:35.680]  the length of life of those people this all fits why because dna and rna which is fundamentally
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:41.440]  connected um our receiver transmitters of information that's what they that's what they are they
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.880]  receive and they're being told to die they're being told to turn off yeah well what um i'll
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:56.800]  give you an example of what i mean um a russian scientific study changed frog embryos to salamander
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:05.360]  embryos by broadcasting the um information of the salamander embryo to the frog embryos
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:12.160]  transformed it right now why can they do that because dna is a receiver transmitter of information
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:24.560]  and i said before everything is a frequency so healthy food healthy organic food clean water
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:35.120]  is a frequency polluted water i mean hello genetically modified food is another frequency
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:45.040]  um and so when we are eating food or drinking whatever or when we uh sit in school all day
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:52.320]  in wi-fi fields of radiation when we are increasingly uh having our atmosphere transformed
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:13:01.200]  by in terms of its radiation content on a fantastic scale um we are seeing that we're
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:07.840]  seeing food as in the holographic level as as something on the plate but in its base form
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:14.960]  it is an information field and that distorted information field we call the rubbish food
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:22.640]  that we get and the polluted water etc and the wi-fi fields is interacting with the dna and it
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:29.120]  is changing it what is a distorted information field going to do to another information field
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.880]  that's receiving it it's going to distort it and that's what's happening let me stop you let me
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:39.920]  stop you because while you're speaking they're googling and putting up mainline prestigious
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:45.840]  universities admitting that our dna is unraveling degenerating our sperm counts down almost 90
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:53.840]  percent uh they're admitting they're admitting that they can charge dna with the program sequence
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:59.760]  of another animal and it will actually imprint that so it's it's documented and they know they're
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:05.600]  doing it you wrote about this 20 years ago and now they're just now admitting it they are purposely
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:12.240]  reprogramming us to turn us into abominations i mean this is sick i mean i mean i was a foreign
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:17.760]  alien force this is how i take over here's alex that you know um you know these these
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:26.880]  ancient endless stories all over the ancient world of the gods um uh interbreeding with humans
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:34.320]  and transforming the human form well if you understand how dna works you don't you don't
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:41.360]  have to mutate the species and change the species by sexual procreation i mean how long would that
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:51.600]  take you can do it by transmitting the information um of the form you want to turn us into to the
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:58.080]  dna on its frequency and as it receives it it will mutate in accordance with that information
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.640]  sure your dna is a wireless receiver and there's real wi-fi that's why they can plug wires into
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.120]  people's brains now and make them stop having epilepsy we are literally being programmed
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:13.440]  yeah and and this is where the transhumanist agenda comes in i mean engineered wars engineered
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:20.400]  financial crashes all these things are absolutely vital to know about they're absolutely vital to
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:27.600]  circulate and explain but beyond that the biggest agenda of all is the transhumanist agenda because
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:33.680]  i've talked about the fact that this is a biological computer they'll want to put technological
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:40.720]  computer software into the biological computer so that they can control it and control its
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:48.080]  perceptions and feed its perceptions on a level that we've not even seen so far they uh we talk
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:57.680]  about um smart uh meters smart tv smart phones smart in front of all these new technologies everything
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:03.600]  with smart in front of it is designed to speak and communicate with everything else with smart
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:12.000]  in front of it and thus what they're creating is a sub reality an energetic sub reality uh
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.760]  within a certain frequency band the frequency band of human brainwave activity and the idea
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:23.360]  is that they connect if they can get technology inside of humans the connection will be obviously
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:30.880]  technology to technology they will connect the human mind the human perception processes to this
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:37.440]  um smart grid sure it's artificial telepathy and it's funny you say that we were uh google last
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:43.200]  year declassified from their own corporate records uh their own founding meetings 16 years ago
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:46.240]  where they had the billionaire investors they go why don't you know the searches they said it's not
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:51.600]  that everyone's going to feed the reality into us we're going to have an ai that's a mass hive
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:57.680]  consciousness tied into all these devices that are integrated and it will now be a new reality
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:04.800]  show and that's exactly what's happening alex and that's why google i mean google is absolutely at
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:11.360]  the center of this it's no accident whatsoever but not only does google dominate the internet and the
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:17.120]  internet is fundamental to this technologically generated fake reality they're building and and
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:24.160]  want to attach us to but they've also uh got this google x laboratory they're also buying up robotic
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:30.560]  companies to create uh artificial it's an ai takeover the word is it's already artificially
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:36.000]  intelligent we're in a science fiction movie it's taking over it's already making the decisions
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:43.920]  this is the point but if you um see what's happened up to this point is people have been
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:52.000]  pulled out of their expanded level of awareness their true self into the five senses by society
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:59.760]  being totally driven and um focused upon the five senses everything's about look at this smell this
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:05.840]  taste this all of it and the education system is about locking people into the five senses and the
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:11.040]  left side of the brain which connects more than any other part of the brain into the five senses
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:18.080]  and people then get locked in a tiny tiny band of sure five sense reality but what they want to do
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:25.760]  with the um uh the transhumanist agenda is take that another massive step forward so instead of
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:30.480]  just locking people in the five senses so that's the only reality reality they perceive so they
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:35.200]  think people like me are crazy because i'm saying it's not the only reality they want to create a
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:42.320]  situation where they have a um a technologically generated collective sub reality like a massive
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:49.760]  global cloud as as they call it which is connected to the human uh thought and perception processes
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:54.960]  and is feeding this fake reality that we think is real i was about to say they're not wanting to
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:00.400]  just gauge reality they're wanting to control reality and completely dictate it yes so that we
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:07.600]  become no more than robots literally we become biological indeed with the transhumanist agenda
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:13.200]  biological technological that's what they say there's no ability to think outside of what we're
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:18.240]  being said that's where it's leading and that's what we must address absolutely well i know you've
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:23.040]  had a lot of projects going and you just said you can come back on uh anytime two weeks a month

[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:09.200]  less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body as a result you'll have less energy
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:13.840]  your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled an older person will typically injure more easily
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.200]  and heal more slowly not fun however if you could consume a protein powder that is easier
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:24.720]  to absorb then you may be able to gain back some strength muscle and speed of recovery

[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:18.480]  keepers keep a gun under the counter punks are running wild in the street there's nobody
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:24.640]  anywhere seems to know what to do and there's no end to it we know the air is unfit to breathe
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:30.320]  our food is unfit to eat we sit watching our tv's while some local newscaster tells us that
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:36.080]  today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be we know
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:41.360]  things are bad worse than bad they're crazy it's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.160]  don't go out anymore we sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.040]  all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms let me have my toaster and
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:55.840]  my tv and my steel belt and radios and i won't say anything just leave us alone well i'm not
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:01.600]  going to leave you alone i want you to get mad i don't want you to protest i don't want you to
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:05.120]  ride i don't want you to write to your congressman because i wouldn't know what to tell you to write
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:09.200]  i don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the russians and the crime in
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:15.040]  the street all i know is that first you've got to get mad you've got to say i'm a human being
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:23.360]  my life has value i want you to get up now i want all of you to get up out of your chairs
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:30.800]  i want you to get up right now and go to the window open it and stick your head out and yell
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:36.320]  i'm a fag as hell but i'm not going to make this short segment part of the next about
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:42.640]  steve pacinic has been able to briefly join us today and then i will get into the rest of the
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:50.880]  news i haven't hit yet towards the end of this hour i never even aired the uh this week on abc
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:55.120]  yesterday where they claimed i wouldn't show up to debate them live when they said that they
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:00.080]  weren't going to do the interview basically and then came to pick me up 12 minutes before it was
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:05.280]  airtime so they could claim i was a coward just all sorts of weasley behavior out of government
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:11.040]  run media but dr steve pacinic of course ran the famous camp david accords as the psychological
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.400]  expert there he wrote the manual on psychological warfare of the state department helped found the
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:20.880]  delta force with general boykin and others uh and of course i'm going to remember the council
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:25.120]  and fine relations co wrote a bunch of books with tom clancy produced hollywood films and he was the
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:29.920]  guy came on early 2002 to say that bin laden death was a hoax and then he'd already you know but you
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:34.880]  know basically died that he wasn't alive they'd roll him out later then walter cronkate came out
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:39.040]  and said it madeline albright secretary of state said it uh and then they rolled him out and it was
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:46.080]  all fake well now cy harsh came out two years ago and said it's a hundred percent lie i have an
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.480]  article coming out well they came after him he shut up for a while he talked some to our office
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:55.360]  now he's saying well it's just fake that they didn't have a firefight only one guy was killed well
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:03.120]  that's what we were told a double of bin laden and then it was a military safehouse that's why
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:07.040]  it was a half mile from the main military headquarters of the whole country uh that the
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:12.080]  navy seal started figuring that out so they blew up their helicopter a few months later on a setup
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.240]  mission i've since then talked to family members of the navy seals and i've talked to some of the
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:22.400]  navy seals the videos are up on info wars dot com within a day of the hoax i said it was a hoax
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.440]  and then within a few months of the event we pointed out that they basically had killed the navy
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:31.600]  seals uh and joining us is dr patrick we got three minutes to break we'll come back with 10 minutes
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:36.640]  after that sir appreciate your time but what do you make of cy harsh now and all this coming out
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:42.400]  uh at this point with the bin laden hoax well i i i've known about cy harsh we come from the
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:47.120]  opposite side of the ideological spectrum but he's very well versed in intelligence
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:54.160]  and he is very accurate there was no raid and there basically was no stand at a stand-down
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:28:01.040]  was as we said a cheney bush runs fell and basically this is the cia operation it was
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:09.120]  run by the cia and implemented by the cia started by tenon john brennan and what we have is a real
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:14.960]  problem of credibility in our military and our political leadership and then our intelligence
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:21.600]  leadership and what this brings out is like the melai massacre the cover-up is major it goes from
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:30.320]  bill clinton hillary clinton it goes to uh bush uh to bush jr cheney rumsfeld and obama and
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:36.240]  basically it puts into place uh i had norma draven who was in charge of the special forces
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:41.840]  or the seal team who claimed all this nonsense about how well they perform and that puts into
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:47.200]  play admiral mullen who was also a liar i've said it from day one they were liars i said they were
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.880]  ineffectual i said the seal teams were blown out of proportion it was a publicity stunt and now
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:58.320]  more than ever cy harsh has made it very clear now i and cy harsh have not agreed and i've had a
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:04.480]  confrontation with him in intelligence meetings so for him to come out on our side to basically
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:10.800]  say the government's lying again and again this is the key point for your listeners to understand
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:17.360]  we have a government that is not legitimate obama has lied repeatedly from the beginning till now
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:24.000]  he has lied our military has lied our intelligence has lied so we have candidates who are coming in
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.440]  like uh hillary clinton who also lied she was part of this she was a senator well daughter stay there
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:34.080]  i'm gonna come back to dr cpa cheney after this quick break to break down what does it signify
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:39.040]  though that cnn's top headline would be this and that cy harsh is coming out with a truth now
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:44.000]  or a limited hangout what does that say is happening inside the power structure stay with us

[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:31.520]  dr steve patinik is our guest then i want to air the face the nation thing i never really got to
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:37.920]  yesterday or this week whatever the stupid sunday propaganda show is where they just lied and said
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:42.400]  that i didn't show up to the interview they said we're not doing it live and i said well i'm not
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:47.760]  doing it taped they didn't respond back and sent a car 12 minutes to airtime just the stunts they
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:53.200]  play now to try to win points everybody knows i go on live shows i'm gonna tear these people apart
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:59.760]  i want to ask dr patinik his take on jade helm and all the drills the government's got him doing
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:05.200]  for civil disturbance and where he thinks it's all going what they're gearing up for not if
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:09.360]  patinik's talked about the states being the answer to getting control of the federal government
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:14.560]  well yeah and they're preparing and training the military to try to take on the states people say
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:18.880]  well that'll never happen well with the criminals we've got running things it certainly might and
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.440]  they're really worried about texas so we'll get dr patinik's take on that briefly here in a moment
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:29.760]  as well but if you go to info wars dot com you'll see flashback proof been locked in death another
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:38.000]  government lie info wars report uh four years before harsh revelations and then we break down
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  the day after it happened an eight minute video that it's a hugs that was uh may second 2011
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:49.200]  and then proof been lauding uh death another government lie we've got interviews with patinik
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:55.280]  in there we've been interviews with the family of some of the dead seals multiple families
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:01.440]  and we've got more current breakdowns of this but i want to explain something to people we've
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.720]  broken hundreds of secret documents here and hundreds others that are restricted and it's
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:12.800]  very dangerous to do that in this climate um you know if we meet with a navy seal and i talk about
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:16.800]  it on air you better believe we did or if we meet with a family of a navy seal who died
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:22.880]  that's what i did a couple days after the helicopter blew up and they got rid of them
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:28.160]  a few months after the fake killing and the families and what the seals believe is that
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.880]  was a body double they were there to take out there wasn't a big firefight outside the other
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:38.240]  helicopter just blew up it was a half mile or less from them from the main military base of the
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:44.720]  whole country their headquarters and their main academy and so we never knew exactly what happened
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:48.960]  but people on the ship said there was no barrel at sea so they cart marshaled over a hundred people
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.600]  and it's just been one big cover-up they lied about the situation room photo
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.720]  dr patinik you've got a lot of amazing sources i know you've been visited by the cia and
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:07.280]  mi6 and threatened i've been threatened um and then they had the stratford leak that they were
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:12.800]  tasked with trying to you know make us look bad uh i mean i didn't ask to be at the level of this
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:18.640]  whole game all i want is my country back but now i'm being attacked by up to 300 to 500 newspapers
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:24.560]  a day saying lies uh i mean on a rector scale previous attacks were two or three this is a 10
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:32.720]  what is going on why do you think they're targeting us is it getting ready to destroy me
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:37.760]  or building me up to be politically discredited with with straw man and then i want to go back
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:42.640]  into bin laden but i want to be a little selfish today and ask you from your perspective and your
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.360]  sources what is going on because they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:52.800]  about this show and quite frankly i don't like being that prominent i mean we this is a multi
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:58.880]  magnitudes more effect but but i think i know my own answer and i want your take on this congress
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:03.040]  is listening the military is listening not that i'm special but i have all these amazing guests
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:09.040]  on people like you and this show is a lot closer to reality than almost anything else out there so
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:17.360]  this has become like the forbidden fruit channel or something uh where it's just gotten really hot
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:22.480]  and it shows the insanity of the official narrative and so they're trying to discredit me right now
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:29.120]  with pentagon directed bull and ci directed bull where is this going well alex number one let me
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:35.520]  let me assure you that nobody wants to take you out and the reason for that is very simple uh
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:41.520]  they do not want to make you a martyr that that does not serve anybody's purpose number two the
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:47.680]  reason you're exceedingly important even to the intelligence community to me is remember you were
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:55.200]  the only man who stood up 13 years ago when we had the 9 11 and said and allowed me to say
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:02.080]  this was a false flag in the stand down 14 14 14 years ago so you have to remember a
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:08.960]  profit in his own country is never appreciated you will never be appreciated in this country
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:15.280]  because you tell the truth and no one in the republic who runs the republic and tolerated
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:22.000]  however you have a master huge audience in the millions which to many in the in the senior
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:28.240]  leadership is very threatening and the reason is very simple in the beginning they could co-opt
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:35.680]  you as crazy or me as crazy and call us a very simple term conspiracy however fortunately your
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:42.480]  audience and the american audience is too smart far too smart that by any of the narratives that
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:49.600]  were sold by clinton the bushes or by the cia or the military and eventually what happened in the
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:55.440]  age of the internet you were able to take that narrative without deviating announce without
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:01.440]  backing off but having sponsors and having someone like me say keep going alex you're brave don't
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:06.400]  worry about it they will not attack you they will i mean i'm gonna attack with propaganda and other
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:11.280]  things by different camps i know it's not one monolithic system it's just to be 41 years old
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:17.520]  and to have no exaggeration one day last week 500 news articles and you know lying about me
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:22.240]  what nerve have we had is that they think we're weak so they're going in or they think we're
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:26.960]  strong because i mean i can handle a lot of pressure doc but this is starting to get like
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:33.280]  the twilight zone well the point is that is a sense of recognition and admiration remember
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:40.080]  you're being lauded by the fact that they feel you're a threat to them by continuously cutting
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:46.080]  into their vulnerable point it's a badge of honor and the audience understands that people all over
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:52.320]  the world listen to you and this a republic can no longer stand the way it is it's falling apart
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:56.160]  well i just want the establishment to understand this and i say this selfishly for myself and my
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:01.600]  own family uh people get this stuff now i'm not the only one talking about this there's thousands
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:05.760]  of other prominent people that get the paradigm now so doing something to me is not going to do
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:11.280]  anything oh all i'm except turn me into a martyr i but the thing is i don't hate the government
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:15.840]  i don't even hate these special interests these people are almost blind dr pacinic in my view
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:22.960]  in that they don't look at what their actions are going to do 1015 steps down the road they
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:29.360]  they're destroying the empire itself they're destroying the country they are they are going
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:36.320]  after the press they're going after our industry uh they're just doing crazy stuff and i just don't
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:41.120]  see it i don't see this elite being able to continue on that's all i'm saying and all i
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:47.280]  want prosperity and stability doctor let me pull back a little bit and explain something to you
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:53.440]  we are not a monolithic entity i've said that before but your ability to penetrate through
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:59.840]  through and hit at the nerve spot allows different elements of the government i won't identify which
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.520]  intelligence communities of which elements to allow them to push back now give me an example
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:10.880]  why was this story by seymour hersh released now more than ever nobody's asking that question
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:17.440]  except you and the answer is my suspicion is it's only my suspicion i'm not going to conspiracy
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:23.120]  is that it's elements within our own government who have very close relationships with seymour hersh
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:28.400]  and know him exceedingly well because seymour has been in meetings with me with the intelligence
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:34.560]  community and he knows he gets information from it and it's the i won't identify which units it's
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:41.600]  a way of paying back obama jeb bush jeb bush and hillary clinton to get them out of the race
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:48.880]  it's the way the industry the intelligence system and the military system works indirectly
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:56.000]  in order to punish those political leaders and dynasties which think that they can run the republic
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:03.280]  namely the clinton's who involved in 9 11 let me finish and the bushes neil marvin jeb and the old
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:10.080]  man including bush jr because they have destroyed the republic now it's time for the military and
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:17.280]  intelligence units that have loyal to the republic to punish this administration for what they did
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:23.600]  in banghazi for having demoted betray us for having demoted 12 of our navy commission
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:30.640]  admiral navy men for having demoted african generals and this is their way to tell obama
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:37.120]  you're no longer in charge and by the way hillary you will not get elected nor will you jet bush
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:44.160]  and that's my point of view which i think is well grounded in terms of knowing seymour hersh
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:49.040]  knowing when he covers up and knowing where he gets the intelligence so what i'm saying to you and
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:55.920]  the public is we have our own ways in the republic to punish those who've punished the people and
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:03.040]  you have to have faith that you have you alex and the audience have had an impact on many elements
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:08.160]  of our society which you don't know about and and some of them i don't know about but there are
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:14.560]  many who i work with and can't criticize because this country allows you to criticize as long as
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:18.160]  you serve it that was my next point that's my next point that i want your take on this then
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:21.840]  we'll go back to the bin laden situation we'll have you back for a full hour soon if you can do it
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:27.360]  stevepachennick.com bestselling author joins us right now a former spy chief basically uh with
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:32.080]  the state department if you pull back from all this i totally agree with you i know there's really
[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:38.640]  good camps of people in the army in the navy in the marines across the board they hate what's
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:43.680]  happening i know two years ago general demsey uh on that saturday night went to the white house and
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:49.120]  said the military is not going to back an attack to a topple sod to put al-qaeda in charge it just
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:54.400]  we're not doing it so there is just like eisenhower warned of the military industrial complex he meant
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:44:01.360]  the special interest manipulating it people always ask and say charity couldn't come our military
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:06.960]  wouldn't put up with it well that's actually true our military has been saying no over and over again
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:12.560]  that's why these bureaucrats are so angry with it is that it's not perfect but compared to them
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:18.960]  it's it's it's it's you know a whole different world and you're right i know for a fact when the fbi
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:25.840]  or the justice department uh subgroups uh or state police or federal marshals give us documents
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:30.800]  that turn out to be accurate every time that burns the police state it's because they don't like it
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:35.840]  and there is a war going on from every different angle between different stratus and it is good
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:41.760]  versus evil and i i mean i agree with you all this stuff coming out on hillary and how she lied
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:50.400]  about getting shot at in in uh serbia is is is the the inside system saying no to these dynasties
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:56.080]  and trying to reform things so in this fight i understand where he uses a conduit because i'm
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:00.320]  only person at least the past crazy enough to stick my neck out and do this stuff to go forward
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:06.000]  the future so what does that signify and how is the fight from your sources going internally for
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:11.680]  the future of the republic well i i'm more optimistic about the future republic number one
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:17.360]  without without you know caressing you or or lauded you you and i know we've gone back a long
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:23.440]  ways when you were very young and very courageous and you were able to state exactly what i said
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:30.560]  and we made the prediction that 14 years from now after 9 11 some president is going to claim he killed
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:36.880]  osama ben laden which we knew was nonsense secondly you have to remember when i walk around and see
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:41.120]  different people some people may recognize it but you know the first thing they asked me about
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.400]  it's not tom clancy my partner it's about alex jones and i said well how did you know who i am
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:52.400]  he said well i heard you on alex jones you are everywhere i go to europe you're everywhere in the
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:46:00.000]  middle east you're everywhere so your voice is not just the voice of alex jones it's the voice of truth
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:05.360]  and a profit that within his own country has made an impact now let me tell you the intelligence
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:11.440]  community is a very rich and wonderful community it's filled with individuals who feel very strongly
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:16.640]  about our country but they can't come out in public and say what they want to and especially in the
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:22.880]  military i can't tell you how important general martin demsey has been to our country in terms of
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:28.480]  restraining the wars in terms of focusing in terms of running our military in a time of uncertainty
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:34.560]  next question who's this new guy i don't really know him i i can't say anything he's a commandant
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:40.000]  of the marine corps i'm a great admirer of the marine corps it's improved over the years they've
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.600]  become very effective in what we call the human topography in other words they've learned about
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:50.800]  psychology and anthropology but i really can't comment about any of that i think it's important
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:55.680]  that we rotate through the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff but there are people
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:01.680]  who have not worked with us and that is what you're seeing now i think bangazi and i think what
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:08.880]  happened the betrayers had a major major impact on military and intelligence community and especially
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:14.960]  a white house that was not very effective or very developed as an obama administration
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:21.120]  they specifically do not want jeb bush anymore they're tired of bush bush is a liar he worked with
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:26.640]  his brother they're tired of hilly tent and it's more than just her lies it's the corruption that
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:34.720]  she's had with russia uranium and with bill clinton constantly lying constantly degrading the republic
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:39.040]  and our military intelligence units will not tolerate sure well we know the clinton's have
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:43.440]  been blackmailing with all the files they've got but you can see that the that people in the system
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:50.000]  are sick of them correct but alex you cannot be i know it's hard for you and i understand it very
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:55.760]  well that's why i often volunteer to kind of give you and say to the audience look take a break but
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:01.920]  you have to keep going on this race is not a short distance race and you've done a formidable job over
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:07.120]  14 years but there's going to be more years to come because whatever we're going to elect and
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:13.520]  hopefully it will be the scott walkers the rand paul's the people from the midwest the young christians
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:20.320]  who come out of something that doesn't have any kind of uh tainted background and can begin to
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:26.880]  understand what our country needs and it needs leadership it needs to consolidate it needs to
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:33.360]  close down our government units but you're the voice and that voice is going to attract a lot
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:38.560]  of dissident behavior and that's okay well i'll tell you when it comes down to i mean take this
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:42.080]  military drill that's just more conditioning more of an attempt because i think the country's
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:45.920]  going to collapse to get ready for that we never said jade helman would be the takeover but everybody
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:52.320]  from the governor of texas to senator cruz to senator paul uh to congressman louis gomer to
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:56.720]  chuck norris you came out and said i love our military but i don't trust who's running it well
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:00.880]  you know chuck norris has got incredible military sources the special forces loving he hangs out with
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.160]  them all the world and i'm not going to say what i've been told in things we're going to have some
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:09.280]  news tomorrow on that subject but it's not just me i'm just one little iceberg sticking up
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:15.920]  under the surface what you just said the military is so awake and knows what's going on that's why
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:20.960]  the political elite these globalists better get their act together because what they've
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:25.840]  got planned for this country uh taking it over setting up a police state the dog's not going to
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:32.080]  hunt dog well let me tell you one thing number one the police state can no longer exist and it
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:38.560]  can't it's not viable and i'll tell you why i live in the south it is very hard for any
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:44.880]  policeman on a national level to be able to infiltrate any particular area of the south
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:51.920]  because it's very fragmented and it has its loyalty to the local community i can't emphasize
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:57.440]  enough how important it is for your listeners to work at the local level with the local police
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:02.720]  with the local mayors the local commissioners they are far more powerful than the president
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:08.560]  in the united states than the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff we have military officers
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:14.160]  who work at the local level i've got a military officer who works in my area and at the same
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:19.280]  time as a commissioner he's not taking over the government he's learning how to run run a
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:25.280]  civilian government while at the same time being able to service this country what we call the patriot
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:30.800]  that's what happened in 1776 and that's what i'm beginning to see all over the country
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:36.000]  what we need are leaders who have served in our country who understand where we have to go you
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:40.640]  know you just said it stay there do the final statement with us because that's it i should
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:45.360]  just leave jade home alone and let them practice taking over local government because most military
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:50.080]  is already on our side and so as they put them in local government it just means our people are
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:56.720]  already everywhere that's what the barack obamas don't get is they're literally setting up their
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:04.960]  own downfall we'll be back stay with us why use dial-up when you can use broadband why travel with

[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:16.640]  shone's your host we're fighting the mind control when i talk about the prominence of this broadcast
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:23.520]  i'm not here bragging the reason i spend a little bit of time on that is that it gets creepy uh to
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:28.800]  to have the media misrepresenting what you say what you stand for what you do
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:32.560]  trying to discredit you because they're so scared of what you're talking about
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:37.920]  and i mean they should be scared we were the first to have navy seal families on who lost their
[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:47.920]  sons saying that bin laden raid was fake because it was and i got death threats over that very
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:53.920]  specific ones and i'm not really scared it's just at the same time i'm not going to stop
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:59.680]  doing what i'm doing but at the same time i'm trying to help everybody i mean this country's
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:04.000]  going over the edge here somebody's got to restrain the out of control bureaucrats and corporate
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.440]  interests that sit overseas half the time and aren't really looking at what they're doing
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:14.720]  and don't understand how they're eroding america's real power that's my view on it
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:21.920]  and dr pacinic finishing up uh on the whole climate in this country jade helm 10 state
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:27.040]  operation clearly it's mastering the human domain it's practicing how to take over locally
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:32.240]  for civil unrest and and this new enemy the tea party or whatever but the good news is that's only
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:37.280]  woken the military up but but i think the system should look at all these small towns people coming
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:43.040]  out of the woodwork saying no in a traditionally pro military state like texas it's not anti
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:49.280]  military we understand the mission uh is an overall corrupt mission i'm not against people
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:53.520]  who are vets running for office i think that's great but i'm talking about the fact that not
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:59.440]  just the military rejecting where obama wants them to go but the people understand that the
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:07.040]  military is being used for unconstitutional duties and that the feds are very scared of the
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:12.160]  state's rights movement dr pacinic your take on that well you're absolutely right what i begin to
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:17.040]  see more and more is that more young people are joining the national guard and are getting involved
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:23.360]  in the local communities at a very young age at the 2030s i even met a young woman who is
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:29.520]  the 23 years old in state legislature here in florida and it's very impressive so you have
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:34.480]  grassroots that are coming out from very different groups whether it's the christian missionaries of
[02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:41.120]  america a religious group or political group and or the tea party and that is the essence of our
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:47.200]  democracy so i'm not as worried about the police state coming down and our soldiers shooting in
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:50.960]  america they're not going to do that i don't think that's going to happen either the point is the
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:58.320]  political class is trying to trying to sell that mission well the problem is first of all remember
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:05.360]  you you have aggrandized your audience to the end of the millions you look at anderson cooper an xca
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:11.200]  operative who works you know on the weekend he has less than a million people you look at msnbc
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:17.120]  they're dead you look at fox it's basically nothing more than roger hails allowing himself to make
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:24.240]  more money and i know roger i like him but nobody takes it seriously so the reality is it's you and
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:31.760]  what the people find on the internet and you're able to cross across uh you know the hatch we'll
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:36.960]  take drudge i mean why does the pentagon in congress obsess over drudge all day i mean it
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:42.560]  really shows the systems of paper tiger well yeah that's true but on the other hand you have general
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:48.000]  demsy whose real concerns is how many guys can i send in to jibouti how many guys can i send

[03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:06.400]  all right folks we're into overdrive and kill the music i won't have the maximum
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:09.840]  amount of time to finish it with pacenic you understand selfishly i'm gonna ask some of
[03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:14.560]  my own questions here but you heard the questions i asked as we were going to break a dr pacenic
[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:21.040]  go ahead the basic bottom line is that the the congressman incentives particularly the senate
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:28.400]  from new york their camp whether it's winningly or unwittingly is to degrade our capability in the
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:33.760]  military civilians feel very threatened by the strength of our military they always have but
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:39.760]  our military is much stronger a lot smarter than these congressmen and senators many of our generals
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:46.480]  have phd's masters i mean keith alexander had four masters general portray has had a phd so
[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:52.080]  these senators are very low in terms of the intellectual gravitas where you have commanders
[03:00:52.080 --> 03:00:57.360]  who are literally in action and i've worn our commanders that if they continue to appear before
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:03.520]  congress and senate and go over this nonsensical issue of sexual harassment we're now our own
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:08.720]  soldiers that have to wear high heel shoes in order to feel what it feels like to be a woman
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:12.880]  that's degrading but it's really by the way if you're new lister they made them wear ruby red
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:18.400]  slippers right i mean i mean this is this is just mental illness well it's not only mental illness
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:23.360]  there should be defiance within the rank and just throw out the generals or female generals or
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:29.840]  male generals who insist on it this is inappropriate it's a command and control issue it's not acceptable
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:36.560]  the second thing is where the cia a civilian unit has created troubles like in ices like iraq with
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:42.160]  bush jr and cheney where they were not able to complete their own task where it was an inappropriate
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:48.320]  task to attack iraq iraq was created ices was created from the generals who escaped thanks to
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:55.200]  jerry bremer who was an inept individual part of opus day a man who was never qualified for this
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:02:02.720]  and demilitarized the iraqi army now they have the unit of the iraqi army which attracted sunnis
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:08.320]  and that in turn our military has to go in and clean out what the cia made a mistake that is a
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:14.080]  history that has gone on for 30 years i've worked with both the cia and our military intelligence
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:19.840]  for the most part our cia has left the legacy of ashes as heisenhower's repeated and the
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:27.520]  military's had to clean it up be it vietnam be it ices be it iraq yemen samalia and so now we have
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:33.520]  an internal fight that goes between the civilians and the military it will go on for quite a while
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.160]  but we can no longer have and the civilians are going to put the military in roles to make them
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:42.880]  the bad guys just like they're going to put cops in the roles to make them the bad guys we've got
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:47.680]  to be sophisticated enough to see that it's these different agencies that want to discredit
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:53.840]  what they see as the old original american institutions the military and local governments
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:58.880]  well i'll give you an example i mean the prosecutor the african-american woman prosecutor moseby at
[03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:04.880]  baltimore who said that we're gonna find justice i mean she was she was absurd because i happen to
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:09.360]  know the difference between a switchblade and a regular knife and i happen to have properties
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:15.600]  in baltimore 30 years ago and i had to give them up because baltimore was the same problem 30 years
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.960]  ago that it has now so it has not improved it's not a matter of justice it's a matter of competency
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:25.680]  she also is going on stage with prince promising to persecute the police and i'm not defending
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:29.760]  the police state but i mean you don't have prosecutors like a rock star because she's
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:35.120]  prosecuting someone it's crazy correct and prince is totally inappropriate it's the issue of african
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:41.120]  american versus white is not appropriate obama should have cut this off quickly i think we have
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:46.720]  an attorney general who's quite good lynch who will not get into this problem and we can solve it i
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:53.920]  think we have an fd i director call me who defied uh bush jr before and i think that's going well
[03:03:53.920 --> 03:03:59.920]  and we have a general who's defied the president's orders so we have people who are really americans
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:05.920]  who defy what the orders are but do it quietly and then retaliate through guys like seymour
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:12.240]  hersh and that's definitely a retaliation against the clinton wire in closing only on 45 seconds
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:16.640]  why are they making such a big deal out of jade helm i mean we just mentioned it as an aside and
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:20.800]  they're like chickens with their heads cut off what's going on i have no idea they they just
[03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:26.080]  picked a particular individual for jade helm but the truth is the far greater story is the story
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:32.160]  of our economy as it moves forward and then china and europe and russia are going down so that's
[03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:35.920]  sure i talked to the governor's he was kept today and he said look we're just ignoring jade helm and
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.680]  trying to go ahead with the economy you just go ahead with the economy and that's what your people
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:43.520]  have to understand and keep on doing the great work all right well thank you dr patrick for your
