[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.960]  Areas of the Midwest, up into Minnesota and Illinois, are experiencing some of the coldest
[00:36.960 --> 00:43.200]  temperatures ever recorded since we've been recording temperatures the last 150 years
[00:43.200 --> 00:48.800]  accurately. We'll be obviously breaking all of that down today and praying for all of those
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.720]  in the Arctic blast zone because we've shut down close to half our cold plants, only a few
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.240]  have opened back up. The two years Trump got back in, many areas cannot produce enough power
[01:00.240 --> 01:05.040]  from the windmills and other systems that the globalists have put in and so a lot of people
[01:05.040 --> 01:11.040]  are without power. This is a very serious situation with the polar vortex, so pray for all those
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.680]  in those areas. It is, it is a very serious situation obviously. Coming up in the second hour
[01:17.680 --> 01:26.320]  today, when you first don't succeed, try, try again. It's been said that thrice is the answer
[01:26.320 --> 01:33.760]  or that three is the charm. Roger Stone, infowars.com reporter indicted by Mueller has tried to have
[01:33.760 --> 01:41.600]  two press conferences, one in Florida after his release from jail and then he has tried to have
[01:41.600 --> 01:50.080]  another one when he went to DC to be arraigned a few days ago. They completely shouted him down
[01:50.080 --> 01:59.040]  there where he couldn't even speak. So today in one hour at the JW Marriott in Washington DC,
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.360]  we have a major ballroom and then we have the private security and our own security there
[02:05.360 --> 02:10.960]  so that hopefully he can have free speech in a private property venue that cost yours truly
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.520]  six thousand dollars to rent and then to pay for the hotel security. I'm not complaining,
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.040]  just to have free speech in this country. You can't go put a bunch of microphones out
[02:20.560 --> 02:25.520]  and then go and be heard because the left's job is to shut you up so they can then misrepresent
[02:25.520 --> 02:33.600]  who you are. That is coming up in the second hour. Owen Shroyer is also going to be announcing the
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.800]  name of the woman that sexually assaulted him who has been arrested and charged with sexual assault.
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.680]  He didn't want to release her name but people are then saying that he made it up that he was just
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.400]  going to be nice. He didn't want people to dox her either but since folks are the leftist publications
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.240]  are saying that we made this up, we're going to release the arrest information. He's already been
[02:52.240 --> 02:57.600]  down to the police station yesterday, went live from the police department, the DC Metropolitan
[02:57.600 --> 03:01.680]  Police Department and so he'll be releasing her name and more at the press conference.
[03:01.680 --> 03:07.760]  He was also physically attacked again yesterday by a man that ate his microphone cover. So it is,
[03:07.760 --> 03:12.640]  it is quite an insane asylum. I'm told the police are looking to arrest that gentleman as well.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.680]  Ever since they attacked Tucker Carlson's house and a bunch of other stuff they're actually doing
[03:17.680 --> 03:24.480]  their job now finally going after these lunatics who tried to put spit in his eye and on his camera
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.520]  that is assault with a bodily fluid. That's a felony. He ate the microphone cover and then
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.400]  again sniffing it like a giant rat. Just a very bizarre person who actually was carrying around
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.960]  when they made giant 20 foot tall rat that he worships. You're a radio listener. That sounds
[03:38.960 --> 03:47.040]  completely insane. I'm not kidding. Okay, this really happened. A man worshipping a giant rat
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.640]  attacked Owen. TV viewers can see it right now. I'm not kidding. It's on infowars.com. Though this
[03:52.640 --> 03:59.440]  doesn't feel real right now, does it? No, it doesn't. So fight fascism by spitting on people and
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.800]  attacking them and eating their microphone covers. That is the crazed, a piranha-like left today.
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.200]  Okay, that said, now we have some other big guests in studio. You know, he was so powerful
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.000]  yesterday in studio that I invited Robert Barnes, attorney at law to come back in on some other
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.680]  subjects in the third hour. And then Paul Joseph Watson didn't do the Tuesday show. So he's doing
[04:19.680 --> 04:25.440]  the Thursday broadcast today. So this is going to be one hell of a transmission as they say.
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.360]  I want to thank you all for viewing and listening. Without you, the enemy would have won. We are
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.080]  bound together now against the will of the globalist. Our will is bound together and it's
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.280]  their will and it is quite the context. You're quite the contest. And I can feel your energy. I
[04:39.280 --> 04:45.280]  can feel your strength. So when you thank me, you're thanking yourself. So for myself, my family,
[04:45.280 --> 04:50.560]  and this whole crew, we don't just count on you. Without you, we're dead meat. Together, we win.
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.560]  So I salute everyone of you, no matter how old you are or where you came from or what color you are.
[04:54.560 --> 04:58.320]  If you love Liberty, you hate Satanist. We are brothers and sisters together.
[05:02.880 --> 05:07.040]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key. While coffee, candy,
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.600]  and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than
[05:11.600 --> 05:17.760]  ever. Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix in energy packet that utilizes vitamins,

[06:16.880 --> 06:18.480]  Tomorrow's News Today
[06:24.960 --> 06:33.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, January 31st, 2019. The Democrats are uncloking.
[06:33.840 --> 06:51.680]  They are revealing themselves, as evil always does when it makes its move.
[06:54.320 --> 07:02.960]  World government is now open. The attempt to end the family and its very existence is now
[07:02.960 --> 07:10.720]  mainstream. Mainstream headlines yesterday screamed, Satanist fear penses Christian faith.
[07:11.280 --> 07:16.640]  And breathlessly, mainstream news had the Satanist as the good guys fighting the evil of the Christians.
[07:18.960 --> 07:21.200]  Thank God we've got those Satanists as a watchdog.
[07:23.600 --> 07:31.200]  Read the headlines. It wasn't satire, it was real. And then, a few months ago, the law passed.
[07:31.200 --> 07:34.720]  It's now in place. You can kill a baby, taken out of the mother's womb,
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.280]  not just when the baby was crowning, like previously, with partial birth abortion.
[07:41.920 --> 07:49.680]  But up to the final hour, when the baby's born, they can decide whether they want to keep it alive.
[07:51.040 --> 07:56.000]  And Virginia is set to pass the bill and debated the bill. And people were shocked. We played the
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  clip yesterday. Folks were shocked around the world. The short clips of it on Twitter got tens of
[08:02.000 --> 08:09.520]  millions of views. And the governor then went on a radio show yesterday. Stories up on infowars.com.
[08:10.160 --> 08:15.040]  Used to go out to everybody. Sick. Virginia dims that are just billed to allow abortion right
[08:15.040 --> 08:28.880]  before a woman is giving birth. And the governor, sounding like a slick-tongued serpent, Ralph Northiam,
[08:29.920 --> 08:36.640]  admits that, yes, we'll have doctors decide with the mother, who does whatever they say,
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.480]  whether you're going to keep the baby or not. You know, Austin, Texas has the highest rate of
[08:42.480 --> 08:47.920]  caesareans in the world, according to a statistic I read last year. All four of my children were
[08:47.920 --> 08:54.320]  born caesarean. The doctors always find a reason to do it. And they say, in the near future, vaginal
[08:54.320 --> 09:00.320]  birth will be a thing of the past seen as abusive. This is the medical system taking control, but
[09:00.320 --> 09:08.400]  bioethics boards were set up in the 1920s in Europe, in England, and the United States,
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.400]  and Mexico, by the way, adopted it. They were some of the most strident eugenics just in the world,
[09:14.400 --> 09:20.400]  at that point. And if you had a bad test scores, or the local doctor thought you were stupid,
[09:21.120 --> 09:27.680]  you would have your genitals cut off, or you would have your cervix, your uterus removed. They
[09:27.680 --> 09:32.880]  didn't do the old tube tying then. And those same health department systems now have the
[09:32.880 --> 09:39.200]  forced vaccine regimen. They now have the bioethics boards in the hospitals that decide who lives and
[09:39.200 --> 09:45.360]  who dies. And so you hear about this woman's right to choose, and the governor says,
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.120]  yes, the baby's born in our new bill, and we kill it after it's out of the womb.
[09:52.160 --> 09:58.640]  So it is post birth abortion. And I told you that was coming in my film, In Game,
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.480]  Blueprint for Global Enslavment, now been released for 12 years. I have clips of the state health
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.360]  board congressional meeting in Texas, the legislative meeting. I have federal congressional
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.760]  meetings where they have the boards, and they talk about eugenics, bad gene pools,
[10:16.880 --> 10:22.720]  and how they are carrying out these operations. To understand, those cults are still operating,
[10:22.720 --> 10:30.720]  just like the head of the Cold Springs Harbor, Dr. Watson, who discovered DNA with his British
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.720]  counterparts, came out and said he's looked at DNA and that basically black people aren't humans,
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.840]  that gay people have a gene that makes them weak and stupid, so they need to be gotten rid of.
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.560]  I mean, it's all there. This is his perspective looking at the DNA. And so he just got stripped
[10:48.560 --> 10:53.920]  of all of his letters, his awards, because he said it. You have to understand, folks,
[10:55.200 --> 11:02.560]  you don't know who this group is unless anyone in your family got into it. And my dad had some
[11:02.560 --> 11:07.360]  of the highest test scores when he was a junior in high school. He went into the plan to University
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.160]  of Texas. He worked at MD Anderson when he was in high school, cancer research facility. He was
[11:12.160 --> 11:17.120]  not in high school anymore after he was a junior, and they just walked him into rooms and point
[11:17.120 --> 11:20.880]  blank told him. He had a Jewish professor who was the head of the botany department,
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.160]  Spear, and he said, no, we don't like the Nazis. I know a lot of you young people here in this
[11:26.160 --> 11:31.200]  elite group thought the Nazis, that's good. They were going after select groups. We're going after
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.440]  everyone, and eugenics is good. Now, my dad never ended up going with that program. There were only
[11:37.440 --> 11:43.280]  six kids in that elite program that he was in, and I guess whatever it was, like 1966 or something.
[11:43.280 --> 11:49.200]  So you have to understand, he never even told me all this until he saw my film Endgame,
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.200]  before it was released. My mom was blown away by it and said, David, this can't be Trony. He said,
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.840]  well, actually, it's all true. And I knew parts of it. And she knew Professor Spear,
[11:57.840 --> 12:03.200]  his letter when she was going to UT, and they were getting married. They would go over to his
[12:03.200 --> 12:07.440]  house and have dinner. I mean, my dad really liked him. But the point was is that, and he was
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.920]  Jewish, eugenics guy, is that that's what's going on. And so people have to understand,
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.000]  this is what runs things, and this is what operates. So they're in the elite guild,
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.520]  you're not in the elite guild. I mean, they first off looked, you have the top test scores in your
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.320]  state. Then you just get a seat at the table to find out if you're going to be recruited and
[12:30.320 --> 12:35.120]  promoted up into these systems. That's what happened to Bill Gates. That's what happened to
[12:35.120 --> 12:41.200]  Warren Buffett. All of their families were eugenics. All of their family think of the KKK
[12:41.200 --> 12:47.120]  as racist. The KKK is a joke. Okay. This is the real deal. These aren't people sitting around
[12:47.120 --> 12:53.520]  rigging Jack Daniels wearing wizard outfits. These are people with 170 IQs that run the planet.
[12:53.520 --> 13:02.480]  And they mean business. So we come back. I'm going to play the sickening audio
[13:02.480 --> 13:12.800]  of the governor of Virginia saying, now listen, this is a woman's right. Stay out of it. And
[13:12.800 --> 13:19.840]  the women both nod their heads. There's nothing to do with women. This is a baby on the table.
[13:21.840 --> 13:26.480]  And they're trying to tell women, kill babies up to the time of birth. And then it expands out
[13:26.480 --> 13:29.920]  from there. And you can say, well, the Spartans, if the baby didn't look right,
[13:29.920 --> 13:36.480]  the local high priest would decide the apothecary, the doctor, whether we're going to keep Mernon
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.520]  and they're not there. They had a cliff that they threw the baby off of.
[13:44.480 --> 13:53.440]  The famous 400 foot cliff. That's how this works. And so they're just introducing it to you. Oh,
[13:53.440 --> 14:01.360]  now it's after it's born and even says, well, we keep the baby alive. And then we kill it.
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.000]  And then, of course, you use the body parts. So we'll break that all down. We come back after
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.320]  this break. This is the big issue. This is the dehumanization program. And I'm going to give
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.920]  you the rest of the story, how the whole thing operates. But they call in the best and brightest.
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.320]  They tell them, you're the elite. You're going to decide who lives and dies. They call it bioethics.
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.760]  They got rid of the Hippocratic oath 16 years ago worldwide. Do no harm. Now their job is to
[14:25.760 --> 14:33.600]  carry out the orderly execution. If the mother's in labor, then the infant would be delivered.
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.560]  The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother
[14:38.560 --> 14:54.640]  and the family desired. Be kept comfortable. This will be painless. Destroy the child. Corrupt them
[14:54.640 --> 15:00.560]  all. And you say, why do they do this? Because it's the act of getting the nurses and the doctors
[15:00.560 --> 15:08.640]  involved. Just like Hitler did, the first group by 34, first, the secret police got control,
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.600]  the Gestapo, they took out the brown shirts that brought him to power, first secure power,
[15:13.600 --> 15:21.520]  then get the doctors to start carrying out infanticide. And then once you get them to do that,
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.520]  then they'll do anything. It's called the cement of blood. It's a Nazi technique of getting you
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.840]  involved in immoral crime. And then once you've done that, you'll do anything because you can't
[15:31.840 --> 15:37.680]  admit what you did was wrong before. It's satanic. They get you involved in a satanic crime,
[15:37.680 --> 15:43.360]  and then they have you. I have you now. All right. We'll explain it all on the other side,
[15:43.360 --> 15:46.880]  the deep secrets that I want you to know. The reason they fear this broadcast more than any
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.120]  other on the planet. Whatever you do, live streaming, listening to local radio, tell folks
[15:51.120 --> 15:56.880]  how you're listening. Your word of mouth is beyond paramount. It is mission essential. You are the

[16:07.920 --> 16:13.680]  spiral out of control. After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more
[16:13.680 --> 16:20.080]  often and using prescription drugs. After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take
[16:20.080 --> 16:26.080]  our children away from me. I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could

[17:37.200 --> 17:44.080]  foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.080 --> 17:50.480]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[17:50.480 --> 17:57.360]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available at

[19:11.680 --> 19:15.520]  and get creative and get fired up. We won't just be here 100 years. We'll be here forever. We'll
[19:15.520 --> 19:20.640]  turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what
[19:20.640 --> 19:25.120]  are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here. We made it. And that's really
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.160]  where this goes. God's got a big war for you ready. And so if you can't face George Soros and
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.640]  Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the
[19:34.640 --> 19:39.600]  other stuff? Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[19:39.600 --> 19:43.040]  ready to fight. You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[19:43.040 --> 19:46.800]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future. I mean, all I know is,
[19:46.800 --> 19:52.320]  I want to go with the master built. I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit
[19:52.320 --> 19:56.880]  that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being a
[19:56.880 --> 20:05.920]  tomb. I want life. I want Jesus. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.880 --> 20:35.200]  Well, so does he live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[20:36.400 --> 20:43.760]  There's an article posted info wars.com. Watch live. Roger Stone holds major press conference in
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.120]  DC. I will not be silenced. Today's show will feature stones live press conference coming up
[20:49.120 --> 20:55.360]  in about 40 minutes. Democrats openly endorsing post birth abortions. Schultz running for president,
[20:55.360 --> 21:02.240]  sending the leftists into connection. Fetch and more, more, more, more. So that is all coming up.
[21:03.200 --> 21:08.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the second hour, this very live feed that's going out is posted in
[21:08.480 --> 21:13.840]  that article that you see. And so we'll be covering it. There'll be a commercial free feed
[21:13.840 --> 21:19.440]  that we have that'll be posted as well to this same page. And so we certainly hope the drug
[21:19.440 --> 21:24.480]  report.com has been very gracious to pick up the live feeds. The last few times, Rogers tried to
[21:24.480 --> 21:28.320]  give a press conference. We'll do it today because we're doing it inside the JW Marriott,
[21:29.120 --> 21:35.040]  renting a ballroom and paying for their security $6,000 for only an hour in the big room.
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.680]  I'm not complaining, just we can't have it on the street because in Florida and then in DC in
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.880]  the last week, they shout the thing down. He got a few sentences out in Florida. He could get nothing
[21:44.880 --> 21:53.120]  out, nothing out in DC. So we hope in a private venue, we're able to do that. And of course,
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.600]  we're announcing it just in the last 20 minutes or so. So hopefully Antifa scum doesn't come and try
[21:57.600 --> 22:02.320]  to stop it. But whatever happens, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be covering it live. And it's
[22:04.800 --> 22:10.640]  already getting picked up by the news. Okay, let me break it down right now.
[22:12.320 --> 22:19.280]  I should have just started the last segment with incredible Virginia governor endorses
[22:19.280 --> 22:26.880]  post birth abortion after the bill that he's supported was introduced and was debated a few
[22:26.880 --> 22:32.160]  days ago. People freaked out when they discussed killing babies out of the womb. Well, the governor
[22:32.800 --> 22:38.400]  just said, Hey, this is what we do. It's the way it is. And leave a woman's right to choose where
[22:38.400 --> 22:45.360]  it is. So now it's a woman's right to choose when the baby is already out of the mother.
[22:45.360 --> 22:51.360]  And you see this is in line with the main tenants of eugenics and Dr. Peter Singer,
[22:51.360 --> 22:56.080]  who's really the head of PETA, who believes you should be able to kill children up to age three.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.520]  And what the government can decide if you're not smart, you don't have value. And of course,
[23:01.520 --> 23:05.600]  you know where that goes from there exactly where we see it. Everything we got warned about
[23:06.240 --> 23:12.480]  when Roe v. Wade 45 years ago went to the Supreme Court, just in time where some people,
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.960]  my parents knew said, Oh, your husband's going to medical school. Alex was unplanned.
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.160]  Why don't you kill him? Be a real feminist. Remember friends told her, you know, you'll
[23:22.160 --> 23:27.280]  have more money, you can have more fun. And they discussed aborting me and decided, let's not do
[23:27.280 --> 23:33.120]  that. But then my mother said, let me get an IED show that we don't have more kids. And then that
[23:33.120 --> 23:38.000]  sterilized her and gave her endometriosis. And she had to have her body part removed
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.680]  and wanted to have more kids. So we adopted my sister, Marley, who's awesome from South Korea.
[23:44.240 --> 23:48.880]  But you know, if they couldn't get me, boy, they sure got my mom. And of course, those
[23:48.880 --> 23:54.960]  things were designed to screw up women's reproductive system. So ladies, you better find
[23:54.960 --> 24:01.120]  out about the bigger plan and how every abortion doubles your chances of reproductive cancers.
[24:01.120 --> 24:07.680]  Yeah, if 99% of the time, if the pregnancy needs to be terminated, mother nature does it.
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.160]  But the way that the governor's spending it, oh, the health of the mother,
[24:12.160 --> 24:16.000]  that's not what the bill says. Let me tell you something. If a woman's dying and it's the
[24:16.000 --> 24:23.680]  woman or the baby, it's default. You save the mother. Okay. In decades past, a lot of times,
[24:23.680 --> 24:28.720]  they'd ask the mother, do you want to try to have this baby? He can kill you. And sometimes,
[24:28.720 --> 24:32.000]  you know, it was really Christian, hardcore Christians, the doctor was hardcore Christian.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.720]  Sometimes the woman would make the decision with the husband to go ahead and try to have it,
[24:34.720 --> 24:39.840]  then she'd die too. But in most cases, it's not called abortion. If the baby's threatened in
[24:39.840 --> 24:45.920]  the mother's life, it's called an emergency procedure. So they always spend that. But the
[24:45.920 --> 24:54.320]  bill itself, same one, past New York, it's now law, says that you can kill a baby for any reason.
[24:54.320 --> 24:57.680]  Now he later tries to spend it and say, well, there'll be two doctors that'll agree to it.
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.800]  No, the bill doesn't say that. So they are desperately trying to put this info out. So here
[25:02.800 --> 25:11.840]  is the governor on television via radio. And it's the sickest thing ever. This is Virginia
[25:11.840 --> 25:18.480]  Democrat Governor Ralph Northam advocates post birth abortion. We'll just hear it from him.
[25:19.680 --> 25:25.520]  Abortions. These are done with the consent of obviously the mother with the consent
[25:25.520 --> 25:31.200]  of the physicians, more than one physician, by the way. And it's done in cases where there may
[25:31.200 --> 25:37.600]  be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that's non-Bible. So in this particular example,
[25:37.600 --> 25:43.760]  if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered.
[25:43.760 --> 25:50.400]  The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother
[25:50.400 --> 25:56.400]  and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.560]  So I think this was really blown out of proportion. But again, we want the government not to be
[26:02.560 --> 26:08.560]  involved in these types of decisions. We want the decision to be made by the mothers and their
[26:08.560 --> 26:14.800]  providers. And this is why Julie, that legislators, most of whom are men, by the way, shouldn't be
[26:14.800 --> 26:20.320]  telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body. So here's a man spending
[26:20.320 --> 26:23.920]  this in line. Notice he says in some of these cases, back it up again. I want to play it again.
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.280]  He says, in some of these cases, we've got to form babies as if they didn't know in the sonogram
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.120]  as if they didn't know before. So he's misrepresenting what's in the bill.
[26:35.120 --> 26:41.440]  This bill says you can kill babies even when they come out of the womb, which is absolutely murder
[26:41.440 --> 26:48.000]  of a child, a serious premeditated felony. And then he wraps it in, let's not get in the way
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.680]  of what these mothers' wishes are. So they're making new law that, oh, you Christians and
[26:53.680 --> 26:57.680]  conservatives don't want to kill babies in the last three months because they can easily have a
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.320]  cesarean and then adopt the baby up. And then we've actually got more people wanting to adopt.
[27:04.400 --> 27:07.280]  Then we actually have abortions every year. They don't tell the women that.
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.520]  No, now they want the bioethics board, the eugenics board at these hospitals to come up with
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.800]  whatever deal they want to try to trick a woman to let them have the baby to get the organs.
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.680]  There's a lot of reasons they want to do this, but a woman is under their control in a hospital,
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.480]  and we're going to not have the government involved or the church or anybody. We're going to have
[27:28.480 --> 27:34.240]  the hospitals, and we're going to have the mothers decide right then what happens to this baby.
[27:39.200 --> 27:42.800]  So it also repeals criminal charges for harming unborn children.
[27:42.800 --> 27:44.400]  Let's go ahead and play the club again. Here it is.
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.240]  There may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that's non-Bible. So in this particular
[27:54.240 --> 28:00.480]  example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be
[28:00.480 --> 28:06.640]  delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what
[28:06.640 --> 28:12.320]  the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians
[28:12.320 --> 28:18.560]  and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion. But again, we want the government
[28:18.560 --> 28:24.720]  not to be involved in these types of decisions. We want the decision to be made by the mothers
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.960]  and their providers. And this is why, Julie, that legislators, most of whom are men, by the way,
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.640]  shouldn't be telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body.
[28:35.360 --> 28:38.960]  Now, this is the government trying to pass a law. This is the government saying,
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.480]  we're not just going to kill babies in the womb now. We're going to kill their ass once they're
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.120]  out of the womb and lying and saying it's for deform babies. It's babies period and it's not
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.560]  two physicians involved. It gets rid of that. So it pushes already the partial birth abortion
[28:52.560 --> 28:56.240]  all the way to post-birth abortion. We'll play the whole clip when we come back. Stay with us.

[31:59.760 --> 32:04.160]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[32:04.160 --> 32:09.600]  the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally
[32:10.160 --> 32:14.800]  dumps the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[32:14.800 --> 32:20.880]  iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was
[32:20.880 --> 32:24.880]  pretty good but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it,
[32:24.880 --> 32:30.640]  so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and BroughtUX2 that's been incredible.
[32:31.200 --> 32:36.400]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[32:36.400 --> 32:41.840]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[32:41.840 --> 32:48.320]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[32:48.320 --> 32:54.080]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[32:54.080 --> 33:23.920]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[33:23.920 --> 33:32.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones, live from Austin,
[33:32.400 --> 33:37.760]  Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[33:44.400 --> 33:48.640]  So, if you were ever wondering how they would bring
[33:48.640 --> 33:54.880]  infanticide like China has, the killing of already born healthy babies even, well you now look at
[33:54.880 --> 33:59.840]  New York that's past it and Virginia set to pass it, and how they play these semantical games.
[34:01.520 --> 34:06.080]  They are now streamlining the murder of children that has nothing to do with the health of the
[34:06.080 --> 34:14.400]  mother after the baby is outside of the womb. This is a larger eugenics plan, I predicted it in my
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.840]  film in-game blueprint for global enslavement, but still free online with tens of millions of views,
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.240]  but that major organizations, anti-free speech groups are trying to remove because it proves
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.600]  how deadly accurate we've been so that they hope you won't listen to us in the future. But we're
[34:29.600 --> 34:36.160]  going to lay out the plan and then after it's passed across the country to kill babies after
[34:36.160 --> 34:42.960]  they're born, what's coming next after that? So we're again going to lay it all out here today,
[34:42.960 --> 34:48.320]  and hopefully you will then once this video is posted to infowars.com and newswars.com get it
[34:48.320 --> 34:52.560]  and send it to your friends, your neighbors, your families, nurses, doctors, because nurses and
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.280]  doctors are really awake to all this. But then you know that other people know and are aware of
[34:57.280 --> 35:02.960]  what's happening, and I want to tell you about infanticide of babies that are up to six months
[35:02.960 --> 35:09.440]  old that we've had whistleblower nurses on the last few years. Yes, they're killing babies without
[35:09.440 --> 35:14.800]  even telling the parents the hospitals are. Super hardcore felonies, but it's been done through
[35:14.800 --> 35:22.160]  the health department, through eugenics boards, so that's coming up. Now, if you just tuned in,
[35:22.160 --> 35:28.240]  I just played the governor putting his deceptive spin in Virginia on this is a woman's choice,
[35:28.240 --> 35:32.160]  stay out of it, and we'll have two doctors that agree if she wants to kill the baby once it's out
[35:32.160 --> 35:36.240]  of the womb on the on the table, and we'll make them comfortable before we kill them.
[35:36.240 --> 35:41.760]  And he's responding to debate in the State House, where people are reading the bill about killing
[35:41.760 --> 35:45.920]  a baby after it's born and they're freaked out. So he tries to spin it and say, well,
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.560]  in some cases they're deformed, as if they wouldn't already know that with ultrasound. So
[35:52.720 --> 35:56.560]  health of the mother, nothing to do with it. Deformities, even if you say, hey,
[35:57.440 --> 36:02.400]  shouldn't kill kids with deformities, let's move past the eugenics debate. This is them
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.120]  killing viable healthy babies in the hospital, pressuring mothers into doing it so they can get
[36:07.120 --> 36:14.560]  their organs. And that's really what's going on here is they can get up to a half million dollars
[36:14.560 --> 36:18.960]  for those organs, and they can get especially poor, ignorant mothers to go along with it and
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.760]  never know what hit them. And my dad was in medical management for decades, believe me,
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.080]  I know all about it. And they've had 60 minute specials out there about them killing people
[36:28.080 --> 36:36.720]  for their organs. So you better know what this is really all about, period. Now let's play the
[36:36.720 --> 36:43.280]  whole clip from the radio show that he was on, radio slash TV, to hear the whole spectrum of
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.200]  the deception. We'll go to that in a moment. But first, I want to play the clip that started it
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.120]  all. Remember, New York has already passed this. And this is how they're countering Christians.
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.360]  This is how they're countering conservatives. This is how they're countering people humanizing
[36:55.360 --> 37:01.760]  babies with the ultrasound, sucking their thumb, singing, playing by the second trimester,
[37:01.760 --> 37:05.760]  by the third trimester jumping around having a great time, can't wait to sit in their mommy's
[37:05.760 --> 37:11.360]  lap. They don't tell women how you can get $300, $400,000 from the average adoption agency for
[37:11.360 --> 37:16.800]  that baby. There's actually a shortage. They're never told that. They're told we'll give you
[37:16.800 --> 37:20.480]  300 bucks to abort the baby. They never tell you they sell the body parts and get sometimes tens
[37:20.480 --> 37:24.240]  of thousands of dollars. Sometimes it's partial birth, hundreds of thousands because they take
[37:24.240 --> 37:30.960]  the baby away. They keep it alive and they just harvest the organs at their legion. So this is
[37:30.960 --> 37:39.600]  the whole sick, easy, laissez-faire system they've got where this is done out in the open. But the
[37:39.600 --> 37:44.720]  first clip is the house dims in Virginia propose legislation allow abortions while the mother
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.280]  is having the baby. But actually, the bill says after it's born, you'll see the governor admit
[37:49.280 --> 37:55.280]  that in a moment. But here is the snake women sitting around talking about this. So how late in
[37:55.280 --> 38:02.080]  the third trimester would you be able to do that? You know, it's very unfortunate that there are
[38:02.080 --> 38:06.640]  physicians, witnesses were not able to attend today to speak specifically. No, I'm talking about your
[38:06.640 --> 38:13.120]  bill. How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated
[38:13.120 --> 38:19.440]  it would impair the mental health of the of the woman or physical health. Okay. Okay. I'm talking
[38:19.440 --> 38:24.160]  about the mental health. So I mean, through the third trimester, the third trimester goes all the
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.960]  way up to 40 weeks. Okay. But to the end of the third trimester, I don't think we have a limit
[38:28.960 --> 38:43.120]  in the bill. So where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that
[38:43.120 --> 38:48.160]  she is about to give a birth. Would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if
[38:48.160 --> 39:01.360]  she was so certified? She's dilating. Mr. Chairman, that would be a, you know, a decision that the
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.640]  doctor, the physician and the woman understand that I'm asking if your bill allows that. My bill
[39:06.640 --> 39:13.440]  would allow that. Yes. Now, the governor clarified, he said, no, no, no, no, we keep the baby alive
[39:13.440 --> 39:18.800]  after. Now, let me tell women something that are cold-blooded leftist. You're nothing but like
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.840]  an apple tree to these doctors and these corrupt medical facilities. You could get
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.560]  couple hundred thousand for the healthy viable baby. They pay while you had the baby all your
[39:30.560 --> 39:35.680]  medical fees and these adoption groups, some Christian, some not, we'll, we'll pay you on
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.320]  average a couple hundred thousand dollars. If the baby has black hair and blue eyes,
[39:40.320 --> 39:45.440]  you can get five hundred thousand. I know people that work at these groups. Okay. That's the most
[39:45.440 --> 39:54.000]  expensive black hair, blue eyes, five hundred thousand dollars living. Even more expensive,
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.720]  green eyes, black hair is the most expensive. Now, that's just a fact, Jack. And they do
[40:00.720 --> 40:05.040]  genetic testing and things like that. So these elite families will pay even more. So women aren't
[40:05.040 --> 40:11.680]  being told you can get five hundred thousand cash. You can get a hundred thousand dollars for a
[40:11.680 --> 40:16.800]  black baby. I'm not being mean. It's just not, you can get two hundred thousand dollars for a
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.960]  Hispanic baby or an Asian baby. Well, I think my parents paid almost that for my sister 30 years ago.
[40:23.760 --> 40:29.120]  So let's get down to brass tax here. You're not being told how valuable your uterus is.
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.640]  You're not being told you go have that third trimester abortion. They keep that baby alive
[40:34.640 --> 40:40.080]  in the back room and harvest those goodies. Three hundred, four hundred thousand, two hundred and
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.560]  a low end. You could have got some major cash. So maybe we're reaching out to liberal women the
[40:44.560 --> 40:49.520]  wrong way. We're listening, honey. You can grow these goodies and sell them. These folks are
[40:49.520 --> 40:56.320]  ripping you off. So that's a whole nother angle that nobody else gets to here. Is that these
[40:56.320 --> 41:03.520]  hospitals want the organs and they want to keep that baby alive. And you go look at this legislator
[41:03.520 --> 41:09.520]  and who's funding her some of these big medical nanotech biotech labs. They want whole babies
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.720]  and they want a law to keep them alive, keep them comfortable while they're getting harvested.
[41:15.280 --> 41:18.960]  Now here's the governor admitting it but putting a bunch of spin around it. Here it is.
[41:19.520 --> 41:24.080]  There's no exception. There was a very contentious committee hearing yesterday when Fairfax County
[41:24.080 --> 41:29.280]  delegate Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third trimester abortions as
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.760]  well as other restrictions now in place. And she was pressed by a Republican delegate about
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.280]  whether her bill would permit an abortion even as a woman is essentially dilating ready to give
[41:39.280 --> 41:46.880]  birth. And she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor. Do you support
[41:46.880 --> 41:53.440]  her measure and explain her answer? Yeah, you know, I wasn't there, Julie, and I certainly can't
[41:53.440 --> 42:01.760]  speak for delegate Tran, but I would tell you one first thing I would say this is why decisions
[42:01.760 --> 42:10.640]  such as this should be made by providers, physicians, and the mothers that are involved.
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.240]  We're going to come back with this unedited because I want you to hear it. Notice it's the
[42:14.240 --> 42:21.520]  providers, nice southern gentlemen, the providers going to take the ghetto at baby. I see, I see,
[42:21.520 --> 42:28.400]  I see. You don't realize you're hearing pure maximum evil right now. We're going to keep that
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.360]  baby comfortable after that. It's mama. And then once we get all them little good, good little,
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.520]  the little chitlins out of there, once we get all the little organ meats out of that little chicken,
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.160]  we're going to flush his blood out and sell it to rich people to inject into their veins.
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.640]  And we're going to make us a lot of money and we're going to go to the Bahamas and we're going
[42:48.640 --> 42:54.400]  to get out some huggers. I kill that little baby baby. There ain't nothing you're going to stop either.
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.160]  I'm a fine southern gentleman. Let me have a mint julep.
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.160]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key. While coffee, candy,

[44:03.440 --> 44:07.520]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with info wars. Yes, some of them
[44:07.520 --> 44:11.360]  are like little side accounts. They even know we had like info war store that just showed our
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.880]  products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be
[44:16.880 --> 44:20.880]  mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.880]  this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick. But the globalists
[44:24.880 --> 44:30.880]  now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to
[44:30.880 --> 44:37.040]  be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just
[44:37.040 --> 44:42.480]  destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that,
[44:42.480 --> 44:47.040]  and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've got a back ish and I promise you this.
[44:47.040 --> 44:52.400]  I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will, but I give
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.080]  you my commitment if you financially support us at infowarstore.com to give you my absolute total
[44:58.080 --> 45:04.400]  commitment. If you're not expanding, you're imploding. There is no set stasis. There is no
[45:04.400 --> 45:09.200]  managed system. There is no uncontenual. The continuum is always launching forward in the
[45:09.200 --> 45:14.640]  future. So you support us and get creative and get fired up. We won't just be here 100 years.
[45:14.640 --> 45:18.800]  We'll be here forever. We'll turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases
[45:18.800 --> 45:23.520]  and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here,
[45:23.520 --> 45:28.640]  we made it. And that's really where this goes. But God's got a big war for you ready. And so
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.720]  if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[45:32.720 --> 45:37.680]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff? Because God wants warriors that are smart
[45:37.680 --> 45:41.760]  and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight. You don't go to the next level without
[45:41.760 --> 45:44.880]  getting a big weight put on your back. And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the
[45:44.880 --> 45:50.160]  future. I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built. I want to go to the next level.
[45:50.160 --> 45:55.920]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed
[45:55.920 --> 46:00.560]  and feels like being in a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus. Listen, I'm just going to tell

[46:59.760 --> 47:28.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show Monday through Friday from 11am
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.040]  to 3pm. I'm here. Alex Jones, your host, then War Room, 3pm Central. The David Knight broadcast,
[47:35.600 --> 47:41.440]  8am Central being hosted by Harrison Smith and others while David has been convalescing from
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.720]  a big heart attack and surgery. But he's already ready to get back in the fray, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.560]  He'll be back in a week and a half hosting the David Knight show. And he's the guy that usually
[47:52.560 --> 47:58.880]  gets ready for six hours before a broadcast. I told David, you do double the time preparation
[47:58.880 --> 48:04.880]  for every minute of airtime. You're up here at 4am every day. Stop it. And then you're leaving it
[48:04.880 --> 48:10.480]  like 4pm every day. I mean, it's crazy how much he researches. And I'm going to like, dude,
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.560]  do half the research, have more guests on playclips. It's ridiculous how much preparation he does.
[48:16.560 --> 48:23.520]  It's insane. But anyways, you can hear that broadcast. 8am every day. And it's time for
[48:23.520 --> 48:27.840]  not him to start mailing it in. He does the opposite. I mean, I do hours and hours of
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.720]  preparation. And it seems like the ones where I do like four or five hours are not the good shows
[48:32.720 --> 48:35.920]  because I just get too prepared and then I'm all pissed off and frazzled. And I've already
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.080]  looked at the news so much that it just makes me angry. Some of the best times are when I just,
[48:40.080 --> 48:48.080]  it stops breaking and I'm giving my first analysis, but I'm digressing. Okay, so you have to understand
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.920]  this all sounds crazy. But if you go to the medical literature everywhere, they're harvesting
[48:51.920 --> 48:55.680]  babies organs, they're selling them. And you've seen all the undercover footage last few years,
[48:55.680 --> 49:01.120]  it's exposed that, but the laws are in place. It goes on. But there's an issue with you need to
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.720]  keep somebody alive on a respirator while you take the organs. You can make twice as much money
[49:06.720 --> 49:13.200]  if you can keep the subject alive and take organs a piece here, a piece here, you know,
[49:13.200 --> 49:18.320]  the kidneys, the liver, you keep people alive a week or so while you keep them on a respirator.
[49:18.320 --> 49:25.360]  And finally you take the heart and sell that and the lungs and things like that. So they can get
[49:25.360 --> 49:30.560]  double the money keeping these babies like the movie coma in these wards they're building at
[49:30.560 --> 49:34.800]  these children's facilities where they actually keep the little slaves alive, although vampires
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.440]  have their will with them. Oh, but it's all to save lives of others. So everyone's brainwashed
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.920]  and psychologically tested to make sure they don't see what they're doing. The nurses are paid,
[49:43.920 --> 49:50.080]  you know, 300,000 a year instead of 80,000 a year. The doctors are paid 2 million a year
[49:50.080 --> 49:58.480]  instead of 500,000 a year. They are all a very special guild. But see, once this is made mainstream,
[49:58.480 --> 50:05.120]  it'll be just cut down to no big deal. And then, oh, got a complication. Looks like your baby's
[50:05.120 --> 50:10.080]  oxygen went down. Looks like they're going to be brain damaged. Would you like to talk to the
[50:10.080 --> 50:13.840]  nurse while you're on all these drugs and things? Would you like to sign this form?
[50:14.480 --> 50:16.240]  We're not going to be able to resuscitate.
[50:18.240 --> 50:23.680]  Oh, yes, doctor. I signed it good. My husband's in prison. I don't know what to do. It's okay.
[50:23.680 --> 50:32.800]  I'm a fine Southern gentleman, man. Never mind that demo tell right there. I'm going to take
[50:32.800 --> 50:41.600]  good care of you, my little sweetsy. We just got us another half million dollars. You remember
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.800]  the undercover videos where there's like women drinking $400 bottles of wine. They're drunk.
[50:46.800 --> 50:50.800]  They're going, I'm going to get a Ferrari next week. Seriously, I'm making millions.
[50:50.800 --> 50:57.040]  I had all these places and I can't believe we're getting the whole babies for like 50 grand.
[50:57.840 --> 51:05.760]  I sold one for $400,000 last week. There is a freshest problem though.
[51:07.840 --> 51:12.960]  We could just keep those little buggers alive a couple of days. We could really get their goods.
[51:12.960 --> 51:20.160]  And you wonder why there's so archetypally evil because the archetypes are what they really are.
[51:21.920 --> 51:26.080]  The undercover videos of YouTube and the New York Times working together to
[51:26.080 --> 51:30.240]  they go, who's your number one enemy? Oh, Alex Jones and those damn veterans and
[51:30.240 --> 51:35.280]  any scum with with you. Yeah, here's here. She is any scum with American flags. Yeah,
[51:35.280 --> 51:42.240]  we hate them and we'll crush them good. I love Ferraris and Lamborghinis and $400
[51:42.240 --> 51:53.200]  bottles of wine. So the mother comes in, they go, it's your right little lady to get rid of
[51:53.200 --> 51:58.880]  that little bugger. They don't join and say, how would you like half the money? You grew the baby.
[51:58.880 --> 52:05.360]  How would you like $200,000? And see, that's what's going to bring this down. It's not women
[52:05.360 --> 52:09.440]  on average actually caring about their baby. They're programmed by the Satanism, many of them.
[52:09.440 --> 52:16.080]  But if they hear they didn't get any of the money, well, then maybe we can cause a big debate and
[52:16.080 --> 52:22.000]  class action lawsuits about this because then you hear this monster governor realizing the bill
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.320]  is really about keeping the kids alive and getting their organs. So he doesn't even debate that they
[52:26.320 --> 52:31.600]  killed the baby up to the point it's coming out of the mama. No, no, he goes, listen here,
[52:31.600 --> 52:38.400]  my little baby, we keep that baby alive. And then we take real good care of it. We kill it.
[52:38.400 --> 52:44.000]  But there's no discussion of why they want to do that and why they want custody of that little
[52:44.000 --> 52:50.480]  baby, that little baby boy, be they black, be they white, be they Hispanic, be they Asian,
[52:50.480 --> 52:57.920]  God's children in the hands of that fork tail little devil, selling them goods, selling them
[52:57.920 --> 53:05.280]  goods, doing that sacrifice right in front of mama and God and saying to the ladies,
[53:05.280 --> 53:10.480]  you don't question this because it's a lady's right. Even though the ladies aren't getting the
[53:10.480 --> 53:17.760]  money, it's the nice governor getting those contributions. It's the governor. He knows
[53:17.760 --> 53:24.560]  what he'd be doing. The state's got a new main export. It's our baby's organs. Here, let's hear
[53:24.560 --> 53:32.400]  this slime bag for yourself. Certainly can't speak for delegate Tran, but I would tell you one,
[53:32.400 --> 53:38.560]  the first thing I would say, this is why decisions such as this should be made by providers,
[53:38.560 --> 53:46.560]  physicians and the mothers and fathers that are involved. The mothers and the fathers and the
[53:46.560 --> 53:52.400]  women's all looking real deliberative. They're all such good moral people. Oh, tell me, the mothers
[53:52.400 --> 53:59.840]  and the providers, they know it's a good thing we're doing for the babies. And again, the provider's
[53:59.840 --> 54:06.160]  going to take care of you. Let's go back to him. When we talk about third trimester abortions,
[54:06.160 --> 54:13.040]  these are done with the consent of obviously the mother with the consent of the physicians. Hold
[54:13.040 --> 54:19.600]  on. Is there consent of the baby that's now out of the womb? Oh, I know. It's not a person. Continue.
[54:21.120 --> 54:27.120]  And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities. It's done in cases where there may
[54:27.120 --> 54:37.040]  be. No, the bill says kill everybody if you want to. Continue. Play it. So in this particular
[54:37.040 --> 54:43.200]  example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.440]  delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what
[54:49.440 --> 54:55.040]  the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.080]  and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion. But again, we
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.880]  blown out of proportion. No discussion of the father. No discussion of the baby, the father.
[55:07.440 --> 55:13.440]  That discussion will ensue by the hospital and the mama who's all drugged up. Let's continue.
[55:14.160 --> 55:19.280]  The government not to be involved in these types of decisions. We want the decision to be made by
[55:19.280 --> 55:26.560]  the mothers and their providers. And this is why, Julie, that legislators, most of whom are men,
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.120]  by the way, shouldn't be telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body.
[55:31.120 --> 55:35.920]  And do you think multiple physicians should have to weigh in as is currently required? She's
[55:35.920 --> 55:40.400]  trying to lift that requirement. Well, I think it's always good to get a second opinion and
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.440]  at least two providers to be involved in that decision because these decisions.
[55:45.440 --> 55:50.640]  Here are the two doctors that run our organ harvesting wing. We're not going to tell you
[55:50.640 --> 55:57.680]  that, but they both agree it's best for Junior to go for a few days with us. They're comfortable
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.760]  in the room over here. Get the knives ready, boys. I'm sorry. We're going to take good care
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.040]  of your baby, lady. Let's go back to him. So, you know, I would certainly support more than one
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.160]  provider. All right. Let's go back to the phones now for the governor. We're going to talk about
[56:14.160 --> 56:21.840]  governor Mike. So it's he's openly up here promoting pure evil, organ harvesting, keeping babies alive.
[56:24.800 --> 56:28.000]  But don't worry. Super relax. We'll just make a joke about it. You know, some new music video
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.720]  making fun of me. So I'm just going to say this right now. If you want to keep us on the air,
[56:34.720 --> 56:39.600]  to stand up for the unborn and to stand up for everybody's rights and to defeat the globalist,

[59:49.280 --> 59:55.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:29.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:43.920]  Virginia's Democrat governor, Mr. Northam, is trying to sign a law, a bill similar to the one
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.720]  that passed New York, that allows them to keep babies alive after they're born so they can harvest
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.640]  their organs. That's really what's going on here and we've laid out all the proof in the last few
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.480]  segments. It really is totally out of control, completely evil, and he started out defending
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.880]  Democrats introducing the bill so they can kill babies up at the time they're born,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.800]  even if they're coming out of their mother. He said, oh no, we humanely keep the little
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:18.000]  buggers alive before we suck all their goodies out. So this is the most nightmare satanic evil
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.400]  hidden in plain view in front of everybody and so that's your rest of the story. It's not just
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.640]  post birth abortion legal in New York about to be in Virginia.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:36.800]  It's why are they doing it and it's for organ harvesting on record. Think about that, America.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.800]  We won't stand up against that. What will we stand up against? I mean, it's hard in the news that all
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.960]  the major iPhones and droids are watching and listening to you that Samsung TVs are doing the
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.840]  same thing and now there's new quote security holes in the iCloud. Let anyone get into your stuff.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:58.400]  It's designed by a criminal class to rape and abuse you and they get rid of all defenses,
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:05.680]  all privacy, where everything is open for the globalist to feed on you. So stand up, reclaim
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.800]  your instincts, your common sense, your life force and ask Jesus Christ in your heart and stand
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.520]  against these devils and realize info war is under attack because we carry the light
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.560]  in the dark of the night to resist these people. All right, you know I'm sick of Russian game
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.960]  because it's such a fraud and there's been no charges for any real collusion with Russians.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.120]  It's made up. It's a smoke screen for Mueller and Hillary and all them on the Russian payroll.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:37.200]  But Roger Stone has tried to have two press conferences when he was
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.040]  released in Florida that when he was arraigned this week in DC
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:50.240]  and they've shot him down. He's been unable to speak both times. So he's got the JW Marriott in
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.040]  DC and Owen Schroyer's there. We're going to have that live feed coming up in the next segment.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.480]  There's a lot of media already there. We'll see if we rent it a hall and have our own security and
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.320]  their security if it can even happen in America. The live feed is Watch Live. Roger Stone holds
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.160]  major press conference in DC. I will not be silenced, he says. Very important what they're
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.600]  about to break down on so many fronts and he hasn't been able to speak yet at a press conference.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.760]  So we'll see if it happens. This is the live radio slash TV feed. We'll have breaks. We'll
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.240]  have it all. But as soon as they go live at about 10 after they think this one about seven
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:32.000]  minutes, we'll post a live feed box commercial free. So if you want to watch it without Alex Jones
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.240]  commentary or ads or if Drudge wants to link to it or whoever wants to, that'll be up that link live.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.760]  And then we'll also have our feed as well. You know, I thought we had a lot of feeds last week
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.800]  or I guess earlier this week. This was last Friday now when Stone came out of the courthouse in
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:04:02.320]  Florida. We had 5,000 people a second IP addresses hitting the servers. We have some of the biggest
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:10.080]  companies in the country. 5,000 a second. It was 2 million coming in every couple minutes and it
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:16.400]  actually crashed the servers for about an hour. So he was unable to have that press conference
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.800]  out there, but he talked for 20 minutes with us beforehand. But that crashed. So if Drudge
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.920]  does link to us, I don't know what will happen this time. But that was a big story because the
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.200]  whole press was waiting. They wanted to hear from Stone. They gave us exclusive first,
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.840]  but he never got in his press conferences. So we'll see what happens here in like five minutes now
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.480]  with these live feeds at infowars.com and newswars.com. Hell, the leftist may just go into the
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.480]  feeds we've got on Twitter and Facebook and kill those, you know, because we're not allowed to,
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.160]  when you get indicted to have a say, you know, don't say, hey, learn to code either. Twitter
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.760]  will ban you for that as well. You do what Silicon Valley says when they say it, or we'll throw yourself
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:04.720]  an electronic gulag. When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key. While coffee,
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.440]  candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:15.760]  than ever. Turbo force from info wars life is a powerful mix in energy packet that utilizes vitamins,
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.520]  amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity and a boost
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:29.680]  of energy on the go. Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.960]  with 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply. This is the formula to stock up on whenever
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:44.800]  you need a boost. Perfect for work in the car or at home. Turbo force is the ultimate answer to a
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:06:10.800]  sluggish day. Don't let your day slow you down. Her cup with turbo force at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:20.800]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go live to Washington, D.C. and the J.W. Marriott.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.560]  We're Owen Shroyer and Roger Stone are attempting to give a live press conference. The last two press
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.520]  conferences on the streets of Florida and on the streets of D.C. have been shut down by Antifa
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.600]  and left us anti-free speech folks. One of the silence people they're trying to put in prison
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.000]  and not just take their personal physical freedom away but also take their speech away. So let's go
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.200]  to Owen Shroyer preparing to introduce Roger Stone right now. Numerous media inquiries and it's almost
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:11.280]  been impossible for us to sleep through this endeavor. Now anybody who saw the FBI raid on
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:19.520]  Roger Stone's house knows that it was clear to me beyond a reasonable doubt that somehow CNN got
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:27.920]  a leak and now you have congressmen calling for an investigation into that. You've also seen a lot
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:34.400]  of violence against Trump supporters and a lot of threats, as I said, against Roger Stone. So now
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:40.000]  we have to walk around with increased security. In fact, there are a lot of people doubting a story
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.200]  that I was sexually harassed in Washington, D.C. by a woman's March protester marching against
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.000]  sexual harassment, sexually harassed me. People are doubting that story saying it's fake news.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.400]  Well, I'm going to go ahead and give out this individual's name and I'm begging unlike people
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.280]  on the left, unlike what you did to the Covington Catholic high school boys and unlike what you've
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:06.800]  done to Roger Stone, I hope that you would not dox this woman and you would leave her alone.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:16.800]  But Isabel O'Shaughnessy was arrested for sexually assaulting me. Okay. Also yesterday I had a man
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:23.200]  try to rub spit in my eye and this is all thanks to the lies in the mainstream media and now they're
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:31.600]  trying to destroy an innocent man, Roger Stone. And I am just I'm just in a disbelief at how Roger
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.520]  has been able to keep his composure and maintain his energy throughout all of this. Now I hope
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:44.240]  that he gets fair treatment here today, unlike what he has received this entire week and unlike
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:52.880]  what he has received since this political witch hunt has began against him. Now again, all of you
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:59.440]  came out here for one reason. You want the Roger Stone story. But how many of you actually care
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:05.680]  about an innocent man getting out of the grips of a rogue prosecutor? I'm wondering if any of you
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.560]  do. You were more obsessed with getting your shot than getting the truth out about Roger Stone
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.120]  at a press conference that you didn't pay a dime to be at and you're begging for Roger to give you
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:22.240]  any quote all day long. So I just ask you, do you care that an innocent man is being politically
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.200]  persecuted right now? Or do you just care about your own ratings? Is that why you lie about
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.000]  President Trump? Is that why you lie about Trump supporters? Is that why you lie about Roger Stone?
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.800]  So Roger is going to step up here and he is going to provide an opening statement and then we are
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.760]  going to take questions. But I know that some of you had to reach out to your corporate overlords
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.720]  and ask if you're even going to be allowed to air this press conference because there's an info
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:57.280]  wars mic flag sitting on the podium. Well I hope that triggers you and I hope that you realize
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:03.520]  that in media you should be standing up for free speech and in America you should be standing up
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.720]  for justice not a political persecution against an innocent man where they're trying to destroy
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:15.280]  his life and he has to deal with death threats every day. So without further ado here is Roger Stone.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:27.520]  Thank you Owen. First of all as a veteran of 50 years in American politics I understand that
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:33.760]  you cannot brand every member of the media with the same brush and therefore there are honest
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.880]  reporters in this room there are capable honest reporters in this room who are just trying to
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.880]  do their job and get there the facts and there are others who do not meet that criteria. So
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:52.800]  let's be clear I do not regard the press or the media as the enemy I regard some members
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:11:00.000]  of the press and the media as the enemy. That said I wanted the opportunity to make a statement
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.840]  outside the courthouse the other day that was obviously physically impossible given the pushing
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.760]  the shoving the shouting the spitting I felt kind of like Vice President Richard Nixon in
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:22.800]  Caracas in 1958. I want to say to begin with that as I think most of you know I have pled
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:29.920]  not guilty to the charges against me I stress that these are all after the fact process crimes
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:37.120]  and I am not accused of a rushing collusion I'm not accused of collaboration with WikiLeaks I am
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:43.520]  not accused of conspiracy there is no evidence or accusation that I knew in advance about the
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:50.640]  source or content of the WikiLeaks materials be that allegedly hacked material or allegedly stolen
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:57.120]  material. The allegation that I was less than truthful to the House Intelligence Committee
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:04.160]  to cover up what underlying crime there is no underlying crime and therefore any honest mistake
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:14.160]  I made in memory would be both immaterial and lacking intent I do intend to vigorously contest
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:25.040]  these charges I will mount as vigorous offense a defense as I can I am heartened that Senator Graham
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:31.440]  and also some Republican members of the House are looking into the manner in which I was arrested
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:42.720]  I think as most of you know at 5 50 a.m. 29 federal agents FBI agents both men and women
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:51.680]  arrived in my home wearing full SWAT gear night vision goggles brandishing assault weapons
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:58.960]  sidearms in some and they had a device that is generally used for battering down a door
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:06.240]  when somebody refuses to open it there were 17 vehicles in the front yard
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.560]  two of them armored there was a helicopter overhead I live on a canal there were two
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:19.920]  amphibious units in the water my house was completely surrounded by armed agents covering
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:31.040]  every exit I have no prior criminal record I'm accused of nonviolent process crimes I do not
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.480]  own a gun there was no guns in the house I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment but I
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:47.600]  do not own a firearm I do not own a valid passport with the caveat that it may have expired within
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:56.640]  the last three days I don't know because it was seized by the FBI I was not read my Miranda rights
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.320]  I was brought out of the house I was handcuffed I was standing in the street wearing a
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:12.000]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt just what I slept in you can get those at 1776.shop
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:21.280]  the proceeds go to my legal defense fund wearing a pair of cut-off sweatpants no shoes my wife
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:27.920]  who is hearing impaired was aroused in from the house she was made to stand next to me
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:36.880]  wearing a nightgown and barefooted the the agents were professional and they were courteous
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.560]  once I was in custody okay let's stop right there about their listeners have all heard this before
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.880]  because this is the place he doesn't get censored but when we come back he'll still be speaking but
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.720]  he's going to go to questions and I'm told there's like 50 news cameras there by Owen and others we
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.480]  may get him to turn our live feed camera around so you can see that so he's getting his first
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:02.400]  amendment that he's been denied so far we've got the corporate press calling for him to be gagged
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.560]  this judge that seems to handle all the Mueller cases all the Mueller cases has gagged people in
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.080]  the past so we'll see what happens on Friday when he is before her but we come back we'll
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.280]  have more of Roger and then the press conference itself when they go to those questions we're doing
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.760]  this again so that they cannot shut down free speech so we can actually be heard and you heard
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.080]  Roger talking about his defense and he's got his criminal thing that can cost two million dollars
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:35.360]  and that's great we support Roger any work series paid we can't allow that to overshadow the fact

[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.480]  welcome back i'm alex jones this is the syndicated radio slash tv program
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.120]  i'm dreaded by the globalist dreaded by the communist by radical islam
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:33.120]  by the pet of followings by hollywood and elin shroyer and roger stoner having a press conference
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.920]  because they shut down his last two in florida n dc when he got released from jail and when he got
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:45.600]  arraigned uh tuesday uh and so we're covering all of that right now uh again why is this broadcast
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:52.400]  so vital no one's going to point out their passing laws written by big pharma to be able to harvest
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.840]  organs of children that's why they want to keep babies alive after they're born because that's
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.920]  where they're weak in these partial birth abortion suits is because they've been caught doing it
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:06.400]  that's why we're valuable that's why info wars is important that's the type of stuff we break
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:11.680]  now roger stone just went to questions my question is what does trump need to do to stand up against
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.560]  this talk about all that but let's see what rogers he just went to questions let's go to roger stone
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:29.440]  live in the seat but the witness also intimidated me the witness first of all perjured himself
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:36.480]  before the grand jury about being the source of the content in the october release date of the
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:43.600]  wiki leaks material when i released over 30 pages of text messages proving that very very few media
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.760]  outlets reported that they all reported his denials msnbc reported them almost in a serial
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:57.760]  nature but nobody reported virtually nobody reported uh my uh production of proof uh
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.640]  secondarily uh the same man threatened to put a bullet in the head of one of the other
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.800]  exculpatory witnesses before mr muller's probe that was reported by the daily caller additionally
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:16.000]  he threatened to have a woman falsely accused me of sexual assault so he hasn't been uh he
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.040]  hasn't been indicted for perjury he hasn't been indicted for witnessing intimidation or witness
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:27.200]  tampering but i'm a randy credit card i also would suggest that any attorney uh who makes
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:34.480]  pronunciations about this indictment without reading all four and a half hours of my testimony
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:42.880]  to see the questions in context uh or to see the emails and text messages surrounding those that
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:48.240]  are highlighted by the government doesn't really understand the situation and it would be irresponsible
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:57.200]  to draw conclusions i'm represented by bruce rogall uh grant smith uh robert buchel and tarot
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:03.280]  campion they are excellent excellent attorneys mr rogall has argued before the u.s supreme court
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:10.320]  on 11 occasions he is a noted first amendment civil and criminal attorney he believes that this
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:17.120]  indictment is flawed roger roger you said you won't bear false witness against the president
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:23.280]  i think it's that means that you are ruling out cooperating with robert muller uh this is a question
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.320]  that i will have to refer to my lawyers ultimately all i can tell you today is i will tell the truth
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:35.440]  about any matter that i have knowledge of i don't possess any uh knowledge of any wrong
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.880]  doing by the president of the united states including russian collusion so when i first said
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.640]  i won't testify against the president uh some of you said hi you see it's a cover up that's not
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:52.080]  what i'm saying what i'm saying is i will not make up stories i will not bear false witness i will
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:57.200]  not say things that are not true i will tell the truth i can't say like juliani said that nobody
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.880]  ever did i have not i have not has been found though special counsel's latest filing it says
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.800]  the evidence evidence against you is voluminous and complex does that scare you at all my attorneys
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:15.680]  have agreed to that um it is so voluminous and complex that a speedy trial is literally impossible
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.240]  so we stipulated to that in in the hearing before the magistrate um and both parties agreed to that
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.360]  do you think the hack of the dnc was a good thing for america i think the hack of the dnc is an
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:33.040]  accusation that is unproven in any court of law in the united states it is a it is an assertion
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:40.400]  but there is substantial forensic evidence that may never have been hacked at all so i understand
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.480]  the credibility of those making that charge but it is on a temporary stick what do you think it's
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:52.080]  about at least you know this new media so the basis of the premise pro for russia pro what the
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:58.320]  don's here says is that don trump colluded russia to hack the dnc server that's never been fooled by
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.960]  the fbi or anyone else i thought of brazil said that the dnc destroyed the server hired a product of
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:11.120]  cyber security for cram it sounds like a standard fairbanks uh uh replicated what was on the server
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.320]  and that's the basis of the pope do you think that the act of attorney general should be looking into
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.840]  why the dnc destroyed its server which is like i said the basis of this whole russia investigation
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:27.840]  well we don't know whether they have destroyed their server we do know i'm being sued by the
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:34.400]  democratic national committee and my attorneys in that action have sent a spoilation letter
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:40.080]  demanding that the server be maintained and preserved so that it can be inspected and we can
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.080]  get to the bottom of the question as to whether the dnc was ever hacked at all by anyone maybe you
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:51.920]  should be standing in your hat kill people yes
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.720]  any number of defense attorneys who caution their clients against speaking in a situation like this
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:03.360]  by the time your trial uh happens months perhaps even years from now circumstances will have changed
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.520]  you may uh come to regret some things that you're now saying you may come to regret some of the
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.000]  associations such as info work which you now have what kind of advice are you getting your
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.560]  attorneys about this why are you speaking like this well first of all if you've read my bookstones
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:23.760]  rules which i highly commend i believe that in the current atmosphere when one is accused of
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:30.480]  wrongdoing and one has no response either is not available or doesn't comment there's a presumption
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.560]  of guilt that perhaps is unfair but very real i know what i did i know what i didn't do i know
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.560]  the facts of the case i don't think i said anything today that i will regret um and it will be
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.680]  obviously said with greater documentation in court in due time as far as info wars is concerned it's a
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:55.120]  media outlet it's a network i don't subscribe to everything alex jones says alex jones doesn't
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:00.160]  subscribe to everything that i said i'm probably a bit more libertarian than he is we have many
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.920]  talented people there but it is a perfectly reputable platform i'm responsible for the things
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:12.000]  that i say i agree with alex jones on a number of things i'm a nationalist he's a nationalist
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.440]  we believe in american sovereignty we believe in american exceptionalism i'm grateful to them for
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.960]  hosting this because otherwise i'd have no reasonable forum in which i can answer your
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:30.400]  questions my cell phone my cell phone is the only electronic vice that i still have
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:37.360]  which was restored to me by the fb i i'm 400 messages behind from reporters wanting to ask
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.400]  me questions so this was the most efficient way to do so roger if you take yourself out of the
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.920]  equation uh and you just look at broad scope of this i can explain the fact that man for flin
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.520]  koan popped out this case all of them found guilty of lying and all about one issue which is russian
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:00.400]  uh i'm not sure i agree with that with that formulation uh they they were accused of that
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:05.440]  i'm not any of them i can only speak none of them in the case and i am not guilty
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.920]  roger are you ready tomorrow for judge jackson if you do again
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.640]  that's certainly a possibility um we'll deal with that when it comes i would point out that i make a
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.960]  living writing and speaking about politics i would hope that the court would take that into
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.880]  consideration obviously um the government has not made a motion for that as of today
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.080]  that we're aware of it would require we're going to break as i understand it obviously i will
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.760]  read report dot com is linked to us right in the middle column and we've got live feeds there that

[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:36.560]  now i had the idea of them to have a press conference at the trump hotel and i'll give you
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.920]  inside baseball trump hotel we stay with each other it's a nice hotel vote at the best in dc
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:47.440]  but trump advisor the managers there say we don't want you here by the way i've been
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.160]  there at trump hotel with cnn's on both tv channels the bar something's going on with this this is
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:58.400]  people and so i'm telling them keep the press conference going bring up what trump needs to do
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.560]  to challenge the deep state the war on the press and how the clinton's and and moeller and others
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.400]  are connected to russia gate state all those points at the press conference and state the
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.520]  questions because we can't hear them but during the break i'm talking to oh and we'll see if
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:16.240]  he gets the message to roger let's go to them live right now with the censored press conference
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:21.760]  threes the charm thanks to drudgerport.com linking to it here it is and the illicit
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:28.880]  infiltration of his campaign by the fbi he should direct his attorney general either the acting
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.320]  attorney general or his new attorney general to do that he has that authority i also think he should
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.720]  declassify the documents surrounding the fiso warrants and find out whether there are additional
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:48.480]  fiso warrants as i believe they are and it is well known that mr rozenstein was the u.s attorney
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:56.240]  who was aware of bribes by the russian energy company but approved the uranium one deal anyway
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:03.440]  and mr moeller was the man who took the uranium samples to stockholm for inspection by the russians
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.560]  as a condition of closing the deal i think these are legitimate issues that should be
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.480]  investigated by the justice department what should the president do about the war on the media
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:20.720]  well the the in my opinion he should direct the um justice department to enact antitrust
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:26.720]  action to stop the racketeering of the big tech companies that would censor some of us but not
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:33.600]  others uh when i see jerry nadler sit in the google hearing before the house judiciary committee and
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:40.480]  say censorship of conservatives by google is a is a conspiracy theory that's not true we have
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:46.720]  internal memos we have internal videos from google we have we have extensive proof that that is a
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:53.280]  willful strategy by those companies to believe that everybody banned info wars on the same day
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:59.840]  but they never spoke to each other which would be collusion is uh is just not credible i think
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:07.200]  mr cook who should be under oath i saw mr pie under oath uh he purged himself again and again
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  and again china where's china i don't even know where i could even find china on a map
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.680]  we're not doing business in china that's a lie or the google app does not allow you to track the
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:23.680]  whereabouts of a person that's a lie as well there were numerous lies told that day but he
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:35.360]  has not been indicted for being less than truthful no decisions been made on that that would be wildly
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.920]  premature the question you could address to my lawyers but i don't think they could answer it at
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:52.000]  this time well it's technically true i left the campaign in august of 2015 because i believed i could
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.680]  be a more effective advocate for his election uh operating on my own and i did so i wrote the
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.640]  clinton's war on women which i think is the definitive work on the entire public record of
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:09.680]  bill and avery clinton uh i i commend it to you if you haven't read it um but no i i don't i don't
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.880]  take any reading of that whatsoever is there any change in your relationship with him over
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.600]  a period of months well i think you have to recognize that based on the advice of both his
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.680]  lawyers and my lawyers we have not spoken in in some time but i have great affection for the
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:33.040]  president and his family he attended my wedding right in the willard hotel next door i attended
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:38.960]  his wedding to malania also his wedding to marla maples i've known malania the first lady of
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:46.240]  the united states since 1999 she's a wonderful person i'm a strong supporter of his agenda i've
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:52.640]  also been critical uh i think we should be out of syria now i think we should be out of afghanistan
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.640]  now i think we should be out of iraq now he's he ran as a non-interventionist i believe he
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:04.400]  actually agrees with me and i hope that he is moving towards that but his record on the economy
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:10.160]  i think is extraordinary things that we were told could not happen have happened 500 000 new
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:16.560]  manufacturing jobs 4.8 million new jobs a record stock market even with the some of the corrections
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:22.960]  so america is on its way back i have great affection and i remain a strong and loyal
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.560]  supporter of the president you think he does for you as well because he had a good relationship
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.960]  with michael come in at one point and then when the legal things got confiscated i think my situation
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.640]  is quite different do you think that a jewelry clinton should be indicted anybody who has not
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:44.160]  asked a question from the media yes sir i would say generally speaking yes
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.880]  i think a process crime has to have intent and materiality and let's see if that happens and
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.160]  on the other crimes let's see if they're even actually true
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:22.400]  yes i have no idea because it's not true nobody directed me to do anything nor inquired i did
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.160]  not coordinate anything with the trump campaign or with wiki leaks in terms of their disclosures
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.600]  i had a tip which turned out to be a very good one about the significance and the october timing
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.760]  of the wiki leaks disclosures everything else could be gleaned by setting a google news alert
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:45.040]  and reading everything about wiki leaks and julie nissange or watching their their uh
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:52.880]  the wiki leaks twitter feed when i was not banned on twitter and therefore my purpose
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:59.680]  was to hype the disclosures to draw voter and media attention to the ultimate
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.960]  release of material that's called politics that's what i do it hasn't been criminalized in this
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:16.320]  country at least not yet any more questions from the media yes in that filing today from the
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:23.200]  police with the volume this amount of evidence they have to go through it mentions terabytes of
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.080]  data that they've collected what do you think they're hoping to find in terabytes
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.880]  i could i could i could not speculate i believe that and i've said this before i believe that
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:41.120]  that over a two-year period maybe even a two and a half year period my emails my text messages my
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:46.880]  phone calls have been monitored they're certain all right folks this is live coverage of the roger stone
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.840]  i will not be silenced press conference in dc we're going to go to break come back i know he's
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.400]  got some final statements and showed us oh and i'm very thankful for drudgerport.com for helping

[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.520]  feeds this live radio slash tv feed that's happening right now and then the live feed they've got
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.600]  that's commercial free so if you don't want to hear me talking or the breaks that radio and tv

[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:30.560]  it commercial free but bottom line know this i told people and i'm not at liberty to get into it
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:35.840]  and i don't know my lawyers are right man i tell you they've i've had Mueller try to set me up with
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:42.640]  the russians like out of a movie and then they leaked it and then even though i caught them and
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.760]  got them red-handed when it happened and then they did it again and then they did it again
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:57.360]  and it's just like at a certain point i've given it to folks at fox i've given it to other people
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.480]  they've got it all and it's just like they know i'm not involved with russians or anybody else i'm
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.400]  a flaming americana guy who nobody can buy off everybody knows that and then they try to target
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.800]  my dad with the fact that course he worked here claiming that hiring him was a payoff
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.320]  is it just fundamentally makes me sick now everything roger told me was true
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.800]  about not working with wiki leaks and all that i don't like the credit code back and forth crap
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.280]  if you want to be honest the only place there's something is there but then it's on record credit
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:36.160]  code was threatening him back just as bad it's i guess something they do in new york here in
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.760]  texas he threatened to kill somebody you try to do it you know uh but just whatever we're gonna

[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:12.080]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:18.640]  viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.560]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:28.240]  it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:34.080]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured

[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.080]  friday in florida they shut the press conference down his arraignment in on tuesday they're talking
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.880]  about the judge gagging him she's already gagged a bunch of other people she told people they couldn't
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:28.720]  fundraise to defend themselves it's the same judge magically out of 30 plus judges in dc the
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:35.040]  computer just keeps picking her the same person winning the lottery three times in a row uh so
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.720]  all of this garbage all of this insanity uh just uh continues you know this politico
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:47.280]  roder stone faces a gag order he has a plan to resist it so just incredible ladies and gentlemen
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:53.680]  um as we're trying to get the feed reconnected and and and and find out what's going on uh
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.800]  with whatever just happened pulse of disruptors showed up or something's happening the feed cut
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:02.400]  so again i'm on the edge of my seat right now we're going to find out as soon as we know
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:07.840]  uh at info wars dot com four slash show and that link on drudgerport.com um let me just try to
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.200]  midair refueling because i got truth bombs i want to drop in the globalist forever but
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.040]  if we don't get the funding and i'm not complaining at the listeners of viewers thank you for your
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.480]  support you're incredible but you don't understand starting like three years ago they took all our
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:28.800]  internet sponsors then they wouldn't let us advertise on the google platform then they took
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:35.840]  away all the online advertisers we had on info wars they took away the disgust commenting section
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.960]  so we wouldn't have thousands of comments per article even though they were making money on that
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.400]  with their own ads then they took away our paypal then they took away three of my other banks and
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:48.640]  got us down to one bank now we've got some backups now i'm not complaining this is what happened
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:56.320]  and then you know they financed and ran all these lawsuits against us and we we we got 16 thrown out
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:01.200]  and had four more to deal with so they filed five more here's the thing i'm not giving up because
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:07.280]  i know we've got truth and justice on our side but it takes money to wage this war i saw an
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.720]  article last week with new york times we covered it here where buzz feed that doesn't even have
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:19.680]  as big a fingerprint and footprint as we do in the media world makes 300 million a year but has to
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:26.960]  get 100 plus million extra money from the democrats and sorrows to stay afloat and then i talk about
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:34.320]  our real numbers are bringing in 40 million a year or so gross but most of its product sales so an air
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:43.440]  filter we might make 40 bucks on a water filter at full price we might make 80 bucks on usually
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:51.520]  stuffs discounted and so that's the problem out of a million dollars of sales we might get 200
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:57.440]  300 000 in here to fund things so i'm not funding stuff with 40 million i'm funding stuff with 10
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:04.000]  million and 10 million dollars for what info wars is doing is unprecedented that's what scares the
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.360]  living hell out of these people is it sounds like a lot of money if you're just an average person
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.240]  working in a paper mill i get it but when you've got a hundred plus employees and crew you're on
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:20.800]  our old show here old operation our own janitors our own legal our own accounting our own researchers
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:28.240]  camera people producers everything writers about a hundred people and when you're dealing with that
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.640]  and then breathe them down your neck i mean we've learned to improvise a lot because they've taken
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:37.760]  everything away from us and i'm not a victim i'm a target like tommy robinson says but they've
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:43.200]  cut us back to this position like a armored fort like like the alamo and you know i'm gonna make
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.920]  a good case for liberty no matter what happens does i'm not gonna cry if we get overrun and taken
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:51.840]  down i'm gonna keep swinging till the end because i believe a good example is what it's all about
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:52:03.360]  but i'd really rather continue on and be victorious and not give the enemy a victory but the enemy's
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:06.560]  biggest victory is that i don't like to promote things and sell things even though they're great
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:15.840]  products i like to stay focused on news uh and information and so here's the deal i talk about
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:23.120]  the products i think are the best even though they're not our best sellers the the the
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:31.360]  products that we have are the very best i mean take fish oil what it does for your heart your
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.800]  brain energy i don't even usually take a new tropic if i'm up at 10 o'clock at night and
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:43.280]  i got to work till 3 a.m on coast to coast a.m or some show i pop five fish oils nobody calls
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:48.720]  fish oil a new tropic your brain is electrochemical it's basically made out of what fish oil is
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:55.600]  so i like to say brain force which is a clean high-quality new tropic we went to the top producer
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:59.760]  and said make it even stronger than the best brand in the country and sell it for half the price
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.880]  because most folks just do nothing but advertising they put nothing in the pill
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.080]  so great brain force is great a lot of folks are addicted to it and they think it's wonderful and
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:16.080]  it is the best fish oil is what floats my boat i mean i take it every morning right now first
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:23.680]  thing i get up at 6 a.m with my coffee i bang back three big old fat juicy fish oils uh and so our
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:28.960]  ultimate krill oil is even better than fish oil what does for your brain but there's no way
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:32.640]  to denature it it gives you the burp so i'm not gonna lie to you but if you can deal with it it's
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.960]  it's yet the ultimate krill oil is rocket fuel baby i mean it's the next level ultimate fish oil
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:44.000]  while crafted out of the fjords amazing doesn't give you the burpees neither does honor roll it's
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.960]  amazing for your kids small caplets but i tend to like honor roll i got okay i'm a fish oil addict
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:54.640]  let's just i'm not gonna lie i gobble the stuff uh coffee is the thing of the past now brain
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.600]  forces thing of the past and for different people different things i'm just telling you fish oil is
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:09.120]  number one until i was talking to the guys two years ago and i said what's the number one best
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.680]  selling thing in supplements what is jeff bezos his number one selling thing in whole foods
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.240]  and an amazon that he owns give those own publications attack me for selling the same
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.360]  thing he sells and the answer was it's energy drinks i said look at all these dyes well that's
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.400]  what triggers it sir you know obviously the toxic chemicals it's a drug dyes are really drugs we're
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.280]  not going to do that what if we put out the strongest natural thing with all the herbs
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:38.720]  that are wildcrafted turbo charge the brain that are slow release so instead of five hours 10 hours
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.800]  with all the vitamins and minerals folks are already missing with the amino acids for total
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:49.760]  upload and the scientist said you're absolutely right turbo voice so let me explain something
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.720]  just like our information is game changing and no one else has it and it's obnoxious and explosive
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:02.000]  and like everything that old joke is everything was more guilty more wild more strong more
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.960]  out of control in the south this is the chicken fried steak of gravy of steaks ladies and gentlemen
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:12.880]  but it's healthy and it's good this is what happens when somebody runs a company that says
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:19.040]  i believe people really want what the best is available so that a lot of the price is actually
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:23.840]  the product and not the marketing instead you get me up here telling you how great it is set
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:28.800]  us a million dollar ad with a bunch of hot chicks in vegas dancing around i don't think you want
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:33.680]  hot chicks in vegas dancing around to sell you the product you might want that in real life
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:39.760]  what you want is to actually be straight shot i want you to be annihilated by how good it is
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:47.680]  i want you to go holy mackerel jones is awesome god he never scares us wrong exactly see that's
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:55.200]  that's my sales tactic is what's the best damn thing i ever had let me promote that that's turbo

[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.240]  take brain force it's mainly a new tropic so i'm already a little wired a little fast so
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.520]  like i said i've ever had a problem with hard drugs a few times i took it up i was gonna die
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:17.680]  i took methamphetamine twice cocaine twice thought i was dying both times because i'm
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.480]  i'm like on methamphetamine already all the time i mean that's how i am just i don't need it but i'm
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:27.520]  telling you this is all natural this is healthy this is what god gave us not what the meth dealers
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:36.800]  give you it is turbo force turbo force turbo force turbo force and i believe it is the ultimate

[01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:16.080]  jones show live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones 50 000 watts anthrax
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:27.200]  and radio
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.760]  we're about to have another exclusive statement from the press conference of roger stone
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.720]  linked on drudgerport.com and let's go to this report real quick apple's lawless invasion of
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:51.280]  privacy because new stuff just broke well this is what hubris looks like apple head honcho tim
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:57.280]  cook recently tweeted we must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in on this hashtag
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:05.280]  data privacy day let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections the dangers
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:12.480]  are real and the consequences are too important they're real all right thanks to tim cook and apple
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:18.640]  tim cook's ridiculous tweet unraveled as a 14 year old discovered a spy glitch on apple's
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:26.320]  facetime app as the apple insider reported reports of a massive facetime flaw surfaced on twitter
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:32.720]  present and current versions of ios the bug enables a facetime caller to eavesdrop on a
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:39.440]  recipient device's audio even if that person does not answer camera access is also granted if the
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:45.600]  recipient interacts with hardware buttons on their iphone for example pressing the power button to
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:51.680]  decline the call perhaps most troubling was the relative ease at which the bug is exploited

[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:53.120]  what you think the president should do about the democrat ties to russia the democrat ties to the
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.640]  muller probe and how urgent this situation is if he doesn't act soon they're going to come for him
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.960]  there's no question about that i was asked that question this is indeed a speeding bullet
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:08.480]  heading for the president's head uh he must declassify the fice of warrants they lead right
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:15.520]  to barack hussein obama himself peter stroke gave us the hint in his text messages obama wants to
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:22.080]  know everything it is inconceivable that susan rice and david rhodes and john brennan
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:28.960]  and james clapper uh and uh all these people and eric holder acted without the approval
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:35.200]  a direction of the president united states not believable so he needs to declassify that information
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.440]  and look into whether there were other fice of warrants something we a question that's never
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:45.760]  been answered number two appoint a special counsel to investigate uranium one the largest
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:52.800]  treasonous crime in american history absolute treason to sell out 20 percent of our enriched

[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:14.080]  sent in to compromise george poppidopoulos carter page roger stone and michael caputo
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:20.800]  but i think those things would get him off of defense and on to offense uh when will hillary

[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:58.160]  worshipers they're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb i want life i want jesus
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:06.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:09.280]  you
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:24.880]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones this just is
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:33.440]  jury awards senator ran paul $580,000 to be paid by leftist neighbors who assaulted him
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:40.160]  paul probably spent that much money going after this guy i'd rather not get six broken ribs in a
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:48.080]  punctured lung than $580,000 robert barnes constitutional lawyer patriot representing
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:51.760]  some of the covington kids there's been a lot about demonize you've been here watching this
[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:57.200]  live press conference what rogers telling everybody's covering all the weirdness going on you know
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:01.600]  a lot of the players involved you know kassandra fairbanks reporter is being demonized what do
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:05.920]  you think's really going on so i think there's a collective effort by moeller's team to silence
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:10.640]  and shut roger up and i think the way in which it will be approached is they'll try to use someone
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:16.160]  like drome coursey with mr. claimant try to claim that mr. stone is somehow interfering or trying
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:20.960]  to obstruct or coordinate or course his testimony in a particular manner which would not be accurate
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:27.200]  just based to try to gag roger stone and to try to set up any ancillary charges because the behavior
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:31.520]  of mr. claimant and the behavior of mr. course you've been highly peculiar because while they
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:35.760]  claim to have sued mr. moeller and claimed to be exposing mr. moeller yesterday they're out
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:40.560]  there threatening kassandra fairbanks that they're going to sick moeller on her so there's some clear
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:45.600]  inconsistency some clear contradiction in their behavior they appear to be acting at the behest
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:50.400]  and at the behalf of mr. moeller not meaningfully challenging him not meaningfully contesting him
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:55.600]  not on the opposite side of him but in his bed so what does roger do course he doesn't matter
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:22:00.480]  down anyway just leave course you alone exactly he he has to continue to defend himself publicly
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:04.720]  and have his lawyers and other advocates defend himself publicly but make sure that nothing he
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:09.920]  says can be misinterpreted or misconstrued i've litigated this in other contexts i had a case
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:14.960]  where the government informant was the cfo of a company and it was falsifying testimony against
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.840]  my client so i sued the individual to expose him the department of justice threatened me threatened
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:24.240]  my law firm threatened other people said that's my client's constitutional rights and they backed
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:30.880]  down so he has to assert his constitutional rights but be intelligent about how he goes about it what
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:36.720]  would you call this period not just america but the world's in right now it's really a time period
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:41.120]  where either we're going to be democratically run or we're going to be a deep state run it's one of
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:46.160]  the other that's the nature of chaser d exactly where either ordinary people are going to get to
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:50.320]  run their own government determine their own society create their own justice or we're going to be
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:55.600]  subject to a small elite group that runs at the whole show so it's a global corporate takeover
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:59.600]  absolutely and are the people going to put up with us correct is is our government going to
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:03.600]  become the chinese government are we going to mimic chinese society where we have a small group of
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:08.400]  people who run everything control how we think control the media control operations control the
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:13.520]  economy control society or are we going to be what our ancestors set up with my great great
[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:18.480]  grandfather who settled rhod island helped set up which was a democratic vision a democratic dream
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:22.320]  where ordinary people could control and govern their own lives their own thoughts their own economy
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:26.880]  isn't that western europe because it is true like a thousand years ago we were cave dollars
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:32.240]  isn't our big innovation that we actually wanted to have local rule absolutely it was the the rule
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:36.480]  that is the closest to the person is the rule that is the most democratic in origin and ultimately
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:41.920]  is the most humanitarian in respect it's very hard to hate somebody when you're governed at the local
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:47.040]  level hatred and divisiveness come about when we have power concentrated in an elite group that
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:51.200]  needs people fighting each other so the elite group can maintain and control its monopoly you
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:55.920]  decentralize it it it makes it about the people exactly it makes it humanitarian it makes it
[02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:59.440]  individual it makes it about celebrating the best aspects of the human existence
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:09.040]  if this was a football game a super bowl championship where's team humanity versus the
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:15.040]  globalists in their post human future really team humanities in the fourth quarter facing
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:19.360]  someone that's a better has first and goal against them i mean that's the reality the realities
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:23.600]  were on the very back you know we've we've had successes to the degree to where we can actually
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:28.000]  win the situation win the game win the sun only because our spirit senses were about to be destroyed
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.920]  precisely only because we're our backs are up against it and that's the reason why they have
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:36.160]  the opportunity to close it down forever if people like molar can be the de facto attorney
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:40.160]  general of the united states then our elected president doesn't even matter look at whittaker
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:45.600]  like shaking calling him the director it's like where these men just literally kiss they grovel
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.880]  to each other correct they're not men they're part of the sort of blacklisted a culture that is so
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:54.880]  used to being extorted so used to being blackmailed they don't know what their independence is when
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:25:00.160]  i was a little kid i always idolized medgar evers uh from uh because he was you know the person who
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:04.640]  actually shot him grew up in my hometown i knew him and so i was about those who medgar evers was
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:08.240]  absolutely medgar evers one of the greatest civil rights leaders in american history he was a man
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:12.480]  who had death threats against him all over the place uh and what he said was he said they asked
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:17.040]  him he said why aren't you afraid to die he said well most men die a thousand deaths every day
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.280]  i'm only gonna die once and as a little kid i thought that was one of the most extraordinary
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:25.520]  amazing things i wanted to be like medgar evers unfortunately a lot of the people that have
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:29.200]  political power more time on him than what ended up happening to him exactly what happened is he
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.240]  was shot in his uh in his front lawn and waiting to go into his house to meet his wife uh but he
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:40.320]  was right he did only die once his his iconic history inspired millions of people across the
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:44.160]  country to change the world and that's the reason i thought the globalists are smart
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:48.480]  they're not going to kill me until they destroyed my name and made me something else then when
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:52.400]  they're complete then i'll be killed exactly because the goal is to control the audience they want
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:56.640]  the audience to not hear you the audience to not listen to you the audience to be afraid to tune
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:01.520]  in the audience to be afraid to support the audience to be afraid to participate the audience
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:06.320]  to be part of this community part of this family part of this extended group of people challenging
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:11.040]  conventional wisdom challenging the establishment press challenging this corporate agenda that
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:14.880]  wishes to control every aspect of their human existence they don't want us giving each other
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:19.520]  aid and comfort absolutely because that's the key to resistance effective resistance is a group of
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:24.320]  people together taking collective action and inspired by that supporting one another supporting
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:29.440]  our ability to be out there to communicate to express to articulate to challenge to question
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:32.880]  those are the things that scared them those are the things that terrify them because those are the
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:37.760]  things upon which revolts and revelations are established but just join with the will of humanity
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:42.640]  because there's an evil driving force that wants to destroy ourselves there's like a kill switch
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:47.040]  built into us that we have to override it's very much a sociopathic psychopathic mentality
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:51.280]  that the people in positions of privilege and power occupy and they die remember being taught
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:55.360]  years ago by a young professor i was like you know i wanted to actually be a prosecutor coming
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.840]  out of law school because i did all my only ethical duty was to do justice and i couldn't even get an
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:03.360]  interview and i was like how is this i finished at the top of my class i'm doing much better than
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:06.880]  all these other people have done and he said they don't really want reflective people they don't
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:10.480]  want people who are independent of thought they don't want people who really have a conscience
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.640]  because in order for the system to perpetrate itself they want robots exactly that's what they
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:20.560]  need and that's why independent authoritative voices like info wars terrify them so much and
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:25.440]  they need to censor and shame and terrify the audience into not supporting not being part of
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:29.760]  it not being connected to it because that's the only way they want to associate with losing when
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:34.800]  no this is association with winning precisely the whole goal and the objective is to is to make
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:39.120]  the opposite of what is true true so that people don't recognize and realize the success that they
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:44.560]  have exactly we get Trump elected our listeners make it dirty make it bad don't let us be rewarded
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.200]  for our victories let us feel like we're failures in our victories exactly make the make them feel
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:54.320]  guilty and bad and shamed by being even associated or part of it it's part of an ongoing mind control
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:58.080]  effort to trick people into not being part of something that's actually working and succeeding
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:03.440]  and now they're really pissed because they have cut off so many avenues to reach new people but our
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:09.600]  core audience even gets it more and it's enraging them exactly it's like that it's it's having that
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:14.800]  that fortress mentality of people who are willing to fight to the barricades to the very end that
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:20.240]  that level of mindset is effective resistance because there that that is what stops the mind
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.720]  control efforts of the establishment press from being able to shape people's minds and dictate
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:28.080]  their outcomes and so with all the guests what they really fear I'm not just saying it's true

[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:00.880]  a lot of african americans they're a lot of different stuff over the years and then you pull
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:07.120]  back you look at what's currently happening and you were saying earlier that the globalists are on
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:11.680]  the verge of winning and that's why we see this big resistance that's kind of depressing i mean what
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:17.360]  would you quantify that about who the players are from your own historical research different
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:21.600]  power structures what's happening on the world today so you have someone like robert moeller
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:25.920]  who's been the deep state fixed man for the better part of two decades involved in a wide range of
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:33.440]  questionable cases bcci hsbc noriega covering up the cia's role in all of those uh continuously

[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:42.160]  we should take time on the asimov case in a minute but go ahead exactly the i mean uh we have 9-11
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:46.000]  where he not only helps get the soddies and the bin laden's family out of the country while they
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.320]  should have been under investigation but he also covers up that fbi whistleblowers and field ages
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:56.640]  how did he become the cover-up guy the really it's sort of his master he learned that and and
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:01.040]  showed his skill at it uh in the whitey bolger case in boston so he becomes he goes from the
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:05.360]  northern district california over to boston becomes chief of the criminal division while one of their
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:10.080]  key informants is whitey bolger and he's the one who helps cover up whitey bolgers involvement in a
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:16.080]  in another bank robbery and a murder were four they were using him actually as irish deep state
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:21.280]  muscle for the white shoeboys to take out italian mobs exactly when that war kind of started with
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:26.480]  the fbi and the italians because before the fbi had been under italian control so they were kind
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:31.360]  of pissed about it they were wanting to wipe them out so he was an early capo in a war who made his
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:37.280]  bones absolutely the way moeller to understand moeller moller sees hoover as a icon as a hero
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:41.920]  as someone to idolize as someone to be a part of someone to support as someone to imitate as someone
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:46.800]  to mirror someone to reflect and so he takes that same etiology just to combine it with a patrician
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:51.440]  background take the the he comes from his family comes from when new york was new amsterdam that's
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:56.480]  how old money uh moeller is so you combine that with the princeton dining clubs and you in the
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:01.040]  elite history and you combine that too with the hoover etiology and the hoover mindset you have
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:05.920]  one of the most dangerous people at key positions in the justice you got a silverspoon white knight
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.360]  is really a black knight who's god's gift to the planet exactly you have hoover but with a fancier
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:16.800]  pedigree and a nicer resume and a better outfit and that is a more you got hoover but not in the dress
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:22.480]  exactly that's correct the and are you hoover's reborn as a marine precisely and he's and he's
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.760]  got he's got the clean cut imagery he's got the princeton ivy league pedigree he's got the family
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:32.560]  history and ancestry he's the guy that everybody is scared so let's just say it he's he's he's
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:40.800]  he's not the cum dump that hoover is so so so so getting serious here though moving forward
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:44.640]  this is his cover-up job and i interrupt you in the middle of you breaking all that down
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:49.840]  so let's get into his cover-up history does a great job with the war against the italian mafia
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:53.280]  not to get rid of the italian mob but to replace it because they have a little uppity with the
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:58.480]  white shoe boys and then he just leads into the current precisely so you know when he's with bush
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:02.560]  he helped cover up he got he convinced the federal judge to not allow noriega to talk about how he
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:08.080]  was really on the cia payroll he gets the bcci which was the bank of choice you know clark cliford
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:13.520]  the former uh kennedy an attorney general was involved with bcci they were the favorite bank of
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  drug dealers terrorist money launders some of the worst criminals rogue states in the world
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:22.560]  was a cia bank exactly but that never comes out because of bob moeller and you don't have to take
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:25.840]  my word for it you can go and look up william sapphire at the new york times he was reporting
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:29.680]  about bob moeller interrupting and interfering with the new york prosecutor's attempt to document
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:35.040]  what bcci was up to so these things are out there in the open they're in court filings they're in
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:40.000]  public filings they're in the evening so he's the dirtiest of the dirty and then how they bring him
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.960]  in exactly he is an expert he is the deep state fixed man he's the guy who makes sure the cia is
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:49.440]  never implicated powerful political people are never implicated the connected parties are never
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:54.080]  are implicated that the that they find a couple of sin goats and scapegoats to sort of offer to
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:58.640]  the public and they make sure all the important people walk away clean and free and he's done it
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:03.760]  repeatedly and he's done it for more than 30 years and his involvement in u.s attorney's office and
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:09.440]  his does at the fbi includes fast and furious includes the irs t party includes hsbc which
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:14.800]  replaced and was the successor to bcci and its money laundering and drug running activities
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:20.000]  and its gang criminal support at hsbc was known as the bank of choice for the mexican drug cartels
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.880]  yet somehow the cia's role deep institutional role deep state role all covered up all hidden by
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:30.320]  the same you know a lot about chicago is the main drug route el chopo worked for the cia i know the
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:36.880]  guys used to run the flights for him uh that we've had on the show uh so it's how to even have a
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:41.920]  trial for el chopo when he was in cia for 25 years exactly it's a very interesting choice
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.880]  because you look at that you know netflix and they're uh they're doing narcos mexico they hint at it
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.360]  they hint at the fact that the cia was involved in mexican drug running and and gun running they
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.920]  hint at their role in the in the attacking the dea agent but they never go to the full details
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:00.000]  of it in the scope of it and what very interesting el chopo made an interesting choice he chose to
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.200]  put on no defense uh whatever the story is he's doing something behind the scenes to sort of
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:10.160]  keep secret and keep quiet the complicity involving hyran they're holding his kids hostage
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:14.560]  correct he's got two little kids two that have been inside the courtroom the judge threatened if
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:19.440]  he could even communicated with his wife or his kids uh they he the judge threatened the lawyers
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:23.680]  if they allowed such communication to take place so it gives you once people are introduced to the
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:27.840]  american criminal justice system they're often shocked and horrified by the way in which it
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:33.360]  operates we're not lionizing el chopo but let's be honest he was an angel cake running all of
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:39.840]  mexico before obama decided to end all that and he stabilized and cost 200 000 dead i mean he wasn't
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:44.560]  back then you didn't kill women or kids under el chopo so they've pulled el chopo out to put in
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:51.520]  the next generation of of of allister crowley grim reaper worshipers absolutely i mean basically
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.520]  what they've done is when you look at the drug distribution networks under el chopo they mostly
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:00.080]  minimized collateral violence because that was the way to maintain their political limited
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.880]  limited political harassment in mexico so as soon as you take him out all of a sudden you get heads
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.920]  on stakes like you got in cancun you get bodies being hung off of bridges you get live video
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:15.200]  executions that started taking place popularized in various films so the taking out el chopo had
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:19.840]  the net effect of of destabilizing the drug distribution and allowing the most violent
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:26.480]  sick vile sources of of of king activity in the world so why was choppo removed i think that that's
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.400]  an open question that a lot of people are struck by because everybody knew that the effect of
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:35.440]  removing el chopo would be to increase the power of ms-13 the central american gangs that have no
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:39.760]  cause they had to deal with the democrats that's why they aren't they now the arm of them they very
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:42.720]  much are i mean they're the ones running guns they're the ones running drugs they're the ones
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:50.480]  the democrats that literally run ms-13 other groups now this is the the net effect of it is
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:54.640]  that basically they're given free reign i mean and that's why obama started taking him out
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:59.760]  was because he's the old school that doesn't kill women and children they want the new
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:05.760]  literal translation worship of the angel of death they want that group in control because
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.480]  they'll do everything effectively what happened is human smuggling takes off so human once el
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:14.960]  chopo is political powers removed the net effect of there wasn't kidnapping when he was in charge
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:18.640]  correct because it interfered with his drug distribution business so they put different
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.400]  people in charge the net effect of their prosecutorial policy decisions decisions they
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:26.080]  knew would have those consequences dating back to when they did the same thing to cutting off
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:30.160]  columbian traffic through miami and the caribbean shifted it to create the mexican drug cartels in
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:35.200]  the first place so the the very everybody at the top level knows that the net effect of our policy
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:40.880]  choices is to create exactly so what is what is the end game then that's a that's an open question
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.040]  i mean in the what people are speculating and various people see is what they see is if they
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:49.120]  intend the consequence if they know the consequence what's the consequence worse human trafficking
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:53.520]  than we've seen in the long time some of the most vile violence than we've seen in the long time
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:57.200]  in the elevation of some of the most dangerous precarious gangs in the world to where they're
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:01.520]  running caravans i mean you've got these gangs protecting creative it's the worst groups ally
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:06.720]  with the u.n el choppa wouldn't do it to break the u.s to break latin america to break mexico
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:11.600]  it's a literal globalist run drug cartel ready to break north america well the old sort of
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:16.080]  notion of fuco and other people was that you know why would we create a permanent criminal class
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:19.840]  because it makes people feel more and more comfortable with the police so you destabilize
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.600]  europe what's the net effect within a year or two you have them publicly admitting things that you've
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:28.080]  been talking about for 10 years which is well really maybe we need an e u army to deal with all
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:31.600]  of these immigration and migration issues but then they're going to be able to help run at all
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:35.920]  exactly so it helps create the premise and the presumption for their new power grab
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:42.720]  it's unbelievable ladies and gentlemen el choppa is removed because he wasn't
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:49.920]  evil enough and just wanted stability no we're using drugs as a weapon to break down everything
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:57.920]  this is what the globalists are doing we'll be right back stay with us with robert barnes

[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:06.160]  in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:13.280]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:20.080]  the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:26.000]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:32.640]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter and not only
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:39.120]  were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:45.360]  as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:51.840]  that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:58.080]  water filtration system will purify it listen i'm just gonna tell us for something right now i think

[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:33.840]  if a mother is in labor i can tell you exactly what would happen the infant would be delivered
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:40.480]  the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:46.480]  and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother so
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:52.640]  i think this was really blown out of proportion but again we want the government not to be involved
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:58.720]  in these types of decisions we want the decision to be made by the the mothers and their providers
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:04.800]  and and this is why julie that legislators most of whom are men by the way shouldn't be telling a
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:16.560]  woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body so i was asking constitutional lawyer
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:21.680]  robert barnes his take on what he thinks is most evil in the world he brought up the governor of
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:27.520]  virginium talking about keeping babies alive after they're born to harvest their organs that's the
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:32.320]  real reason they're doing it and just how dehumanizing this has gotten but you see those of us that
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:38.320]  have a conscience psychopaths and sociopaths they think they're the ruling elite because they don't
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:46.400]  have one and they're expert on playing on our emotions that they don't have so your take on
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:53.680]  this whole situation with new york legalizing post birth abortion and then now virginia moving for
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.080]  it defending it and what they're really legalizing is infanticide what's fascinating is you know several
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:02.560]  years ago i mean you've been talking about this for an extended time period you had the various
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.240]  undercover reporters going and document that plan parenthood was doing this with various
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:11.200]  organizations and associations in california the new story that came out tried to filter and frame
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:16.400]  and and reinterpret and reconstruct what they said by saying oh these were selectively edited
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:20.720]  like they claim about james kief they said that these videos were not accurate were not honest
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:24.720]  were not correct and it turns out they were in fact they went up to the fifth circuit court of
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:28.960]  appeals earlier just of this month and the fifth circuit court of appeals said that what these
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.760]  people had videotaped was actually accurate it wasn't selectively edited it was that what was
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.960]  really happening where they were harvesting organs and various stem cells and other aspects of a baby's
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:44.160]  physical body for the purposes of personal political profit uh in fact not only that the
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:47.680]  orange county district attorney brought charges against several of these organizations forced
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:51.840]  them to leave the state this close that they had made over eight million dollars or close to it
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:56.880]  uh and yet those stories were completely suppressed that unless you were following it in detail the
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:00.960]  establishment press never reported it instead in fact the state of california me and some other
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:05.520]  lawyers fought it but the state of california tried to criminalize what was videotaped they
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:11.120]  tried to make it a crime to do undercover reporting of that type if it didn't have certain levels of
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:16.080]  certain kinds of politically pre-approved uh approval from certain select political sources
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:20.960]  then you could go to prison for doing what those guys did when they undocumented this whole scandal
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:25.360]  and put it in video format and then here you have now the state of new york and the state of
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:31.440]  virginia openly celebrating it openly welcoming it openly trying to make it state law to basically
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:37.520]  treat a human being like nothing more than a piece of cattle so the real headline is democrat
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:43.920]  governor ralph northam is advocating the legalization of babies having their organs harvested
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:49.040]  that's really what he's doing that's really what he's saying that's really what he's pushing
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:53.680]  it's the ultimate form of dehumanization if you can dehumanize a little baby then you can
[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:59.040]  dehumanize anybody any place anywhere anytime so it's part of this broader campaign that it's
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:04.320]  meant to undermine the humanity and the humanitarian experience and the universality of humanitarianism
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:08.080]  i remember when i met one of the top ranking people in the planned parenthood when i was a
[02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:12.800]  kid at Yale we did a group in fact i did it with uh justice bryer's daughter we were doing a debate
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:17.840]  series he was there he was discussing it we did a dinner later and he just presumed that i would agree
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:20.960]  with him when i didn't but he's sitting there talking to me and he's saying well bob if you
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:25.600]  really look at these things uh you should look at where the population is expanding
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:29.920]  and where we need to control it i was like so this is basically i was calling for minorities
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:35.280]  absolutely he was saying we need to have repress the african population the latin population the
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:40.240]  asian population that he made it clear that this was just the sterilization campaigns the 19 teens
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:45.120]  and 1920s which people forget was the true inspiration to the nazis the nazis constantly
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:50.240]  gave credit to the margaret sanger and the roga fellers absolutely to that entire movement so
[02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:53.920]  refreshing to talk to you because you know your history most lawyers i talked to they're really
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:58.320]  good at law but i tell them stuff about history they look at me like i'm a chinese jet pilot
[02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:04.960]  right and it's like the left are literally nazi eugenicists crazy people they're selling
[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:10.400]  baby's organs and i tell the women you can get 300 grand for your baby for organ harvesting or adopted
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:15.360]  they're like i'm a woman i'm killing it i'm like fine keep the money at least from your dead kid
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:20.640]  you grew it you know it's just so sick and northam really disclosed that it was fascinating to watch
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:25.120]  it with that sort of silky southern accent he hides the nefarious nature of what he's saying
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:28.880]  because he's like well especially you know people that have certain disabilities and certain problems
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:33.520]  he said they might have it and we're gonna take care of it the baby's gonna be talking about why
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:38.400]  we get the goodies exactly we'll wrap them up and in a nice tight little row and then we'll
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:42.800]  then we'll strangle him i mean it says so that's a little and he tells the women he goes
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:49.360]  who look upset he goes we don't tell women what to do now exactly in a lie this is a deeply
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:54.400]  disturbing you're seeing the insights of us like the most vamp psychopathic sociopathic mind it's
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:58.160]  the most vampiric crap i've ever seen absolutely and he's putting it right there for everybody
[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:04.320]  means the governor of one of the biggest states in our union i remember when i learned that they
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:09.600]  were heating hospitals six seven years ago in the uk and you're up with with baby bodies and i knew
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:14.400]  i said wait that's just the cover to say we're burning babies for energy and then sure enough
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:18.640]  they were selling the organs and so they've got blood tests that they know what's going on a woman's
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:22.560]  coming in they've got blood tests they tell the baby's blood tests so they've got some rich person
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:26.480]  who's got a kid the car at age three they're gonna get a half million dollars so they go these
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:30.160]  computers but in bounties three and a half million a million dollars just for that liver
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:36.720]  for some rich guy doesn't even know and so your kid is sick they're in there oh we're sorry little
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:42.640]  angel didn't do too good but you sign the organ the card and so and then they guys get that money
[02:53:42.640 --> 02:53:48.320]  i mean this is such a scandal but it said it turns into women's reproductive rights and he's like
[02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:55.680]  ladies don't stand up for those babies it's a woman's right the women go i guess you're right
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:54:03.280]  he's like yes you are my dear you keep your mouth shut women for women's rights exactly it's one of
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:08.800]  the sort of sickest most disturbing ways to do it because the once you can dehumanize a baby
[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:13.840]  you can dehumanize anybody any place anywhere anytime it's the ultimate extension the ultimate
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:18.320]  expansion of a mindset where people in elite positions of privilege and power don't see human
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:26.240]  beings it's the final frontier and so what you do is you go after his donors that are genetic tech
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:32.000]  biotech body parts you show it because again think i think how evil he is he's got his own
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.560]  legislator introducing an abortion up till after birth what does he do he just goes he doesn't
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:41.200]  debate they're killing babies during the birthday he goes we keep it alive we make it comfortable
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:50.000]  while we take out the the nice juicy organ parts he just he just it's like we don't get in the way
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  of women do we the women go i guess we don't he's like now you gotta see at the table you can grow
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:02.720]  us we don't grow cotton or tobacco now you women grow them babies for us women like yes we do
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:08.160]  he's like and you ain't gonna get down to money either and she's like yes sir i just think you're
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:14.480]  good now you know exactly and it's what's frightening is it's an extension of the mindset of slavery
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:20.480]  that dehumanized indivisible this is the ultimate slavery exactly you got the fine southern gentlemen
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:27.520]  we're gonna grow that baby i'll be in june and nobody stands in a feminist way and she's like i
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:34.880]  guess you're right and to disguise this kind of horrific dehumanizing in the name of motherhood
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:41.760]  to call it oh we're gonna mom is give us some babies precisely it's a degree of darkness and i think
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:46.080]  what shocked him was he probably didn't expect this public reaction well he didn't he thought he was so
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.040]  slick like yeah we're not just killing them when they're coming out the birth canal we make him real
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:56.240]  comfortable and then he uses it was amazing the language he uses he gets away from all death language
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:56:01.040]  he says oh we'll just make him comfortable and then and then a decision will be made well decision
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:04.960]  not we're gonna kill i don't want the government to be hurt but imagine him tied up i got a big old knife
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:13.840]  or something oh we got a decision coming exactly we're going to size you don't precisely and it's
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:19.040]  a rebirth like people forget the whole vaccination issue my uh my populism professor at Yale what he
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:23.840]  studied was the anti-vaccination movement of portland in 1920s because in fact it was a populist
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:28.080]  movement because under the guise of vaccination they were doing illicit sterilizations they were
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:32.320]  targeting poor kids and poor families mostly white families but also poor african-american
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:36.080]  families across the board that's why i love you because you know history it's all on record the
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:41.280]  eugenics boards that hitler came out of came out of the us and exactly they bragged about it there
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:45.760]  wasn't a nazi you said that they didn't get their ideas as a nuremberg trial they said we're following
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:49.920]  your damn orders exactly just following and implementing it to its logical conclusion they're
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:54.640]  like that's all the us would go along exactly well and to some degree now the us goes and
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:59.760]  employs a bunch of these nazi scientists thirty six thousand of them exactly so the uh to some degree
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:06.000]  we did sadly well this governor clearly is on the payroll of this and i think he jumped the the
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:11.360]  the medecladon yeah i think he he had no he's clearly so accustomed to his bubble in bubble
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:15.440]  universe that he thought talking about this and talk radio would be so normal and so natural
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:21.600]  we're gonna make that baby real come like a vampire we're gonna drink your baby's blood but
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:27.920]  we're gonna give him a shot of heroin and i sink my thing in and suck that blood out
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:35.520]  he don't think mommy give him a kiss so let me talk to you like that real sweet now give me
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:41.760]  that baby yorgans because i need that money next hour coming up with paul wassa but not before
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:50.880]  we finish up with robert barnes when it comes to rebuilding your energy convenience is key
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:55.840]  while coffee candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost the crash can leave you
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:01.360]  more tired than ever turbo force from info wars life is a powerful mix in energy packet that
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:07.920]  utilizes vitamins amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus clarity

[02:59:51.360 --> 03:00:19.200]  well i got some good news before paul joseph watching takes over i was going to cover this
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:24.240]  today was in my stack that trump's chief counsel boy he's he's being killed by these
[03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:28.880]  establishment lawyers he had nominated three conservatives the night circuit that's the
[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:32.720]  circuit that bans the american flag and says the country's evil and all the rest of it and
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:39.440]  we should bring in unvetted jihadis with with no real passport so his chief counsel had made a deal
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:45.920]  it turned out white house uh working behind trumps back to a point left us the night circuit
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:52.480]  jamie white wrote about that yesterday well look here fox news harris and feinstein fume
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:58.160]  well they're you're not the president lady after white house renominates two conservative california
[03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:03.840]  judges because they gave him one but but two lebtards on trump just reversed that so he's fighting
[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:09.040]  hard but he's fighting major mutiny so we've got a good constitutional lawyer robert barnes of at
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:13.200]  barnes underscore law at twitter what do you make of that that's a very good decision of the president
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:17.920]  to reverse courts because the people that would have been nominated by harris and feinstein would
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:21.760]  have been established well as soon as he knew he reversed it exactly and thank god so the i mean
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:26.240]  the sad thing is i think he has very few true ideological allies in the entire white house
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:30.320]  apparatus they all get threatened they're a bunch of wimps exactly that there are people who don't
[03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:33.360]  share his agenda there are people who don't share his mindset there are people who will
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:38.160]  capitulate at a given moment at any time they don't share the same backbone that he has
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:42.720]  and the effect of that is that he they constantly put him at political he's a general without an army
[03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:47.200]  exactly he's a general without any army or without any other generals so he's trying to do things or
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:50.640]  he's doing things with kernels that are actually undermining him on a daily basis imagine trying
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.840]  to run a battle that way so he's towards washington with 50 benedict kernels exactly so the and that's
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:59.520]  the effect of it and they're and they're pretending that they're not benedict arnold arnold's while
[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:03.840]  they're designing and developing strategy and the net effect of is that it puts his political
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:08.480]  agenda at risk it puts the independent populist agenda at risk it puts the the humanitarian
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:14.480]  re-establishment of democratic right to risk and they think these modern men think double dealing
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:19.680]  is smart but no double dealing it's one thing if you're working for a great plan have a backup
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:23.360]  with somebody you think is almost as good but when you're dealing with pure evil and something good
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:28.640]  that's called being an idiot loser morons precisely there are people who've grown up in such a
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:32.240]  protective environment they grew up in sort of they're almost all upper middle class upper
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:36.880]  income total white shoe exactly they have no clue about the real world they've never had a real job
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:40.400]  they've never taken a real risk they not only have they not done a real risk in sort of the
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:44.000]  military or the police and their real lives or in their business but they haven't taken a real
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  risk in politics and the effect of it is if if the president went back and president trump
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:52.400]  went back to appointing and putting into power people like himself he would be able to implement
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:56.720]  more of his agenda than have this constant sabotage and again notice the whole establishment's
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:03:01.920]  move is about keeping us from risk rights of passages as bad as they are it's like niches said
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:07.040]  that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger every risk I took brought me to a new level it's
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:12.720]  literally like magic exactly the the sort of safe space ideology has led to a safe space idolatry
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:16.400]  so you have these i mean they don't let their kids go out and play or publicly associate with
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:19.600]  other people they're always in their own little environment from the time that they're three
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.760]  until the time that they're 30 and the net effect of it is you get very delusional absolutely the
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:27.280]  people who are terrible like if you looked at the list of those people and you said if a black swan
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:31.760]  event happened tomorrow that was totally anticipated uh unanticipated who would we trust to be an
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:35.360]  opposition of leadership outside of the president none of them they're people that the last people
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:39.440]  on the list you would want to be in that position they don't run into committees while the zombie
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:42.800]  apocalypse happened precisely i mean that there are people who are just not skilled you wouldn't
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:46.240]  trust them on the battlefield you definitely don't trust them in the strategy room and they're and
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:49.920]  they're undermining the president on a constant continuous basis and thankfully the president's
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:54.480]  paying enough attention to people like yourself to take independent action when necessary well
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:58.400]  people's you know you can you you can attack the president and suddenly you get promoted everywhere
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:03.040]  on twitter and facebook and i'm not bashing in culture for that but give me a break the men
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:08.640]  i halfway bashing suddenly the the censorship's over so what is it they had about trump so much
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:14.960]  in closing trump is a is the reassert is basically recreating ordinary everyday people's power over
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:19.440]  our own government reinstating little d democracy over our military over our law enforcement over
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:25.120]  our political hierarchy reinstating humanitarian goals the universality of americanism the universality
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:29.760]  of of humanitarianism and that's what makes them terrified he's independent he thinks independent
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:33.680]  he acts independent and they can't afford that to happen in those meetings he's like what's the
[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:38.000]  best deal for america exactly that's all he cares about sure we have the power we sell it off he's
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:44.080]  like no you don't they go no you're mentally ill we sell it and he's like no they go yesterday
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:48.480]  right sir and they run to these meetings and sit around with a bunch of traders a bunch of nobis

[03:06:53.920 --> 03:06:57.520]  where we're going i know it's gonna happen poll watch is about to take over let me just briefly
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:07:02.000]  throw out here because i don't do it enough i'm our biggest problem i plug like once an hour
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:07.680]  other talk show hosts plug every segment and i have millions of dollars of legal bills a year
[03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:12.960]  i'm not bitching i i chose the fight but this is the fight this isn't just a side fighter there's
[03:07:12.960 --> 03:07:16.640]  all these thousands of flavors of news and information and everybody claims they're under
[03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:20.800]  attack everybody claims they've got the zeitgeist i'm not on a power trip having the zeitgeist
[03:07:20.800 --> 03:07:26.400]  i'm going to bed every night at like 10 o'clock literally for a reason i think better on my knees
[03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:31.600]  in the room before i go to bed going god tonight when i'm asleep tell me what to do i this is a
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:36.960]  big responsibility i didn't i didn't know this would all happen uh and i'm i'm i'm giving all this
[03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:43.840]  power that i really want to do a good job because because this is confusing and god just says just
[03:07:43.840 --> 03:07:48.960]  keep taking action you're not going to figure out my plan but at the final equation at this
[03:07:48.960 --> 03:07:54.880]  temporal level i need money and you look at buzzfeed with 300 million dollars a year they make
[03:07:54.880 --> 03:08:00.880]  100 million they lose they don't have half the footprint we have the media is like jose admits
[03:08:00.880 --> 03:08:06.800]  he made 40 million dollars a year last year i'm a free market guy i'm not against money if you
[03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:13.360]  earn it create a better widget a better toothpaste but no it's 40 million a year half of its product
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:20.480]  cost then the employees the bandwidth all the cost we're we are this year in the first month
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:25.360]  i talked to accountants this morning we've lost a million and a half dollars because i haven't cut
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:31.840]  new ads and haven't created new hysteria about products it's my fault so at that rate we'll be
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:36.720]  bankrupt in six months so the enemy that might excite them people say you don't do that i'm not
[03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:41.360]  maccubelli i'm going to tell you where the cards are i can show you the text from the accountant
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:45.920]  right here if you want before i even it's seven a.m before i met with them at nine a.m the point is
[03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:50.400]  we've got fluoride free colloidal silver iodine four to five toothpaste you need we've got the best
[03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:55.920]  uh uh products out there whether it's colloidal silver or whether it's turmeric
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:00.960]  or whether it's a high quality healthy energy drinks or whether it's brain force whatever it is
[03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:05.680]  i set out to say what is the best plus they're going to test everything we do and demonize it
[03:09:06.320 --> 03:09:09.840]  and we we have it so info wars life dot com info wars store dot com
[03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:16.400]  to remove vitalities refill vitality or cold pressed herbs i've had so much trouble getting it
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:21.600]  that i told the people they're one of the top companies in the nation i'm sick of only getting
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:26.000]  it once a year not having it for six months we're done with it so it's the last run of it not because
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:30.480]  it doesn't sell but because it's too hard to get despite that it's 50 off that cell ends in a couple
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:36.720]  days the point is whether it's water filtration air filtration non-humor heirloom seeds books videos
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:42.080]  whatever it is info our store dot com we find great products we lower the price in many cases
[03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:46.880]  lower than amazon and then you get people that are on a comic cosy mission against the globalist
[03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:51.840]  paul watson is about to take over the big uh press conference and more the roger stone
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:56.240]  is posted info wars dot com news wars dot com pressure port dot com is still linked to that
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:10:00.640]  live feed they've got another event i'm told the streak that's about to happen in the next 30 minutes
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:04.960]  so i'm glad roger's still linked to that uh but robert barnes i'm not just kissing your ass because
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:10.240]  i have a lot of i've had the former technical head of the nsa on who knows all about secret
[03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:18.000]  interdimensional breakthrough equations that he just told me at dinner well if you don't
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:22.720]  understand it i can't tell you it's classified i've had everybody on but you and your general
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:28.000]  knowledge of real politic is impressive so in closing before paul watson takes over i just
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.920]  wanted you about the general state of the world where humanity is to make some final comments
[03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:36.480]  well basically it's organizations like this and the people that support and it's about the audience
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:41.200]  being able to continually to access independent information independent resources that the net
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:45.120]  effect of that is to be able to create an opportunity for ordinary people to keep the
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:49.440]  democratic little d democratic experiment alive the little d democratic experiment in our legal
[03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:53.600]  system our political system and our social system to have independence of thought independence of
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:57.760]  lesson we're totally abandoning what made us the greatest country on earth exactly we got a return
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:11:00.800]  to those roots and reinstate those roots and make them stronger and more powerful and then
[03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:04.000]  trumps trying to reboot it and he's the bad guy precisely that's how the whole system is
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:07.840]  oppressing it and they want to quash it for good they want the democracy little d democracy
[03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:11.840]  to be dead they want free speech to be dead so it's about making speech free again it's about
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:16.000]  not only not only about that in order to make america great again and it's order to reinstate
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:20.240]  the original roots and the original principles of our little d democratic experiment so humanitarianism
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:25.680]  and individualism can be respected all across the world what is the unified corporatist instinct
[03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:31.440]  to extinguish what creates all the innovation i guess it's just a a point of contact
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:35.440]  greatiness i mean what is that instinct they don't trust individualism they don't trust
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:40.400]  independence they don't trust their dominance i mean as a leader i want to see men and women
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:46.480]  that rise up that become greater than me i want to not worship them in a in a big w sense but a
[03:11:46.480 --> 03:11:51.680]  little w sense i mean i want to see them it's like they say in full metal jacket our drill
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:56.640]  sergeants were very very pleased to see that we'd swollen beyond their control more powerful than
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:01.200]  they'd ever been i mean i want to see that don't they get leadership they don't because they
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:05.440]  see independence as individuality is leading to humanitarianism and that undermines a
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:09.520]  collectivist corporatist approach that sees human beings as nothing more than chattel and cattle
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:15.600]  which don't the elite know they turn themselves into that by that process they should but the their
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:20.160]  mindset is so distorted and so contorted that they're unable to connect to the ordinary vision
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:25.440]  and they see any independent act any individualistic act any humanitarian act is threatening their
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:29.360]  power and they're so obsessed with their power perniciously and parochialy that they cannot
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:33.520]  see the universalism of humanitarianism and its appeal ultimately for their own self benefit
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:38.880]  so what is the paradox like cancer doesn't know it's cancer it if it had a consciousness it would
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:43.520]  think it was winning taking over the body so it's the same thing conversely they think they're taking
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:48.160]  over that means they're the elite know they're breaking all the fundamental strictures of the
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:53.920]  healthy system they are cancer so what do we do we recognize that we cut it out or we die that's
[03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:58.640]  exactly right they have a cancerous mindset that attempts to infiltrate and to spread the virus
[03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:03.440]  through everybody and the only way to resist it is to through acts of humanitarianism individualism
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:08.400]  and to risk and to create organizations like info wars a community that surrounds it to be able to
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:12.000]  enable independence of thought independence of mind to raise the questions that need to be asked
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:17.840]  and they know we're willing to be burned at the stake show they can't stop us they want to stop
[03:13:17.840 --> 03:13:21.840]  people having access exactly it's all about controlling the audience having the audience be
[03:13:21.840 --> 03:13:25.840]  too afraid to support have the audience be too afraid to participate have the audience be too
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:31.360]  afraid to help keep this alive so that they the audience can continue to make up their own minds
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:35.760]  about their own ideas and express themselves because that's ultimately the goal is to control
[03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:40.160]  what the audience thinks to shame and censor them not so much to shame and censor you to
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:44.320]  shame and censor them so that they don't have access to the independence of thought the independence
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:48.240]  of ideas that challenge and question the established wisdom from the establishment press
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:55.920]  Robert Barnes we're gonna break in Paul's taking over from London always doing an amazing job Paul Watson
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:00.240]  but I mean take Paul I'll talk about Paul he didn't want to be on air he didn't want to be a
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:04.320]  personality he was doing a great job doing his own writing I hired him 18 years ago
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:09.760]  and then I got him on air and now he's done a great job and I see that that potential in everybody
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:17.600]  and I don't think people realize just how big the stakes are and just how powerful they are if
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:21.760]  they take action absolutely that the state in the system does the state in the system knows
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:27.360]  how easy and effective it can be for just a small group of people to change the world because every
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:31.600]  revolution and evolution that's ever happened in human history has been the product of often
[03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:36.240]  just a small group of people willing to stand up and be that iconoclastic presence so people like
[03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:41.920]  Paul Watson who are independent of thought who exemplify the old British tradition of great
[03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:46.080]  independence of thought independence of ideas and independence of expression are necessary
[03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:50.480]  a critical and essential to the ability to to challenge conventional wisdom to challenge
[03:14:50.480 --> 03:14:55.520]  establishment so it's the ghost of renaissance that we're conjuring and everyone has to understand
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:14:59.520]  that's what the enemy fears exactly they want to suppress and repress the renaissance they see the
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:04.400]  renaissance as one of the great mistakes of human history they see the Catholic mindset of the old
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:08.640]  Catholic church not the new Catholic church but the old Inquisition era church as the model they
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:12.800]  wish to replicate that's why they operate with the same mindset towards anybody that's engaged in
[03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:16.480]  heretical thought that's why they care more about thought controls than they do about freedom of
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:21.120]  speech or freedom of ideas or freedom of expression for them all of those things are a threat because
[03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:26.080]  they like the old institutional power that the old Inquisitional state had under the religious
[03:15:26.080 --> 03:15:32.640]  orthodoxy of the corrupted old Catholic church but we will win you can feel it you can know it

[03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:29.440]  and now your host paul joseph watson and we are live on this january 31st 2019 edition of the alex
[03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:36.400]  jones show i'm gonna start off here in the fourth hour with a few big news stories from my home country
[03:20:36.400 --> 03:20:42.880]  of the uk because political correctness has run amok this is not political correctness gone mad
[03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:48.640]  this is political correctness in the insane asylum we have a situation here in the uk where
[03:20:49.440 --> 03:20:57.040]  somebody can report to police what they call a hate incident which basically means if they feel
[03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:03.280]  they've been offended and if they're you know class of identity whatever they choose it is for that
[03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:09.520]  day whatever they had they identify as for that day has been offended by an adversary they can
[03:21:09.520 --> 03:21:16.480]  report it to the police and the police are duty bound to investigate the report as a quote hey
[03:21:16.480 --> 03:21:22.720]  incident now there doesn't need to be any evidence that any crime has actually taken place nor nor
[03:21:22.720 --> 03:21:29.440]  any evidence when they even arrive at the scene if somebody claims that they feel offended then that
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:35.440]  incident is registered as a hey incident then people wonder why you know reported hate crimes are
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:42.480]  up 17 plus percent since brexit it's because they changed the definition and now simply from being
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:47.680]  from claiming they're being victimized the police are duty bound to report on this and we had an
[03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:53.440]  absolutely probably the most absurd example of this i've seen at least in recent years
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:22:00.880]  headline out of the telegraph man investigated by police for retweeting transgender limerick
[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:07.040]  now as far as i know because i report on this info was reported on this days before the mainstream
[03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:13.040]  media again tomorrow's news today because i saw this when it went out on twitter from the individual
[03:22:13.040 --> 03:22:19.920]  explaining how he was contacted by police for a transgender limerick now let's get it straight
[03:22:19.920 --> 03:22:26.800]  he did not even post that tweet these were not even his words and this headline claims he retweeted it
[03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:33.280]  from what i researched he liked the tweet he didn't even retweet it he merely liked it somebody
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:38.880]  reported that he liked a tweet a docker from humberside has been investigated by police over
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:44.320]  a limerick he posted that's incorrect he didn't post it on twitter after an officer claimed it
[03:22:44.320 --> 03:22:51.120]  constituted a hey incident against transgender people harry miller 53 from linkedin was contacted
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:57.120]  on wednesday by a community cohesion officer following a complaint that had been made about
[03:22:57.120 --> 03:23:03.760]  the plant and machinery dealers social media posts they singled out a limerick that he had
[03:23:03.760 --> 03:23:08.560]  retweeted again he didn't retweet it he liked it which questioned whether transgender women or
[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:13.680]  biological women included the lines your breasts are made of silicone your vagina goes nowhere
[03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:19.840]  even though no crime was committed sharing the limerick online was recorded as a hate incident
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:27.680]  and they actually told him over the phone they called him up threatened him threatened his job
[03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:32.800]  threatened to report him to his boss said that they needed to check if any transgender people
[03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:38.640]  worked at his firm at his place of employment because they might not be safe because he liked
[03:23:38.640 --> 03:23:46.080]  a funny limerick on twitter this is what police resources are going to in the united kingdom
[03:23:46.080 --> 03:23:52.960]  even as a violent crime rate source even as people are out on the streets in yorkshire the same
[03:23:52.960 --> 03:23:59.120]  county as this today with machetes trying to murder people you've all seen the videos again
[03:23:59.120 --> 03:24:05.040]  nine percent of crimes actually end with a criminal being charged in the united kingdom
[03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:11.040]  but they've got plenty of resources to harass people to call them up to threaten with getting
[03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:17.280]  them fired and potential hate crimes charges because they liked a limerick about transgender
[03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:23.840]  people they see the story today i shall feel my hometown where some insane persons running around
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:29.120]  with a machete maybe you know if he did if he'd have tweeted about it before they would have
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:35.120]  reacted quicker now in this case they actually phoned him up this is humberside same county
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:42.880]  yorkshire and they said he would have to check your thinking that the officer told this guy who
[03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:49.280]  liked to tweet that he would need to check your thinking that was what he said over the phone
[03:24:49.280 --> 03:24:55.840]  now what that makes us even more ridiculous and absurd is that somebody in humberside responded
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:25:02.080]  to this tweet somebody who lives in the same area after humberside police tried to backtrack
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:08.160]  from this they got completely ratioed on twitter the tweet from humberside police read we received
[03:25:08.160 --> 03:25:12.240]  reports of a number of transphobic comments being posted on social media we take all reports
[03:25:12.240 --> 03:25:16.800]  of hate related incidents seriously blah blah blah blah blah so they have to investigate it
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:23.840]  somebody responded and i think this is somebody who i follow and follows me you didn't investigate
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:28.560]  my brother's flat in hull which is in the same area when i told you i had concerns about his
[03:25:28.560 --> 03:25:37.120]  well-being you told me you didn't have the resources two days later a neighbor found his body i wish i
[03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:44.720]  told you he'd like to limerick on facebook so literally the same police force told this woman
[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:51.920]  they didn't have the resources to investigate a missing person who turned up dead but they do have
[03:25:51.920 --> 03:25:58.800]  the resources to investigate a 53 year old man because he liked a limerick about transgender
[03:25:58.800 --> 03:26:06.160]  people on twitter and when they're called out when they get thousands of responses to the tweets
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:13.280]  they just double down double down on the insanity mr miller told the telegraph
[03:26:14.160 --> 03:26:17.760]  i can't believe what's happening in the uk in the name of transgenderism
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:23.840]  which again is like what 0.03 percent of the population or whatever and worse still we're
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:28.560]  not even allowed to think never mind talk about it the married father of four was alerted in the
[03:26:28.560 --> 03:26:33.840]  investigation by his company directors after they were approached by officers trying to make contact
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:39.840]  with mr miller so the police went to his boss to try and get him into trouble the complainant
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:45.120]  had managed to identify mr miller's place of work so again it was some busy body on twitter
[03:26:45.120 --> 03:26:49.840]  that literally tried to get the guy fired tried to get him in trouble with the police
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:55.200]  because he liked to limerick on twitter as part of the complaint to police it was alleged
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:00.160]  the firm was an unsafe environment for transgender employees because of mr miller's comments on
[03:27:00.160 --> 03:27:08.560]  social media he didn't even comment he liked to tweet listen to this crime in humberside
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:15.520]  the same area has gone up 13 percent in the year ending september 2018 above the 8 percent national
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:23.120]  average violent offenses are up 24 percent sexual offenses up 19 percent robberies up 17 percent
[03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:28.880]  the number of officers on the beat has increased by nearly 200 in the past 12 months so even with
[03:27:28.880 --> 03:27:34.240]  extra officers the crime rate keeps going up across the whole country nine percent of crimes end up
[03:27:34.240 --> 03:27:40.080]  with somebody being criminally charged either they don't have the resources to investigate the rest or
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:46.560]  the criminal gets away with the crime again we've been told in the uk burglary if your car gets
[03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:52.080]  burglarized if your home gets burglarized they're not even going to show up to record it in many
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:59.280]  places oh but plenty of resources to investigate somebody liking a limerick on twitter meanwhile
[03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:06.320]  missing persons are being reported to the same police authority they don't even investigate it
[03:28:06.320 --> 03:28:13.760]  those same people turn up dead this is the state of the united kingdom this is the thought control
[03:28:13.760 --> 03:28:19.440]  they literally called him up and said you need to change your thinking otherwise you're going to
[03:28:19.440 --> 03:28:30.000]  get in trouble with the police this is worse than anything all well ever envisaged in 1984 forget
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:36.560]  about thought crime this is literally he didn't even say any words he clicked a button on twitter
[03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:43.680]  and got investigated by the police almost got fired harassed absolutely incredible and it gets
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:47.760]  worse i'm going to get into more of these stories after the break the incredible state of thought

[03:35:55.760 --> 03:36:00.240]  by police for a transgender limerick which he didn't even post he just liked it on twitter
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:07.040]  crimes skyrocketing in the same area dead bodies are being reported and not even investigated
[03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:11.120]  but they've got plenty of time to call up some guy and threaten to get him fired
[03:36:12.160 --> 03:36:16.560]  and threaten to give him a police record if he doesn't change his thinking
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:21.920]  how orwellian is that in the same area then we have this story out of spite
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:29.840]  headline even woke comics on safe pc is back for comedy of all political persuasions and i've
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:36.000]  made videos before about how political correctness is ruining comedy in the united states people
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  are tuning out of it because basically comedians are walking on eggshells uh the most offensive
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:49.920]  people from a decade ago and now backtracking in fear of the mob outrage twitter pitchfork crew
[03:36:50.800 --> 03:36:56.240]  and we have a similar situation in the united kingdom this is a comedian who's basically the
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:37:02.560]  most safe boring comedian you could ever imagine pc lefty politically correct so you could go down
[03:37:02.560 --> 03:37:08.560]  the line but now he claims that the bbc asked him to tweak a routine in case it offended isis
[03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:17.680]  this they were seriously concerned about offending islamic terrorists in the latest episode of his
[03:37:17.680 --> 03:37:23.200]  sky one show the russell howard hour the bristol comic did a routine about freedom of speech
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:28.000]  in which he told this remarkable story from his time working for the bbc which of course is basically
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:34.560]  the state broadcaster funded by license players payers who if you don't pay the license they come
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:39.040]  to your house and bang down the door and try to get in your house in the wake of the paris attacks
[03:37:39.920 --> 03:37:46.080]  he wrote a bit for his then bbc show lambasting the isis killers as warmongering pricks insisting
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:55.440]  they aren't muslims but terrorists so how dare he straight after the 2015 paris attacks hundreds
[03:37:55.440 --> 03:38:02.240]  of people slaughtered hundreds more injured by islamic terrorists he insulted islamic terrorists
[03:38:02.240 --> 03:38:07.920]  and he got a little slap on the wrist for the bbc this apparently set off alarm bells with the
[03:38:07.920 --> 03:38:14.080]  executives who made him change it to say that jihadists aren't devout muslims even though
[03:38:14.080 --> 03:38:18.080]  they claim to be in every one of these attacks and even if you read the quran they're only following
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:24.160]  it to a team so they are devout muslims he said are you worried we're going to offend isis are
[03:38:24.160 --> 03:38:30.560]  they going to write in on his sky news show on his sky show last week imagine my horror when
[03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:35.600]  i was misrepresented on a late night satire show feruq and i will be cancelling our tv
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:41.200]  licensee jokes please excuse my handwriting i have a hook for a hand obviously talking about the
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:48.640]  infamous hook-handed cleric abu hamza the story has been met with some typical bpc b reactions on
[03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:54.720]  social media but if anything this was kind of an odd departure for the corporation the bbc's clunky
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:00.000]  house style has it so that the words islamic state only ever appear in quote marks or
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:06.240]  professed by so-called that's right they can't even say islamic state on the bbc they have to say
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:11.680]  so-called because they want to claim it's not islamic even though when you look at polls
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:18.640]  from moderate muslims huge numbers of them support suicide bombings again those are the moderates
[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:26.960]  so this guy basically insulted islamic terrorists days or weeks after one of the biggest islamic
[03:39:26.960 --> 03:39:33.200]  terror attacks in recent history and the bbc told him he would have to change his routine
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:38.800]  because it might offend islamic terrorists this is the level of pc y dealing with now
[03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:45.440]  that would be strangled by in the united kingdom so you can't like transgender limericks on twitter
[03:39:45.440 --> 03:39:51.760]  or you'll get investigated harassed you can't insult terrorists and now we have this story
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:59.440]  out of kipper central which is a u-kip website student effectively expelled from uni for offensive
[03:39:59.440 --> 03:40:05.440]  comments on immigration and halal the student at the university of central Lancashire told kipper
[03:40:05.440 --> 03:40:10.800]  central that he's been effectively expelled from university after he told fellow students he would
[03:40:10.800 --> 03:40:16.960]  never eat halal meat and what's being described as a shocking attack on free speech and in fact
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:22.880]  they emailed me all the documents for this last night i think it was i read the email this morning
[03:40:23.760 --> 03:40:26.880]  but this kipper central website's already reported on it
[03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:32.720]  sebastian walsh he was a student until today studying a children's school and family's course
[03:40:32.720 --> 03:40:39.200]  at u-c-l-a-n has been informed that he's been suspended from studies on the and can only return
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:44.240]  on the condition he signs a future good conduct and behavior agreement which revokes his right
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:51.120]  to free speech and takes diversity training so again you can't say that you're not going to eat
[03:40:51.120 --> 03:40:57.040]  halal meat absolutely cruel and barbaric practice you can't say that you're against immigration
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:03.360]  we had a story not so long ago where they were investigating school kids in the united kingdom
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:10.960]  if they had been found to have visited u-kip's website under the prevent anti-terror program
[03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:17.280]  they were actually treating children as potential terrorists in uk schools because they visited
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:25.360]  u-kip's website and now this kid faces basically being expelled because he was reported as saying
[03:41:25.360 --> 03:41:31.760]  offensive and harassing things by basically declaring that he wouldn't eat halal meat absolutely
[03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:37.840]  incredible sebastian who is the northwest german of u-kip's youth wing that's obviously why he was
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:43.760]  targeted is unashamed to have made the remarks arguing that he has been victimized by u-c-l-l-a-n
[03:41:43.760 --> 03:41:50.080]  for speaking the truth i stand by everything i said he told kipper central because the truth
[03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:56.160]  can never be silenced no matter how hard universities might try he said halal is barbaric in every way
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:42:02.320]  and i make no apology for saying so if that offends other students then perhaps they need to
[03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:09.040]  need to toughen up they always target these u-kip kids if they're not putting them in like prevent
[03:42:09.040 --> 03:42:14.880]  anti-terror programs and visiting them at the schools we had another another story a few years
[03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:22.480]  ago out of the uk where foster parents who had had an exemplary record of fostering children
[03:42:22.480 --> 03:42:28.160]  they found out that they voted u-kip and i think this isn't rather where we have the giant islamic
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:34.720]  pedo grooming gangs they found out that they voted for u-kip and the local council in rotherham
[03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:40.720]  which basically ignored the entire grooming scandal tried to take the kids away from those
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:45.440]  parents because they found out they voted for u-kip which at the time was the third biggest
[03:42:45.440 --> 03:42:51.520]  political party in the uk absolutely ludicrous situation we'll be back with morris the alex

[03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:16.880]  broadcast live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:17.520 --> 03:47:27.120]  and now your host paul joseph watson the back it is the final segment of the fourth hour of the alex
[03:47:27.120 --> 03:47:33.200]  jones show now we've been talking about youtube of course there was a buzzfeed article last week
[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:40.640]  which basically again pressured youtube into changing its own policy they caved within 24 hours
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:47.440]  after buzzfeed wind and complained about the fact that conspiracy theory videos were appearing in
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:53.840]  recommended videos on youtube now how did they define conspiracy theory videos well they conflated
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:48:01.920]  conspiracy theory videos with ben shipy hero jordan peterson prager university and a bunch of
[03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:08.880]  mainstream right of center immigration watchdog groups so again this was another blatant example
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:15.600]  of buzzfeed abusing its own platform to manipulate youtube into crushing their adversaries into
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:21.680]  crushing their competition we already have a situation on youtube where a wall of mainstream
[03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:27.280]  media results will appear if you search for any news event whatsoever they've already
[03:48:27.280 --> 03:48:35.680]  gamed the algorithm to the point where cnn abc cbs already have a massive upper hand over any
[03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:42.160]  of the independent con content creators who helped create helped boost helped build up youtube in
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:49.200]  the first place and one of those individuals who is not even political but he's absolutely massive
[03:48:49.200 --> 03:48:56.240]  he's got a subscriber base of 20 million subscribers he had a recent youtube series about
[03:48:58.240 --> 03:49:05.920]  logan paul which went absolutely viral got tens of millions of viewers jpearl as well
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:14.160]  and basically i tweeted last night that youtube is going to start interfering in his revenue income
[03:49:14.160 --> 03:49:21.120]  in his videos because he made a one hour 45 minute documentary about conspiracy theories he is
[03:49:21.120 --> 03:49:27.040]  shane dorson who you may have heard of he was one of the individuals who right at the start of youtube
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:33.280]  helped build it up he's one of the first creators ever to go viral and last night basically i put
[03:49:33.280 --> 03:49:41.760]  out a tweet warning him that youtube is now promised to change its algorithm to relegate
[03:49:41.760 --> 03:49:47.760]  quote conspiracy theory content so here's a guy with 20 million subscribers who's put out a documentary
[03:49:47.760 --> 03:49:53.760]  on conspiracy theories one of which by the way is the apple through the iphone is listening to you
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:50:00.160]  all the time which again was proven yesterday with the big story about uh the facetime calls
[03:50:00.880 --> 03:50:05.200]  accessing people's microphones and cameras before they even allowed it before they even
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:10.960]  answered the call in fact that was one of the quote conspiracy theories in his documentary
[03:50:10.960 --> 03:50:17.120]  again not a conspiracy theory at all so basically i warned him that youtube has resolved to change
[03:50:17.120 --> 03:50:23.440]  its policy to relegate those videos in the algorithm he responded with a tweet and they
[03:50:23.440 --> 03:50:31.920]  see the verge article they demonetized his video immediately he lost about 14 000 within those
[03:50:31.920 --> 03:50:38.480]  first few hours at least because they automatically demonetized his video because it presumably had
[03:50:38.480 --> 03:50:46.240]  the word conspiracy theories in the title very mind this is one of the biggest creators on youtube
[03:50:46.240 --> 03:50:52.400]  they'll bend over backwards to help the likes of jimmy kimmel to help the likes of cnn you know
[03:50:52.400 --> 03:50:57.200]  massive corporations that have put nothing whatsoever to you into youtube they've just
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:51:03.040]  hijacked it off the back of other independent content creators like shawn dorsen building it up
[03:51:03.040 --> 03:51:08.880]  so they've basically acted as vultures then they've demanded handouts to help build them up while
[03:51:08.880 --> 03:51:15.600]  demanding youtube de-platform sensor and relegate in the algorithm other independent content creators
[03:51:16.160 --> 03:51:21.760]  and now shane dorsen himself has been punished exactly as i predicted he would be punished
[03:51:21.760 --> 03:51:28.080]  last night in that tweet headline youtube's reviewing mistake could cost shane dorsen thousands of
[03:51:28.080 --> 03:51:34.240]  thousands of dollars shane dorsen's new hour and a half long exploration of conspiracy theories
[03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:42.480]  was demonetized by youtube for 12 hours they claim it was a reviewing mistake okay and they later
[03:51:42.480 --> 03:51:47.920]  gave a comment this from a youtube spokesperson to show ads videos must comply with our advertiser
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:54.240]  friendly guidelines sometimes we get it wrong all right okay so why is every single video i upload
[03:51:54.240 --> 03:52:00.880]  instantly demonetized nobody's looking at it it's just instantly demonetized that's the policy
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:05.680]  they didn't get it wrong they'd be demonetized it because they had conspiracy theories in the
[03:52:05.680 --> 03:52:12.480]  headline that's why it got demonetized i warned him last night and then he responded on twitter
[03:52:13.360 --> 03:52:18.080]  he said oh yeah i've never made money on my conspiracy videos and i've had some removed
[03:52:18.080 --> 03:52:23.200]  so again he's saying they always get demonetized if not removed and again when we say conspiracy
[03:52:23.200 --> 03:52:29.040]  theories we're talking about the iphone spying on people okay it's not some of it isn't even
[03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:35.760]  conspiracy theories proven fact he said it's the risk of being into this dark sh it i guess
[03:52:36.640 --> 03:52:43.360]  love your stuff by the way oh my god and can you imagine the meltdown this got 18 000 likes on
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:50.240]  twitter this is the guy with 8 million followers saying he likes my videos immediately somebody
[03:52:50.240 --> 03:52:55.920]  called nathan benard responded a verified idiot on twitter this is a youtuber with 20 million
[03:52:55.920 --> 03:53:00.880]  subscribers praising prison paul from info wars for his great work radicalization on youtube is
[03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:07.280]  very real the platform is a cesspool of far-right reactionaries so left wing verified twitter some
[03:53:07.280 --> 03:53:13.440]  of them at least went into an absolute meltdown wouldn't be surprised if there are vox and vice
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:18.800]  stories about this by tomorrow morning and this is the point i've made over and over again any
[03:53:18.800 --> 03:53:26.000]  prominent individual on youtube any independent creator who dares stray from the progressive
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:32.480]  reservation is immediately targeted by this these people because they're in such a blind panic
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:36.960]  over the influence these independent content creators have because they're not controlled by
[03:53:36.960 --> 03:53:42.480]  corporations because they don't have to be employed by buzzfeed to go on youtube and have a massive
[03:53:42.480 --> 03:53:49.040]  impact and it's the same with pewdiepie shane dawson's not political in any way he makes funny videos
[03:53:49.040 --> 03:53:54.880]  some of them about conspiracy theories for basically teenagers he's got a generation z
[03:53:54.880 --> 03:54:00.560]  audience but the mere threat of him having an open mind and saying i love your stuff in a tweet
[03:54:01.120 --> 03:54:06.800]  and a reply to one of my tweets they cannot handle that and if you go if you search you know at
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:13.920]  prison planet at shane dawson on twitter you'll see hundreds and hundreds of people very salty very
[03:54:13.920 --> 03:54:19.920]  salty about that because again they're terrified of anyone having independent thought just as they
[03:54:19.920 --> 03:54:26.000]  were with conya west just as they were with pewdiepie and anyone basically who sticks their
[03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:32.800]  head above the parapet because as i make i made the point in my video about pewdiepie these digital
[03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:38.160]  media people these corporate media people they don't have personalities so they can't be successful
[03:54:38.160 --> 03:54:45.440]  on youtube they can't create content all they can do is parrot tired left-wing social justice
[03:54:45.440 --> 03:54:51.280]  warrior cliches nobody's interested in that they're losing out on advertising money because of it
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:56.240]  they're losing out on traffic because they abolished their own comment sections because they
[03:54:56.240 --> 03:55:01.280]  didn't be challenged on any of their own content so because they're losing all that ad revenue
[03:55:01.280 --> 03:55:05.040]  they're having to try and get it back to try and get traffic back to their websites
[03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:12.320]  by just attacking popular independent content creators on youtube like pewdiepie like shane
[03:55:12.320 --> 03:55:20.080]  dawson and there's even one the other day which is james charles who's like this effeminate gay
[03:55:20.080 --> 03:55:25.920]  makeup artist youtube channel he goes to birmingham the second largest city in the uk
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:31.280]  8 000 screaming girls show up and then the mainstream media writes a bunch of articles
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:35.760]  because they don't understand youtube in any capacity because they don't understand how youtube
[03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:40.960]  is a success successful in reaching people and they attacked him as a nobody throughout the
[03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:47.680]  mainstream media when he's got more viewers than anyone in the mainstream media you know he's
[03:55:47.680 --> 03:55:52.080]  probably got like what eight ten million subscribers he's got more viewers than any of them again
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:56:00.560]  james charles is not political he talks about makeup for god's sake and yet even he terrifies them
[03:56:00.560 --> 03:56:05.680]  because he's an unknown quantity and he was criticizing the mainstream media so that's
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:10.640]  why people like shane dawson like my videos because i defend them when the mainstream
[03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:17.040]  media attacks them basically james charles 40 million subscribers so they like me because i
[03:56:17.040 --> 03:56:22.000]  defend them from the mainstream media not because they agree with all my political beliefs and that
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:28.400] 's what it's come down to that is how divisive the media and the digital media the likes of buzzfeed
[03:56:29.280 --> 03:56:35.440]  the likes of vox the likes of cnn's activist reporters who try to de-platform their competition
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:39.920]  at every turn that's how they've created this environment and that's why people like shane
[03:56:39.920 --> 03:56:47.200]  dawson will occasionally give me a shout out even at the risk of being viciously attacked by ignorant
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:53.760]  bigoted closed-minded hate mobs on twitter as is happening today so he lost about
[03:56:54.960 --> 03:57:00.880]  14 000 dollars they're reporting within 12 hours dawson is likely earning even more than two dollars
[03:57:00.880 --> 03:57:06.560]  per 1000 views because of his popularity and influence on the platform so within minutes
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:13.120]  of him uploading that video simply because he had conspiracy theory in the title it was removed
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:19.360]  and then he gave me a shout out on twitter and the meltdown ensued from there that's so terrified
[03:57:19.360 --> 03:57:25.680]  of independent people who command large audiences who don't follow their progressive mantras and
[03:57:25.680 --> 03:57:32.240]  just want to entertain people and have fun they can't even tolerate that that's where we're at
