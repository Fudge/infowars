[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.980]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.980 --> 00:26.400]  Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this
[00:26.400 --> 00:32.360]  Wednesday April 1st April Fool's Day you know it's almost like every day is
[00:32.360 --> 00:36.200]  April Fool's Day that's why we're accused of being conspiracy theorists
[00:36.200 --> 00:40.320]  because whenever the government tells us anything we always have to step back
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.320]  and say is that for real or are they pulling our leg I mean we have a
[00:45.320 --> 00:50.840]  government that is so obviously lying to a specimen he thinks not transparent
[00:50.840 --> 00:54.120]  about anything everything is a government secret and they've been
[00:54.120 --> 00:59.100]  caught so many times lying that every day we have to ask that and that's why
[00:59.100 --> 01:03.320]  we are conspiracy investigators we're looking to see if the government is
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.360]  doing something illegal if they're lying to us about what their intentions are
[01:06.360 --> 01:09.800]  that's why there's so much speculation about what's going on with this jade
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.240]  helm exercise of course the military runs exercises all the time however when
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.360]  they do these things in urban populated areas when they get off of the bases
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.040]  when they are practicing I think this is key when they are practicing to go
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.080]  undetected amongst the American public and civilian clothes that makes you
[01:28.080 --> 01:34.080]  question what their mission is because we've been lied to too many times by our
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.720]  government by our military one of the things that I think we should question
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.280]  is something that just came out we're going to talk about this in detail the
[01:43.280 --> 01:50.040]  DEA after busting Silk Road and of course Alex talked to the mother of Ross
[01:50.040 --> 01:54.480]  Ulbricht who was accused of being dread pirate Roberts this is a website that
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.680]  was a conduit essentially for illegal drug trade and so they came after this
[01:59.680 --> 02:06.920]  and now we find that the key agents the DEA agent as well as a secret service
[02:06.920 --> 02:13.440]  agent were involved in fraud theft of government property money laundering on
[02:13.440 --> 02:20.280]  and on and on and all of this information was withheld and the trial even though
[02:20.280 --> 02:23.520]  they knew this they were not allowed the defense was not allowed to bring this
[02:23.520 --> 02:29.240]  up even to the extent that these guys are running multiple names involved in
[02:29.240 --> 02:34.200]  the orchestrated murder for hire all of this did not come out in the trial was
[02:34.200 --> 02:38.640]  shut down in the trial and that's essentially what we heard from Bear
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.560]  Brown when he was talking about his trial how they kept out of evidence so many
[02:43.560 --> 02:47.720]  things that could have cleared him but the judge just denied that from evidence
[02:47.720 --> 02:50.560]  so he says we no longer and this is a quote from Bear Brown he said we no
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.920]  longer have a rule of law we have a rule by law enforcement or rule of law
[02:54.920 --> 02:59.280]  enforcement and that's the sad state of where we are so we need to always
[02:59.280 --> 03:02.800]  question this narrative and it's going to be interesting we'll look at that in
[03:02.800 --> 03:05.960]  a little bit more detail of course there's some new news about this Bill in
[03:05.960 --> 03:11.040]  Texas that would come out in opposition to filming the cops this is the same
[03:11.040 --> 03:16.920]  Texas representative who also introduced a bill to mandate psychological
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.120]  evaluations based on teacher recommendations and if you didn't get
[03:20.120 --> 03:24.080]  your kid evaluated for teachers I'd send them to a psychiatrist there were
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.440]  serious consequences for that we're going to talk about that we're going to
[03:27.440 --> 03:30.800]  talk about the representative who keeps coming up with these insane bills he's
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.000]  a Republican out of Dallas but we have two stories I think are very interesting
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.160]  and very telling about where we are a university is requiring students to
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.600]  apply for free speech permits at the same time we see that the universities
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.800]  and the college loans are just squashing children under mountains of debt when
[03:51.800 --> 03:56.240]  they get out we have to ask you know you're going to get out of college in
[03:56.240 --> 04:01.240]  most cases you're going to be a debt slave but you also need to have the
[04:01.240 --> 04:04.880]  mentality of a slave and that's what they're working on in schools from K
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.280]  through 12 and even in college and that's what this is about having
[04:08.280 --> 04:11.680]  students apply for free speech permits we've had Dinesh D'Souza many people
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.920]  talking about how illiberal the universities have become and I mean
[04:16.920 --> 04:22.160]  that in the sense of the classical liberals people in the 1800s called
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.720]  those who stood for liberty they called them liberals but that's not what
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.520]  liberal means now it's basically very illiberal we also have a clip from a
[04:31.520 --> 04:37.360]  city council meeting where a man who is a veteran is called an enemy of his
[04:37.360 --> 04:42.360]  country by the councilman because he said that he smoked pot he was an enemy
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.000]  of the Constitution really who is the enemy so stay with us we're going to be
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.080]  right back and we're going to cover those stories as well as what's happening
[04:49.080 --> 04:58.040]  in the Middle East

[08:11.120 --> 08:29.120]  the age of wonder if you are receiving this transmission
[08:29.120 --> 08:52.440]  we're gonna try to work out what's going on what his opinion is about what's
[08:52.440 --> 08:56.160]  behind Jade Helm and of course with today being April Fool's Day as I said in
[08:56.160 --> 09:00.680]  the last segment we're always trying to figure out if the government is spoofing
[09:00.680 --> 09:04.320]  us or not because we can never count on the government we've caught them so many
[09:04.320 --> 09:09.520]  times covering things up lying to us deliberately everything is a national
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.720]  secret it's all about national security so we can never get a straight answer
[09:13.720 --> 09:17.240]  from these guys and usually we find out when they do give us a definitive answer
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.480]  that it's a lie just like we saw James Clapper giving the lie looking down as
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.960]  he scrubbed his eyes he couldn't look Ron Wyden in the eye because he knew that
[09:27.960 --> 09:32.080]  Ron Wyden knew that James Clapper in the NSA was doing dragnet surveillance on
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.520]  everybody in violation of the foreign intelligence surveillance act he knew
[09:36.520 --> 09:39.720]  that the staffers all knew it he knew that all the other senators knew it so
[09:39.720 --> 09:43.920]  when Ron Wyden asked him a point blank question he just kind of looked down and
[09:43.920 --> 09:49.480]  well and we know that too we know that too Mr. Clapper we know you guys are all
[09:49.480 --> 09:53.520]  lying to us but it's just good to get it on tape once in a while we're going to
[09:53.520 --> 09:57.200]  as I mentioned have Steve Quill join us in the second hour he's going to talk
[09:57.200 --> 10:00.320]  about what he thinks is behind J. Helm and of course there's been a lot of
[10:00.320 --> 10:06.400]  speculation about what this is because you know it is not just the an ordinary
[10:06.400 --> 10:10.520]  exercise this is something that's going for two months it's over a large range
[10:10.520 --> 10:15.400]  and I think personally we ought to be concerned about this whether it is for
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.280]  domestic operation or not I'm very concerned about the fact that they're
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.840]  going to have training a large part of the training is to operate amongst the
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.000]  American people in civilian clothes to see if they can go undetected I don't
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.760]  know why you would need to do that in a foreign country if you're going to do
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.640]  that in America if you're going to train that way in America that would not help
[10:34.640 --> 10:38.480]  you in a foreign country as everybody's thinking they're going to go maybe to the
[10:38.480 --> 10:42.680]  Middle East or wherever they're going to go but we have a lot of evidence that
[10:42.680 --> 10:45.840]  our government is also preparing for war in the Middle East they're also
[10:45.840 --> 10:49.000]  preparing for war against the Russians are they preparing for war against the
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.280]  American people possibly the answer is all of the above unfortunately these
[10:54.280 --> 10:58.200]  guys think that they can go to war with everybody everywhere and they can still
[10:58.200 --> 11:03.040]  come out on top or maybe what they really want to do is get everybody
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.360]  fighting with each other we have a speech that was made by the head of
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.000]  strat for it's always interesting to get these speeches that were made at
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.360]  conferences because many times these guys will make statements comfortable in
[11:17.360 --> 11:20.520]  this area and figure that nobody's ever going to look at these dry proceedings
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.720]  from a conference and every once in a while you'll find these that somebody
[11:24.720 --> 11:28.560]  notices something in it and pulls it out usually they only get a couple hundred
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.600]  views and they post them on YouTube if they put them up there it's kind of
[11:32.600 --> 11:36.560]  similar to what Petraeus did when he said well what comes after America well
[11:36.560 --> 11:41.520]  that simple North America were 20 years in the North American Union we had a
[11:41.520 --> 11:45.800]  kind of a similar thing I think from a speech done by the strat for president
[11:45.800 --> 11:53.320]  Friedman and he was talking about the conflict in the Ukraine we're gonna play
[11:53.320 --> 11:59.000]  some excerpts from that I think it gives a real insight into the mindset of these
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.200]  people and I think it raises some real troubling questions for us the video was
[12:03.200 --> 12:06.440]  actually posted with German subtitles by somebody in Germany because he talks
[12:06.440 --> 12:12.600]  a great deal about Germany and Russia to give you kind of a preview he says that
[12:12.600 --> 12:16.560]  for the last 100 years the existential threat to America has been to keep
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.960]  Germany and Russia apart from each other to keep them from unifying because we
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.480]  could not control that the British and the Americans could not control that
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.360]  power base so we need to keep them separate that is an existential threat to
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.560]  us he says but then he also goes on to point out that if we get into the
[12:33.560 --> 12:39.200]  Ukraine the Russians consider that to be an existential threat so here you've
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.080]  got two conflicting existential threats is what he's saying so we're gonna talk
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.680]  about that we're also going to have another look at Jade Helm we've talked
[12:48.680 --> 12:54.200]  about the troubling domestic implications for this as we're very
[12:54.200 --> 12:57.520]  concerned like I said about the people moving about as civilians we've also
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.880]  seen the training facility at AP Hill there's others throughout the country
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.400]  and other military bases where they have created replicas of American cities not
[13:07.400 --> 13:12.240]  European cities not Middle Eastern cities American cities and they train
[13:12.240 --> 13:17.440]  there they train the military there they train police there to act as military
[13:17.440 --> 13:21.800]  that's something we should all be very concerned but Watson had an interesting
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.200]  take on this map but we've had a couple of veterans who contacted us and said
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.600]  that they think that Jade Helm is preparation for an Iranian invasion or
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.480]  an Iranian and Syrian invasion so we're going to play Watson's report on that
[13:35.480 --> 13:38.600]  later on and of course there's been other stuff that people are saying what's
[13:38.600 --> 13:44.040]  what's going on with these nationwide emergency alert tests people are panicked
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.960]  they're confused it was one that went quite a long time on the east coast
[13:48.960 --> 13:52.960]  yesterday I think it was or the day before we have Paul's article about this
[13:52.960 --> 13:59.440]  he posted on the 31st it was yeah it was yesterday morning we're gonna talk
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.560]  about what's behind that but before we do that I want to get into this video
[14:03.560 --> 14:09.880]  this is a veteran who came back and spoke at a video at a county a city
[14:09.880 --> 14:15.360]  meeting and he was speaking about medical marijuana he was speaking to a city
[14:15.360 --> 14:21.760]  official in Maricopa County he was an attorney and of course Maricopa is where
[14:21.760 --> 14:29.640]  sheriff chef Joe Arpaia is and he had some comments let's play this video and
[14:29.640 --> 14:32.280]  then we'll talk about what they had to say
[14:32.280 --> 14:40.120]  Mr. Montgomery thank you for your service I'm a Vietnam veteran myself today is a

[16:56.640 --> 17:02.840]  United Nations understand that ten years before Richard Nixon actually nine
[17:02.840 --> 17:08.360]  years before he declared it in 1970 nine years before in 61 the United
[17:08.360 --> 17:11.840]  Nations came up with the four schedules that we have now for drugs that came up
[17:11.840 --> 17:17.040]  with a template with an agenda they enacted that and declared war on drugs
[17:17.040 --> 17:22.040]  ten years later this is a UN agenda and it is something that has failed for
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.200]  over 40 years we need to understand that but who is the enemy of the
[17:25.200 --> 17:30.600]  Constitution I would say this county attorney is the enemy of the Constitution
[17:30.600 --> 17:35.800]  not the other man the 9th and the 10th and the 18th and the 21st
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.560]  amendments make it clear that they don't have the right to outlaw this they
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.040]  haven't done what they need to do the 9th and the 10th amendment make it clear
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.600]  that just because we don't specifically mention something like the right to keep
[17:48.600 --> 17:52.440]  in their arms which they also don't respect or free speech which they also
[17:52.440 --> 17:55.800]  don't respect just because we don't specifically mention that doesn't mean
[17:55.800 --> 17:58.720]  that those rights are not important doesn't mean that we don't retain those
[17:58.720 --> 18:02.280]  rights that the states and the individuals don't retain those rights
[18:02.280 --> 18:06.040]  that's the 9th and 10th amendment then the 18th amendment in respect of that
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.480]  they said well we want to ban alcohol for whatever idiotic reason we know that
[18:09.480 --> 18:13.920]  drug prohibition did not work that it made everything far worse because it
[18:13.920 --> 18:18.160]  wasn't the way to handle the problem and alcoholism is a problem I understand
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.320]  that but it's a spiritual problem it's a psychological problem it is not a law
[18:22.320 --> 18:27.000]  enforcement problem that does not work but the 18th amendment came in and said
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.760]  alright we don't have the authority to ban alcohol so we're going to amend the
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.160]  Constitution so that we specifically have the power to ban this particular
[18:33.160 --> 18:38.120]  substance and the 21st amendment roll that back so they have to have
[18:38.120 --> 18:41.800]  constitutional permission to do this and they don't have that so the real enemy
[18:41.800 --> 18:48.240]  of the Constitution are the quote-unquote law enforcement and attorneys and the
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.440]  counties who are putting people in jail they're the real enemies of the
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.880]  Constitution they're the ones who have really violated their oath and this and
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.680]  an attorney an attorney should know better we have talked many times to
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.560]  law enforcement against prohibition it's attorneys it is law enforcement
[19:05.560 --> 19:09.240]  official former most of them are former some of them are active as well as
[19:09.240 --> 19:15.560]  judges who realize a this isn't working and b this is destroying our country but
[19:15.560 --> 19:20.760]  let's talk about the free speech part of it you know we should have that held
[19:20.760 --> 19:25.160]  without any laws being made that should be sacrosanct and it's certainly in an
[19:25.160 --> 19:28.440]  institution of higher learning like a university you would think that they
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.200]  would understand the importance of free speech the importance of hearing
[19:33.200 --> 19:37.200]  everyone's side of this and and having an open debate I mean isn't that what
[19:37.200 --> 19:39.920]  higher education is supposed to be about isn't supposed to be about holding up
[19:39.920 --> 19:44.880]  ideas examining these things and having a debate about them and letting the best
[19:44.880 --> 19:50.280]  ideas come forth not in our modern universities not in the ones where you're
[19:50.280 --> 19:53.960]  going to come out massively as a slave that we're gonna talk about that story

[24:44.960 --> 24:50.240]  talking about in the previous segment that they're trying to suppress freedom
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.760]  of speech at the universities this is one way that you can get out there and
[24:54.760 --> 24:57.480]  engage people even if you're not at a university especially if you're not in
[24:57.480 --> 25:00.440]  university because universities are going to censor you they're going to try
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.840]  to anyway but this is one way that I guess I don't see that they've got
[25:04.840 --> 25:08.200]  dress codes prohibiting this yet I mean you can't hand out flyers and talk to
[25:08.200 --> 25:11.360]  people but you can certainly wear a shirt you can wear a buckle it's a great
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.320]  conversation starter you'll find other people who are kindred spirits who
[25:15.320 --> 25:18.880]  understand liberty and you might get into a discussion with some people who
[25:18.880 --> 25:22.440]  maybe think that they know what we're about but don't really know what we're
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.240]  about you can kind of help explain to them what's going on here but certainly
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.800]  it's an opportunity for you start to engage people in a conversation again you
[25:30.800 --> 25:36.000]  can get free shipping through the end of the week at info wars store calm that's
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.680]  our no fooling free shipping special now going back to this story that we just
[25:40.680 --> 25:43.640]  started talking about just before the break this is up on info wars dot com
[25:43.640 --> 25:48.440]  kit Daniels University requires students to apply for free speech permits the
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.240]  content of student handouts must also be reviewed and approved by these school
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.240]  officials this is that California Polytechnic State University in Pomona
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.040]  they are now requiring students to engage in free speech activities on
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.320]  campus to apply for permits to be issued between weekdays between the hours of
[26:06.320 --> 26:12.800]  8 and 5 so you not only have a free speech permit you've also got a free
[26:12.800 --> 26:15.560]  speech time window that you can put remember when they went out to the
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.760]  Bundy Ranch and they put this little cordon area out in the middle of nowhere
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.880]  I mean it was it was so far away from anywhere where anybody would ever see
[26:25.880 --> 26:29.160]  you of course that's what they do at the Republican and the Democrat
[26:29.160 --> 26:32.480]  conventions where they pick their presidential candidates and they've done
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.280]  that for the last several cycles setting up free speech areas anybody who wants
[26:37.280 --> 26:43.320]  to exercise their constitutional rights to demonstrate in public peacefully to
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.280]  redress their grievances that they have with the government those people at the
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.520]  political conventions they get put into cages that are many many blocks away from
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.440]  where the convention is being held if you get out of your cage your free speech
[26:56.440 --> 27:02.720]  cage you get arrested you get beaten you get tazored or maced or whatever the
[27:02.720 --> 27:07.440]  police feel like they want to do that day so this is something that is now
[27:07.440 --> 27:12.560]  being promoted in the universities like California Polytechnic State they say
[27:12.560 --> 27:15.640]  that if you're going to hand out flyers you not only have to get a free speech
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.320]  a free speech permit but you also need to get approval from school officials
[27:19.320 --> 27:24.240]  over the content so that you can then go to the free speech zone you know what
[27:24.240 --> 27:31.280]  at Bundy Ranch they had this this orange fence there and they had a sign that
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.040]  was printed up very nicely by the BLM professionally printed up signs that free
[27:35.040 --> 27:39.480]  speech area and somebody did a handwritten zone and said first
[27:39.480 --> 27:45.240]  amendment isn't an area and that said it all now of course at Polytechnic State
[27:45.240 --> 27:48.840]  University in California they're going to have to check in with the Office of
[27:48.840 --> 27:52.600]  Student Life they're going to have to allow the school to copy their IDs say
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.200]  they're intimidating you and then you're going to have to wear badges I don't
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.360]  need no stinking badges to get my free speech out there and then the Office of
[28:02.360 --> 28:07.200]  Student Life must approve all flyers and posters they say that last fall I could
[28:07.200 --> 28:11.360]  point out officials at Dixie State University from St. George Utah refused
[28:11.360 --> 28:15.240]  to allow libertarian students to hand out flyers that were poking fun at US
[28:15.240 --> 28:21.080]  presidents because the campus forbids mocking say a political correctness that
[28:21.080 --> 28:25.720]  just trumps everything so those students are replying with a lawsuit but you
[28:25.720 --> 28:31.320]  know if you go to school today at a college you're going to wind up massively
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.360]  in debt they want you to have the mindset of a slave as well that's what
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.000]  that training is about but you will have the debt of a slave you will be an
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.600]  indentured servant to the state you will not be able to get rid of that loan by
[28:44.600 --> 28:47.320]  declaring bankruptcy you don't get rid of a student debts by declaring
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.360]  bankruptcy those things hang around and it's become a massive business for the
[28:52.360 --> 28:57.240]  state for the banks that issue it we had a article that was up yesterday from
[28:57.240 --> 29:01.720]  sovereign man points out what every young person should see that every young
[29:01.720 --> 29:06.800]  person should see the feds startling numbers on student debt here's four key
[29:06.800 --> 29:10.960]  points they say 40 million Americans are now debt because of student loans on
[29:10.960 --> 29:17.300]  average borrowers have four loans with a balance of $29,000 student loans
[29:17.300 --> 29:21.920]  have the highest efficiency delinquency rate of any household credit and they
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.560]  have these second it's the second highest category of personal debt and they
[29:25.560 --> 29:32.760]  say only 37% of student loan balances are in current or current with their
[29:32.760 --> 29:37.360]  repayment and not delinquent it's a massive debt that's being imposed on
[29:37.360 --> 29:40.880]  people some majors are great sometimes if you're going to be a doctor or lawyer
[29:40.880 --> 29:44.880]  an engineer you need to go to college but many of these degrees are not going

[32:58.880 --> 33:06.800]  yet our best trained best educated best equipped best prepared troops refused
[33:06.800 --> 33:16.400]  to fight matter of fact it's safe to say that they would rather switch the Alex
[33:16.400 --> 33:22.560]  Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[33:23.880 --> 33:27.880]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David nice as I mentioned earlier in
[33:27.880 --> 33:30.720]  the show we're gonna have Steve quail joining us in the next hour he's going
[33:30.720 --> 33:35.640]  to talk about what he believes is going on with jade helm we don't really know
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.320]  we know there's an exercise going on we know it's very large extensive we know
[33:39.320 --> 33:43.880]  that the government has been training with replicas of American cities but we
[33:43.880 --> 33:48.440]  know that the government has also involved in many foreign wars all of
[33:48.440 --> 33:52.760]  those things are problem aren't they I mean even if they were going to only use
[33:52.760 --> 33:58.680]  this to start a massive new Middle Eastern war only if wouldn't that still
[33:58.680 --> 34:04.320]  be a problem can't we have a discussion about the scope of our government and
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.120]  of course one of the things we should be concerned about is the war on drugs
[34:08.120 --> 34:13.200]  which literally is a war this is a story from the nation that we have an info
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.040]  wars calm the US's war on drugs has spiraled dangerously out of control you
[34:17.040 --> 34:21.480]  think it's been this way for a long time but here's the case that they make they
[34:21.480 --> 34:24.720]  talk about people being beheaded by the hundreds
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.600]  he headless handless bodies along the road sides as a warning to those who
[34:29.600 --> 34:32.760]  would resist their power they have penetrated the local state and national
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.600]  governments and control entire sections of the country they provide employment
[34:36.600 --> 34:40.280]  and services to an impoverished public which distrust their actual government
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.000]  with its bitter record of corruption repression and torture they seduce young
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.160]  people from several countries including the US into their murderous
[34:48.160 --> 34:54.600]  activities they say are we talking about ISIS or ISIL or IS no they're talking
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.800]  about the Mexican drug cartels a huge number of people killed I think the
[34:59.800 --> 35:04.040]  last time I saw it I don't know what their count is here many people have
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.720]  different casually counts but it's certainly over a hundred thousand people
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.560]  have died in this war on drugs this is a real war this is a real war that could
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.680]  come to America we need to be concerned about this and we don't need to be
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.040]  concerned about it in the way that we erect some kind of a fortress on the
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.040]  border or that we turn ourselves into an armed police state no the armed police
[35:28.040 --> 35:33.840]  state is what is encouraging this kind of war the US war on drugs really is a
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.280]  war it's a war on our freedom it's a war on everything that our government has
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.160]  been based on it's something we should all be very very concerned about and we
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.440]  need to be concerned about a government that will not tell us the truth that will
[35:46.440 --> 35:51.840]  not be candid with us that will say that everything is national security or I'm
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.080]  not going to comply with this order or that one here's a good example this is
[35:56.080 --> 35:58.920]  something for the weekly standard Homeland Security had threatens to defy
[35:58.920 --> 36:05.320]  subpoenas now these are subpoenas that are coming from Chairman Jason Chaffetz of
[36:05.320 --> 36:09.360]  the House Committee oversight and government reform they wanted to know
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.520]  about these Secret Service agents and the incidents that happened there where
[36:13.520 --> 36:16.840]  they had these drunken Secret Service agents hit the gate and everything they
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.080]  were not shot of course I think maybe you know the lesson here is if you make
[36:21.080 --> 36:25.080]  want to make sure that you're not going to get shot in Washington dress up like
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.480]  a Secret Service agent look like the men in black don't wear a dress okay this is
[36:29.480 --> 36:32.800]  what happened to these two guys the other day because we'd already seen that
[36:32.800 --> 36:36.480]  they shot the lady with a baby in the back without thinking twice about it
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.480]  similar situation hitting the barrier but they wanted to find out what's going
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.120]  on with a Secret Service there's been some tremendous laxes in security so
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.560]  they subpoenaed a couple of Secret Service agents and these guys did not
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.860]  show up okay Secret Service Director Clancy had gone back on a promise to
[36:55.860 --> 36:59.600]  make the two unarmed agents available to be interviewed by the Congressional
[36:59.600 --> 37:05.360]  Committee so they sent subpoenas to Homeland Security and within hours get
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.940]  this talk about not seeing the contradiction here Homeland Security
[37:10.940 --> 37:15.180]  Secretary Jay Johnson fired back a sharply worded statement denying the
[37:15.180 --> 37:22.360]  charges of uncooperativeness along with a veil threat to defy the subpoenas so
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.800]  he's not going to how dare you call me uncooperative but he's not going to show
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.280]  up they're not going to comply with these but he's not uncooperative this is
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.040]  the kind of just over-the-top lying that we see from officials all the time
[37:38.040 --> 37:43.000]  this attitude that they are not responsible this administration is not
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.360]  accountable it can't be balanced by anyone or anything they're going to do
[37:46.360 --> 37:50.000]  whatever they want it doesn't matter what the Congress wants it doesn't matter
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.680]  what the Constitution says it doesn't matter what the laws are they're going
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.600]  to do whatever they wish and they're not going to be held accountable to anyone
[37:57.600 --> 38:02.360]  I thought it was kind of interesting Nico gave me this story from Gawker they
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.480]  actually called some questions about Hillary Clinton's actions with this
[38:06.480 --> 38:11.480]  email situation and they pointed out that she had sent an email and here's a
[38:11.480 --> 38:16.320]  subject to the email she sent it to Huma and it was regarding Pakistan troops
[38:16.320 --> 38:22.680]  battle Taliban for US drone debris and then that was an email and she returned
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.840]  that and she said I like the idea of these how high are they what would the
[38:27.840 --> 38:31.480]  bench be made of and I'd prefer two shelves or attractive boxes baskets
[38:31.480 --> 38:37.320]  containers on one what do you think and she said this back and she said did you
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.000]  send this to me in other words here's a couple of different ways you can look
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.400]  at this either Hillary Clinton and this is the take of Gawker their take on it
[38:45.400 --> 38:51.240]  was she's not able to keep these accounts separate she's got supposedly
[38:51.240 --> 38:55.480]  personal accounts and she's got the State Department accounts if she could
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.640]  send back a personal reply saying this is what I would like for my furnishings
[39:01.640 --> 39:07.640]  to somebody who had just sent her an email about Pakistan troops battling
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.960]  the Taliban for US drone debris if she could send something back that is a
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.800]  personal thing about yeah let's buy that table maybe if somebody is asking her
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.960]  about the table she might send back some classified information of that person
[39:22.960 --> 39:30.240]  about what's going on with the Taliban of course maybe she really was sending her
[39:30.240 --> 39:37.240]  code maybe that you know get that box and the extra lamp maybe that was something
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.000]  about you know ship some clandestine nukes over there I don't know as Hillary
[39:41.000 --> 39:48.200]  Clinton anything can happen with Hillary Clinton now we want to go to we're gonna
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.400]  have a video that Paul Watson put out because as we're talking about Jade
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.080]  Helm and I don't know really what Steve Quayles take is on this and one of the
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.760]  things that's come out from a lot of military people is that this may be
[40:01.760 --> 40:09.080]  preparation for a war in the Middle East so let's take a look at this video that
[40:09.080 --> 40:13.680]  Paul Watson's got he lays out the possibility that maybe what they're
[40:13.680 --> 40:20.200]  doing is planning to attack Iran in Syria the Jade Helm military exercise set
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.280]  to take place in nine US states this summer has prompted concerns about
[40:24.280 --> 40:29.240]  preparations for martial law in America but could the real purpose behind the
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.760]  drill be centered around a mock invasion of Iran and Syria and a huge Middle
[40:34.760 --> 40:40.520]  Eastern war as we've exhaustively documented these drills are clearly
[40:40.520 --> 40:45.320]  dual purpose and there are plans in place to use the army in a law enforcement
[40:45.320 --> 40:51.400]  capacity to intern Americans during mass domestic unrest but as Sputnik news
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.000]  documents today Jade Helm seems to be geared around a much more sinister
[40:56.000 --> 41:02.600]  project namely quote a preparation for an invasion of Iran and a Middle East
[41:02.600 --> 41:08.480]  wide war look at this map you'll recognize it as being from the Jade Helm
[41:08.480 --> 41:15.040]  exercise documents but it's been amended slightly the image is rotated to
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.480]  represent the approximate position of countries within the Middle East so
[41:20.480 --> 41:28.320]  instead of Texas Utah and a pocket of California being represented as hostile
[41:28.320 --> 41:35.200]  states the rogue nations become Iran Syria and Palestine with Iraq currently
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.840]  under siege by ISIS leaning hostile Israel Lebanon and Turkey in blue are
[41:40.840 --> 41:47.520]  friendly states the US states are also comparable in some ways to the Middle
[41:47.520 --> 41:52.920]  Eastern countries they represent New Mexico has vast swathes of desert like
[41:52.920 --> 41:59.320]  Iraq Utah has both mountains and flatlands like Syria California generally
[41:59.320 --> 42:04.720]  has a more gentle Mediterranean climate like Israel then look at the different
[42:04.720 --> 42:09.760]  operations that will be undertaken during Jade Helm and the implications are
[42:09.760 --> 42:15.920]  alarming in Utah the equivalent of Syria there will be a huge mock battle
[42:15.920 --> 42:22.240]  located here with the enemy being the army of a simulated country apply this
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.240]  to the Middle East and we're talking about the Syrian army allies of course
[42:27.240 --> 42:33.840]  with Iran also during Jade Helm two unidentified operational detachment
[42:33.840 --> 42:39.760]  groups will also be dispatched to the capital here simulating a covert
[42:39.760 --> 42:47.320]  operation in Damascus Syria being a permissive blue state Colorado or
[42:47.320 --> 42:53.280]  Turkey would allow NATO and US forces to move through the area unimpeded
[42:53.280 --> 43:00.720]  California or Israel is also listed as a permissive blue state no deployments of
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.280]  troops are planned to California during Jade Helm just as no US troops would
[43:06.280 --> 43:12.520]  need to enter Israel during an invasion of Iran and Syria the insurgent pocket
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.760]  shown on the Jade Helm map probably represents the West Bank and the Coastal
[43:17.760 --> 43:22.560]  Garza Strip although it could also represent Hezbollah forces in Lebanon
[43:22.560 --> 43:29.720]  who would oppose a US invasion of Iran Arizona or Jordan will be the site of
[43:29.720 --> 43:35.600]  the Special Forces operational detachment headquarters ODH and a Marine Corps site
[43:35.600 --> 43:43.720]  during Operation Jade Helm simulating Jordan's capital a man and of course the
[43:43.720 --> 43:51.280]  primary focus of Operation Jade Helm will of course be Texas at least 17 Texan
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.040]  cities involved in the exercise which of course tells us that the mock invasion
[43:57.040 --> 44:03.480]  of Iran is the centerpiece and the focus of this drill so as you can see the
[44:03.480 --> 44:09.280]  location terrain and operational activities that characterize Jade Helm
[44:09.280 --> 44:17.040]  can all be transposed onto a simulated invasion of the Middle East as four-star
[44:17.040 --> 44:23.440]  General Wesley Clark revealed after 9 11 the Pentagon rubber stamped a plan to
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.840]  invade the entire Middle East country by country about 10 days after 9 11 I went
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.800]  through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary
[44:33.800 --> 44:37.120]  Wolfowitz I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the joint
[44:37.120 --> 44:40.240]  staff who used used to work for me and one of the generals called me and he
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.760]  said sir you got to come in you got to come in and talk to me a second I said
[44:43.760 --> 44:48.920]  well you're too busy said no no he says we've made the decision we're going to
[44:48.920 --> 44:54.280]  war with Iraq this was on or about the 20th of September I said we're going to
[44:54.280 --> 45:02.000]  war with Iraq why he said I don't know he said I guess they don't know what
[45:02.000 --> 45:07.880]  else to do so I said well did they find some information collect connecting
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.960]  Saddam to Al Qaeda he said no no he says there's nothing new that way they just
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.960]  made the decision to go to war with Iraq he said I guess it's like we don't know
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.280]  what to do about terrorists but we've got a good military and we can take down
[45:22.280 --> 45:27.020]  governments and he said I guess if the only two you have is a hammer every
[45:27.020 --> 45:32.280]  problem has to look like a nail so I came back to see him a few weeks later
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.560]  and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan I said are we still going to
[45:36.560 --> 45:40.680]  war with Iraq and he said oh it's worse than that he said he reached over on his
[45:40.680 --> 45:44.360]  desk he picked up a piece of paper he said I just he said I just got this down
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.000]  from upstairs me the Secretary of Defense office today and he said this is a
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.080]  memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.360]  starting with Iraq and then Syria Lebanon Libya Somalia Sudan and finishing
[45:58.360 --> 46:04.840]  off Iran with Afghanistan Iraq and Libya already ticked off the list there's
[46:04.840 --> 46:10.960]  operation Jade Helm signal that a US attack on Iran and Syria and a
[46:10.960 --> 46:17.560]  potentially devastating wider war throughout the region is coming sooner
[46:17.560 --> 46:22.320]  than we think check out the other video subscribe to the channel I'm Paul
[46:22.320 --> 46:26.400]  Joseph Watson for info wars dot com interesting report and we're gonna be
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.640]  talking to Steve quail to get his take on what he think is is behind Jade Helm
[46:31.640 --> 46:35.880]  and of course we never know because the government will not talk to us but we do
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.680]  know as Wesley Clark pointed out that they're working to take down seven
[46:39.680 --> 46:43.000]  countries throughout the Middle East in five years that was a plan it may not be
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.600]  on schedule but can you have any doubt that that's still what they want to do
[46:47.600 --> 46:50.840]  and of course we know that they're pushing into the Ukraine we're going to
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.400]  talk about what the strat for president said to a small group of people that's
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.080]  pushed published up on a German site and we know that they are training for the
[47:00.080 --> 47:03.400]  American people they're training to go to war with everybody so the question is
[47:03.400 --> 47:06.440]  where are they spoofing us we're gonna talk a little bit more about that in
[47:06.440 --> 47:11.000]  just a moment but you know right now we have a special we are not fooling about
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.320]  and that is a free shipping special through Friday called the no-fooling
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.280]  free shipping special up on our store and we still have one more day this is
[47:19.280 --> 47:24.920]  absolutely the last day Alex has extended for DNA force it's 30% off and
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.520]  just through the end of the show today so you can get that as well as free
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.320]  shipping and you know when I look at that this story that came out on info
[47:34.320 --> 47:39.760]  wars.com it's up today about an Anglo Saxon cow bile and garlic potion that
[47:39.760 --> 47:44.800]  kills MRSA okay this is one of the superbugs that's going crazy in the
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.560]  hospitals and so many times the scientists will say well you know we
[47:49.560 --> 47:53.400]  don't if it's not there with the guys in the white lab cuz that's what we're
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.560]  talking about with the hearings in North Carolina medical marijuana I'm just
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.520]  not going to entertain the idea they said that anything that hasn't come from
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.400]  a pharmaceutical company or been approved by the FDA can do anything well
[48:07.400 --> 48:10.760]  we know that there are plenty of natural ingredients out there and of course if
[48:10.760 --> 48:15.920]  you're going to use cow bile and garlic potion that's essentially trying to kill
[48:15.920 --> 48:19.240]  a bacteria that's there that's that's kind of the same approach that the
[48:19.240 --> 48:24.840]  pharmaceutical companies take which is to try to kill something that is a kill
[48:24.840 --> 48:28.400]  disease or stop disease after it's already started of course there's another
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.160]  way to deal with that that's the allopathic way to do it there's another
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.120]  way to do that and that is to build up your body's immune system to build up
[48:37.120 --> 48:42.360]  your body's cells it's defense system that's the that's what's behind most of
[48:42.360 --> 48:45.640]  the supplements that you take trying to get you as healthy as possible and
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.560]  that's the point about DNA force trying to give you the nutrients the
[48:50.560 --> 48:57.640]  nutraceuticals in a very high quality this is backed up by 175 studies Nobel
[48:57.640 --> 49:02.800]  prize-winning studies this is the thing that helps you to keep your cells
[49:02.800 --> 49:07.040]  healthy to deal with the toxins that you're going to come in contact with not
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.560]  necessarily trying to fix something after it's broken but trying to proactively
[49:11.560 --> 49:15.440]  help you to deal with things that's exactly what they're trying to sell us
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.600]  when they sell us vaccines the problem is that with the vaccines they're
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.760]  sticking in all kinds of toxins at that moment as well as adjuvants things to
[49:24.760 --> 49:29.040]  irritate your immune system because people's immune systems are typically so
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.600]  weakened by the toxins that they're already trying to deal with so the
[49:32.600 --> 49:37.240]  strategy that we try to take is to I think that's a much better strategy is
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.640]  to try to make your body as healthy as possible ahead of time so that can deal
[49:41.640 --> 49:45.320]  with these challenges as they come in because you can't filter everything out
[49:45.320 --> 49:49.680]  you can't stop everything that's going to come at you in the water in your food
[49:49.680 --> 49:53.640]  in the environment so the best thing you can do is to try to deal with that
[49:53.640 --> 49:56.960]  proactively but I think it's still interesting when we look at this
[49:56.960 --> 50:03.280]  Anglo-Saxon cow bile and garlic potion so many times people will dis disavow
[50:03.280 --> 50:08.440]  anything that doesn't come from the medical community and here's a thousand
[50:08.440 --> 50:14.280]  year old medieval remedy and we've been told many times that that natural
[50:14.280 --> 50:20.280]  ingredients like garlic are very potent for attacking a lot of different
[50:20.280 --> 50:24.720]  bacteria as well as viruses so I think that's a very interesting story
[50:24.720 --> 50:29.840]  surprised that there hasn't been more talk about that in the in the media but
[50:29.840 --> 50:33.840]  I guess they don't really want you to avoid the big pharmaceutical products
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.440]  again say one more time you get free shipping through Friday we're going to
[50:38.440 --> 50:42.920]  be right back and we're going to talk about how willing people are to follow
[50:42.920 --> 50:49.320]  authority especially when it comes from a computer many people will drive off of
[50:49.320 --> 50:51.720]  a bridge if the computer tells them to and we're going to talk about the
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.120]  implications of that and autonomous cars stay with us we'll be right back
[50:58.120 --> 51:02.400]  hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information I want to tell
[51:02.400 --> 51:06.560]  you about Matt Red Hawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[51:06.560 --> 51:10.480]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment frustrated
[51:10.480 --> 51:13.480]  with the direction this country was headed and the charlottes willing to
[51:13.480 --> 51:18.080]  sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots
[51:18.080 --> 51:22.720]  four Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted

[53:51.520 --> 54:11.200]  be part of your security solution be vigilant but not fearful fake TV.com
[54:11.200 --> 54:24.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show and April 1st 2015 I think this is an
[54:24.640 --> 54:30.520]  appropriate story for April 1st it's a tragic story I don't I mean it there's
[54:30.520 --> 54:36.960]  there's a lot that is funny and amusing about it but the problem is this this
[54:36.960 --> 54:42.880]  couple that drove off the bridge the wife died and the man is in serious
[54:42.880 --> 54:48.600]  condition and I'm not making fun of that but we need to think about the many
[54:48.600 --> 54:52.120]  times if you've heard your parents say well if Joe told you to do such and
[54:52.120 --> 54:55.680]  such I told you to jump off a bridge would you do it or to jump off the dock
[54:55.680 --> 55:02.560]  would you do it the computer told this couple in the car to jump off the bridge
[55:02.560 --> 55:08.720]  and they did it now they fell 38 feet the man survived but the wife did not very
[55:08.720 --> 55:14.120]  sad story but here's the thing about this because the GPS navigation was
[55:14.120 --> 55:18.040]  telling them to go down this road even though listen to why this was marked they
[55:18.040 --> 55:22.040]  said the Klein Avenue Bridge is marked with numerous barricades including
[55:22.040 --> 55:27.360]  orange barrels large wooden signs saying road closed with orange striped
[55:27.360 --> 55:33.160]  markings okay the barricades include orange barrels concrete barricades
[55:33.160 --> 55:37.960]  large wooden signs saying road closed still they go around all that why
[55:37.960 --> 55:43.120]  because the computer told them how willing we are and I've seen this many
[55:43.120 --> 55:48.600]  times before going back to the early days of computers if you could get a
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.160]  computer readout no matter how stupid your model was if you get somebody a
[55:52.160 --> 55:57.160]  computer readout and the bottom of it it gave you the some prediction or or
[55:57.160 --> 56:01.280]  told you what people would follow it because it came on a computer readout
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.880]  you know the number might have been 42 and I said oh that's the the meaning of
[56:05.880 --> 56:10.760]  the universe or whatever I you know garbage in garbage out if it's a bogus
[56:10.760 --> 56:14.480]  model and you get a print out that doesn't validate it and when I look at
[56:14.480 --> 56:18.880]  this I have to question whether or not we are going to turn over the steering
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.720]  wheel and the brakes to the Google car do you really trust Google and Apple to
[56:23.720 --> 56:28.680]  drive the car for you I've used their apps extensively I find them to be very
[56:28.680 --> 56:34.000]  helpful most of the time but I have also found them on occasion to be totally
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.720]  clueless dangerously clueless and I think that they're not ready for prime
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.880]  time but this is coming faster than you think if just a couple of months
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.520]  Tesla is going to be putting out their car that is going to drive without
[56:48.520 --> 56:56.120]  assistance between cities all they have to do they think is to connect the GPS
[56:56.120 --> 56:59.520]  navigation with all of these systems that are subsystems that are on the
[56:59.520 --> 57:02.960]  control the braking the steering the acceleration the cruise control as well
[57:02.960 --> 57:07.600]  as some radar detectors that are going to determine where the cars are in front
[57:07.600 --> 57:10.480]  and behind you cameras to see where the lanes are and they think they're done
[57:10.480 --> 57:16.240]  it's not going to be that simple but there's a whole world of tyranny that
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.680]  is coming with that that goes beyond the level of safety that we should be very
[57:20.680 --> 57:24.960]  concerned about look at this story out of Virginia they're using federally
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.960]  funded license plate readers to collect local taxes this is Newport News Virginia
[57:28.960 --> 57:31.960]  and they say the cameras will be mounted on the backs of six sheriff's
[57:31.960 --> 57:35.880]  department's cruisers to automatically read license plate numbers those numbers
[57:35.880 --> 57:40.400]  will be crossed search for the database updated daily at all the license plates
[57:40.400 --> 57:46.720]  in the city with more than $200 and personal property taxes owed see what
[57:46.720 --> 57:49.920]  they're going to wind up doing and we've already seen them come back to
[57:49.920 --> 57:53.720]  people that owe student loans I was just talking about what a mountain of debt
[57:53.720 --> 57:58.520]  students come out of college with with student loans and they're already in
[57:58.520 --> 58:01.560]  some communities they're going in and saying we're going to pull your license
[58:01.560 --> 58:05.160]  to for your profession if you're a doctor or your lawyer we're going to pull
[58:05.160 --> 58:10.840]  that license unless you pay off the student loan they will immobilize you
[58:10.840 --> 58:15.360]  they will essentially turn you into a debtors prison that's what we're going
[58:15.360 --> 58:18.400]  to wind up having a debtors prison without bars or you're not going to be
[58:18.400 --> 58:22.480]  able to drive to work you're not going to be able to practice they will use
[58:22.480 --> 58:27.520]  your automobile to basically put you under house arrest that's where this is
[58:27.520 --> 58:30.960]  all headed they've been putting speed control cameras in the UK they're coming
[58:30.960 --> 58:35.280]  here the United States as well that will automatically govern your car to the
[58:35.280 --> 58:39.680]  speed limit where you are stay with us we'll be right back

[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:16.000]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.080]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.560]  Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're gonna be talking to Steve
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.160]  quail in the next segment we're gonna talk to him about his take on Jade
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.440]  Helm what he's concerned about of course we played another possibility that's
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.640]  been brought to our attention by some veterans Paul Joseph Watson did a video
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.040]  on it we played that in the last half hour looking at the map rotating it a
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.920]  little bit you get a geographical alignment with Middle Eastern countries
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.360]  and the designation of friendly and hostile kind of roughly corresponds to
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.880]  that as well as the terrain that they would be seeing there so there's
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.160]  concern by many that this might be training for a Middle Eastern war that
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.600]  they've been chomping at the bits to get into for many years now as we have
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.400]  seen they had a agenda of seven countries and five years Wesley Clark
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.760]  talked about that and so are they going to finally be able to get on with that
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.040]  battle plan I don't know what Steve quails take is on this I make sure to
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.520]  hear what his take is we're concerned about the drills that they've been
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:32.920]  having for the American people going to war with the scenarios of internal
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.880]  martial law that's what I'm most concerned about but I'm concerned about
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.840]  us getting involved in yet another war as well I think we need to step back and
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  say what is the mission of the military what is the valid mission of the
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.600]  military are we going to increase our security by having a war throughout the
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.960]  Middle East are we going to increase our security by having a war with Russia
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.800]  over the Ukraine and we're going to talk about that in the third hour we're
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:02.920]  going to go over a video that was put out by the strat for organization
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.560]  actually was the president speaking at a conference talking about how the
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.120]  existential threat for Russia is the Ukraine and how the existential threat
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.480]  for us is to make sure that we keep a corridor between Germany and Russia and
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.920]  so we've got conflicting existential threats here don't we so we're going to
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.920]  talk about that as well as some other admissions that he made in that speech
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.080]  that are kind of interesting before we go to the segment with Steve Quildo I
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.600]  want to go over some of the news that's breaking that I think really illustrates
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.520]  the insanity of the war on drugs here we've got Kim calm and of course he's
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.680]  being accused not of dealing with drugs but of course they're coming after him
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.080]  with civil asset forfeiture which they created with the war on drugs he had
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.880]  metastasizes into different areas they're saying that he had videos and
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.040]  copyrighted material on his site and so they shut it down and they're coming
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.680]  after him they confiscated sixty seven million dollars worth of assets things
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.200]  like cash property luxury cars jet skis art the US government they say this is
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.280]  an article from Daily Mail one it's civil forfeiture case no one can talk
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.600]  about whether they won anything whether it's a case against Kim calm and
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.640]  Megala the Megala upload founder and he's lost 67 million dollars in assets as
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.720]  result he no longer they say owns these properties these luxury cars the US now
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.560]  owns more than a dozen bank accounts that he had in Hong Kong and New Zealand
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.440]  but this is what he said this is what Kim dot com said he said he indicated that
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.800]  his defeat represents the quote sad state of the US justice system I would
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:47.160]  agree because this is why he said by labeling me a fugitive the US court has
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.080]  allowed the US government to legally steal all of my assets without any trial
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.720]  without any due process without any of the tests of the merits the asset
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.760]  forfeiture was a default judgment they didn't win a case they didn't have a
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.640]  case they didn't take him to court all they said was we are going to take all
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.040]  of his property again this goes even further back this goes back to the
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.360]  RICO statutes of that were enacted during the Nixon administration to go
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.000]  after organized crime saying that we can't get convictions against these
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.960]  guys unless we steal all their assets because they'll be able to hire good
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.560]  lawyers once we allow that to happen once we broke that chain saying you have
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.920]  to find people guilty the penalty that you hit them with has to be proportional
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.720]  to the crime once we broke that then what we got from Ronald Reagan was civil

[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.160]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Deidre today we're going to go to
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.600]  Steve Bale in just a moment we're gonna talk to him about the Jade Helm exercise
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.880]  what he believes is behind this what's the purpose of it I'm very troubled just
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.760]  by the scale and scope of it by the actions that we've seen from our
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.920]  military one of the things I think got a lot of people scared was this
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.680]  nationwide emergency alert test that happened yesterday mainly on the East
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.240]  Coast this is an article that Paul Joseph Watson had up yesterday he said it
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.600]  began around 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time was broadcast in Washington DC
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.400]  Indiana Kentucky Maryland Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut New Jersey
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.080]  North Carolina South Carolina and Virginia it said that there was going to
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.680]  be an alert that would run from 11 a.m. until 12 midnight and the message was up
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.680]  for about 10 minutes at no point where the viewers advised that the alert was
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.000]  only a test the question is were they a day early on April fools or what I mean
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.480]  what what do we do with this government that is constantly doing these types of
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:20.800]  things are they trying to test our reaction to them is this a mistake are
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.320]  they just totally incompetent is it all of the above I don't know he points out
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.400]  that of course last October we had another very suspicious emergency alert
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.200]  from the White House interrupted TV viewers across America and told them to
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.880]  stand by tune into their phone now they blame that one that was AT&T they said
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.720]  that was some nationally syndicated radio station that sent out the alert
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.760]  message by mistake maybe that was he says despite the fact that only the
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.440]  federal government can send out EAS alerts the alert system can only be
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.560]  activated by the president in times of an emergency reported Fox 5 so this is a
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.920]  second time we've seen this last time was October so that's what about six
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.440]  months they're putting out these nationwide alerts alerts that there's
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.880]  an emergency coming up and nothing that says that it was a test we're all
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.480]  familiar with that you know this is just a test if it had been an actual
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.640]  emergency they don't do that anymore either constantly keeping the American
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.000]  people in a state of questioning what is real and what isn't that is part of a
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.160]  massive siob if nothing else and you know though we've got a special here at

[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.800]  quail now as Steve was one of the original founders of the prep movement
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.520]  he's been a talk who talk radio host for 20 years he was a lone voice 20 years
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.080]  ago saying that the Chinese and Russians would ultimately back their
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.920]  currencies with gold that they would want to cash these in on something
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.120]  besides the petrodollar he's the author of 10 books his most recent entitled
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.480]  xenogenesis turning men into monsters he wrote breathe no evil 15 years ago on
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.360]  understanding bio weapons before anyone thought is a problem I wonder what he
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.480]  thinks about what's going on in Tulane with this Bercold area pseudomaliotic
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:50.200]  but got out of the lab and they still don't know how it got out may we'll
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.680]  talk to him about that but primarily I want to talk to him about Jade Helm
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.440]  joining us now is Steve quail thank you Steve
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.880]  Wow David good dig it's really nice to be on with you because Jade Helm I think
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.720]  needs to be put in the larger context this is the first time in history that a
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:12.280]  two-month-long operation is going to be focusing on the American public we know
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.120]  that the same tactics that are being proposed for the exercise to take place
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.440]  between the hours of midnight and four or five in the morning is exactly what the
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.920]  special operations troops did prior to the bombing of Iraq and all of our
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.280]  different Middle Eastern ventures whether it's Afghanistan in other words you
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.040]  move the special operations community in prior to an event now remember I want to
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:39.080]  take everybody back to Larry great wall in his book no place to hide if people
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:44.080]  remember he was the one that penetrated the weather underground when Bill Ayers
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:49.920]  and 25 other actually 24 other elite from Ivy League trained schools were
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.200]  talking about the necessity in the early 70s a killing 25 million Americans and
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:01.200]  prior to the killing of them moving them into detention camps for reeducation
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.400]  now I know David that you've read his stuff but here's the larger context I
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.520]  think that people are being tied up with the how do I say the events or the
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.120]  implementation of how they're going to round up people and kill them and they're
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.520]  forgetting the idea that when Bill Ayers was making this comment he was deadly
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.080]  serious now I've just taken the population density at that point in
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.120]  history moved it into our point in history and the numbers I've heard from
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.520]  special operations active duty generals in the past contemporary military and
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.360]  intelligence agents is there up to 80 million to a hundred million people so
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.760]  I think if people put it in a context notice a change notice a change when
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:51.440]  Middle East terrorists became obviously in embraced by this administration now
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.080]  that's the context I think that people have got to understand that context David
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.720]  because what we're talking about is not an exercise when the local police are
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.680]  told to stand down and not respond to gunfire by the way it's a live fire
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.960]  exercise when we've seen massive YouTube videos you guys at info wars.com have
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.760]  led the charge in showing all the videos coming into you from all over the
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.960]  country people are now starting to get it and the point that I want to really
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.000]  get across everyone today and thank you for taking this hour out of your time
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.360]  to interview me is this this is the full-scale implementation of the red the
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.440]  blue and the green list the red list are people now do you remember David I'll
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.160]  let you obviously respond because that's just my intro that day days years ago
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:43.960]  when our gun owners homes are being GPS'd oh yeah absolutely and we warned
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.360]  we warned about that and and we tried to get people to understand I was
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.680]  literally in my front yard in a oh good night right at a mountain community at
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.240]  the base of the mountains in boson Montana when the guy came up with his
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.880]  GPS unit and his bicycle and came literally to my front door and I watched
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.760]  the reason I didn't challenge him at the time I wanted to see to the left of me
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.360]  were leftist to the right of me were leftist and I wanted to see if they even
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.760]  got GPS absolutely not okay so I watched this is not a report well we heard
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.560]  massive reports of that happening and the deal that people have got to
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.520]  understand is this that with the implementation of the red list the
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.880]  blue list and green list that was the given to me almost 20 years ago actually
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:35.000]  before that about how it would be implemented in when they were ready to
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.960]  make their move by the former head of the environmental protection agency who
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.400]  was murdered for the western United States so that wasn't just quote internet
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.520]  talk and obviously that at that point the internet was just in its beginnings but
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.840]  I think it's important that people have got to understand that this explains
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.920]  everything it explains the Chinese it explains the Russians it explains the
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:02.400]  North Koreans and it explains the the assault coming on the United States from
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.920]  Mexico remember when we broke the story I think Alex had me on to talk about the
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.600]  Chinese troops you guys verified it below the borders yes and then and then
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.040]  the thing that people have got to understand is that this is this is the
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.680]  plan so when I say don't lose track of it in in perspective I want to just make
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.000]  one sentence so I'll give it back to you in no place to hide I call them great
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.200]  wall maybe it's graph wall explains that the weathermen actually believe that
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.440]  they would be successful in overthrowing US government and that with the help of
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:39.920]  the Cubans Chinese Russians and North Vietnamese they would occupy America now
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.480]  remember this during the Vietnam War Americans would have to be reeducating
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.200]  camps over to what communists in Vietnam Cambodia Laos and other countries
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.360]  that they'd taken over and then here's one of the most chilling revelations I
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.840]  asked well what great wall speaking well what is going to happen to those
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.880]  people we can't be educated that are diehard capitalist and reply is they'd
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:04.160]  have to be eliminated so David that's the context of what we see the American
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.360]  people as Alex has pointed out as you pointed out as the you know going on day
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.160]  after day hours after hours have become the enemy and now in the face of
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.360]  basically nuclear tension and for the record I used to write about nuclear
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.920]  weapons and their effects and during the Cold War years of you know and and as
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.240]  civil defense and all that stuff so as I look back on the perspective we have
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:35.520]  seen the absolute taking a part of our military our top of flag officers and
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.120]  generals fired any battlefield experience and we've seen complete
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:46.560]  redirection of funds from foreign enemies to the internal enemies and
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.040]  I've read on the air the letter that was sent in those days by I believe it was
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.520]  that it was either Janet Reno or Napolitano to the Russians requesting
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.720]  their help and the foreign troops so you can't deny it any longer people used to
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.120]  poopoo black helicopters they used to poopoo Russian troops Chinese troops
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.960]  well I think exactly we've had the we've had the the article we put up over the
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:13.840]  weekend that Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones put together listing all the
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:17.520]  many times that they have defined who their domestic enemies are it's not
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.800]  just what Larry Graff will say we've been seeing this coming from the
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.680]  administration we've been seeing it coming out of the military academies
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.720]  and other think tanks that are associated with the military we saw it
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.920]  coming out of the Mayak report when they define what their enemy is when they
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.640]  come in and do things like the NDAA and then they start having these training
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.240]  exercises like we saw in Fort Lauderdale where it looks like they are actually
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:41.640]  implementing the NDAA dragging people who are civilians down the street taking
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.320]  them off in helicopters marching them in single file with military guards on
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.120]  either side putting them into white vans and driving them off I mean that's
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:53.840]  exactly what we were would expect to see if they implement the NDAA but of
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:57.560]  course they told us don't worry we're not actually going to do that I don't
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.960]  believe that they're not actually going to do it I don't know when they're
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.080]  going to do it but of course as many people have pointed out whenever there's
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.000]  been a massive false flag attack or what if they've had a drill that's going on
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.960]  exactly at the same time in the same way we saw this with the 7-7 bombings in
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.040]  London and the subway bombings these people came back the day or so after and
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.880]  said well isn't this amazing you know we were running a drill in exactly the
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.480]  same place with exactly the same scenario at the same time this was
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.320]  happening it happened with 9-11 they can always use that to keep the people
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.520]  who are compartmentalized to not understand what's going on and then the
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.920]  mass public looks at this and says well yeah this came out after the fact but
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.640]  when we expose it before the fact maybe this particular time this won't happen
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.800]  maybe they will just do some kind of a training exercise but we always need to
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.680]  be on the alert stay with us are going to take a quick break and we'll come right
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.160]  back to you Steve Quayle we're talking about Operation Jade Helm and Steve is

[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.560]  quail and Steve you were talking about the the fact that you're concerned that
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.600]  this is coming to the next step coming to fruition in terms of a war against the
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.440]  American people talking about Larry Graff well you're talking about the red
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:31.080]  list the blue list and the green list break that down for the audience the
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.720]  red list are the primary target for the New World Order in the United States of
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.640]  America when the order is given the list already exists and again according to
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.800]  and I'm I want to make this clear I cannot know this stuff and less people
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.800]  tell me just like Alex gets tips you get tips David there are people out there
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:55.200]  that genuinely love their country so that's how I got this a red list are
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.240]  primarily firearms owners they are constitutionalist they are people who
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.240]  have been politically active in resisting the New World Order and those
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.200]  are the people that are their targets and let me make this clear they're not
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:13.680]  coming to take the guns away they're coming to it terminate exterminate
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:19.360]  blow away the gun owners again special operations teams are not sent in to take
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.560]  prisoners unless it's a high-value target for later date they basically are
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:30.080]  are trained to go in and just obliterate okay now again when I get told this by a
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:35.600]  four-star general active duty and by the way you guys have more probably active
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:41.920]  duty spec ops and spooks in Austin than any other city in the United States of
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.160]  America you probably know that if you don't I will tell you that and the thing
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.200]  that's fascinating to me David is a red list basically goes down the first 30
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.400]  days okay so let's say they've increased it to 60 days well things they're
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:01.280]  combining now two different events now the system that's been set to communicate
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.840]  with law enforcement from the Department of Homeland Security is a pretty
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.760]  secure system now they can lock out individual officers from being able to
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.680]  hear the general alerts they can punish or they can terminate now these are
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:20.240]  really hard statements for people to understand quick anecdote 32nd version
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.840]  chief of detectives in a major metropolitan city heard me on I think
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.560]  it was one of the interviews Alex and I were doing a couple years ago he didn't
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.680]  think I was basically up front with the information until a foreign observer was
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.840]  assigned I told him what to look for the foreign observer knew everything about
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.880]  he his family his children went they went to school how much money he made he
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:51.280]  knew everything and he rode along in the back of two detectives cars and the
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.200]  interesting thing was is I got a call from the individual probably a week later
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.080]  and he said it's you're right this is going down just exactly as you said well
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.480]  I wasn't at the originator of that the blue list our law enforcement National
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.720]  Guard and anybody who's contributing to the execution and the takedown of the
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:16.640]  red list 30 days to 60 days after that those guys get wasted now again well I
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.720]  don't know what word you would use David but they're they're murdered they're
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:24.280]  killed yeah where have we seen that in history before go ahead oh yeah that the
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:30.480]  the Navy SEALs that got been one right yeah you got it and so as a matter of
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.960]  fact before we went on this show I was contacted by a Navy SEAL overseas and he
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.480]  said Steve I cannot believe what's happening to the country I love and was
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.840]  ready to lay down my life for he said it's like a Paul if you will a blanket
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.440]  of darkness has settled over the country and people can't see what's happened
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.880]  David is one of the things that I've really tried to do and talk radio and
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.520]  all the stuff I've written in the interviews I've done 9,000 plus hours
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:03.720]  is to get people to understand you've got to understand the root of evil because
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.480]  everything else is an offshoot of evil may I speak oh I'll give you one more
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.040]  interview that took place recently with a personal friend of mine no one to me
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:19.680]  who met with various generals retired and what they told him was simply this is
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.840]  that it is going operational now this is generals this isn't make-believe this
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.280]  isn't scuttle but this is an internet rumor okay and the gentlemen just
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.520]  happened to be at the top of their hit list we're gonna go to break Steve
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:36.160]  hang on we're gonna go right back and you know quite frankly it's kind of like
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.160]  the couple that drove the car off the GPS bridge how many signs do we need
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.120]  before we start to pay attention if it isn't happening now it's gonna be

[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:24.360]  I'm David Knight your host we're talking to Steve quail Steve quail.com we're
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:28.080]  breaking down Steve was breaking down for us the red list the blue list we
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.520]  haven't gotten to the green list yet but Steve just before we had to go to the
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:35.400]  break you started talking about a source that you had and who thought this was
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.080]  going to be operational tell us what he said start that over again for people who
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:45.080]  who are just tuning in former green beret had a meeting with retired
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:51.800]  generals and high-ranking enlisted former enlisted men who were very concerned
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.480]  because the friend of mine that had had the meeting was asked come the meeting
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.920]  because supposedly there was a pentagon memorandum put out about some of the
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:07.560]  people in this country that they are forbidden to listen to he happened to be
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:11.200]  one of them Alex happened to be one of them I happen to be one of them
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:14.480]  Hock happened to be one of them and Doug Hagman happened to be one there are two
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.200]  other guys that he couldn't remember their name one on the east coast one on
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.040]  the west coast and I don't know what I tell it here's the issue the issue is
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:29.040]  David that the American people must understand that the sheer placement of
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:35.040]  the tanks your personal carriers troops on the streets and everything else is
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.720]  indicative now let's talk about jade helm the name I do that simply are the
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.840]  people that they go into reeducation and are assimilated they get to live but
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.880]  they get to live as perpetual drones or techno surfs at the behest of the New
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:56.080]  World Order the thing that is really critical for people to understand is
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:02.080]  is that jade helm's name jade is always associated with China it has nothing to
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:06.440]  do primarily with the Middle East it has everything to with the Faris if I tell
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.760]  you the captain's at the helm that means he's steering the ship that means that
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.720]  he is the one who's in charge the direction one of the Chinese demands
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:21.160]  upon the United States government was the fact that they needed to disarm the
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:25.040]  American public you remember that story when it came out that China absolutely
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.640]  demanded that the American public be disarmed yeah remember that was kind of
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.600]  strange wasn't it yeah there's always something behind that it's kind of like
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.120]  when the UN came out and said you need to shut down Colorado and Washington state
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.760]  the federal government needs to shut that down because we have a UN drug
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.840]  treaty and of course it was a UN that set up the schedule for the war on drugs
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.560]  ten years before Nixon declared the war on drugs right yeah well what's
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:52.120]  important is is everything's in her name now look it's not it's not lost in the
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.800]  financial markets that that China has amassed the world's largest gold hoard
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.240]  and this has everything to do with the name jade helm 15 obviously 15 can
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.160]  relate to the year that it's going to be implemented as in this year China is
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.200]  going to make an announcement at some point and we're seeing with the AIIB
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:16.320]  bank we're seeing it with the nation's abandoning former allies it doesn't
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.400]  matter if it's Australia doesn't matter if it's a Britain it doesn't matter who
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:25.640]  it is everyone's going to China because basically it's a truism a maxism in the
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.960]  world that he who has the gold makes the rules one of the things the bankers
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:36.480]  have been able to do is to transfer the gold that was in the United States it's
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.760]  irrelevant if there's anything in Fort Knox I'm here to tell you that there's
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:45.600]  nothing there the point being is is that China with its 30,000 plus tons of gold
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.960]  by the way the World Gold Council is totally inaccurate in the country's
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:55.360]  gold holdings just opted if they're wrong Russia for instance has right now
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:02.040]  in excess of 10 to 15,000 tons of gold so the point is let me make this clear
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:09.240]  Jade Helm may be the orchestration and the introduction of the Chinese Yuan or
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:14.440]  Rememby in a gold-backed or commodity-backed form at that point the
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:19.760]  dollar will lose value almost overnight if not become worthless my guess is just
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.720]  quick and dirty it goes down 50% a matter of days and then another 30% well
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.440]  that's not going to make anybody happy in the United States the point being is
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.240]  that the riots will be generated now here's something people need to do go
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.240]  to the root of the problem you understand the fruit and how will be
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.960]  implemented in order for the communist revolution to take place they want to
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.600]  engender civil war I've been saying that Alex has been saying that and by the way
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.080]  obviously with the Mayak report and others when the veterans were vilified
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.480]  any man or woman who has served in this country any official capacity had to
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.960]  note that this man's military guess I and I've never been the military but
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.000]  that's what a lot of them call it has changed so dramatically and it's
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.320]  fascinating to me that even yesterday or the day before I may be off the day but
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.680]  the president of the United States has now declared they want to cut back the
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.880]  military pensions at the same time there's unlimited amounts of money to
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.760]  purchase billions of rounds of ammo MRAPS the police department who have been
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.880]  militarized you know so I think it's saying you know we're talking about that
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.800]  Steve I think it's very interesting that it was just last summer that the
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.080]  Pentagon announced that they were going to stop giving equipment to fire
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.800]  departments this is something that they have been doing since the right after
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.600]  World War two giving equipment to small rural fire departments because they can
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.400]  afford very much and they're the ones who have to deal with the really large
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.000]  fires and so they shut that down and stayed shut down for about a month but
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.880]  there was a lot of pressure from the firemen from congressmen and senators
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.400]  they got that restarted but that was happening at the very same time they
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.920]  couldn't get enough equipment quickly enough into all these small towns for
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.080]  law enforcement they would only wanted to give equipment to people who had the
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.840]  power and the authority to arrest that was going to be what they were going to
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:13.960]  do it for not to the fire departments they wanted to completely shut that down
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:20.160]  well and you're correct so the point is is that in essence all the fire
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.880]  departments any authority figures that with the power arrest and by the way
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.600]  everybody as you know has been given the power to rest now from IRS agents to
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.520]  remember when they forest service Rangers never wore weapons I can tell you
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.880]  from watching them I take a lot of photographs and you know in the national
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.760]  parks and now you would swear that you would declare freely you can't believe
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:49.040]  how weighted down those guys are with weapons in their car or AR-15s and
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.720]  shotguns and of course you shouldn't worry about the fact that they got
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:56.840]  billions of rounds of hollow point bullets which the military doesn't even
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.400]  use you shouldn't even worry about that as we got all the pushback they would
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.920]  look at the small purchases for some of these organizations say well that's just
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.160]  for target shooting but it's three billion they would take the very smallest
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.800]  ones and they would push back against that but we won that fight and I guess
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.400]  Steve the question is we also had this fight about a year ago with them trying
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.800]  to start the war in Syria with a false flag Sarin gas attack trying to blame
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.600]  that on the appropriate parties so they could use that as a pretext for war do
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:27.040]  you think that because this has been exposed has gone viral and there's so
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.960]  much talk about it do you think that they will just stand this down and it'll
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.080]  just be a training exercise not to say that they won't do this in the future
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.320]  but don't you think that that that the very publicity that has come there might
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:42.080]  make them to stand down on this for the time being that's what I'm praying for
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:48.240]  literally okay and I literally am asking the prayerful believing Christians
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:52.680]  around the world to pray against us because again it's kind of like when
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:57.960]  went in even the Old Testament times David when you know that the idea or the
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:03.480]  plan to murder all of God's people that you know was taking place got raised up
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:07.320]  somebody whether it was a property Elijah who could read the king's thoughts
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.800]  while he slept on his bed I think that when a a at least a covert operation
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:18.120]  gets exposed that they have to rethink and let me share this these guys have
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:24.160]  supercomputers calculating every single step and every single response they
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:30.120]  have algorithms when I broke the story about algorithms the mathematical if you
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.960]  will structuring of specific if you will assassination parameters and rating
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.280]  people on a different scale they have their targets already gridded out it is
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.480]  my prayer it is my concern that enough people scream about this that enough
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:52.240]  people go to the congressman because I posted a couple weeks ago do you remember
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.200]  the old mini series America remember that the scene it where the Russians
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:02.360]  come in under the guise of being quote national terrorists and kill all a
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:07.000]  Congress yeah and the Russian is addressing well is it interesting that
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.080]  what was it the senator from South Carolina made the statement that you
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:15.680]  know Obama should have the right to basically do away with Congress you
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.080]  remember that oh yeah yeah well effectively he has hasn't a I mean he
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.920]  pretty much does whatever he wishes he's not constrained by the Constitution by
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.160]  laws he's not constrained by Congress or their threats I mean they're they're
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:32.000]  saying now you know he wants to do he wants to implement the UN's climate
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  change treaty just by executive order and the Republicans are saying well you
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.840]  know all these countries need to realize that we just may undo that they
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.400]  know they're not gonna undo anything these guys are not doing anything you
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.800]  know this is something critical there and please understand the root is what
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.960]  I'm talking about if people will go on my website and go to my alert section I
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.920]  just posted this as Nico was giving me the countdown for the break and I didn't
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:01.080]  know this I'm not a video gamer but are you familiar with the oblo three no the
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:08.120]  oblo three the main character the witch doctor is Jade Helm okay and I want to
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:13.120]  read this because again this is this has this even Alex is talking more and
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.000]  more when I say even Alex as Alex is talking more and more about the
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.960]  demonic manifestation the supernatural element people have got to read this it's
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.960]  on my website Steve quail.com go over on the right it's the Q alert big Q and it
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.200]  says alerts I was blown away by there's some lady named Jean sent it to me and
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.480]  I want to read this to you because it did and it's just a quick paragraph you
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.200]  know it says the witch doctor that's what who's the witch doctor is a character
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.720]  that uses the Jade Helm again from their website he weaves the power of the
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:49.000]  spirits of the unformed land summoning creatures from beyond the grave he
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.960]  summons frightful undead vermin and other creatures for protection and
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.600]  offense uses destructive poisons acids fire attacks power spells and summons
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:03.840]  with mana a slow accruing but deep well of energy the witch doctors make use of
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.400]  a variety of weaponry I think that the critical thing that people have to send
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.880]  you under you brought up Syria here it is in context if people can understand
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.960]  this simple concept everything excuse me makes sense number one in order for the
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:25.080]  Mahdi to come on the scene that is obviously the Islamic savior that is
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:31.200]  obviously the reign and rule of Muhammad on earth there has to be a global
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:37.040]  nuclear conflagration are you aware of that no no I wasn't aware that yeah go
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:42.120]  ahead so and so and please I only asked that basically to allow you to feed back
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.120]  because I don't want to dominate but I think we only got an hour the thing is
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:50.320]  that we are now seeing the disruption of all the countries in the Middle East
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:55.440]  well classical Christian dispensationalism always said the 10 nations
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.600]  were the holy Roman Empire I said you know decades ago this is only to put it
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.840]  into perspective that I saw a 10 nation Federation building and coming to being
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.920]  coming into being in the Middle East now you've got the whole Middle East on fire
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:16.120]  you've got basically the ultimate betrayal of Israel by the United States
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:21.240]  now whether people like Israel don't like them the point being is in the Old
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.920]  Testament prophecies of Zachariah it says all the nations of the world will
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.240]  gather against Jerusalem that's happening that yeah I think I think you're
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.120]  very right you know what we need to be what we need to hope for is that by
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.520]  exposing this we are going to shut it down at least this time perhaps they'll
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:41.000]  decide that maybe they'll just do this exercise on an annual basis and maybe by
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.600]  Jade Helm 17 they'll actually roll it out but I think you're right when you
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:49.640]  said earlier we need to pray about this we need to ask that this would not
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.960]  happen that we would have peace not only in our country but in these other
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.200]  countries and and you know I should have mentioned it earlier to you know Alex
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:01.000]  is having a hernia operation today I'd ask people to pray for Alex pray that
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.400]  he would have a successful outcome there wouldn't be any complications that he
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.680]  would be at peace with this and have a quick recovery so I'd ask for people's
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:14.120]  prayers about that and he gave me this before he left he said that he's going
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:18.000]  to be running a I just want to mention this quickly a free shipping special it's
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.400]  there April Fool's special but there's no fooling we do have free shipping
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:26.160]  through Wednesday and this is the last chance this is the last day to get DNA
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:29.760]  force he had that expiring at the end of March but he's run it for one more day
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:34.400]  you can get that for 30% off it's about $40 off of those ingredients of course
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.680]  you need to have clear minds and healthy bodies to fight tyranny and we have
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.280]  Nobel Prize winning studies that confirm that the ingredients in this DNA
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.160]  force will help your body it's mitochondrial health will help it to fight
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.520]  the toxins that you're constantly exposed to so again that's 30% off the
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.520]  very last day DNA force and you can get free shipping on everything at the store
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:02.360]  no fooling now Steve as you were pointing out I think it's very interesting to
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.680]  look at these this enemies list that they have and the fact that you know the
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.840]  connection that the Chinese government is starting this Asian investment bank
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.440]  and that is really taking off I mean that's turning into an avalanche of
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.040]  people who are signing up for that and of course the the Chinese are flush with
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.040]  cash they're using this in a very different way than we have used the
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.560]  IMF fund but even the United States is trying to get on this just so that they
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:33.720]  won't be left off we see a massive shift from the United States of course to
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.040]  China but that isn't that's been going on for quite some time everybody can see
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.440]  that but it's really accelerating at this point isn't it it well it's not
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:45.440]  only accelerating but you know somebody said what's in a name my answer to that
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:52.440]  is everything when any operation is chosen there is usually a reason for the
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:56.760]  name being chosen and that's why I believe that Jane Helm is so critical
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.440]  let me make this clear and this is something that I you know I stand on
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:05.960]  after 10 or 12 books I think I'm up to 12 now thanks for announcing that but the
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:11.360]  point that I'm trying to provide for people is a perspective how to embrace
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.160]  this because if you try and David you'll find this out if you try and look at
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:22.240]  this purely in the natural there is a if you cannot look at it purely in the
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:26.520]  natural because it's like a and I'm gonna use the word supernatural evil force
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:31.280]  that see me seeking to subject and subjugate the people the world not
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.760]  only kill them look the Illuminati Alex yeah this multi-generational as well I
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:38.480]  mean that's something that we see this this relentless progression towards this
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.480]  and it's like why would the people care so much to pass on a pass on an agenda
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.240]  from one generation to the other we think each generation would have its own
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.560]  agenda but as you point out this is a supernatural backing behind this that's
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:56.800]  I think why this continues along this same path of progression from generation
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:02.880]  to generation well and again that's why you know that's why I'm accelerating I'm
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.960]  accelerating my efforts look I don't know how long I have by the grace of God I
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.400]  thank everyone for their prayers and I do pray for Alex thank God our hernia I
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.880]  had an operation years ago hernia operation and you know but they done
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:17.880]  and when they do them right you're on your feet pretty quick you know you
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:22.440]  heard a little bit but may my prayers go with him and I thank God for everyone
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.240]  who prays for Alex's safety and the protection around his family but I want
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.000]  to share something David this is important because in less and I want to
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.720]  say this if this were my last time on talk radio I would say what I'm gonna say
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.960]  right now unless people understand the supernatural root of evil they will not
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:46.440]  understand that when the Illuminati talks in the Georgia guide stones about
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:50.880]  500 million people being left Alex and I did a show where we quoted every you
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:56.640]  know person of power and how they hate humanity the vaccines it was on info
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.760]  wars.com when we were going to have this level five biological shutdown of the
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:07.080]  country Alex let me pray at that point and and and I said the only thing I got
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.160]  from the Lord was watch what I will do within 24 hours we are going from a
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.520]  global pandemic shutdown and martial law to the thing fading out and fizzling
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.040]  out when we start exposing Ebola the thing faded out and fizzled out not to
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:25.040]  say it won't come back you know the point being it when you hear of almost
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.000]  ridiculous releases of some of the most deadly pathogens in the world my rope
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.360]  breathing though evil 15 years ago the point is that I know I know I know how
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:39.040]  these people think because again there is a God in heaven who reveals the
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:43.280]  secrets to his servants the prophets prop I'm not a prophet all I am is a
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.920]  watchman now one of the hang on Steve we got to go to a commercial break when we

[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:23.080]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and Austin and we're talking to
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.160]  Steve Quill we've been talking about Jade Helm and Steve's pulled us back to
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:31.880]  talk about the broader context and Steve I want to talk about your book here
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:37.680]  Xenogenesis turning men into monsters you'd also talked about you also had a
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.560]  book breathe no evil where you were talking about bio weapons and we've
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.920]  just seen gotten a glimpse into the massive if you want to call it
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:51.200]  incompetence of the CDC and these biotech companies who are bringing foreign
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.400]  pathogens very deadly pathogens into this country we just saw an example of it
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:01.240]  in Tulane to give them a gain of function that's what they call it enhancing
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:06.120]  them to withstand medication to also spread more easily and so we have to
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:10.640]  look at this and say what is the madness behind this why would they even get
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:14.720]  themselves involved in something like this but break break down your other book
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:19.400]  Xenogenesis turning men into monsters well Xenogenesis is important for
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:24.080]  people understand because behind the intentional release of bio weapons
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:30.440]  remember this that when people are being exposed to headlines that there's been a
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.800]  strange release or that the CDC that thought Center for Disease Control thought
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:40.480]  that the last remaining supplies of smallpox always mysteriously turn up
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:49.480]  every pathogen worldwide that has been located isolated or reanimated is
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:53.960]  designed for bioweapons the basis of all bioweapons is ultimately first to kill
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.920]  the enemy but ultimately to end all life when I broke the story David 32nd
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:03.480]  important story on race specific bio weapons in South Africa designed by
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.880]  Dr. Wouter Bason that that went wild throughout the world there was
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:13.640]  absolutely a project called Project Coast give it to give it a more impetus
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:18.320]  when Alex and I or whoever talks about singularity that talks about
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.160]  transhumanism that talks about all of the different technological enhancements
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:28.960]  to mankind super soldiers this is stuff that I wrote in my book Xenogenesis what
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:35.360]  they're doing is taking third-party DNA sequences and Xenogenesis just means the
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:40.880]  addition of additional additional helix to the double helix creating a triple
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:45.840]  helix in other words a stand and creating literally new life forms now
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:51.280]  when I first wrote that in genetic arm again 15 years ago people just couldn't
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.560]  handle it but now we're right there where guess what the lie that people are
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.400]  being told is biological enhancements are one thing but when you combine them
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:06.320]  with robotics you're going to get a basically an uberman which Nietzsche
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:10.480]  talked about and and which the Nazis were absolutely looking for the word
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:14.560]  ubermensch literally means Superman so when DARPA went forward with its
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:19.480]  super soldier program and basically started integrating a specific gene
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:25.120]  traits from animals IE ego vision IE regenerative processes of a salamander
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:30.040]  IE all of the different things you know it's just like it's just like this was a
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:37.640]  comic book series coming out in the real real bad time and again because I've
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:41.040]  been so far ahead it's just like this ladies and gentlemen the bottom line I
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.880]  used to say that all the time David and people you send me email don't use that
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.240]  you're over you know the bottom line means when you cut through all the crap
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:53.920]  when you cut through all the haze all the fog and all of the misdirection the
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:57.440]  bottom line is there is a supernatural force called the devil which the
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.520]  Luciferians worship that are trying to kill off every man woman and child and
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:05.360]  what they're promising is eternal life and they're promising supernatural and
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:10.120]  the ability to basically live forever and have to deal with nothing with
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.160]  super intelligence it's kind of like ample it's kind of like animal farm on
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:20.360]  steroids absolutely well actually see this is kind of like a Genesis the
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.560]  serpent promise that with this knowledge you're going to be able to live
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:28.780]  forever you know you're gonna ever die thank you so much for joining us at

[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:26.960]  Alex Jones welcome out to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight it's a pretty
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:31.680]  heavy discussion we just had with Steve Quayle talking about Jade Helm I hope
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:38.600]  that the and he as well hopes that and we pray that this exposure will keep this
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:42.720]  from actually going into effect any kind of martial law this particular time I
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:46.400]  think with the publicity I don't think that they will do that I think that they
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:50.880]  will wait until we get accustomed to it this is a gradual rollout of things
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:56.040]  think about if you were just to go back five years ago and just make the leap
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.600]  without hearing any of this without seeing any of the intervening steps if
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:05.560]  you were to just to go back to 2010 even and then drop into today and and look at
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:09.160]  the wars that we have going on look at the training that we have going on look
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.440]  at the facilities that they have within their bases the scenarios that they've
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.960]  done would you have believed any of this ten years ago you wouldn't have
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:21.760]  believed the NSA most of the people we have been talking about drag net
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:24.080]  surveillance we've been talking about what the government has been doing for a
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.400]  long time here at info wars but most people before Snowden would not believe
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.520]  that they would just dismiss that as a paranoid conspiracy theory no matter
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:37.320]  that we had NSA whistleblowers going back to right after September 11th
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:42.760]  people like William Benny and others who had pointed out that they had basically
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:46.920]  just slipped the bonds of the Constitution and we're going to do
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:52.840]  whatever they wished and of course we had Michael Hayden brag about the fact at
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:57.880]  a university brag about the fact that he didn't get his authorization to do this
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.760]  from the section in a new law he got his orders straight from the president well
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:08.640]  you know you have orders from the Constitution that go even above the
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.320]  president the president and all of the rest of them down taken oath to the
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:18.440]  Constitution that's the legitimate king of this country Lex Rex the law is king
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:24.040]  they swear allegiance to it they are simply temporary stewards but they're
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.560]  acting and they're taking the position that they are now dictators that's what
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.720]  we continually see with the arrogance of Obama talking about the fact that he's
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:34.840]  going to implement climate change is the next thing he's going to do by
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.240]  executive order and nobody can stop him and you know what the Republicans will
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:43.520]  not stop him they could care less about doing that now we also see that I as I
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.360]  said the other day I think there's a huge fight at the state level to shut
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.480]  this down from the outside just as we have to expose these operations that are
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:57.240]  going on and it's great that this has gone viral I think we need to expose
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:01.240]  all of these operations and shut them down at the state level shut them down
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:06.240]  with jury nullification not just state legislators nullifying the laws but we
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.360]  do have some really bad laws being proposed by state legislatures as well
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:13.800]  so it's a it's a fight there's good stuff coming out there's bad stuff coming out
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:18.120]  out of Washington it's nothing but bad news but in Texas we've got this
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:22.520]  representative Jason Vallalba his Republican from Dallas and of course
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.960]  he's a guy who has proposed mandatory psych evaluations for students in
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:34.360]  school and he has also proposed shutting down and penalizing filming cops but
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:38.560]  now we have an article that came out just last night largest Texas police
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:43.960]  union comes out in opposition to the bill that would restrict filming cops now
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:49.080]  they point out that the representative has even described it himself as
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.360]  targeting independent bloggers who are focused on keeping law enforcement
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:58.840]  accountable and that was this quote that I'm not I'm not this is not a
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.200]  characterization from the article he says we want to target quote independent
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.920]  bloggers who are focused on keeping law enforcement accountable why would you
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.800]  want to target somebody who is focused on keeping law enforcement accountable
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.840]  why would you do that okay then I go on to say that although this was set for
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:20.080]  hearing tomorrow it's been withdrawn from a committee agenda as Vallalba
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:23.760]  claims that it is being amended the claim was called into question by
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:26.960]  Charlie Wilkerson executive director of the combined law enforcement
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.600]  associations who told NBC that he's under the impression that the bill will be
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:37.160]  pulled permanently let's hope so but what he's trying to do as an excuse is
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.320]  he's not saying that he's pulling this from pressure being put on by people who
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:44.600]  want to hold law enforcement and people like him accountable that's who you
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:48.320]  really need to hold accountable the Texas law enforcement doesn't want it but
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.800]  he says he's pulling it because he can't write a bill we'll see what happens
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:56.000]  stay with us we're gonna be talking to Joe Biggs about what's going on in the

[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:16.120]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:25.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're joined in this
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.720]  segment with Joe Biggs we're going to talk about what's going on in the Ukraine
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:34.280]  and essentially the strat for presidents take on this but of course
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:40.360]  today is April 1st April Fool's Day and as they point out in California it's no
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:46.200]  joke April 1st is going to bring double digit sales tax to several towns in
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.440]  California some of them are going to get 10% or more and of course I remember
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:53.280]  when they would always increase the sales tax they would always say well
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:58.000]  it's only a penny you know it's not a penny let's say if you got a you got a
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.480]  4% sales tax when you they were telling everybody they were going to go to 5%
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.840]  that was a long time ago but when they would say that that's a 25% increase if
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:10.160]  you go from 4% to 5% so yeah it's not a penny increase that's the way they
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.800]  always sell this stuff but of course Americans are taxed on so many different
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:19.160]  levels there's another story out from CNS news saying these are both off of a
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:23.600]  drudge report Americans must work January the 1st through April 24th just
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:28.840]  to pay the taxes so even though it's April 1st you're still working think
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.600]  about all the way back to your New Year's party and all that time that you're
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:36.480]  going through on average and you may be paying more than that you are still
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:42.120]  working just to pay your taxes but of course the IRS chief says hey always
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:45.840]  talk about getting rid of the IRS ain't going to happen we're still going to be
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:51.040]  here that's right they will be until we stop the spending until we stop the
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.840]  growth of the government getting out of control but they're spoofing us they're
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.680]  spoofing us with the the sales tax increases they're spoofing us with even
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:05.640]  with calls to get rid of the IRS if you know you can't get rid of the IRS if
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.560]  you're going to give a 190 billion dollar increase to just the Defense
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:14.600]  Department and not match that with any cuts anywhere else I mean that's what
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.560]  Ted Cruz Marco Rubio are proposing not even any offsetting cuts and yet you
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:23.640]  can't get rid of the IRS you can't get rid of the income tax if you're going
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.440]  to do that of course the income tax only pays a small percentage we continue to
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:31.760]  go into debt we continue it's like a reverse mortgage with the Federal
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:35.840]  Reserve we only pay just kind of the carrying charges each time and we just
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.040]  go farther and farther into debt but I'll tell you what is not a joke today we

[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:32.600]  have you on was because I saw these this clip from the strat for president
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.040]  George Friedman and it's kind of interesting because every once in a
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.280]  while these guys will get on and they will have these conferences that they
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:42.560]  speak out like I mentioned earlier you know when Petraeus says you know America
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:46.080]  is finished we now have the North American Union you know just and let's
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.600]  talk about what that means and the implications of that so a lot of times
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:52.400]  they'll kind of open up and you know they're talking to the choir and they
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.680]  figured nobody's gonna watch these dry conferences but every once in a while we
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:01.080]  get a tip and we got a tip someone sent to us it's a German posting of a speech
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:05.320]  that this guy who's the president the CEO the founder of the chief intel
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:11.680]  officer of strat for was talking in a kind of candid way about what's behind
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:14.840]  this build up in Russia and of course we just had yesterday we had a Russian
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:20.000]  analyst saying yeah you know we could we could basically wipe out North America
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.360]  by putting some nukes on the fault lines Yellowstone for example I mean that is
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:30.840]  very very provocative and when we see that kind of provocation publicly I mean
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:34.120]  that's just the tip of the iceberg there's a lot that's really going on and
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.960]  as he'll as we'll hear from these excerpts who are pointing out from him
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:40.040]  everybody knows that there's already fighting going on there we've already
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.000]  got soldiers there we've got pair troopers they say are gonna begin a
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.280]  Ukraine mission in mid-April this came out on the 30th from the International
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:50.840]  Business Times but we know that they're already there they're just now
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.880]  admitting that they're going there but what I thought was really interesting
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:01.640]  was kind of the admission that they have they control those troops and that's
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.480]  what I wanted to get you to talk about but let's before we get to that clip I
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:08.640]  want to play a short clip where he's talking about what the real conflicting
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:13.480]  existential threats are between the US and between Russia let's play that clip
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:19.800]  the existential threat clip is Islamic extremism really the major threat to
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:23.400]  United States somebody's asking him a question will it die in its own or will
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:29.560]  keep growing this is George Freeman it is a problem to the United States it is
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:34.320]  not an existential threat it has to be dealt with but it has to be dealt with
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:41.960]  proportionately we have other foreign policy interests so the primordial
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:45.840]  interest of the United States over which for a century we have fought war as a
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:49.880]  first second cold war has been the relationship between Germany and Russia
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:55.320]  because United they are the only force that could threaten us and to make sure
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.880]  that that doesn't happen the point is the United States is prepared to create a
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:07.480]  cordon sanitaire around Russia Russia knows it Russia believes that the United
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:12.160]  States intends to break the Russian Federation I think that is Peter Laurie
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:17.240]  put it we don't want to kill you we just want to hurt you a little bit the
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.520]  question on the table for the Russians is will they retain a buffer zone that's
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:28.680]  at least neutral or will the West penetrate so far in the Ukraine that
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:35.200]  they're 70 miles away from Stalingrad and 300 miles away from Moscow for Russia
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:43.600]  the status of Ukraine is an existential threat and the Russians cannot let go
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.520]  there you go so he says it's an existential threat what happens in the
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.440]  Ukraine of course the Ukraine is and Crimea have been a part of Russia for a
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:56.600]  very long time and what we see here and he says that for the last hundred years
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.480]  for World War one World War two as well as the Cold War we tried to keep
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.240]  Germany and Russia apart and the interesting thing is this was something
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.760]  of course that is very interesting to the Germans they want to know how they're
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.480]  being played okay and they're looking at this and and and it is true they've
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.080]  tried to keep Germany and Russia apart because they believe that that is an
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:19.400]  existential threat to us so they want to set up this corridor we've got
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  conflicting existential threats Joe looks like they're really pushing for
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.120]  war yeah it's very interesting I mean it's definitely a volatile situation
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:31.320]  over there like you said paratroopers I mean there's already been convoys going
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.440]  on we're trying to push their buttons and see if they're going to react yeah
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:38.640]  and it's not going to be good if it happens and it's absolutely insane as
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:42.600]  one of the articles we have up on info wars.com says a Russian analyst says
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:48.160]  this is much hotter much closer to a conflict than we ever had during the
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.400]  Cold War there we had kind of a mutually assured destruction it was kind of a
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:55.960]  standoff there were all these proxy wars in small countries but now we have gone
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:59.320]  right to their doorstep and he's pointing out the Russians are very
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.360]  concerned that we're going to get into Ukraine we could be just 70 miles from
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:08.240]  Stalingrad 300 miles from Moscow I mean that is right on their doorstep so they
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:11.840]  consider that to be something that is an existential threat in other words
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.400]  something to die for and he says at the beginning of this I thought it's very
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:19.360]  interesting the person in the audience asked him and said what about Islamic
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.200]  terrorism he goes well that's a threat we need to deal with it but it's not an
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:25.720]  existential threat but yet they tell everybody that everything is targeted
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.600]  towards the Middle East okay whereas they're going with this now this is the
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:33.480]  next segment that I wanted to get your comments on because we had an article
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:38.040]  came out it when the general went over there this is a pennant general Hodges
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:43.520]  when he went to the Ukraine and he visited with troops he was giving them
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:49.120]  medals and RT came out and said if a Russian analyst there said if an
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:53.600]  American general thinks Ukrainian fighting forces and gives them medals
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.760]  that means that he is their general and I kind of dismissed this at the times
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.800]  like okay that's RT this is kind of over-the-top rhetoric but then Stratford
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:06.000]  said the same thing and I want to get your comments out that let's listen to
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.520]  what George Friedman with Stratford said to this group of people that he was
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:17.320]  talking to. Last week ten days ago General Hodges commander US Army Europe
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:25.160]  visited Ukraine he announced that US trainers would now officially be coming
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:30.520]  not just unofficially coming. I'm very happy to be in Ukraine today as my
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:36.080]  first official visit as commander of United States Army Europe. I'd like to
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:41.080]  mention the great privilege I had to visit wounded Ukrainian soldiers today
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.760]  at Pachyrsk Military Hospital. He actually pinned medals on Ukrainian
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.400]  fighters which by protocol of the military is not the foreigners don't get
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:56.960]  to pin on you know medals but he did showing that this was his army. He then
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:01.480]  left and in the Baltics announced that the United States would be pre-positioning
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:09.120]  armor artillery and other equipment in the Baltics Poland Romania and Bulgaria.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:14.360]  Okay so he's saying that foreigners don't get to pin medals on people and by the
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.160]  fact that he was doing it he was showing us that it was his army and also
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:22.280]  pointing out that he mentioned the fact that they are going to send troops over
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:25.840]  there he goes so now they're doing it and telling people about it. So even he
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:29.240]  is admitting that this has been going on for a very long time. I just think it's
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.840]  interesting for people to understand and to hear it from multiple sources it
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:36.600]  isn't like he's telling us something that we don't know. Nevertheless the fact
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:40.160]  that this general would go with them we've been showing numerous sources
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:45.480]  showing that we had involvement and beginning this whole Ukrainian
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:48.680]  revolution we were financing it. You've seen all these videos popping up saying
[02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:51.320]  oh there's an American soldier there and everyone's like no no there's no
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:53.800]  Americans there what are you talking about? That's right they even talked to him
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:57.040]  and he's had something they call out black water and these guys would run
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.040]  away from them or whatever so we've seen that and now this general goes over and
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:07.160]  does a photo op handing out medals and so when I saw the strat for president
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:10.320]  say that when I saw RT say that I came over and I asked you what what's the
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:16.120]  protocol for this? Yeah so for instance the last time I was in Afghanistan I was
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:19.800]  under the 101st Airborne now they were in charge of the AO that's an area of
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.880]  operation that we were operating in in Afghanistan and the coasts or Kaus
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:28.800]  province everyone said and just because I was in the 82nd Airborne I didn't get an
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.640]  82nd Airborne coin for that. I got a coin from the 101st Airborne because that's
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.240]  who was leading that mission so if there's an American general over there
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.960]  giving out medals or coins to soldiers and that pretty much says hey we're the
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:46.600]  ones running that operation just like when I go to hang on we're gonna take a
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:49.880]  break I want to talk more about that and we're gonna have an update on Alex's
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:53.360]  condition right after the break so stay with us we're gonna we're gonna update
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:58.480]  on his surgery and his condition stay with us.

[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:06.620]  said we're going to have an update on Alex Jones's hernia surgery and his
[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:10.560]  condition and actually let's go to that update right now from Alex Jones
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:15.200]  himself. Alex, how you doing? Thank you so much. I tell you, medical
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:20.120]  technology has come a long way. We criticize MD medicine a lot, but as I've
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:24.760]  said, my dad's an oral surgeon and Dennis himself, he comes from that whole
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:29.040]  school. When you've got a broken tooth or when you've got a broken leg, you've got
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.520]  a hernia or you've got a gunshot wound, nothing's better than MD medicine. And I
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:38.640]  tell you, I had a really bad experience when I was 16 and basically got a compound
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:43.360]  fracture and had to get a pen. When five guys jumped me in the parking lot and I
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.760]  was able to deal with three of them but then they tackled me and broke my leg.
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.760]  It took them nine times the level of sedative to put me under and I woke up
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:54.440]  on the operating table. So I had a little bit of a phobia, but I'll tell you, this
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:00.880]  went amazing. I got in there at 5.30 in the morning, had the surgery at 7. I was
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.120]  awake at 9.30 in an hour. It was a big hernia because I've been there for 14
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:10.360]  years and if you got bigger barriers, I'd lost so much weight and then the
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:13.840]  muscles have gotten larger. So it was forcing a piece of testing out there.
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.440]  I got a piece of dead gut, which can lead to a syndrome where you lose your
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:21.920]  entire intestine basically and have to get a colostomy. So by the grace of God,
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:27.880]  we got in, got it taken care of and I'm up and around. I'm not even on painkillers
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:31.000]  right now, but I'm starting to have a little bit of pain as the local anesthesia
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.840]  wears off. I was under complete general as well under, but there's a good
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.760]  chance I'm gonna try to come in tomorrow and at least do part of the show with
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:44.760]  you. So be ready for that. If I feel worse tomorrow than I won't, but I'll tell you
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:49.400]  it's miraculous. I mean, I left the hospital an hour, two hours ago. I went
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.200]  to Whole Foods at some grocery shopping and I'm back here at the house and I
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:56.880]  just want to thank my family. I'll thank all the listeners for their prayers and
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:02.840]  everybody else. I know hernia surgery's not a huge deal, but at the same time, it
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.280]  can have complications. So we just pray everything clears up with that and it
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.880]  gets a lot better. But I did research with some of the crew and found a Dr.
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:17.440]  Livingston, who's one of the best rated hernia surgeons in Texas and not the
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:21.320]  country. So I want to praise God. Thank God for that. Thank all the listeners for
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:24.520]  their prayers. You know, worry about Joe and stuff when he goes in for medical
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:28.360]  procedures or anybody around the office. But just keep praying for the whole
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:31.720]  info or his operation. We've never had more influence, never had more of an
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:36.000]  effect again by the grace of God and we're definitely over the target in a
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.760]  big way and the world's waking up. So it's a very exciting time to be alive, a
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.120]  lot of tyranny. You know, just in closing, I know you guys are going to break a minute,
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:48.080]  come back and finish up your geopolitical analysis and how serious things are.
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:52.160]  Look at the articles that are up on infowars.com today of just what we're
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:58.800]  dealing with. We have city official calls veteran, a domestic enemy for
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.280]  supporting medical marijuana, which has proven medical uses that mean we
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:05.640]  endorse the abuse of marijuana. And then we've got university requires students
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.880]  to apply for free speech permits to just speak or hand out student info.
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:13.800]  That's why they've had people kicked off campus for pocket constitutions. This is
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:19.480]  in liberalism. This is totalitarianism. Now MSNBC blames law-abiding citizens for
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:23.800]  cop steps once the Second Amendment banned. This is an authoritarian takeover,
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:28.160]  stealing the moral high ground of classical liberalism of Thomas Jefferson.
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:32.600]  Again, George Washington was the first major conservative in this country by
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:36.400]  any historical yardstick. Jefferson's the liberal. You can debate their two
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:40.560]  different views of things. And you kind of in the middle of Benjamin Franklin.
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:45.160]  But we know what, or John Adams, but we know what we're dealing with here is
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:49.440]  totalitarianism of right wing and left wing flavors. And they found they could
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:52.840]  sell the totalitarianism as leftism because it convinces the left. But the
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:57.600]  good news was I got mobbed. I mean, probably stopped 20 times by people in
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:01.640]  Whole Foods when I was there for an hour with what you think of as liberals saying,
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:04.400]  we love the show. We're awake. We know what's going on. We know about the
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.520]  paradigm. We understand, you know, two of them told me, I've got guns now. I go
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:12.800]  out and go shooting. This is the type of stuff people were telling me. It's very
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.280]  exciting. The globalists are losing control. That's why they're coming in
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:20.880]  with total tyranny. But again, thank you all for your prayers. And just, just I
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:25.040]  really appreciate everybody. I appreciate David, the great job you're doing and the
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:27.880]  rest of the crew. And so just thank you so much, everybody.
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.600]  Well, you sound great, Alex. It sounds like I'm amazed that you can talk that
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:35.400]  clearly and coherently that quickly after surgeries. That's that's a real
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:39.120]  blessing. They even paralyzed, you know, my lungs had to breathe for me so they
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:43.120]  could untense the muscles, test it, sticking out. So I was under full sedation.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:46.800]  I'm all back. God bless you guys. Thank you. Don't overdo it. We'll see you
[02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:53.480]  tomorrow. We're all right. We're gonna be right back. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN

[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:31.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday, April 1st, 2015. It's
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:36.160]  April Fool's Day, but of course we have to plod through all the information from
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.480]  the government every day as if it was April Fool's Day because they're
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:43.200]  constantly trying to spoof us with disinformation. So it's constantly picking
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:47.160]  through this. Now one of the things that I thought was interesting and back we're
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:52.120]  just talking about this in the last segment with Joe was going back to the
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.840]  end of January. We had the new general with in Europe, Lieutenant General Ben
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.800]  Hodges, who went to the Ukraine and handed out medals to wounded Ukrainian
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:07.600]  soldiers. And at the time, RT came out and said, hey, if you got a foreign general
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:11.480]  doing that, he's saying that these are his troops. Foreigners don't get to hand out
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:16.480]  medals. So he's saying that these are his guys. And then we had a video that
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:20.880]  surfaced from Stratford where the president of Stratford, George Friedman,
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.960]  said essentially the same thing. Back in the RT article, they said Washington in
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:29.840]  fact just announced that they are sending American soldiers to Ukraine this
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.080]  spring to give training to Ukrainian National Guard. Okay, so that was
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:38.560]  announced then. And then they make a public display owning this because we've
[02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:44.000]  seen these reports over and over again. As you mentioned, Joe, the soldier that
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.160]  they walked up to and he said, go away. You know, he's obviously an American. We
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:50.080]  know that they have troops there even before they say they're going to deploy
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:53.440]  them there. We know that they began this whole thing taking it right to the
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:57.960]  Russian door. And in the first clip that we played from Friedman, he said that
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:02.160]  the Russians understand that this is an existential threat. That if you get into
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:07.680]  the Ukraine, you're only about 70 miles from Stalingrad and only about 300 miles
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:11.000]  from Moscow. So they take that as a huge threat. But he said that our interests,
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.360]  and this is why the Germans were interested in this, this is why they put
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:18.520]  this video up. They're interested in that because they want to keep the Germans
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:21.440]  and the Russians apart. He said, for the last 100 years, that has been the
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:25.480]  existential threat to us. So you've got these conflicting existential threats.
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:31.640]  And he went on to talk about the kind of cynical, immoral way that they would
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:35.800]  handle this. And the guy comes across to me as a real Machiavellian Henry
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:39.120]  Kissinger type of guy. I want you to see this clip and I want to get your
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.960]  response to this. Cynical and moral clip.
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:46.640]  The best way to defeat an enemy fleet is to not let it be built. The way that
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.600]  British managed to make certain that no European power could build a fleet was to
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.240]  make sure the Europeans are at each other's throats. The policy that I would
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:01.960]  recommend is the one that Ronald Reagan adopted toward Iran and Iraq. He funded
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:06.160]  both sides. So they would fight each other and not fight us.
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:12.480]  He funded both sides. This was cynical. It was certainly not moral. It worked. And
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:19.040]  this is the point. The United States cannot occupy Eurasia. The moment the
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:22.600]  first boot sets the ground, the demographic differential, is we are
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:27.320]  totally outnumbered. Well, the ratio in New York of cops to citizens was
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:34.040]  greater than we had deployed in Iraq. I don't know if that's good or bad. You
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:38.520]  know, I look at the fact that they had more cops in New York per capita than we
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:43.800]  had troops in Iraq. You know, that's your own standing army issue right there.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:47.360]  But what he was talking about was funding both sides of the operation. And
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:50.760]  of course, that's what we have been trying to get people to understand is
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:55.040]  that the same globalists have been funding and bankers have been funding the
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:58.960]  both sides of every operation. That's the way they operate. There's a few of them
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:03.840]  at the top and they keep everybody fighting amongst themselves so we can't
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:09.480]  get any changes with them. I mean, I can definitely see Putin reacting if we
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.080]  actually start moving in in this large number. And this whole thing in the
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.320]  Middle East, I mean, the way, you know, based off these videos, that makes it a
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:20.240]  huge distraction to take away from what the real issue is. And the real issue has
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:24.960]  been Russia and Germany forming an alliance. I mean, that makes sense, you
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:28.280]  know, take the eyes off of what's going on, what they're really focusing on and
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:33.480]  just hammer down your throats for the last 10, 15 years that it's radical Islam
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:37.040]  that's our enemy and not the fact that we should be worried about a German-Russian
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:41.240]  alliance. And when you look at history, when you go back and look at this and
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.760]  how they wanted to keep Germany and Russia apart, if we go back and look at
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:52.800]  the Nazis versus the communists, everybody in mainstream media wants you
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:58.880]  to think that these are two diametrically opposed functions, okay? That's not true
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:01.840]  to start with, but because they're both very authoritarian, they just have a
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:05.640]  different argument. But before you get into that, the main thing is, is that we
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:09.840]  had the same people funding both sides. We had the same people funding Hitler
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:16.560]  that also funded the communists. We had Lenin given a $10 million in gold and a
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:20.760]  sealed train out of Switzerland and going up into to start the Russian
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.440]  Revolution. And of course, the people that were giving him that money were
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.480]  German bankers and people who had ties to the Federal Reserve, okay? That's the way
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.480]  the globalists operate. They fund both sides. They fund the Nazis and they fund
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:37.440]  the Stalinists, okay? And then they have them go after each other. And I think we
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:42.120]  need to realize that they're actually doing that everywhere. Not just
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:45.600]  abroad, they do that domestically, of course. And we are always pointing this
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:50.040]  out. Let's play this next clip where he talks about empire and lays
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:54.120]  this out historically how this has worked. But I think you're absolutely
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:39:00.800]  right. We cannot, as an empire, do that. Britain didn't occupy India. It took
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:06.560]  various Indian states and turned them against each other and provided some
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:14.360]  British officers for an Indian army. The Romans did not send vast armies out
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:23.360]  there. It placed kings like, you know, various kings created under the emperor
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:31.040]  and those kings were responsible for maintaining the peace. Pontus Pilate was
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:38.800]  an example. So empires that are directly governed by the empire like the Nazi
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:47.280]  empire failed. No one has that much power. You have to have a level of cleverness.
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.840]  However, our problem is not yet that. It is actually admitting that we have an
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:58.280]  empire. You have to have a level of cleverness. Very, very devious guy. But I
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.880]  thought it was interesting. He said that the biggest problem is that we don't
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:03.920]  realize that we have an empire. Begins talking about the American empire and
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:06.960]  ends by talking about the fact that we don't realize that we have an
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:12.680]  empire. I would say, Joe, that maybe the problem is the empire has us. Yeah. You
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:16.400]  know, in every one of these examples, you look at Roman history. You look at
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:19.560]  British history. You know, they had Pax Romana. They had Pax
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:23.960]  Britannia. You want a peace. You want to have security and safety. Well, you know,
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.240]  one of the ways that you can do that is to have an absolute unchallengedable
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:33.360]  tyranny. Okay. People, whether it is colonialism or whether it's the Roman
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:36.320]  Empire, I mean, that's one way to have it. With people talk about the fact they
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:39.760]  want to be secure. We could have a maximum security prison. That'd be one way
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:42.680]  that, but you're never secure when you're a slave. You're never secure when
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:45.640]  you're a prisoner. But the way they always do this is they got a few people at
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:49.960]  the top and then they fill out the bureaucracy like they did in India. The
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:52.760]  British Empire did in India. They fill out their bureaucracy as well as the army
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:56.880]  with indigenous people. And I have to ask, is that what's going on here in
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:01.280]  America? It seems like it sometimes. Yeah, it certainly does. I mean, people need to
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.160]  understand, people need to question really who they're working for, who is
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:09.120]  behind this. And that's why we're constantly trying to say, look, these
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:12.080]  guys are using this divide and conquer strategy. They're using it between
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:15.560]  different nations. Or they're doing it here at home too with racism. And then they do it here at home.
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:19.560]  Exactly. Ferguson, Starbucks, I mean, coming out with a little race
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.600]  together thing that got squashed really quick. Thank God. Yes. It's never, you
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.760]  know, when you turn on TV, it's never cop kills, teenager, or it's always white
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:34.360]  police officer kills, black unarmed teenager. It can never just be a cop
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:38.280]  killed an American citizen. They always have to add that racial conflict to
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:42.160]  spark that anger. And that's all the civil unrest that's happening. It's popping
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:45.520]  up all over the country and they're creating it. Yeah, they love it. Yeah,
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:49.000]  exactly. And I wanted to play this because I wanted people to hear it from
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  somebody other than us. I wanted them to hear it because it is obvious history.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.360]  Anybody that looks at history knows that that's the way the Roman Empire works.
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.280]  They know that that's the way the British Empire worked. You would go for instance,
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:04.480]  he mentioned Pontius Pilate. Of course, this is Easter weekend. Pontius Pilate
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.320]  was the real power there. They were going back and forth. Herod was the king, but
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:13.680]  he was a king that served under the Roman Empire. So there you have Herod, the
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:16.760]  Jewish king. You've got the Jewish government and everything, but they
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:19.600]  don't have any real power. They have to go to these guys to get the real power.
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:25.280]  It's not as visible today. You don't have somebody that is wearing a New
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:29.400]  World Order badge, okay? These guys are much more clever. Like he talks about,
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:33.680]  you have to have a love of cleverness. These guys love to be clever. They love
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:36.440]  to be hidden. That's one of the reasons why everything is so secret. You're not
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:41.640]  allowed to know who this thin veneer of people are on top. You can see who the
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.240]  quizzling is. You just don't know who the quizzling works for, okay? You know
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:48.000]  that it's the president, you know, it's a prime minister, whatever, but you don't
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.480]  know the guys that this guy actually works for with any certainty. But you do
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:56.280]  know that it is the banks, the people who are pushing this stuff. But I wanted
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:00.640]  people to look at this and think about how they carefully divide these
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.640]  countries and their geopolitical Machiavellian moves. And understand, as
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.760]  we have pointed out a time and time again with the political correctness and
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:13.520]  what the media is doing, that's what they're doing to us here at home. They
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:18.280]  don't want us to wake up. They don't want us to realize that we're slaves. And
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:21.320]  that's their real concern. If things hit the fan, that's what they're really
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:24.640]  training for. What has happened, there's a great awakening going on. And that's the
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:27.720]  Exactly. That's the good thing. There's a lot of people, especially in the
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:31.640]  military, like we say, police officers, you know, whenever I go out, these are the
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:34.680]  people that come up and approach me and say, hey, I have a better understanding
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:39.200]  of what's going on. I'm kind of, they stay awake at night because they're
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:43.760]  like, oh my god, this this many years, I was fighting for the wrong side. And I
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:48.200]  didn't quite clearly see the picture. And now that they do, it's just kind of
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:51.400]  like this huge slap in the face. And now you've got to like it reorganize and
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:55.120]  find out, you know, two sides almost in a sense. They're like, all right, this is
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:58.440]  what I've got to fight for. This is where the real war is. It's not overseas. It's
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:03.480]  not radical Islam. It's here. And it's our government who's basically treats
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:06.400]  Obama like a king. And it is an empire. That's right. Everything is so
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:12.920]  compartmentalized that they don't really understand where it's going until
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:17.160]  they see a portion within their little compartment that verifies what we're
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:22.200]  saying. And then at that point, that lights the fire. It's like, this matches
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:25.360]  up. Let me go see what else I can find. And once they start looking at that,
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:29.320]  even though they ban our website, even though they ban a lot of these other
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:34.080]  websites, even though they'll say, oh, they'll create a straw man and take it
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:38.280]  apart and not mention where this information came from so that people
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.000]  don't go there and thank for themselves. Look at this long history of how this
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.520]  thing has been unfolding, not just the history of the Roman Empire and the
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:48.600]  British Empire, but just the last five, 10 years. What's been going on?
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:51.440]  But I mean, how can you even consider yourself a legitimate news source when
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:55.080]  you can't even show people where you're getting your information from? Yeah, you
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:58.440]  know, they're going, oh, well, don't go to infowars or don't go to that, that far
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:05.120]  right website down in Austin, Texas, because they know that if they
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:08.000]  actually do their job and they link to it, people are going to wake up on even
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.520]  a larger scale. Yeah, we do it differently. We don't say believe us because we're
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:16.840]  infowars. They say believe us because we're Fox News or we're CNN. We put up
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:21.920]  the document just like we did for this martial law stuff that Paul Joseph
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:25.840]  Watson and Alex Jones did. We go back and we show the videos. We have the links
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:29.600]  to the previous stuff, so we have to defend what we're putting there. I think
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:32.800]  I'm fine with that. I would be happy if they would defend that. Instead, they
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:37.400]  just make these blanket accusations and misrepresentations saying that we
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.920]  claimed that we had some secret document. That was never the claim and
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:45.160]  we showed that in the reports. I want to get your take on the latest
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:48.520]  development with Bergdahl. But before we do, I just want to mention real quickly
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.920]  again, we've got this new specialist starting at the store, the no-fooling
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:56.160]  at free shipping special that starts today on April Fool's Day. Going through Friday,
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:01.640]  everything at the store, infowarstore.com is free shipping. And of course, today,
[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:06.120]  and ending at the show, at the end of the show, is your last chance to get DNA
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:11.520]  force at 30% off. That's about $40 that you can save there. Again, there's Nobel
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:15.400]  Prize winning studies that confirm DNA force can support your mitochondrial
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:19.920]  function. We all know that's the powerhouse of energy at the cellular
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:23.920]  level. That's the way that you build your body to deal with things that you don't
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:26.760]  even know are going to be coming at it. The toxins that are in the environment,
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:32.440]  whatever toxins those are. One way is to try to address an emergency, as Alex
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:37.040]  was just pointing out, he had hernia surgery. That's what the allopathic AMA
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:41.400]  approach is good at. It's good at handling emergencies, gunshots, hernia
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:45.640]  operations, broken legs. But you want to get your general health up so that when
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:52.720]  you're exposed to something, your body is in top shape, both genetically as well
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:57.800]  as with the nutrients that you've got, so that it can respond to that and
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:02.800]  dispose of that before it gets any worse. That's one of the best ways to try to
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:07.040]  maintain your health. Again, free shipping today through Friday at the
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:12.160]  Infowars Store. And the last chance at the end of this show for DNA force, 30%
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.240]  off. Joe, there's a new development that just got posted on Infowars.com, a
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:21.280]  story by Kit Daniels about Bo Bergdoll. And of course, you've been following
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:25.800]  this. You're very angry about this story, rightfully so. What happened with this
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:30.720]  guy? Now, this new story says that Obama wanted to do the prisoner exchange,
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:34.680]  whether or not he got Bo Bergdoll. Yeah, on the second page, I'll read a
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:37.880]  little part from it. It says, the president initially only asked the Taliban to
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:42.960]  open up a political office in Qatar to conduct peace negotiations in exchange
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:47.280]  for the five prisoners, but had to modify the deal to include
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:51.840]  Bergdoll to appease intelligence officials. There you go. So, you know, back.
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:55.640]  The Bergdoll was just a beard on what he really wanted to do, which was to get
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:00.040]  these guys released. Yeah, and back out into the fighting force. You know, the
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:03.240]  interesting thing though, is like you said, he just walks off the base, gets
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:08.800]  picked up. And when we get him back years later, and completely totally fine
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.840]  health, but the, you know, Fox News, everyone's coming out saying, oh, this
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:15.600]  guy's withered away. He could barely walk, but you could clearly see in the
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.880]  footage, he's getting out of the little Toyota Hilux truck the Taliban has,
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:24.640]  walks on his own. He doesn't need any help whatsoever. And just gets taken off.
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.880]  And then there's this huge secrecy going on behind the case for the past year as
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:31.440]  a whether or not he was going to be charged with desertion. Now that it's
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:35.160]  out that he's going to be charged with a desertion and misbehaving before the
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.920]  enemy. And, you know, the president's going, well, I didn't really know that
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:43.120]  that he deserted or anything like that. You're going to tell me that the
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:47.640]  president of the United States did not know, because before this even happened,
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:51.680]  before this whole prisoner exchange, Michael Hastings wrote the article about
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:55.720]  the last American prisoner of war, which was Beau Bergdoll, which said when he
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:59.760]  talked to all of his other, you know, soldiers in that unit that said this guy
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:04.760]  was someone who got up, he didn't like what we were doing. He essentially just
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:08.280]  got up and left and was a deserter. So you're going to tell me that with all
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:13.120]  that stuff going on and the fact that they made these soldiers swear a
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:17.440]  non-disclosure, which is unheard of in regular army. That's something that you
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.360]  only see like speck-off guys do for missions. The president clearly knew
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:30.160]  this guy ran off and he still released these five top Taliban leaders to go.
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:35.160]  Well, that's what he wanted all along though. All along he wanted to release these Taliban leaders.
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:38.440]  But we're talking about the Biden-Conqueror. This is more division. You release these five guys,
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:42.120]  get them back in the ring, get them out there, leading troops, killing American
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:46.960]  citizens that justifies the reason that we need to keep 9,800 more soldiers,
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:51.160]  9,800 more soldiers in Afghanistan, instead of withdrawing them like the
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:55.000]  president promised he was going to do. This whole thing is complete and total BS.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.720]  And it pisses me off that they want to call him Sergeant Beau Bergdahl. Come on.
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:02.760]  Yeah. This guy got up, left, he's a deserter, into the story, he's a private,
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:07.160]  he's not even worthy of being given military rank whatsoever. Well, and we
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:10.800]  have pointed out so many times American involvement from the very beginning and
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:14.920]  creating al-Qaeda with Amooja Hadid and the fact that they are giving them
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:18.000]  weapons and supplies. We saw this happening in Syria as they were trying to
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.800]  build a case last year. And we were all saying, look, you're giving weapons to
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:26.160]  these guys who eventually became ISIS and ISIL, and now they're going back into
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:30.040]  Iraq to start that war up. They're operating on both sides of this. And of
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:34.640]  course, now we see that his big push was to get these guys released so he could
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:38.080]  keep this going. They want to keep both sides. We could have taken ISIS out in the
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:42.600]  beginning. Yeah. Right when this whole convoy coming in to Iraq and instead we
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:46.840]  arm them. So then he goes out and as to put a beard on it, he pulls back a
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:51.040]  deserter. And the mainstream media is just fine to tell that narrative. Stay
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:59.840]  with us. We'll be right back with Joe Biggs on the average Americans work
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:04.040]  between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:08.400]  their golden years. Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food,
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:12.280]  energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:16.200]  poverty line. Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:19.680]  call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring
[02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:23.320]  inflation and higher taxes. These questions and more can be answered by
[02:51:23.320 --> 02:51:26.320]  reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:30.120]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about

[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:14.600]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in studio with Joe Bates
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:18.800]  in our last segment here. Joe, I want to talk about Jade Helm. Of course we had
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:25.040]  Steve Quell on and we also played another take on it which was the one that
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.760]  was a possible explanation that some veterans have sent to us. Paul Joseph
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:34.280]  wasn't in article on it yesterday. Jade Helm is at preparation for a huge war in
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:38.000]  the Middle East and of course just rotating this map a little bit. You get
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:43.040]  a rough correlation to friendly hostels and people that are kind of on the fence
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:47.160]  in the Middle East. What's your take on all this? I mean it's a very interesting
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:52.880]  outlook on that entire scenario and especially the fact that Iran is
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:57.320]  labeled hostile. The fact being since before I was even in the military I
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:01.680]  always knew that regardless of the fact we went to Iraq the main end game the
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:07.240]  goal was to essentially move into Iran and put boots on ground there and this
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:12.240]  is just another almost confirmation of the fact of what I've been thinking for
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:18.080]  the past 12-14 years that Iran is the main goal for some reason the CIA they
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:20.960]  want to go in there they want that place just like we were talking about
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:24.960]  earlier on the break. Yeah yeah for the longest time Iran has been the crosshairs
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:29.400]  as I point out to you when I was in college I saw Iranian students that
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:34.120]  were there getting engineering degrees protesting the Iranian Shaw and they had
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:37.480]  to wear hoods over their heads and I said why you got hoods over your heads.
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:42.840]  They said well because the Savak the secret service that the CIA put in to
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:47.160]  Iran when they established that dictator that if they get our faces they
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:52.280]  will arrest our families and torture them. It's like wow really? Now that's my
[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:57.480]  first clue that we're not always the good guys here and but the American
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:01.880]  public doesn't have a history of Iran in the US that starts with an overthrow of
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:05.400]  their democratically elected government an installation of a dictator and then a
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:11.360]  repressive regime that was established by the CIA the Savak. Now there the
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.040]  American people's understanding of the Iranian situation begins with their
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:18.720]  hostile takeover of the US embassy so it's like you know why do these people
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:22.800]  hate us? Well it's our foreign policy we see this all the time we were talking
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:27.640]  about that as well. Yeah people are always saying oh if it gets bad I'm gonna
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:31.040]  leave the country so I think the scary thing would be our foreign policy
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:33.760]  that we have to be scared of to be outside of the country I think it's
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:37.360]  almost safer to be here. Well that's true and that's the other thing you know as
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:42.480]  Watson pointed out these military exercises have a dual purpose and you
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:46.840]  and I walked through API Hill we saw an American city there we know that the US
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:50.920]  go even if this is something that is a training for Middle Eastern operation we
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:54.160]  know that there is also another aspect of this where they're training to move
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:58.560]  around undetected in American cities undetected by an Americans so there's
[02:56:58.560 --> 02:57:04.160]  also a domestic component of this and we see this that Fort Lauderdale exercise
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:08.360]  that we saw a video of that was to me very horrific to see that being done
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:13.400]  oh yeah American city that is the NDAA being practiced on right there. Well I
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:16.720]  believe yesterday or over the weekend I did a report yesterday though on the
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:21.640]  143rd airborne out of Texas Texas National Guard unit they seized the
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:27.160]  North Regional Texas Airport over the weekend and they flew in C-17 globe
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:32.280]  masters which are giant like way bigger than a C-130 bringing out Humvees
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:37.320]  mortar all this stuff bringing all these airborne troops in to seize this area and
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:41.240]  people are like oh this is so neat this is a it just reminds me and the kid and
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:45.200]  all the military planes flying in and out of this airport no this is all
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:49.280]  conditioning regardless of what this training exercise is for the military
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:54.640]  for whatever purpose it is this is also a conditioning exercise to see how
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:58.000]  people are going to react to see what's going to happen you know they keep
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.120]  calling returning vets number one threat you know tea party militias all these
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:05.760]  guys we're getting you know word that the militias are on high alert now
[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:11.240]  because of this exercise they want civil unrest. Yes and Steve Quill thinks that
[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:16.680]  this is possibly the one that they were planning on doing it in 2015 hopefully
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:19.800]  the exposure isn't going to keep that from happening but they'll continue to do
[02:58:19.800 --> 02:58:25.800]  it so maybe it'll be Jade Helm 2017 or 2018 after people get accustomed to it
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:29.560]  then they will roll it out for real doing it as they do a drill that's what we
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:32.880]  always have to be concerned about well that's it for today's show again remember
