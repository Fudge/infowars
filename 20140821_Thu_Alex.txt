[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.822]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.403]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:12.944]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:17.146]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:21.208]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:41.325]  It is Thursday the 21st day of August 2014.
[00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:56.777]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we are going to be live here today for the next three hours and man it is the age of staged global destabilization on every front.
[00:00:56.777 --> 00:01:00.300]  We are going to be looking at the latest ISIS activities
[00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:13.554]  As stage provocations are developed and deployed ahead of possible US-Syria war.
[00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:28.403]  Only in the bizarro world of the New World Order, with an ignorant global population about how the world really works, could you have a situation where rebels funded and armed by the West
[00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:55.408]  From Israel, to Turkey, to Jordan, to the United States, to France, to England, NATO, all involved for four years, arming Wahhabist, Jihadi Islamic State, Al Qaeda in Iraq, scum of the earth.
[00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:07.225]  To attack Assad, to attack Qaddafi, to attack the Egyptian government, our supposed ally that got double-crossed.
[00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:11.368]  They're now attacking Jordan who helped train them.
[00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:16.211]  They're now even threatening Saudi Arabia that's funding them.
[00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.354]  It's just a bunch of wild murdering demons who have just been turned loose.
[00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:23.256]  So they're attacking anything and everything, including each other.
[00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:26.759]  It's like a satanic ideology is the only way to describe it.
[00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:36.114]  And they are now running around like a pack of starving piranhas with all these heat-seeking missiles.
[00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:46.504]  I talked to a, quote, city official yesterday that I ran into at Barton Springs, and he said, you don't know about the surface-to-air missiles?
[00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.564]  And I knew the guy was.
[00:02:47.564 --> 00:02:48.145]  I went and looked him up.
[00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:48.866]  I'm not going to say his name.
[00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:54.424]  He goes, this is off record, you know, who I, you know, my, my name, you can bring it up.
[00:02:54.424 --> 00:03:03.169]  You didn't know that they found service to air missiles just a couple of years ago, crossing the border out of Mexico and were found at the Salvation Army in Austin.
[00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:08.793]  And so I'm going to have to investigate into that.
[00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:10.134]  And he said, that's all I'm telling you.
[00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:10.634]  Look into it.
[00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:18.210]  And I'm sure the police out there that are more senior, they know about it.
[00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.292]  Maybe you can call in and give us the specifics.
[00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:28.160]  But that's just how bizarre all of this is getting.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.165]  Just crates outside the Salvation Army show up in the alley, I guess, to be picked up by somebody else.
[00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:35.547]  And somebody else went and looked at them and said, what are these?
[00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:36.848]  And called the police.
[00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:39.111]  And notice you never heard about it on the news.
[00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.137]  And his words were, it was quite a few crates.
[00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:49.219]  I don't mean to go off on a jag about that.
[00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.542]  It's just that's how bizarre the world is.
[00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:58.924]  And I've been so busy this summer, I hadn't even been to Barton Springs but one other time.
[00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:04.367]  So I went over there yesterday afternoon after getting a bunch of errands and company work done.
[00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:08.649]  And this fellow comes over.
[00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.411]  I knew I recognized him when he introduced himself.
[00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:26.853]  About two minutes into the conversation, sitting there in the springs, he said, oh yeah, we're talking about Al Qaeda and surface-to-air missiles.
[00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:31.454]  And he said, you heard about the Salvation Army and the missiles, right?
[00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:32.334]  I said, excuse me?
[00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:34.235]  No, I never heard about that.
[00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:35.895]  Imagine what else is going on.
[00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:39.818]  I imagine.
[00:04:39.818 --> 00:04:44.764]  I mean, we confirmed missing nukes out of Dias earlier this year.
[00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:51.712]  And remember, right after we reported it, all hell broke loose the next three days with threats of nukes going off right where we said they went.
[00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:56.518]  And Lindsey Graham going on CBS News and saying brace for nukes to go off.
[00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:58.261]  I mean, it's a bunch of weird stuff going on.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.743]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:14.645]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:33.254]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:38.017]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:38.998]  Talk about the effects.
[00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.839]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.781]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:43.882]  I feel like I look better.
[00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:44.602]  I feel better.
[00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:45.663]  I feel sexier.
[00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:46.624]  I love it.
[00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:49.606]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:52.548]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:05:52.548 --> 00:05:53.629]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:54.810]  Consult your physician.

[00:05:57.032 --> 00:05:58.113]  This is life changing.
[00:05:58.672 --> 00:06:04.795]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:08.237]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:09.898]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:16.241]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:22.144]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:26.249]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.313]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:29.313 --> 00:06:37.603]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:37.603 --> 00:06:39.705]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:40.747]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:41.087 --> 00:06:50.050]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:06:58.757 --> 00:07:00.018]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:04.981]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:07.622]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:07.622 --> 00:07:14.706]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:14.706 --> 00:07:17.688]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:20.649]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.670]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.492]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:31.314]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:34.815]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.916]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:45.239]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:07:55.387 --> 00:07:57.129]  I want to tell you about Texas Radio and the Big B.
[00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:26.748]  If you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you are the resistance.
[00:08:26.748 --> 00:08:28.188]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:53.842]  One last breath before winds blow.
[00:08:53.842 --> 00:09:07.908]  Better raise your ears.
[00:09:07.908 --> 00:09:10.309]  Because now you've got some company.
[00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:12.289]  Crank it up.
[00:09:12.289 --> 00:09:17.972]  They come to take your life.
[00:09:20.223 --> 00:09:22.544]  On to the dead of night.
[00:09:22.544 --> 00:09:26.245]  To see the four horsemen ride.
[00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:29.766]  So choose your fate.
[00:09:29.766 --> 00:09:34.307]  Oh yeah!
[00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:38.308]  None of the cowards out there are gonna escape death.
[00:09:38.308 --> 00:09:40.529]  It is the great equalizer.
[00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:42.449]  The truth.
[00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:44.150]  As you pass to the other side.
[00:09:53.639 --> 00:10:00.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.261]  to 2 p.m.
[00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:06.522]  Central Standard Time.
[00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:11.283]  My friends, we have a very important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:10:11.283 --> 00:10:14.164]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:19.047]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:10:19.047 --> 00:10:38.286]  We have architect and engineer Richard Gage joining us with updates on the scientific impossibility that was the official narrative of 9-11 and his progress getting tens of thousands of other engineers and others to go public and a lot of new evidence that's come out.
[00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:53.936]  And we'll tie that into ISIS and Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia all basically being protected by criminals inside of Western systems, both corporate and governmental.
[00:10:53.936 --> 00:11:01.562]  In the security apparatus that wishes to fully take over society and set itself on a throne
[00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:22.035]  of totalitarian surveillance and paramilitary oppression, martial law eternal, over all economic systems, over religious systems, over the family, the total control freak technocracy, the scientific dictatorship,
[00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:41.908]  And it's being delivered to us through contrived medical crises, collapsing border crises, radical Islamic jihadi crises, energy crises, where every sector of the economy is gamed.
[00:11:45.885 --> 00:11:47.966]  Let's just give you some of the headlines here.
[00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:54.629]  UK police say merely watching a James Foley beheading video may be an act of terrorism.
[00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:56.930]  Man, you talk about political correctness.
[00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:09.955]  England is the model of mental oppression where you can't even criticize youth burning down your city or you're a racist.
[00:12:10.973 --> 00:12:13.194]  And they're bringing that here last year.
[00:12:13.194 --> 00:12:16.156]  People thought we were joking when we reported it was mainstream news.
[00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:19.919]  With a straight face, they said, do not bring brown bags to city buildings.
[00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:21.219]  They are racist.
[00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:30.065]  No one ever claimed a brown bag had any... That's like saying you can't have white sheets on your bed because it secretly means you're a Klan member.
[00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:31.686]  Or you can't have a white car.
[00:12:31.686 --> 00:12:35.108]  A black guy's driving a white car, he must be a Klan member.
[00:12:35.108 --> 00:12:37.369]  And again, they know it's mentally ill.
[00:12:37.369 --> 00:12:39.531]  They're getting you to accept
[00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:50.258]  An idea where all human activity and all information is basically a crime selectively enforced.
[00:12:50.258 --> 00:13:06.309]  It's like the different supplement laws they've passed in California where you can't even have one part per million of lead in any of your supplement when there's like, you know, 20 parts per million in one bite of cabbage.
[00:13:07.623 --> 00:13:08.624]  On average.
[00:13:08.624 --> 00:13:15.089]  Or you breathe in 55 parts per million a day, basically anywhere in the country.
[00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:21.995]  But a supplement can't even have over 0.51 parts per million.
[00:13:21.995 --> 00:13:30.522]  Nothing, basically there's nothing out there but things like pure iodine that doesn't have something else in it.
[00:13:32.332 --> 00:13:34.774]  So they can then selectively shut down all the supplements.
[00:13:34.774 --> 00:13:45.684]  Just like they passed gun regulations in California that are impossible to follow, so all the manufacturers leave because micro-stamping's a fraud and doesn't work.
[00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:47.366]  See, this is how they're shutting us down.
[00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:55.353]  Before I get into all the news, let me give you an example, because I was thinking about this yesterday, as a sign of the country collapsing.
[00:13:55.353 --> 00:13:57.615]  Just three or four years ago, a good stake was $20.
[00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:02.968]  Then you go to the same restaurant a year later, it's $35.
[00:14:02.968 --> 00:14:06.971]  Then it's $45.
[00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.815]  Now, that same steak is $60.
[00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:13.437]  This is why my Republic stuff.
[00:14:13.437 --> 00:14:22.664]  I was looking at a menu last night at a steakhouse when I was with some friends, and I literally couldn't even order a steak and eat it.
[00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:25.726]  I was so freaked out that all the steaks were like $60 or more.
[00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:33.099]  And it wasn't that I didn't have the money to buy the steak, it was that I was freaked out the sign.
[00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:49.754]  They say Joe Kennedy sold out of all his stock a week before the crash of 29 because he was out front his brokerage firm and a shoeshine boy ran up to him telling him what stock to buy.
[00:14:49.754 --> 00:14:51.656]  And it's basically like one of those signs.
[00:14:53.445 --> 00:15:01.790]  Of just how everything is teetering and how the inflation is exploding and poor people just can't get by now.
[00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:09.255]  To pay for the gas and the insurance and the food and the clothes for their kids and they're working two, three jobs on...
[00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:22.942]  You know, just trying to make it, and their kids are being raised by television and by the gangster kids in the neighborhood, and it's all designed to destroy the family, to turn women into slaves of the government, to make them work, to make them pay taxes.
[00:15:22.942 --> 00:15:26.363]  You can just see it degenerating faster and faster.
[00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:30.105]  Here's the microcosm.
[00:15:30.105 --> 00:15:32.266]  I know the beef business.
[00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:38.409]  We've raised cattle since 1829 in the same area of East Texas.
[00:15:40.492 --> 00:15:51.878]  And I know people that are in the steakhouse business, and I know people that are in the meatpacking business, and I know the people that own some of the biggest herds in the country.
[00:15:51.878 --> 00:15:59.822]  So, I'm not a super expert, like a cattleman, but I understand the business, I know how it works.
[00:15:59.822 --> 00:16:08.027]  That's why I told you a few years ago, get ready for your beef prices to double, triple, quadruple, which they've now done, because, let me explain this.
[00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:18.271]  Almost everyone is going bankrupt in the cattle business because the government has set up regulations and rules where it's basically impossible to make money.
[00:16:18.271 --> 00:16:28.315]  While the beef is the most expensive it's ever been because of two different issues.
[00:16:28.315 --> 00:16:35.058]  A, the big meat packers, there's only three big ones now, got together, got federal rules passed, controlled the inspectors.
[00:16:37.028 --> 00:16:56.078]  To shut down thousands of meatpacking facilities that have been open in some cases over 200 years, in the case of the East Coast, to shut down family-owned and small corporate chains all over the country that were providing poultry, beef, fish, you name it, using regulations.
[00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:59.160]  There are no more real cattle auctions that go on.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.621]  If they still have the cattle auction, it's being controlled by the big three.
[00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:03.542]  They get all the meat.
[00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:10.337]  They then fix the prices behind the scenes so you would think that the rancher would be making record profits.
[00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:11.298]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:19.029]  They're going bankrupt because it's so gamed they've got to sell it for the lowest price ever.
[00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.309]  Then...
[00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:37.824]  It all goes up to the meat packing facilities, who are literally above the law, can have all the violations they want, you name it, do unspeakable things, the quality goes down, they can ship in meat they want, but only by the big cartels that have greased Congress and the states.
[00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:46.509]  And then you have the dollar being devalued, so that's why meat across the board is going up, because eggs are gamed now, fish is gamed now,
[00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:53.981]  See, people think business now is just about having the best product or the best marketing, and that's part of it.
[00:17:53.981 --> 00:18:05.005]  But more and more, it's just being smart enough to be able to navigate all of the gangsters in government and corporations that literally try to shut you down if you do anything.
[00:18:05.005 --> 00:18:18.050]  If you have a news website, if you sell supplements, if you sell films, if you sell Made in America t-shirts, if you hire a casting facility to make a few thousand belt buckles, the bureaucrats come in and try to shut it down.
[00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.772]  They don't want anybody operating in this country.
[00:18:22.772 --> 00:18:29.775]  That's why they've had thousands of arrests and fines across the country in what Forbes Magazine called the War on Lemonade stance.
[00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:37.538]  That's why they're having wars on farmer's markets, and wars on Amish, and wars on people putting up their own solar power that isn't hooked into the grid.
[00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:47.262]  You hook up wind power across this country, or solar, on your own farmhouse, you're gonna have inspectors showing up within a year, freaking out, wanting to tear it off your house, and just hyperventilating.
[00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:49.948]  They're here to shut this country down!
[00:18:49.948 --> 00:18:50.688]  You understand?
[00:18:50.688 --> 00:18:52.790]  This is an Agenda 21 war!
[00:18:52.790 --> 00:19:00.537]  And I was talking to one of the biggest cattlemen in Texas.
[00:19:01.499 --> 00:19:23.124]  Who was going to build his facility with a state-of-the-art stainless steel, they were about to buy the property two years ago, to then bring their premium black Angus, one of the top breeders in the country, directly to market to sell to steakhouses across Texas and in their own steakhouse.
[00:19:23.124 --> 00:19:28.345]  And came to the conclusion, you're just not allowed to.
[00:19:28.345 --> 00:19:29.185]  That's America.
[00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:34.239]  That's America.
[00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:37.901]  Rich people can't start a business in America.
[00:19:37.901 --> 00:19:40.283]  Because you're not part of the made mafia.
[00:19:40.283 --> 00:19:42.324]  And that's what creates a third world country.
[00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:45.086]  And that's what the political parties are doing.
[00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:51.269]  The only reason Texas is doing okay compared to all the other states is we never allowed a bunch of that mafia crap to go on here.
[00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:52.450]  We're falling as well.
[00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.091]  It's all happening now here.
[00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:56.092]  It is so sad to see our country fall.
[00:19:56.092 --> 00:19:58.454]  We'll give you the latest on ISIS, Ferguson and more coming up.
[00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:00.486]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:20:00.486 --> 00:20:06.029]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.570]  I get it.
[00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:16.176]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:17.317]  That's not what's happening.
[00:20:17.557 --> 00:20:26.000]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.402]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:33.623]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:20:33.623 --> 00:20:35.224]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:20:35.224 --> 00:20:39.186]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:20:39.186 --> 00:20:42.767]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:43.888]  You should too.
[00:20:43.888 --> 00:20:45.010]  Find out what they know.
[00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.334]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:48.394]  800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.394 --> 00:20:48.735]  800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.735 --> 00:20:48.915]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:58.345 --> 00:20:59.626]  Another major health threat.
[00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:04.608]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:21:04.608 --> 00:21:07.270]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:14.313]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:14.313 --> 00:21:17.275]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:20.336]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:20.336 --> 00:21:22.277]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:22.277 --> 00:21:25.119]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:30.926]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:30.926 --> 00:21:34.431]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:21:34.431 --> 00:21:37.534]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:22:27.654 --> 00:22:28.735]  This is an alert.
[00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:32.817]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[00:22:32.817 --> 00:22:37.039]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:42.422]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.

[00:23:32.264 --> 00:23:34.286]  Spare fuel is the answer.

[00:23:59.252 --> 00:24:00.520]  We've got a problem.
[00:24:02.677 --> 00:24:06.498]  Alright, you wanna go?
[00:24:06.498 --> 00:24:09.959]  Alright, you wanna go?
[00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:15.021]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:18.682]  We've got it.
[00:24:18.682 --> 00:24:21.783]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[00:24:21.783 --> 00:24:23.243]  We've got it.
[00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:25.964]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:47.990]  You go back about 15 years ago on the subject I was just covering before the break, how agenda 21 is regulation to shut down all competition that the globalists then exempt themselves from.
[00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.611]  You'll notice most water systems in Canada and the U.S.
[00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:54.092]  are now owned by European companies.
[00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:59.413]  And they'll come into small towns, you name it, and say, you can't even have so many parts per million of arsenic in your water.
[00:25:00.097 --> 00:25:07.922]  Well, basically any water in the world is going to have tiny trace amounts of arsenic in it.
[00:25:07.922 --> 00:25:16.207]  They don't care if there's fluoride, hundreds of other deadly things they're even adding, what they call fluoride.
[00:25:16.207 --> 00:25:17.868]  They don't care about that.
[00:25:17.868 --> 00:25:23.252]  They only got that regulation passed with the lawyers so they can make towns and cities upgrade.
[00:25:23.252 --> 00:25:27.635]  In some cases, billions of dollars to put in new expensive systems.
[00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:37.470]  That with all the filtration and the rest of it ends up adding more toxins back in, but then you get a waiver and it's okay.
[00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:43.699]  And then they give you this toxic toilet-to-tap crud that fish would die in if they were put in it.
[00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:49.183]  But you put fish in clean aquifer water, they would live.
[00:25:49.183 --> 00:25:51.704]  Oh, but you can't have aquifer water.
[00:25:51.704 --> 00:25:53.965]  We've got to add fluoride and chlorine to it.
[00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:57.326]  And we've got to put it through all these expensive filtration systems.
[00:25:57.326 --> 00:26:02.228]  So these Dutch and British and German and French companies...
[00:26:03.615 --> 00:26:08.637]  Can literally rake us over the coals, because they understand how business is done in an oligopoly.
[00:26:08.637 --> 00:26:09.418]  In a monopoly.
[00:26:09.418 --> 00:26:21.303]  They just come over, get the laws passed by the legislatures, get their specific patented filtration systems approved, and then you've gotta buy it.
[00:26:21.303 --> 00:26:26.406]  See how that works?
[00:26:26.406 --> 00:26:31.088]  And if the locals won't sign on to it, well, you just send in the EPA.
[00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:37.814]  Oh, you've got a Range Rover that's 20 years old?
[00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:44.601]  We're going to send a SWAT team of six people to your house from Homeland Security to bust down your door.
[00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:47.784]  Oh, you're at a SWAT meet selling fake Dallas Cowboy hats?
[00:26:47.784 --> 00:26:49.726]  We're going to send a SWAT team from Homeland Security.
[00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:53.910]  See, it's all about these... Oh, our borders can be wide open.
[00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.753]  Mainstream news is reporting that ISIS
[00:26:58.331 --> 00:27:02.692]  is working with the drug cartels on the Texas border.
[00:27:02.692 --> 00:27:03.953]  That's come out of the CIA.
[00:27:03.953 --> 00:27:07.994]  We're gonna get into that report, but none of that's a threat.
[00:27:07.994 --> 00:27:11.695]  You can have GMO that sterilizes the rodents that eat it.
[00:27:11.695 --> 00:27:24.399]  You can have glyphosate in almost every water supply that literally destroys your kidneys, feminizes men and gives women breast cancer on record, estrogen-based tumors.
[00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:25.639]  All of that is okay.
[00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:44.186]  But if you've got one part per million of arsenic in your water, well then you can't drink it.
[00:27:44.186 --> 00:27:54.092]  Even though that's a low level naturally in any water supply on the earth, whether it's the ocean or Lake Superior.
[00:27:54.092 --> 00:27:54.873]  Just like the
[00:27:57.808 --> 00:28:03.393]  EPA and the FDA and the rest of them are passing thousands of pages of new regulation every year.
[00:28:03.393 --> 00:28:05.676]  Even if Congress won't sign on to it, what do they do?
[00:28:05.676 --> 00:28:09.919]  They just say, oh, well, it's our policy to shut down our power plants.
[00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:15.885]  Nothing comes out of a fifth generation, they're going into the sixth generation now, cold-powered plant.
[00:28:15.885 --> 00:28:18.648]  Nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:28:19.895 --> 00:28:21.417]  That plants live off of.
[00:28:21.417 --> 00:28:23.759]  Then they put off oxygen, the life cycle.
[00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:25.040]  Nothing!
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.441]  Nothing comes out.
[00:28:26.441 --> 00:28:27.422]  Zero.
[00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:30.265]  With federal sensors on the top of the smokestacks.
[00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:31.787]  Because they're not smokestacks.
[00:28:31.787 --> 00:28:33.228]  They're steam stacks.
[00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:39.314]  And the media will point cameras at those and say, look at our polluted world, look at all the smoke, look at the smog.
[00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:47.055]  Meanwhile, Mexico has no controls and builds power plants right across the border.
[00:28:47.055 --> 00:28:59.926]  And oh, our government's happy to have the power from Mexico come in, or to have our jobs sent to India or China with no controls, where black smoke and soot comes out of these, totally dirty, and rains down on the whole world.
[00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:00.787]  That's okay.
[00:29:00.787 --> 00:29:06.953]  See, would you rather have the coal burned here to have clean jobs and clean industry, or burned in China, dirty?
[00:29:09.428 --> 00:29:14.535]  We'll see Al Gore and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the Globalists and the Dutch Royalty and the British Royalty.
[00:29:14.535 --> 00:29:15.476]  Look at who owns it.
[00:29:15.476 --> 00:29:18.680]  They all own the major industries in China with the Communist Party.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.826]  They put in power in 1949 and they want it there.
[00:29:22.826 --> 00:29:24.769]  So incredibly cheap, nobody can compete.
[00:29:26.118 --> 00:29:34.564]  And then they act like they're the ones behind the environmental movement in this country that they allowed to grow and then took over and use as a tool of oppression.
[00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:39.227]  I didn't mean to go off on that jag about regulations and how they operate and how they work.
[00:29:39.227 --> 00:29:41.889]  I want people to understand what this is really all about.
[00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:45.271]  When we come back, I promise, we're going to get into huge news on Ferguson.
[00:29:45.271 --> 00:29:47.933]  They now have contractors on the ground.
[00:29:47.933 --> 00:29:48.453]  ISIS.
[00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.414]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.414 --> 00:29:49.894]  And more.
[00:29:49.894 --> 00:29:50.875]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.875 --> 00:29:52.355]  SOMA health news coming up.
[00:29:52.355 --> 00:29:53.957]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:54.697]  Big broadcast.
[00:29:54.697 --> 00:29:55.418]  Big broadcast.
[00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:55.818]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.543]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:06.543 --> 00:30:11.126]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:11.126 --> 00:30:15.668]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:16.088 --> 00:30:19.009]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:19.009 --> 00:30:24.451]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:31.833]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:31.833 --> 00:30:35.974]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:35.974 --> 00:30:41.076]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:41.076 --> 00:30:41.936]  This is innovating.
[00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:49.543]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:49.543 --> 00:30:53.967]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:30.037 --> 00:31:33.678]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:33.678 --> 00:31:37.959]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:39.759]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:47.601]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:47.601 --> 00:31:48.741]  But for how long?
[00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:55.382]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:31:55.382 --> 00:31:58.203]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:31:59.588 --> 00:32:06.753]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:32:06.753 --> 00:32:09.095]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:14.379]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:32:14.379 --> 00:32:19.543]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:32:19.543 --> 00:32:22.585]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:26.928]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:31.271]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:41.499]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:32:41.499 --> 00:32:44.021]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:32:44.201 --> 00:32:52.415]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:22.829]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:30.375]  All the sweet young things trying to make the scene.
[00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:33.738]  Star Spangled Banner flutters in the sky.
[00:33:56.613 --> 00:34:15.313]  Pretty heavy words.
[00:34:15.313 --> 00:34:16.735]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:34:16.735 --> 00:34:17.356]  to 2 p.m.
[00:34:17.356 --> 00:34:18.136]  Central, we're here.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:31.287]  Let's get into the news and then we're going to get our reporters on for a breakdown on the incredible developments in Ferguson.
[00:34:31.287 --> 00:34:35.730]  Some very good developments, also some bad developments.
[00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.432]  But here are the headlines.
[00:34:37.432 --> 00:34:43.356]  UK police merely watching James Foley beheading video may be an act of terrorism.
[00:34:43.356 --> 00:34:43.756]  That's right.
[00:34:45.526 --> 00:34:50.287]  The head of the 7-7 bombings was British MI6 intelligence.
[00:34:50.287 --> 00:34:57.789]  I filmed Terror Storm, breaks that down.
[00:34:57.789 --> 00:35:03.931]  Our government, the British government, has openly funded Al-Qaeda in Iraq, renaming them ISIS and then IS.
[00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:14.574]  And now they think we're so dumb, they're saying we have to topple Assad because that's where ISIS has a base, in Syria.
[00:35:15.751 --> 00:35:21.695]  That's how stupid... Remember Kerry said last year, we must hit Syria.
[00:35:21.695 --> 00:35:24.858]  They have chemical weapons, they will attack us.
[00:35:24.858 --> 00:35:25.798]  We have the proof.
[00:35:25.798 --> 00:35:31.723]  Turned out it was a false flag launched by Al-Qaeda, ISIS, out of Saudi Arabia, working with Turkey.
[00:35:31.723 --> 00:35:33.324]  That's been in the BBC.
[00:35:33.324 --> 00:35:35.205]  That's been admitted.
[00:35:35.205 --> 00:35:36.806]  And no one got in trouble!
[00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:41.430]  That's the incredible part about this now.
[00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.790]  Used to...
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:51.604]  If a president got caught using the IRS to go after innocent people for political purposes, they had to step down, like Richard Nixon.
[00:35:51.604 --> 00:35:55.007]  Now it's like MSNBC says, of course we're coming after the Tea Party!
[00:35:55.007 --> 00:35:57.669]  You're a racist scum!
[00:35:57.669 --> 00:35:59.790]  Of course the IRS is going to arrest you!
[00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.611]  Ha ha ha, I'm Rachel Maddow!
[00:36:01.611 --> 00:36:03.593]  Flaming authoritarians.
[00:36:03.593 --> 00:36:04.733]  These are not liberals.
[00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:07.295]  These are scary people.
[00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:08.076]  That's why when they
[00:36:09.878 --> 00:36:10.819]  He indicted Rick Perry.
[00:36:10.819 --> 00:36:13.281]  He's facing 99 years as the Texas Governor.
[00:36:13.281 --> 00:36:15.823]  We have a great report that was out two days ago.
[00:36:15.823 --> 00:36:16.744]  I might play that today.
[00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:20.908]  It's so powerful that John Bowne went down and got the whole press conference, not just snippets.
[00:36:20.908 --> 00:36:24.331]  And I've been a big critic of Rick Perry.
[00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:26.252]  But Rick Perry compared to Obama?
[00:36:26.252 --> 00:36:28.534]  That is a lesser of two evils.
[00:36:28.534 --> 00:36:30.056]  Sure, he worked for Al Gore.
[00:36:30.056 --> 00:36:32.718]  Sure, he was a Democrat.
[00:36:32.718 --> 00:36:34.219]  Sure, he's a politician.
[00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:35.781]  Sure, I know who Rick Perry really is.
[00:36:38.439 --> 00:36:40.641]  But I know the state law.
[00:36:40.641 --> 00:36:41.681]  I know what he did.
[00:36:41.681 --> 00:36:51.909]  I knew when all the lawyers would come out, even Axelrod, the former chief of staff of the White House, Obama's mentor, said this is shady and wrong.
[00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.330]  It is a fraud!
[00:36:53.330 --> 00:37:03.318]  Folks, if you can arrest a governor for threatening to veto state funding through a state program, that's what a governor is supposed to do.
[00:37:07.102 --> 00:37:12.866]  It's the office of the governor, the office of Texas, the legitimacy of separation of powers.
[00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:14.226]  That's what I said day one.
[00:37:14.226 --> 00:37:16.628]  That's what Rick Perry said, because that's the truth.
[00:37:16.628 --> 00:37:19.330]  See, they're not attacking Rick Perry now, folks.
[00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.911]  They're attacking everybody.
[00:37:20.911 --> 00:37:28.015]  If they can put him in jail for 99 years for following the law, everybody's in trouble.
[00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:29.376]  That isn't Rick Perry, folks.
[00:37:29.376 --> 00:37:30.516]  That's Matt Drudge.
[00:37:30.516 --> 00:37:31.637]  That's Alex Jones.
[00:37:31.637 --> 00:37:32.918]  That's Joseph Farah.
[00:37:32.918 --> 00:37:34.239]  That's the free press.
[00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:35.900]  That's state government up there now.
[00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:41.171]  People are like, yeah, but they're a bunch of politicians, don't you want to see them go to jail?
[00:37:41.171 --> 00:37:44.673]  That's mindless Roman decline.
[00:37:44.673 --> 00:37:52.137]  That you just celebrate some big guy falling.
[00:37:52.137 --> 00:37:59.741]  If Rick Perry got indicted, if it was found that he took money from Merck to push Gardasil on people, throw him in jail.
[00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:05.144]  But see, they'll never send somebody to jail, because then they'd all go to jail for all the real stuff they're doing.
[00:38:07.176 --> 00:38:08.577]  Think about all the stuff Obama's done.
[00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:17.085]  I haven't even gone off on that.
[00:38:17.085 --> 00:38:19.026]  There is so much news, it's like I can't even cover it.
[00:38:19.026 --> 00:38:21.469]  It's just overwhelming.
[00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:28.755]  Do you know how many hundreds of Republicans and Libertarians they've been arresting for trumped-up crap?
[00:38:28.755 --> 00:38:33.719]  If you're in a Democratic-controlled area, it's the Democrats that are doing it, and you bounce one check
[00:38:34.735 --> 00:38:38.498]  When you haven't bounced a check in 20 years, I saw a case of this.
[00:38:38.498 --> 00:38:44.463]  They're watching it in live time and the banks report it through data systems now, and the cops come and arrest you.
[00:38:44.463 --> 00:38:52.010]  If you have overdue library books and you're a conservative Tea Partier, they'll come arrest you.
[00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.591]  That's called Nazi Germany, folks.
[00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:59.537]  That's when they come and take you before some weird Democrat jury
[00:39:00.916 --> 00:39:06.078]  That's why all these professors are on TV saying, if you're in the tea party, don't come to my class, I'll kill you.
[00:39:06.078 --> 00:39:08.239]  I'll put you in a body bag.
[00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:13.802]  That's why they're on the news going, Alex Jones is behind the Boston bombing and deeply racist and he wants to kill police.
[00:39:13.802 --> 00:39:16.423]  They're demonizing me ahead of setting me up.
[00:39:16.423 --> 00:39:21.025]  That's what they do before they set you up.
[00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:27.048]  Rick Perry actually put some troops on the border and actually ordered the state police to arrest people that are felons.
[00:39:28.612 --> 00:39:31.718]  And to hold them and to make the Feds deport them.
[00:39:31.718 --> 00:39:34.082]  And so they're coming after Rick Perry, folks.
[00:39:34.082 --> 00:39:35.865]  Because Rick Perry smelled the wind.
[00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:37.705]  We're good to go.
[00:40:01.786 --> 00:40:07.267]  Because the word from high-level Republicans was last round, they thought he was the only one that could beat Obama.
[00:40:07.267 --> 00:40:17.890]  But he had spinal surgery, was on drugs, and that's why he was acting weird.
[00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:24.512]  Legal drugs, prescription drugs for spinal pain, so he could have surgery on his spine and a day later be on the campaign trail.
[00:40:24.512 --> 00:40:25.932]  Boy, whoever had that idea was an idiot.
[00:40:28.544 --> 00:40:29.725]  You ever had a spinal problem?
[00:40:29.725 --> 00:40:32.086]  Just a little one where you can't get out of bed and you're in screaming pain?
[00:40:32.086 --> 00:40:36.027]  Rick Perry got hopped up on Oxycontin or something like it's the word.
[00:40:36.027 --> 00:40:38.088]  He said serious medication, remember?
[00:40:38.088 --> 00:40:40.629]  And went out and didn't know who he was.
[00:40:40.629 --> 00:40:44.611]  And so that's the only reason Rick Perry didn't give Obama a run for his money.
[00:40:45.455 --> 00:40:47.176]  They want to destroy him, folks.
[00:40:47.176 --> 00:40:50.699]  And it's not that I think he's some great hope against the Democrats.
[00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:57.844]  It's that if they can start arresting frontrunners in a political campaign, do you think we're just about done as a country?
[00:40:57.844 --> 00:40:58.525]  Stick a fork in us?
[00:40:58.525 --> 00:41:01.767]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:09.433]  If they arrested Michael Moore for putting a film out against Bush, I would come to his aid and say it is terrible and we're all in danger.
[00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.875]  But nobody arrested Michael Moore.
[00:41:11.875 --> 00:41:13.056]  They arrested Desha Sousa.
[00:41:15.253 --> 00:41:19.977]  And they're coming after anyone who doesn't want to destroy this country.
[00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:34.510]  Even if you're a boss hog politician that just wants business as usual, but doesn't want to bring down the country, even if you're corrupt, but don't want to sink the nation, they're coming after you, folks, because Eric Holder and the globalists hate this country.
[00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.171]  They want to bring it down.
[00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:37.472]  Do you understand that?
[00:41:37.472 --> 00:41:39.053]  They don't like prosperity.
[00:41:39.053 --> 00:41:40.294]  They don't like wealth.
[00:41:40.294 --> 00:41:41.636]  They don't like success.
[00:41:41.636 --> 00:41:42.957]  They have a vendetta.
[00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:45.290]  And it's called Agenda 21.
[00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.272]  We're going to go to our reporters in Ferguson.
[00:41:49.272 --> 00:41:54.376]  ISIS abducts more Westerners, promises beheadings, propaganda theater ahead of U.S.
[00:41:54.376 --> 00:41:56.077]  invasion of Syria.
[00:41:56.077 --> 00:42:06.644]  And they're on the news saying, we told you, John Kerry, we told you we had to go into Syria or ISIS, Al Qaeda, would get a foothold.
[00:42:06.644 --> 00:42:08.045]  You didn't listen.
[00:42:08.045 --> 00:42:13.129]  Now we, excuse me, we have to bomb for ISIS to take over.
[00:42:14.306 --> 00:42:18.449]  Or ISIS will take over.
[00:42:18.449 --> 00:42:19.970]  And they were planting this a year ago.
[00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.570]  You watch.
[00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:27.915]  These radical Muslims are going to cause trouble in the region if we don't go in and take out Assad and them after giving them the weapons.
[00:42:27.915 --> 00:42:31.897]  Talk about Machiavelli.
[00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:32.718]  I'm John Kerry.
[00:42:32.718 --> 00:42:36.981]  Yes, we've got to take all your rights away or Al-Qaeda will hit you in America.
[00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:39.262]  Yeah, Al-Qaeda, you armed at Benghazi.
[00:42:39.262 --> 00:42:43.485]  I mean, it's so incredible how criminal these people are.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:43:03.876]  And so, yeah, if you've seen me throw myself behind the Tea Party in the last year, it's because the whole system came out against them, the Republican leadership came out against them, all the big think tanks came out against them, all the foreign money came out against them, because they know it's one of the only hubs for this country to peacefully beat the system.
[00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:05.818]  They know liberty's popular.
[00:43:05.818 --> 00:43:09.301]  They know if it gets sold to Hispanics and blacks, it's game over.
[00:43:11.724 --> 00:43:20.893]  They know if people rediscover Americana and wealth and prosperity and freedom and justice, it's all over for the New World Order.
[00:43:20.893 --> 00:43:27.140]  And so they're all hands on deck trying to shut down the Tea Party right now.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.202]  They already tried to take it over, that didn't work.
[00:43:29.202 --> 00:43:30.263]  Now they're trying to gut it.
[00:43:31.383 --> 00:43:57.245]  And not because it's perfect, but because it's real, it knows about the Federal Reserve, it's pro-family, it's pro-gun, it's pro-life, it's pro-sovereignty, it's anti-welfare state, it's anti-corporate welfare, it's anti-banker bailout, it's anti-monopoly, it's pro-American industry, pro-farmer, pro-man, pro-woman, pro-child,
[00:43:59.514 --> 00:44:02.077]  Man, they're on TV saying 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:44:02.077 --> 00:44:04.360]  They're on TV saying your kids belong to the state.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.742]  That you didn't build your business.
[00:44:05.742 --> 00:44:09.307]  Now do you think radicals like this are scared of the Tea Party?
[00:44:09.307 --> 00:44:13.372]  They call us the counter-revolutionaries in their meetings.
[00:44:13.372 --> 00:44:15.175]  They are the revolutionaries and they know it.
[00:44:17.389 --> 00:44:21.210]  And they're not going to give up, ladies and gentlemen, without a fight.
[00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.651]  Now, if you were them, what would you do?
[00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:25.092]  You'd provoke a race war.
[00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:26.152]  You'd open the borders up.
[00:44:26.152 --> 00:44:34.695]  You'd shut down the industry to bankrupt people onto the dole so that you had enough people on the system so you could get them to vote to enslave the others.
[00:44:34.695 --> 00:44:42.498]  With Homeland Security lined up to crush the Tea Party if they don't play ball by staging a false flag to then demonize the Tea Party and arrest its leadership.
[00:44:43.737 --> 00:44:52.122]  That's now in the army training manuals and they're trying to take on the gun owners and demonizing the founding fathers to the army general enlisted now.
[00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:58.406]  That's why the military woke up so much the last few years and swole the ranks of our listers.
[00:44:58.406 --> 00:45:01.488]  We went from very popular with the military to the most popular.
[00:45:02.165 --> 00:45:03.526]  I mean, for real.
[00:45:03.526 --> 00:45:06.789]  Because they know what they're hearing here is real, because they're getting the training.
[00:45:06.789 --> 00:45:09.732]  And they're going, George Washington's bad?
[00:45:09.732 --> 00:45:11.053]  Gun owners?
[00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:11.934]  Rural people?
[00:45:11.934 --> 00:45:19.401]  I'm training to take on Christians?
[00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:26.267]  We now have video of National Guard and of private contractors in uniform in Ferguson.
[00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.220]  You just heard me right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:36.342]  You just heard me right big time.
[00:45:36.342 --> 00:45:38.523]  Headlines up on Infowars.com.
[00:45:38.523 --> 00:45:46.487]  The company officially put out the statement, asymmetric solutions.
[00:45:46.487 --> 00:45:53.290]  We've been to Baghdad, Kabul, KL, Manila, Peshawar, and Bogota.
[00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:56.952]  Never guessed we'd deploy to high-threat team in our own city.
[00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:04.816]  To clarify, we are not protecting state law enforcement or those exercising their right to assemble.
[00:46:04.816 --> 00:46:08.759]  Escort detail.
[00:46:08.759 --> 00:46:09.881]  Augment for individual.
[00:46:09.881 --> 00:46:12.443]  That's the Attorney General.
[00:46:12.443 --> 00:46:19.750]  We are saddened that such service is needed in what is normally a peaceful, harmonious, metropolitan area full of good people.
[00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.651]  So basically you have a Blackwater-type company
[00:46:22.794 --> 00:46:24.515]  Safe tour, job complete.
[00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:29.378]  On direct observation, seems media has made protesters out to be more bloodthirsty than they are.
[00:46:29.378 --> 00:46:32.519]  Oh, why?
[00:46:32.519 --> 00:46:35.161]  Because you were there for a few hours with the Attorney General?
[00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:38.402]  How about our people there for two weeks?
[00:46:38.402 --> 00:46:40.123]  And this is how it creeps in.
[00:46:40.123 --> 00:46:42.445]  Oh, they'll never be Blackwater on the streets.
[00:46:42.445 --> 00:46:44.146]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:46:44.146 --> 00:46:47.708]  Oh, you didn't see somebody in a Blackwater shirt doing a marijuana raid in LA.
[00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:49.488]  Yes, we did.
[00:46:49.488 --> 00:46:50.249]  We have video of it.
[00:46:51.533 --> 00:46:55.334]  And now joining us is former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:46:55.334 --> 00:47:03.335]  The other big news out of Ferguson is the policeman who aimed a gun at him and others and said, I will kill you three times on tape has been suspended.
[00:47:03.335 --> 00:47:09.657]  Reuters went with a headline, Policeman Suspended for Pointing a Rifle at a Peaceful Protester in Missouri.
[00:47:09.657 --> 00:47:12.777]  No, that's spinning it down.
[00:47:12.777 --> 00:47:16.218]  He was suspended indefinitely for saying, I will kill you.
[00:47:16.218 --> 00:47:17.618]  I will shoot you.
[00:47:17.618 --> 00:47:19.099]  I will kill you.
[00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:20.419]  I will kill you.
[00:47:21.988 --> 00:47:23.990]  With a bunch of effings thrown in.
[00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:25.531]  So, that is the right thing.
[00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:30.895]  If the department wouldn't have done that, boy, we know they're bad.
[00:47:30.895 --> 00:47:38.322]  With zero provocation, some crazy guy running up, with his gun, sticking it in people's chest.
[00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.823]  I mean, that is crazy town.
[00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:43.760]  Let's go to Joe Biggs.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.201]  Joe, what have you been witnessing?
[00:47:45.201 --> 00:47:54.149]  I know thunderstorms came through, so that cleared people out the same night that the Attorney General was there, so this Merck group just says everything's wonderful there.
[00:47:54.149 --> 00:47:57.833]  I guess you haven't seen people throwing rocks or Molotov cocktails.
[00:47:57.833 --> 00:47:59.074]  The cops haven't been shot at.
[00:48:00.865 --> 00:48:02.506]  I mean, I'm not even mad at this Merck group.
[00:48:02.506 --> 00:48:05.126]  I just don't like them operating inside the country.
[00:48:05.126 --> 00:48:14.650]  The issue is, though, what kind of propaganda is that when they were there for one day, you know, to tell people nothing's going on?
[00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:15.330]  Joe Big, St.
[00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.290]  Louis here.
[00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.231]  We're right outside of Ferguson right now.
[00:48:19.231 --> 00:48:20.792]  And like you said, we've been here two weeks.
[00:48:20.792 --> 00:48:24.433]  I also want to give credit to the man that was directly
[00:48:24.912 --> 00:48:32.339]  The threat was pointed to, you know, I had the gun pointed at me as well, but the man that it actually had to happen to was at revolutionary underscore Z.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.221]  The police out here have been completely and totally out of control.
[00:48:37.221 --> 00:48:40.822]  And what happened yesterday was the video went viral.
[00:48:40.822 --> 00:48:43.822]  We got footage, our own footage, put it on our website.
[00:48:43.822 --> 00:48:45.583]  There's quite a few footage.
[00:48:45.583 --> 00:48:46.983]  People saw what happened.
[00:48:46.983 --> 00:48:48.403]  And this man has now been removed.
[00:48:48.403 --> 00:48:50.224]  That's one bad cop off the road.
[00:48:50.224 --> 00:48:54.584]  That's one cop that I don't have to worry about shooting me because he's trigger happy.
[00:48:54.584 --> 00:48:56.945]  The guy was deranged and out of his mind.
[00:48:56.945 --> 00:49:01.686]  That was the first time since I've been here I felt like I was actually had a good chance of dying.
[00:49:02.793 --> 00:49:16.997]  You know, you know you're doing something good when I've got people who are in the surrounding areas texting me and saying, hey, they've heard on local radio shows, people are making threats towards myself and the InfoWars as well because we're actually reporting on what's really happening.
[00:49:16.997 --> 00:49:21.918]  You know you're doing something right when people are at that point where they get so furious they're willing to make threats.
[00:49:23.604 --> 00:49:34.128]  What do you know about this mercenary group, asymmetrical warfare group, that was there protecting the Attorney General, Asymmetric Solutions?
[00:49:34.128 --> 00:49:37.930]  Well, I know quite a bit about asymmetric warfare groups.
[00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:44.813]  I'm sure everyone remembers the video that David and I have of being arrested by those guys.
[00:49:44.813 --> 00:49:50.315]  They're a bunch of ex-special forces, Green Beret, Navy SEAL types.
[00:49:51.257 --> 00:49:55.260]  You know, the fact that they're coming down here for that.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:06.026]  It's funny how the mainstream media spins things to where it isn't what it is, but then he has this special forces group come in to protect them.
[00:50:06.026 --> 00:50:13.611]  It's mind-blowing the lengths they'll go to to say one thing but then do another.
[00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:17.834]  Why do you think they threw in the statement there that the media is overhyping the protests?
[00:50:20.546 --> 00:50:21.407]  I don't see that at all.
[00:50:21.407 --> 00:50:25.850]  You know, from what I've seen, you know, there's a lot of people who don't have a lot of money.
[00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:30.774]  They come out here, they're trying to film and catch little things like what happened with that cop.
[00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:34.236]  You know, there's people out here with just cell phones filming.
[00:50:34.236 --> 00:50:42.002]  You know, I haven't seen one journalist, anybody antagonize, provoke any kind of riot or anything since I've been here.
[00:50:42.002 --> 00:50:42.603]  Exactly.
[00:50:42.603 --> 00:50:49.268]  That's the shy-off with the police and these mercenaries and the military is attack the press, demonize the First Amendment.
[00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.275]  What they do is they infiltrate.
[00:50:51.275 --> 00:50:52.519]  They had a guy that night.
[00:50:55.696 --> 00:51:02.180]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:07.303]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:51:07.303 --> 00:51:15.429]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:51:15.429 --> 00:51:19.952]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:51:19.952 --> 00:51:23.754]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:29.857]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:51:29.857 --> 00:51:33.019]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:51:33.019 --> 00:51:38.402]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:51:38.402 --> 00:51:46.427]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:02.368 --> 00:52:05.711]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:52:05.711 --> 00:52:08.454]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[00:52:08.454 --> 00:52:12.397]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:52:12.397 --> 00:52:16.161]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:17.562]  Ours is not immune.
[00:52:17.562 --> 00:52:19.223]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:52:19.223 --> 00:52:19.784]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:24.528 --> 00:52:27.250]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:32.854]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[00:52:32.854 --> 00:52:36.176]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:52:36.176 --> 00:52:37.497]  The choice is yours.

[00:52:39.718 --> 00:52:40.739]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:40.899]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:55.337]  Extension 116.
[00:52:58.598 --> 00:52:59.379]  Question.
[00:52:59.379 --> 00:53:04.162]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:53:04.162 --> 00:53:05.423]  Answer, yes.
[00:53:05.423 --> 00:53:11.667]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.
[00:53:11.667 --> 00:53:19.232]  Pro-EM-1 is a powerful liquid probiotic that uses good bacteria to suppress pathogens and gently eliminate toxins from your body.

[00:53:49.232 --> 00:53:50.172]  Life's getting better!
[00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:11.875]  Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights.
[00:54:30.539 --> 00:54:36.040]  We have seen unprecedented attacks on the press by this administration.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:46.762]  Arresting reporters that talk to whistleblowers, exposing official government crimes that are protected under the Whistleblower Acts and federal law.
[00:54:46.762 --> 00:54:51.923]  Charging them with basically sedition and trading with the enemy.
[00:54:51.923 --> 00:54:55.004]  While this government is trading with the enemy, giving
[00:54:56.559 --> 00:55:06.643]  Missiles to Al-Qaeda and then saying we've got to invade Syria now because of Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Iraq using it as a base.
[00:55:06.643 --> 00:55:10.024]  We're going to go back to Joe Biggs here in a moment.
[00:55:10.024 --> 00:55:21.848]  I'm going to take my first dose of the day, forgot to do this earlier, of the survival shield, nascent iodine, I like to drink it in water, and super male vitality.
[00:55:22.776 --> 00:55:26.699]  Which has just done wonders for my stamina, energy, mood, you name it.
[00:55:26.699 --> 00:55:28.460]  It's got all these key herbs in it.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.961]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[00:55:29.961 --> 00:55:35.324]  It is your purchase of these products at InfoWarsLife.com that also funds the operation.
[00:55:35.324 --> 00:55:36.645]  So take the challenge.
[00:55:36.645 --> 00:55:46.111]  Go buy some of the X2 or the Survival Shield, or the Super Male or Super Female Vitality, the high quality colloidal silver, Silver Bullet, the Lung Cleanse.
[00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:48.272]  We've got some specials running as well.
[00:55:48.272 --> 00:55:51.635]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:55:56.323 --> 00:56:00.687]  And you can read about and watch videos about the iodine and find out why it's so special.
[00:56:00.687 --> 00:56:02.949]  No one else has this proprietary type.
[00:56:02.949 --> 00:56:08.794]  And why the globalists do everything they can to put bad halogens into the food and water, not the good halogen.
[00:56:08.794 --> 00:56:14.999]  And even the iodine that the government put in the salt before wasn't even the type that's really powerful.
[00:56:14.999 --> 00:56:20.905]  But in the old days, the government wanted you to have iodine because they weren't totally evil.
[00:56:20.905 --> 00:56:23.147]  Now they put the bad halogen in the water fluoride,
[00:56:24.656 --> 00:56:27.058]  And take the good halogen, the iodine out.
[00:56:27.058 --> 00:56:41.692]  So for me, this has been the, basically, my personal revolution in my health against this estrogen-based, fluoride, bad halogen-based assault.

[00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:53.493]  Joe Biggs, I'll get an update from you towards the end of the next hour.
[00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:56.355]  I know you're planning to stay there a few more days.
[00:56:56.355 --> 00:56:59.457]  I know the thunderstorms came through and de-escalated things.
[00:56:59.457 --> 00:57:09.705]  The Attorney General showing up, I'm telling people he cared, de-escalated things, while meanwhile he's behind the militarization of the police and the brainwashing to a great extent.
[00:57:09.705 --> 00:57:12.047]  He then poses as the savior.
[00:57:12.047 --> 00:57:14.729]  But I guess stay a few more days and hopefully this will de-escalate.
[00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:18.178]  We had another gentleman shot a few days ago there as well.
[00:57:18.178 --> 00:57:22.148]  What is your gut level assessment of what's coming tonight and the next night?
[00:57:23.459 --> 00:57:30.902]  Yeah, honestly, the only reason I think it was as calm as it was last night, and thank God for that storm, I needed a break.
[00:57:30.902 --> 00:57:35.785]  I know that the city, the community of Ferguson needed that break as well.
[00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:47.150]  The citizens who have to try to get in and out of work, to take care of things, to go to the grocery store, have been so unable to do that because of this police state, the martial law that's been inflicted upon them.
[00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:53.884]  It was a night of rest that needed to happen and there were a lot of awake people out there.
[00:57:53.884 --> 00:57:55.885]  It was a beautiful thing to see that finally.
[00:57:55.885 --> 00:58:00.670]  That's right, you've got interviews that are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:01.951]  They're very good.
[00:58:01.951 --> 00:58:07.036]  Where a lot of the folks out there are talking about the Constitution, the Second Amendment, the New World Order.
[00:58:07.036 --> 00:58:08.958]  Sounds like you met some InfoWarriors last night.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.080]  Yes.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.181]  Yes, sir, we did.
[00:58:11.181 --> 00:58:12.802]  It was a good night overall.
[00:58:12.802 --> 00:58:16.704]  The people there, like you said, they were very awake, very knowledgeable.
[00:58:16.704 --> 00:58:21.027]  And I was just in awe of one of the ladies in our videos we put up on YouTube.
[00:58:21.027 --> 00:58:25.069]  Just to listen to her speak, I probably sat there for 15, 20 minutes.
[00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:28.451]  And what she had to say was just great, mind-blowing.
[00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:29.712]  It's what I like to hear.
[00:58:29.712 --> 00:58:32.013]  In fact, I'm going to tweak that video out right now.
[00:58:32.013 --> 00:58:34.655]  We'll get an update from you at the end of the show coming up.
[00:58:34.655 --> 00:58:36.376]  Second Hour with a ton of important news.
[00:58:36.376 --> 00:58:36.836]  Stay with us.

[00:59:19.162 --> 00:59:22.824]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:22.824 --> 00:59:27.105]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:28.886]  Can you put two and two together?

[00:59:54.673 --> 01:00:05.336]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:06.656]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.656 --> 01:00:08.436]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.436 --> 01:00:10.177]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.177 --> 01:00:11.757]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.757 --> 01:00:13.697]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:17.498]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.498 --> 01:00:21.619]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.191 --> 01:00:27.693]  We covered a lot of news in the last hour, but I haven't gotten to just a ton of it.
[01:00:27.693 --> 01:00:28.533]  Look at these headlines.
[01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:31.354]  This is from DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:31.354 --> 01:00:34.535]  ISIS renamed Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:34.535 --> 01:00:38.596]  So Al-Qaeda gets renamed ISIS, then IS, then Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:38.596 --> 01:00:41.097]  Again, we're going to go over that report.
[01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:42.198]  Financial Times of London.
[01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:45.268]  Americans braced for a new wave of terror.
[01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:46.328]  We told you that was coming.
[01:00:46.328 --> 01:00:49.769]  Gotta give up all our rights now, because the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:49.769 --> 01:00:51.690]  ISIS has 12,000 foreign fighters.
[01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:53.490]  Hundreds of them are Americans.
[01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:58.572]  More British Muslims fight for Islamic State than for Britain.
[01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.153]  What a mess!
[01:01:01.153 --> 01:01:03.893]  Putin's targeting dirty McDonald's.
[01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.174]  Get ready for a boycott of that.
[01:01:05.174 --> 01:01:11.176]  I buy boycott McDonald's and all their... Well, they buy literally rotten chicken from China.
[01:01:11.176 --> 01:01:11.476]  I mean, just...
[01:01:13.422 --> 01:01:17.423]  Are you suicidal, folks?
[01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:21.624]  John the Executioner, Military Conducted Unsuccessful Rescue Mission.
[01:01:21.624 --> 01:01:34.587]  It's such PR where they blew up a Toyota truck today, or they blow up some old armor to make it look like they're fighting Al-Qaeda, while Al-Qaeda just runs around murdering whoever they want.
[01:01:34.587 --> 01:01:38.328]  Al-Qaeda is commanded by the same criminals that run our government, just so you know.
[01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:40.809]  We're going to talk about that today in the third hour.
[01:01:47.557 --> 01:02:00.707]  Meanwhile, while all of this is happening, Obama has taken more vacation time than even Bush, who I criticize big time for that, and it just plays golf every day.
[01:02:00.707 --> 01:02:02.748]  He's not a president.
[01:02:02.748 --> 01:02:09.673]  And it's the arrogance that's just thumbing their nose at everybody.
[01:02:09.673 --> 01:02:15.518]  Meanwhile, if you're Al Qaeda, you can walk across the border, you can be given heat-seeking missiles by the U.S.
[01:02:15.518 --> 01:02:15.878]  government,
[01:02:18.362 --> 01:02:29.871]  But if you're a student in art class that draws a cartoon of army soldiers fighting a T-Rex, I mean, I must have drawn that a hundred, two hundred times when I was a kid.
[01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.433]  Who didn't draw pictures of Godzilla?
[01:02:32.433 --> 01:02:35.376]  I mean, I think every boy... Let me ask the men in there.
[01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:38.938]  Guys, did you all draw pictures of Godzilla being attacked by airplanes when you were a kid?
[01:02:38.938 --> 01:02:39.999]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:39.999 --> 01:02:42.882]  I mean, I think that's probably what I'd... My mother... Guns.
[01:02:44.212 --> 01:02:47.573]  I mean, I've dug through my mom's stuff when she pulls out the old pictures and stuff, and a lot of my drawings she saves.
[01:02:47.573 --> 01:02:49.273]  Bullets coming out of the guns.
[01:02:49.273 --> 01:02:54.555]  Yeah, but isn't it usually like a big monster being attacked by the army?
[01:02:54.555 --> 01:02:55.535]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:55.535 --> 01:02:56.875]  And that's me and my buddies all through.
[01:02:56.875 --> 01:02:58.476]  Yeah, the army's protecting us.
[01:02:58.476 --> 01:03:00.696]  The army's protecting us.
[01:03:00.696 --> 01:03:04.437]  Not attacking us, but protecting our guns.
[01:03:04.437 --> 01:03:08.438]  Now it's a giant army soldier comes out of the sea with a big Obama symbol on his head.
[01:03:08.438 --> 01:03:11.279]  Big Cyclops Obama soldier coming after our guns.
[01:03:13.345 --> 01:03:14.886]  You get suspended or arrested.
[01:03:14.886 --> 01:03:16.067]  That's in the news today.
[01:03:16.067 --> 01:03:23.214]  Teen says he was suspended and detained for joking about killing a pet dinosaur.
[01:03:23.214 --> 01:03:24.535]  Yeah, and then I saw another story.
[01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:28.639]  You guys pulled up a whole nother one.
[01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:32.963]  Imagining shooting a dinosaur.
[01:03:32.963 --> 01:03:37.387]  So now let's see, watching the ISIS beheading, or the IS beheading,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.901]  is an act of terror in England.
[01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:51.205]  But the government literally funding and running them and arresting, you have any free speech you want in England or the UK, you do not criticize Muslims.
[01:03:51.205 --> 01:03:54.206]  You will be arrested, you will be banned, you will be thrown out of the country.
[01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:57.408]  Everybody knows, I'm not going to quote Islamophobe.
[01:03:57.408 --> 01:04:01.309]  I don't spend all my time freaking out over Islam and all the rest of it.
[01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:05.391]  I've been pointing out that criminal elements have been working with it for a long time to overthrow the West.
[01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:13.635]  And that these people attack moderate Muslims, who are the majority, in my experience.
[01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:31.310]  But when ISIS and all these groups are turned loose to kill Christians en masse, and say they're coming to America to chop my head off, I gotta be honest, at an instinctive level, when a guy's pointing a knife at me and saying, I'm coming to kill you Americans, I mean, I just really want to
[01:04:32.489 --> 01:04:35.392]  Get put in a ring, this guy can have a knife and I can have a knife.
[01:04:35.392 --> 01:04:39.555]  I mean, as a man, I want to kill members of Al Qaeda.
[01:04:39.555 --> 01:04:44.800]  I mean, they kill children, women, they cut little kids' heads off.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.681]  But remember, that's the manipulation.
[01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:54.268]  The globalists are funding them, so we get mad at them, so then they use our anger to set up a police state that's aimed at gun owners.
[01:04:54.268 --> 01:04:56.329]  You see how the PSYOP works?
[01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:57.711]  Dr. Ed Gribb's coming in.

[01:05:33.836 --> 01:05:38.598]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:05:38.598 --> 01:05:39.598]  Talk about the effects.
[01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:41.439]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:05:41.439 --> 01:05:43.360]  I have drive to go to the gym.

[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.241]  I feel sexier.

[01:05:57.606 --> 01:05:58.687]  This is life changing.
[01:05:59.227 --> 01:06:00.488]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:00.488 --> 01:06:05.472]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:06:05.472 --> 01:06:08.154]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:06:08.154 --> 01:06:15.200]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.183]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:21.225]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:06:21.225 --> 01:06:23.147]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:25.949]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:31.791]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:06:31.791 --> 01:06:35.312]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:06:35.312 --> 01:06:38.393]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:06:59.143 --> 01:07:05.307]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:09.470]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:14.853]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:14.853 --> 01:07:17.755]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:17.755 --> 01:07:23.219]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:30.604]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:07:30.604 --> 01:07:34.747]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:39.510]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:48.456]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:08:18.772 --> 01:08:21.053]  Well, ISIS has come out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:21.053 --> 01:08:25.435]  It's in the Financial Times of London.
[01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:28.236]  And they're basically saying they're Al-Qaeda.
[01:08:28.236 --> 01:08:31.658]  And Al-Qaeda has been commending them all around the world.
[01:08:31.658 --> 01:08:36.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, ISIS was founded out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:40.161]  That is on the Defense Department's own website, the British Ministry of Defense.
[01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:41.302]  It's in the newspapers.
[01:08:41.302 --> 01:08:43.603]  We've been following this for four years.
[01:08:43.603 --> 01:08:45.384]  This is the group taking over part of
[01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:52.146]  Eastern Iraq, Western Syria, they are the first group to attack Assad four years ago.
[01:08:52.146 --> 01:08:55.387]  They are 60 plus percent of the main battle force.
[01:08:55.387 --> 01:09:04.771]  They have been attacking the non-radical Muslims, if you can call them that, that are more secular and want to overthrow Assad because he's a dictator.
[01:09:05.919 --> 01:09:14.103]  And then Kerry says, well, we've got to then go back those groups against ISIS because they've taken over part of Syria and Iraq.
[01:09:14.103 --> 01:09:20.926]  When our government put them in training bases, the Israeli government's been protecting them and working with them.
[01:09:20.926 --> 01:09:23.367]  That's in Israeli news.
[01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:27.809]  They're on their border with areas with Syria where al-Qaeda is operating.
[01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:29.750]  They've been giving Israeli ambulances.
[01:09:31.078 --> 01:09:34.101]  To the Al-Qaeda forces and taking them to hospitals.
[01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:39.325]  And notice, ISIS and IS and all of them have said, we're not going to attack Israel.
[01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:40.226]  Remember that?
[01:09:40.226 --> 01:09:46.611]  They're going to attack Jordan, who actually let them train there.
[01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:47.692]  They're going to attack Egypt.
[01:09:47.692 --> 01:09:49.934]  They're going to attack African countries.
[01:09:49.934 --> 01:09:51.795]  They're going to destabilize everywhere.
[01:09:51.795 --> 01:09:57.100]  And then they pull back, and then the West has an excuse, just like in Ivory Coast last year.
[01:09:58.325 --> 01:10:18.482]  The President went public in that country and said, the Al-Qaeda forces come in and attack the oil refinery, then white men, western blonde haired men, commando show up, have a fake fight with them and take over the oil rigs, and then say they're protecting them, and then start basically diverting the oil to tankers.
[01:10:18.482 --> 01:10:22.786]  Al-Qaeda works like two peas in a pod with the West.
[01:10:23.809 --> 01:10:29.472]  It was created in 1979 by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who is Obama's main advisor right now.
[01:10:29.472 --> 01:10:31.352]  It doesn't mean they're not real.
[01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:34.474]  Doesn't mean they wouldn't kill our troops and didn't.
[01:10:34.474 --> 01:10:37.195]  That's how this full spectrum dominance is.
[01:10:37.195 --> 01:10:40.216]  You turn these groups loose everywhere, they'll have real wars.
[01:10:40.216 --> 01:10:44.959]  Our troops will go and fight and die with these people.
[01:10:44.959 --> 01:10:52.382]  It's only their triple and double agent commanders that are higher up that are working with Western intelligence.
[01:10:54.462 --> 01:10:59.364]  Did they bomb their convoys to death when they came in?
[01:10:59.364 --> 01:11:02.785]  Did they take them out when they invaded Iraq a few months ago?
[01:11:02.785 --> 01:11:03.505]  No.
[01:11:03.505 --> 01:11:04.425]  They stood down.
[01:11:04.425 --> 01:11:10.187]  Now they blow up a Toyota truck or what looks like artillery and there's never anybody standing around it.
[01:11:10.187 --> 01:11:12.488]  And guaranteed they're scripting it.
[01:11:12.488 --> 01:11:17.730]  Guaranteed the word goes that here's the grid, we want some of your equipment that doesn't work parked here.
[01:11:18.564 --> 01:11:21.666]  They put the trucks, they put the grids, you can see it staged.
[01:11:21.666 --> 01:11:26.448]  Never anybody running away, never a big cache of weapons, never one of their bases.
[01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.169]  It's staged, just like in 2001.
[01:11:29.169 --> 01:11:37.133]  The real Al-Qaeda was flown out to safety, and then our troops had a real war with the Akhani network and with the Taliban.
[01:11:37.133 --> 01:11:42.076]  Who didn't like them being there.
[01:11:42.076 --> 01:11:44.317]  Al-Qaeda starts the wars
[01:11:45.933 --> 01:11:50.396]  Then that gives the West the pretext to come in and not even put a good government in.
[01:11:50.396 --> 01:12:00.363]  They want to destabilize collapsed post-industrial society in the Middle East, just like the globalists want to shut down our farms, our ranches, our factories, our power plants.
[01:12:00.363 --> 01:12:03.345]  They tell us parents aren't parents, the state is the parents.
[01:12:03.345 --> 01:12:08.388]  Everything is about getting you dependent on the system.
[01:12:08.388 --> 01:12:09.549]  Destabilization.
[01:12:09.549 --> 01:12:12.591]  Extreme violence lies in the ISIS DNA.
[01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:30.070]  And then they go on to admit that the murder of American journalist James Foley was done by Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:32.291]  Of course it's done by Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:36.374]  The black flag with Arabic is the Al-Qaeda flag.
[01:12:36.374 --> 01:12:40.538]  I am so sick of... It's like if an army had American flags,
[01:12:42.028 --> 01:12:45.310]  And was running around murdering everybody and was the American Army.
[01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:48.151]  And then people were saying, gee, I wonder if Al-Qaeda's involved.
[01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:49.892]  It is Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:49.892 --> 01:12:51.573]  It's a total brand name.
[01:12:51.573 --> 01:12:55.715]  IS, ISIS, all this.
[01:12:55.715 --> 01:12:58.997]  Is a total brand name to confuse us.
[01:12:58.997 --> 01:13:00.358]  We're getting big problems.
[01:13:00.358 --> 01:13:04.740]  Rand Paul and Alex Jones, all these people are exposing that we're Al-Qaeda's Air Force.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.361]  We're working with them.
[01:13:05.361 --> 01:13:06.741]  The military's really upset.
[01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:09.403]  Saying they won't fight for Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:09.403 --> 01:13:09.903]  What do we do?
[01:13:09.903 --> 01:13:10.804]  You just change the name.
[01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:11.444]  That'll confuse them.
[01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:16.011]  But every time a journalist talks to Al Qaeda, they're not getting direct orders.
[01:13:16.011 --> 01:13:17.952]  They've just been turned loose and armed.
[01:13:17.952 --> 01:13:19.333]  They go, we are Al Qaeda!
[01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:20.514]  We will blow up the White House!
[01:13:20.514 --> 01:13:21.775]  We will kill Americans!
[01:13:21.775 --> 01:13:23.437]  We will cut your heads off!
[01:13:23.437 --> 01:13:25.718]  Your wives and children, we're coming to murder you!
[01:13:25.718 --> 01:13:29.541]  And they have, like, hearts on TV, chewing on them, just completely whacked out of their brains.
[01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:35.206]  I mean, you look at videos and photos of these jihadis, I've never seen soldiers that look like this or act like this.
[01:13:35.206 --> 01:13:37.568]  They're completely whacked out of their brains.
[01:13:37.568 --> 01:13:39.970]  Only thing I ever saw close to this was some of the
[01:13:41.971 --> 01:13:47.735]  There's state police and local police in Ferguson who look totally hateful of reporters.
[01:13:47.735 --> 01:13:55.280]  I don't know what they've told the cops to hate them so much, where they just run up and stick guns in their chest and say, I'll effing kill you!
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.483]  It's still not one-tenth as crazy-eyed.
[01:13:59.483 --> 01:14:03.045]  But it's one thing to have like 50 cops and maybe 10 of them are crazy-eyed.
[01:14:03.045 --> 01:14:03.966]  That's bad.
[01:14:03.966 --> 01:14:09.970]  When you watch videos of ISIS and al-Qaeda, there'll be hundreds of them, and they all just look like they're demon-possessed.
[01:14:12.472 --> 01:14:40.242]  I mean, who chops off two-year-olds' heads, and then goes, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love
[01:14:44.133 --> 01:14:48.635]  I really appreciate Dr. Group coming in studio with us today.
[01:14:48.635 --> 01:14:54.697]  There's so much happening in this world, and there are so many solutions out there when it comes to our own daily lives.
[01:14:54.697 --> 01:15:03.401]  Watch less television, try to eat organic, drink more purified water, spend time with our families, breathe deeply, something I've been trying to do.
[01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:09.023]  I still look like hell, but Dr. Group got out of his car this morning, same time I did, when he drove up from South Texas, and he said,
[01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:12.261]  You look a lot better.
[01:15:12.261 --> 01:15:13.863]  And every time he comes, he can see that.
[01:15:13.863 --> 01:15:15.325]  But everybody sees me on the streets.
[01:15:15.325 --> 01:15:15.785]  You name it.
[01:15:15.785 --> 01:15:21.211]  I still, you know, after 15 years of no exercise and eating like a pig and working 18 hours a day, I got wrecked.
[01:15:21.211 --> 01:15:25.996]  It's taken me four or five years to just try to get back to some semblance.
[01:15:25.996 --> 01:15:31.382]  But I can exercise less, work even harder now, and with the supplements he developed and that we've developed,
[01:15:32.123 --> 01:15:43.534]  I have been able to maintain and go to the next level and just really improve my quality of life with the super metal vitality, the survival shield x2, nascent iodine, the lung cleanse.
[01:15:43.534 --> 01:15:48.358]  When I can't get rid of a cold with antibiotics, I don't know why I took antibiotics this year, it didn't work.
[01:15:48.358 --> 01:15:50.060]  Bunch of colloidal silver, it worked.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.062]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:15:52.062 --> 01:15:53.704]  Now he's not here to infomercial today.
[01:15:54.304 --> 01:16:03.191]  But I am going to roll out a new product that he advised us on, but that is not a product that we're basically in business on.
[01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:07.015]  But he called it a bad-to-the-bone super product.
[01:16:08.376 --> 01:16:15.282]  To quote him earlier, giving us his assessment before we went live, calling it one of the best eye formulas he's ever seen.
[01:16:15.282 --> 01:16:17.344]  Because this is something I care about.
[01:16:17.344 --> 01:16:22.549]  You can keep, according to the medical literature, a lot of bad things happening with the proper nutrition with the eyes.
[01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:23.170]  That's a fact.
[01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:31.537]  We have a patented, very expensive ingredient in here that is known to do a lot of important things to the eye.
[01:16:32.599 --> 01:16:34.301]  And everybody knows what carrots do for the eye.
[01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:38.228]  Well, this is carrots squared, basically.
[01:16:38.228 --> 01:16:39.450]  And it's Occupower.
[01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.493]  We're going to talk about it later towards the end of the hour.
[01:16:41.493 --> 01:16:43.797]  Open your eyes, dietary supplement.
[01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:45.700]  It's more affordable than something like...
[01:16:46.653 --> 01:16:47.133]  We're good to go.
[01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:07.948]  Some of the same regenerative principles, but at a more affordable price.
[01:17:07.948 --> 01:17:11.289]  It's $29.95 for this, not $130 like DNA Force.
[01:17:11.289 --> 01:17:17.152]  By the way, DNA Force is a $600 formula with leading competitors, but ours is even stronger for $130.
[01:17:17.152 --> 01:17:18.833]  It's a nutraceutical.
[01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:29.217]  The stuff in it costs us $12,000 from Mitsubishi, developed right here in America, and is the only pure, true formula.
[01:17:29.217 --> 01:17:30.618]  We could buy cheaper Chinese forms.
[01:17:31.164 --> 01:17:33.967]  And it's patented only one type.
[01:17:33.967 --> 01:17:40.232]  This has something that's a lot less expensive, but that is patented as well, and I'm taking it.
[01:17:40.232 --> 01:17:41.273]  And that's one reason.
[01:17:41.273 --> 01:17:45.217]  We're going to skip this network break because I don't want to take any of Dr. Gribb's time here.
[01:17:45.217 --> 01:17:47.318]  But Dr. Gribb, you heard me just ranting about world events.
[01:17:47.318 --> 01:17:49.480]  I didn't mean to get into Occupower.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.203]  That is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:17:54.204 --> 01:18:17.440]  InfoWars.com forward slash eyes to find the subsection of the site where it's been since last week but I didn't want to roll it out and start you know in promoting it here on the air and endorse it until I had you here to break it down with us InfoWars.com forward slash eyes or you just go to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com and go to the supplement area to find it but let's since I
[01:18:18.396 --> 01:18:40.912]  Since I jumped the gun and prematurely launched here, just getting excited about Occupower, the supplement for the eyes that I just started taking a few months ago before it was even officially out, and I know you didn't come here today to really talk about this, but since you helped advise us on it, why do you call it a bad to the bone, super eye formula, or, I mean, those were your words, but break it down for me.
[01:18:41.573 --> 01:18:56.523]  Well, uh, you know, when you guys came to me and said, hey, we want an eye formula, I was, uh, started doing the research and I don't really need to do the research because I have people that call my office every single day that are having eye problems, macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucomas.
[01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:58.244]  I mean, we're in a situation now where
[01:18:58.684 --> 01:19:02.906]  Practically every person over the age of 40 has to have reading glasses.
[01:19:02.906 --> 01:19:06.328]  I mean look at all the laser surgeries that are out there.
[01:19:06.328 --> 01:19:07.209]  Look at all the glasses.
[01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:08.630]  My eyes have just started to go.
[01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.030]  Always had incredible vision.
[01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:14.573]  It is so bizarre to have them start to go a little bit and since I've been on this I've seen a difference.
[01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:20.814]  Right now, there's a major epidemic going on, especially with the over 40 individuals, males and females.
[01:19:20.814 --> 01:19:27.695]  And if you look at the eyes, it all boils back down to one thing, which is too many toxins, like we talk about, coming in and not enough coming out.
[01:19:27.695 --> 01:19:32.776]  I mean, the eyes especially are exposed to more damaging UV rays right now.
[01:19:32.776 --> 01:19:39.097]  They're also exposed to all the chemicals and everything in the chemtrails, all the chemicals leaking out of your pillow and everything else.
[01:19:39.097 --> 01:19:42.498]  And what's happening is people aren't cleaning their bloodstream enough.
[01:19:42.918 --> 01:20:07.514]  Their arteries are becoming clogged and the small tiny tiny tiny little veins in the eyes and the arteries in the eyes are becoming clogged a little bit and not providing the amount of oxygen and the nutrients that the eyes need to continue seeing really good like lutein and vitamin E and astaxanthin and some of the other compounds that we have in the ocular power and so
[01:20:08.863 --> 01:20:18.369]  Uh, because of the fact that I've had so many requests for it, and actually my aunt has been suffering for a long time from problems with her eyes.
[01:20:18.369 --> 01:20:20.050]  Aspartame eats your eyes.
[01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:25.954]  Aspartame, I mean, you know, it's a combination of all kinds of things, and especially, too, looking at computer screens all day long.
[01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:35.260]  I mean, I know people in their 20s and 30s right now that are having eye problems and they're seeing bad because... Well, I've seen the studies admitting that, especially the new screens, are frying our eyes.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:36.081]  What's happening there?
[01:20:36.661 --> 01:20:41.545]  Wi-Fi, electromagnetic frequencies, being next to... Eyes are very sensitive.
[01:20:41.545 --> 01:21:02.521]  You know, you have your rods and your cones in there, and we talked about that before on how sensitive the rods and the cones are, because the pineal gland also has rods and cones, and when you put in fluoride and chlorine and bromine and the other halogens, which the iodine helps remove, you also get calcification in the two areas, the pineal gland and the eyes, the rods and cones of the eyes.
[01:21:02.521 --> 01:21:04.483]  So those also need to be detoxified.
[01:21:05.273 --> 01:21:10.077]  When you guys came and said, hey, we want to do an eye formula, and I was basically like, well, let me help you out.
[01:21:10.077 --> 01:21:19.965]  You know, right now I'm busy with all the other stuff, but let's put together a formula that I would take on a regular basis and that I would feel comfortable sending people over here to buy for their eyes.
[01:21:19.965 --> 01:21:30.794]  Then I started looking at the different, you know, substances and found out that there really, again, is not some company out there that has all of these ingredients in one high-tech
[01:21:31.434 --> 01:21:32.154]  Formula.
[01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:43.836]  The reason Infowarslife.com is so popular is that we, with your help and others, we really do go out and try to make the best formula, the strongest formulas at the best prices.
[01:21:43.836 --> 01:21:49.577]  It's so bizarre how many supplements, now that I'm really getting into this, where the companies are just cheap.
[01:21:49.577 --> 01:21:54.718]  They don't want to spend fifty-something dollars on the ingredients into a bottle.
[01:21:54.718 --> 01:21:57.399]  They want to spend two dollars and tell you it's really expensive.
[01:21:58.223 --> 01:22:01.887]  I mean, they don't want to really give you all the stuff at Stone that's good for the eye.
[01:22:01.887 --> 01:22:03.409]  It's all marketing bull.
[01:22:03.409 --> 01:22:04.771]  I can't believe it.
[01:22:04.771 --> 01:22:06.873]  It's absolutely out of control.
[01:22:06.873 --> 01:22:09.957]  I mean, you know, there are some good companies out there.
[01:22:09.957 --> 01:22:16.424]  There are very, very few good companies out there that actually go through the quality control and the testing of the raw materials.
[01:22:17.205 --> 01:22:23.931]  I mean, just for, let's say, DNA force, I mean, Astragalus in there, I mean, there's a hundred different suppliers.
[01:22:23.931 --> 01:22:35.160]  You can get it from China for as low as $16 a kilogram, but yes, it's probably high in arsenic, lead, cadmium, all of the toxic chemicals, mercury, or you can get a clean U.S.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:35.460]  source
[01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:41.926]  You know, for maybe $30 a kilogram, there's a big difference when you're sourcing out raw materials for supplements.
[01:22:41.926 --> 01:22:48.191]  But still we do it, have to pay for the expensive testing, and still sometimes we find it's not in the California standard.
[01:22:48.191 --> 01:22:51.674]  It's basically impossible that they did it on purpose to shut down supplements.
[01:22:51.994 --> 01:22:57.956]  It can cost us up to $5,000 just to test each individual batch that comes off the line before and after.
[01:22:57.956 --> 01:22:58.996]  So here's what we're saying.
[01:22:58.996 --> 01:23:05.439]  Nobody's perfect, but we are neurotic to try to give you the absolute, over-the-top best.
[01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:09.440]  But in this contaminated world, it's not even... I mean, it's just... it's that insane.
[01:23:10.245 --> 01:23:11.386]  I've been talking to growers.
[01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:17.628]  I was just in California for 20 days and toured some of the organic farms and went up into the forest and talked to some people.
[01:23:17.628 --> 01:23:21.590]  The park services up there, they have no clue about Fukushima and what's happening.
[01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:27.112]  The herbalists and the medicinal people, they do, because the food shortages up there are going crazy.
[01:23:27.112 --> 01:23:28.973]  The drought is devastating things.
[01:23:28.973 --> 01:23:35.276]  I was in the Redwood Forest and 100 feet from me, a tree that was, you know, as big as a car just fell over.
[01:23:35.896 --> 01:23:45.765]  And the guys were telling me, yes, because of the radiation coming over and because of the drought and because of everything else affecting the land out here, it's like microwave energy.
[01:23:45.765 --> 01:23:49.768]  It's rotting the trees from the inside out and they're just falling over.
[01:23:49.768 --> 01:23:59.557]  And I was talking to an herbalist and she said, we can't even go in the forest anymore and wild craft a lot of these herbs because they're all dying back and there's not anything available.
[01:23:59.557 --> 01:24:01.959]  So people don't understand the
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:08.082]  Well, you listen to thousands of smokestacks and the totally dirty coal plants in China.
[01:24:08.082 --> 01:24:10.363]  The jet stream all rains down over the U.S.
[01:24:10.363 --> 01:24:11.063]  Exactly.
[01:24:11.063 --> 01:24:13.084]  I mean, just it's just.
[01:24:13.084 --> 01:24:15.144]  Well, I mean, we've shown the news reports for all over the country.
[01:24:15.144 --> 01:24:19.346]  Just aluminum dioxide in the soil is just is just killing the plants.
[01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:28.156]  I mean, this is causing the soil to become extremely acidic and all this getting sucked up into the trees.
[01:24:28.156 --> 01:24:34.686]  I mean, the land is unhealthy, the earth is unhealthy, the waters are contaminated, the air is contaminated.
[01:24:35.747 --> 01:24:50.517]  That's the reason why, you know, the only solution to this, which I always like to talk about solutions, is becoming educated and knowing what you need to do and what to protect yourself and protect your family, especially like stuff with Ebola and all these new things.
[01:24:50.517 --> 01:24:52.818]  There's always a lot of diversions, like what you were saying.
[01:24:52.818 --> 01:24:55.380]  There's a fight going on politically around the world.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.782]  There's a fight going on with health care around the world.
[01:24:57.782 --> 01:24:59.243]  There's a fight going on with
[01:25:00.023 --> 01:25:01.704]  You know, nuclear stuff around the world.
[01:25:01.704 --> 01:25:11.990]  There's all these different fights going on with pandemics and all this stuff coming together, which is just... The Earth is reaching its carrying capacity.
[01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:17.694]  And you'll hear that from the eugenicists, but there is a carrying capacity with the level of technology we've got now.
[01:25:17.694 --> 01:25:25.339]  Then the globalists are working to destabilize things, in their own words, to bring in the global crisis, so that we will then accept all their demands.
[01:25:26.179 --> 01:25:37.192]  This is a perfect storm of evil, because it's easier for them to ride and direct the crises, both created ones but ones that are naturally there, to get more power than to try to fix it.
[01:25:37.192 --> 01:25:38.834]  It's hard to fix things.
[01:25:38.834 --> 01:25:42.698]  Instead, they've just decided to make it as bad as they can, burn down the world,
[01:25:43.599 --> 01:25:46.523]  And then they will inherit it because they're posing as the savior.
[01:25:46.523 --> 01:25:47.444]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:25:47.444 --> 01:25:54.692]  I see what you're saying, but the good news in that it's not as hard as people think to fix things because you can look at the human body.
[01:25:54.692 --> 01:25:56.294]  It takes a beating over 40 years.
[01:25:56.294 --> 01:25:59.077]  It might take you 30 or 40 years with patients coming in.
[01:26:00.899 --> 01:26:05.625]  He's destroying their body with bad food and bad air and everything else.
[01:26:05.625 --> 01:26:09.169]  But the good news is we've been able to turn that around in less than 90 days.
[01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:11.452]  And we know that the liver regenerates in 90 days.
[01:26:11.452 --> 01:26:13.755]  The skin tissue regenerates in 24 hours.
[01:26:13.755 --> 01:26:18.280]  So you could completely destroy the body for 30 years straight and regenerate it.
[01:26:19.702 --> 01:26:30.385]  You know, a really good regeneration could happen in your body in 90 days of you just drinking water, eliminating all those toxic artificial sweeteners, the chemicals, all the other stuff that we talk about.
[01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.586]  That's right, I've only eliminated two!
[01:26:32.586 --> 01:26:35.027]  The earth can clean itself really fast as well.
[01:26:35.027 --> 01:26:39.949]  So there is a good, positive solution if we just look at how we regenerate.
[01:26:39.949 --> 01:26:42.990]  The plants regenerate the same way, the water regenerates.
[01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:47.271]  We just have to eliminate all the stuff that's actually killing us and poisoning us.
[01:26:48.507 --> 01:26:50.949]  Undoubtedly the government is engaged in geoengineering.
[01:26:50.949 --> 01:27:07.044]  I've talked to meteorologists on air, multiple meteorologists that have been on TV shows, on news, and they said, now clearly there's planes off the coast, the West Coast, spraying to block weather fronts and to knock that Pacific moisture down.
[01:27:07.044 --> 01:27:08.346]  What's the long-term plan?
[01:27:09.699 --> 01:27:15.001]  of the globalists to turn California into a desert.
[01:27:15.001 --> 01:27:30.489]  I mean, I guess they're going to run everybody out and make it collapse and then come back in and I guess turn the water back on because even Klamath Falls and other areas where lakes are full of water, they'll just dump it in the ocean and redirect it over some sucker fish that isn't even indigenous.
[01:27:30.489 --> 01:27:31.709]  So the farmers go bankrupt.
[01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:33.530]  This has been going on for 10 years.
[01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:37.552]  I mean, at every level they are systematically trying to bankrupt us.
[01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:42.228]  Well, you've got to remember that most of the food's grown in California, too.
[01:27:42.228 --> 01:27:45.870]  So, you know, when there's a food... And food prices are going through the roof right now.
[01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:47.230]  They're attacking our breadbasket.
[01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:47.610]  They are.
[01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:49.031]  I mean, I've talked to restaurant suppliers.
[01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:55.973]  I was on the phone with one of the main guys at, uh... I'm not going to say the name of the restaurant, but it's a higher-end restaurant that's all around the world.
[01:27:55.973 --> 01:28:03.956]  And he said they're having an extremely hard time right now with beef and pork and all the commodities because they're in such short supply and they're raising the price.
[01:28:03.956 --> 01:28:05.997]  Steaks are now $50.
[01:28:05.997 --> 01:28:08.258]  Putting them out of business completely.
[01:28:09.022 --> 01:28:09.743]  Really?
[01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.564]  Yes.
[01:28:11.564 --> 01:28:13.886]  Yes.
[01:28:13.886 --> 01:28:15.287]  I mean, look at it.
[01:28:15.287 --> 01:28:15.608]  What?
[01:28:15.608 --> 01:28:22.714]  You need how many gallons per day for a cow to, you know, a cow needs to drink something like 30 gallons of water a day or something like that.
[01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:27.038]  They don't have any, you know, the droughts, the chemicals.
[01:28:27.038 --> 01:28:28.899]  What are the cows eating right now?
[01:28:28.899 --> 01:28:36.165]  The grass, which is contaminated with aluminum oxides and everything, they're being shot up with hormones so they can get ready to butcher in one year instead of three.
[01:28:36.866 --> 01:28:44.291]  You know, the pigs are contaminated because they're being fed a bunch of GMO food, as well as the cows.
[01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:54.157]  I mean, sooner or later it's going to come to a breaking point, and then you're going to have that all roll over into the restaurants and into the human situation.
[01:28:54.157 --> 01:29:03.623]  So, yeah, I mean, restaurant, the food supply, we all know that the food supply, and that's one of the mechanisms of many that is done by design
[01:29:04.503 --> 01:29:09.765]  To make you more dependent, fear and make you more dependent and make you more sick.
[01:29:09.765 --> 01:29:11.746]  And then who does the government demonize?
[01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:14.647]  Anybody that tries to get off the grid and be self-sufficient.
[01:29:14.647 --> 01:29:16.027]  That's who they watch.
[01:29:16.027 --> 01:29:18.068]  So what's the plan?
[01:29:18.068 --> 01:29:20.869]  Why do they want us totally dependent as they turn the resources off?
[01:29:21.924 --> 01:29:23.826]  It has to do with Agenda 21.
[01:29:23.826 --> 01:29:25.587]  I mean, you know, they want districts.
[01:29:25.587 --> 01:29:27.088]  They want agricultural districts.
[01:29:27.088 --> 01:29:28.369]  They want capital districts.
[01:29:28.369 --> 01:29:29.310]  They want all the districts.
[01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:30.251]  And they want control.
[01:29:30.251 --> 01:29:32.192]  And they want to control the population.
[01:29:32.192 --> 01:29:33.713]  Which is also in Rollerball.
[01:29:33.713 --> 01:29:36.195]  Yeah, they want you dependent upon them for everything.
[01:29:36.195 --> 01:29:37.596]  I mean, that's all in Club of Rome.
[01:29:37.596 --> 01:29:43.521]  When you see Rollerball, or you see or read Hunger Games, that's art imitating life.
[01:29:44.621 --> 01:29:48.043]  See, folks, we're not here saying it's, you know, we're not copying Hunger Games.
[01:29:48.043 --> 01:29:49.084]  Well, this is The Hunger Games.
[01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:49.684]  We'll be back.
[01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:50.224]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.406 --> 01:30:06.569]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:08.911]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:08.911 --> 01:30:14.193]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:14.193 --> 01:30:19.356]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:19.356 --> 01:30:22.397]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:22.677 --> 01:30:26.760]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.083]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:31.083 --> 01:30:41.309]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:41.309 --> 01:30:43.831]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:52.244]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:30:52.244 --> 01:30:56.210]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:59.392 --> 01:31:05.561]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:31:05.561 --> 01:31:10.128]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:31:10.128 --> 01:31:14.695]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:18.016]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:31:18.016 --> 01:31:23.459]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:23.459 --> 01:31:30.842]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:31:30.842 --> 01:31:34.983]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:31:34.983 --> 01:31:40.106]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:40.106 --> 01:31:40.946]  This is innovating.
[01:31:41.226 --> 01:31:48.713]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:31:48.713 --> 01:31:52.977]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:31:52.977 --> 01:31:58.162]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:32:00.307 --> 01:32:01.667]  In the near future.
[01:32:01.667 --> 01:32:06.149]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:07.369]  Security alert.
[01:32:07.369 --> 01:32:09.389]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:09.389 --> 01:32:13.090]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:17.972]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:17.972 --> 01:32:20.552]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:20.552 --> 01:32:23.413]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:26.654]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:26.654 --> 01:32:28.955]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:28.955 --> 01:32:29.655]  These people are a
[01:32:29.895 --> 01:32:36.539]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[01:32:36.539 --> 01:32:39.481]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[01:33:02.926 --> 01:33:21.693]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:33.093]  I want to get into Ebola.
[01:33:33.093 --> 01:33:36.075]  Ebola epidemic and how to protect yourself from an outbreak.
[01:33:36.075 --> 01:33:38.057]  Solutions to stopping the Ebola outbreak.
[01:33:38.057 --> 01:33:41.340]  Insane supplement laws and new regulations in foods.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.601]  Prop 65.
[01:33:42.601 --> 01:33:52.390]  As they poison the environment, they then make everything illegal to eat at literally impossible levels where there's more lead in the air than is in supplements or...
[01:33:54.625 --> 01:33:56.406]  A potato.
[01:33:56.406 --> 01:34:01.229]  We're gonna talk about immune system power versus vaccines and how to boost your natural immunity.
[01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:07.772]  Other threats such as ticks that make you allergic to meat.
[01:34:07.772 --> 01:34:11.654]  We're gonna talk about it all briefly.
[01:34:11.654 --> 01:34:14.176]  We come out with new products.
[01:34:14.176 --> 01:34:16.917]  A lot of times they're so popular they sell out right away.
[01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:22.180]  We sold out of the DNA Force in less than four hours.
[01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:27.252]  That had been available.
[01:34:27.252 --> 01:34:37.142]  This new Occupower, ladies and gentlemen, we have a limited supply, a little bit more than we had of the DNA Force because it's less expensive.
[01:34:37.142 --> 01:34:39.544]  We could afford to buy more of it.
[01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:45.413]  But at the rate it's selling, it'll be sold out within about two to three days.
[01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.655]  And I want to get your reviews of Occupower.
[01:34:47.655 --> 01:34:51.578]  I want you to tell me, you know, obviously how it worked for you.
[01:34:51.578 --> 01:34:59.164]  But it is just filled with the organic, highest quality, basic things like vitamin A, zinc.
[01:35:00.244 --> 01:35:06.527]  Ibrite Herb Extract, Bilberry Fruit Extract, and then I can't even pronounce all these others.
[01:35:06.527 --> 01:35:09.389]  In... How do you pronounce that?
[01:35:09.389 --> 01:35:11.590]  In... Ziaxanthin.
[01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:13.951]  It also has... That's the one that's... Zaxanthin.
[01:35:13.951 --> 01:35:17.433]  It's got the... Bilberry in there.
[01:35:17.433 --> 01:35:23.436]  The Blackcurrant Fruit Extract, and then this patented one, that's the Saffron Bulb Extract.
[01:35:23.436 --> 01:35:24.897]  Saffireal is what they call it.
[01:35:24.897 --> 01:35:25.237]  Yep.
[01:35:25.237 --> 01:35:26.998]  The concentration of the saffron bulb.
[01:35:28.376 --> 01:35:32.201]  I mean, all in all, you're looking at the best things to support eye health.
[01:35:32.201 --> 01:35:40.572]  I mean, look, the way the world's going right now, you know, and if there's going to be a revolution or whatever, I mean, think of all the people that are firing guns.
[01:35:40.572 --> 01:35:43.495]  They're definitely going to need to have good eyesight, that's for sure.
[01:35:44.556 --> 01:35:46.979]  When it comes down to it, our body is built to this stuff.
[01:35:46.979 --> 01:35:50.041]  It's not in the over-farmed foods out there.
[01:35:50.041 --> 01:35:52.363]  That's admitted.
[01:35:52.363 --> 01:36:03.673]  We're trying to bring people the super supplements that also fund this operation so we can have the reporters cover Ferguson and change the course of the entire events and expose what's really going on there.
[01:36:03.673 --> 01:36:06.396]  Infowars is the tip of the spear, so it's a win-win.
[01:36:06.396 --> 01:36:07.817]  You get high-quality products.
[01:36:08.257 --> 01:36:23.480]  At extremely affordable prices, and you support hardcore First Amendment, pro-liberty media when you buy Occupower, Survival Shield, X2, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, and all the other great products.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:28.461]  Dr. Group, you've also developed something that I call the secret sauce that I can't wait till we're ready to roll it out.
[01:36:28.461 --> 01:36:30.661]  Don't tell people what it is yet.
[01:36:30.661 --> 01:36:33.462]  That I can be exhausted at 10 o'clock at night about to do a radio interview.
[01:36:34.648 --> 01:36:39.471]  And in the old days, I'd just go drink half a bottle of red wine, that would kind of wake me up, because alcohol has a stimulant effect.
[01:36:39.471 --> 01:36:40.712]  Now I don't do that.
[01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:56.863]  I take three squirts of, it's not even a stimulant, I'm not going to tell you what it is yet, but it's, you guys have been able to change the molecular structure of something that's very well known, and I've taken it before, other brands, and it's had some effect.
[01:36:58.001 --> 01:37:01.867]  Undoubtedly, this should be sold as the ultimate energy drink.
[01:37:01.867 --> 01:37:06.293]  But we're not going to have it as an energy drink, but people are going to want to get this and put it in an energy drink.
[01:37:06.293 --> 01:37:09.898]  It's actually something that's very, very, very good for you, and you might pay...
[01:37:11.306 --> 01:37:16.188]  Up to $200 for an injection of this at different places around the world.
[01:37:16.188 --> 01:37:17.409]  Don't give it away!
[01:37:17.409 --> 01:37:22.371]  Nobody's put these two ingredients together that's actually what you need.
[01:37:22.371 --> 01:37:26.873]  It's like having three cups of coffee, but it doesn't give you the jitters.
[01:37:26.873 --> 01:37:33.175]  How many people do you know that are just run down and not having enough energy and not being able to sleep properly?
[01:37:33.175 --> 01:37:34.096]  And believe it or not,
[01:37:34.716 --> 01:37:50.420]  What this is, I would say probably a good 50 to 75% of the people, probably even more than that, I'd probably say 90% of the people on the planet are deficient in these nutrients that we're putting in this formula.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:56.321]  It's just like iodine, you know, you can study a hundred people and 99 of them are going to be deficient in iodine.
[01:37:56.741 --> 01:38:09.864]  Well, that's what the scientists, as you know, discovered about areas in Japan and the mountains, and areas in Italy and places, where you would just have tons of people living to 105, 110, and even the unhealthy guys that smoke cigarettes living to 90.
[01:38:09.864 --> 01:38:17.986]  And it was because they had volcanic soil that was the right kind of volcanic soil to give them all the essential trace elements and minerals that they needed.
[01:38:17.986 --> 01:38:24.568]  Then the plants were growing in that as well, so it was then in a bioavailable form for the body.
[01:38:25.248 --> 01:38:30.572]  But most people don't live in those areas or they're not getting fruits and vegetables from those areas.
[01:38:30.572 --> 01:38:31.673]  That's a basic.
[01:38:31.673 --> 01:38:38.698]  And then you get into the superfoods and the super nutrients and the things that are in DNA Force and in the Occupower.
[01:38:38.698 --> 01:38:39.818]  It's just not out there.
[01:38:39.818 --> 01:38:44.862]  I mean, you were talking about the DNA Force that you developed for us.
[01:38:44.862 --> 01:38:47.644]  That particular extract you were saying was the equivalent of how many blueberries?
[01:38:48.914 --> 01:38:57.744]  About 500 cases of blueberries would be the equivalent of the Pitero Pure and it's an extract from the blueberries.
[01:38:57.744 --> 01:38:59.826]  Is that per bottle or per pill?
[01:38:59.826 --> 01:39:01.708]  I think it's per serving.
[01:39:01.708 --> 01:39:02.189]  Per serving.
[01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.970]  So two pills?
[01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:03.631]  Yep.
[01:39:03.631 --> 01:39:04.271]  Two pills.
[01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:04.772]  Or capsules.
[01:39:04.952 --> 01:39:05.912]  That's pretty powerful.
[01:39:05.912 --> 01:39:15.937]  I mean, it's, you know, anytime I do anything, I always make sure it's the best out there because I personally don't want there to be a product out there anywhere on the market that's better.
[01:39:15.937 --> 01:39:16.538]  That's right.
[01:39:16.538 --> 01:39:22.220]  Our whole future, knowing how we're under scrutiny especially, is about being absolutely neurotic.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:26.322]  But still, this world's so crazy, you know, they can take anything and try to make it something down the road.
[01:39:26.322 --> 01:39:27.303]  We expect that.
[01:39:27.303 --> 01:39:28.443]  We expect to be attacked.
[01:39:28.443 --> 01:39:31.785]  But we are literally working around the clock to bring you the best.
[01:39:32.236 --> 01:39:32.536]  Right.
[01:39:32.536 --> 01:39:42.008]  I mean, all of the products that I develop, if you look at the reviews, which have four, five, six hundred reviews for you online, they're all five star, four and a half star.
[01:39:42.008 --> 01:39:46.914]  I mean, you know, that is unheard of in the nutraceutical industry.
[01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:50.699]  That's why we've got some of the biggest names calling us, wanting to basically merge with us or buy us.
[01:39:50.979 --> 01:39:51.399]  Right.
[01:39:51.399 --> 01:40:00.481]  I mean, it's so hard to do something that's going to be so effective on a broad range of people, from 15-year-olds up to 100-year-olds.
[01:40:00.481 --> 01:40:14.005]  I mean, you know, considering the fact that every single person has different psychological profiles, every single person has different exercise patterns, every person has different dietary habits, they all have a different environment in which they live.
[01:40:14.665 --> 01:40:15.606]  We're all different.
[01:40:15.606 --> 01:40:17.587]  Some of us get an hour of sun every day.
[01:40:17.587 --> 01:40:19.568]  Some of us get no sun every day.
[01:40:19.568 --> 01:40:20.568]  Some of us eat healthy.
[01:40:20.568 --> 01:40:21.729]  Some of us don't eat healthy.
[01:40:21.729 --> 01:40:32.755]  So it's hard to be able to develop something because based on the amount of absorption that you're going to have, considering your current state of health, how clean is your body?
[01:40:32.755 --> 01:40:37.358]  You could take a nutritional supplement, but your body is so out of whack because you're eating GMO food.
[01:40:37.358 --> 01:40:43.802]  Well, everybody knows I still work sometimes all night and still eat some bad stuff, but I've cut back a lot.
[01:40:44.702 --> 01:41:00.593]  Literally, when I started getting on your supplements, and I was already taking some really great ones, the Yongevity products, InfoWars, Health.com, they're awesome as well, but yours is, I guess you go look at what the key things are that people haven't really recognized that are hiding in plain view.
[01:41:00.593 --> 01:41:01.514]  I mean, take the iodine.
[01:41:01.514 --> 01:41:02.455]  That's so simple.
[01:41:03.359 --> 01:41:07.083]  I mean, I was really getting into iodine previously because Ben Fuchs and others had told me to get into it.
[01:41:07.083 --> 01:41:10.566]  It was helping me, but it would give me stomach aches.
[01:41:10.566 --> 01:41:14.469]  It wasn't, most of the stuff out there isn't real nascent iodine.
[01:41:14.469 --> 01:41:17.773]  And, you know, it turns black or red on paper.
[01:41:17.773 --> 01:41:19.855]  Ours is red, but it turns electric blue.
[01:41:19.855 --> 01:41:24.199]  Well, because it's from the real electric blue crystals.
[01:41:25.464 --> 01:41:28.727]  There's nothing, you know, we always look for purity, too.
[01:41:28.727 --> 01:41:29.267]  I mean, you know.
[01:41:29.267 --> 01:41:33.271]  Yeah, but no one else has the X2 electric blue crystals.
[01:41:33.271 --> 01:41:37.855]  I mean, why was it you that went out and got a deep earth source, not a sea source?
[01:41:37.855 --> 01:41:39.537]  I mean, everyone's so damn lazy.
[01:41:39.537 --> 01:41:41.939]  Excuse my, excuse me, Lord, for taking that, I didn't mean that in vain.
[01:41:41.939 --> 01:41:44.561]  It's just people are so lazy.
[01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:46.123]  I want to innovate.
[01:41:46.123 --> 01:41:48.505]  I want to bring people the most incredible stuff.
[01:41:49.801 --> 01:41:50.722]  I'm the same way.
[01:41:50.722 --> 01:41:56.986]  I mean, if there's a million... Well, no, that's why we work with you, but you found the crystal source.
[01:41:56.986 --> 01:41:59.567]  Why had no one else done that?
[01:41:59.567 --> 01:42:12.315]  Because the first thing that people do, formulators, first of all, formulators most of the time are just individuals that have a little bit of a nutraceutical experience, and this is what they do.
[01:42:12.315 --> 01:42:16.318]  Let's say the president of the company says, we need an eye formula.
[01:42:17.158 --> 01:42:31.382]  We have a registered dietician, we have somebody that was trained in the standard modern system of medicine, which you can't have that because they're going to look at synthetic vitamins and everything they learn in biochemistry and nutrition courses.
[01:42:31.382 --> 01:42:38.764]  And what they're going to do, and this is broad spectrum across the board, I've talked to many nutritional formulators that supposedly out there are the best.
[01:42:39.755 --> 01:42:43.476]  They look on, they say, the president says, we want an eye formula.
[01:42:43.476 --> 01:42:47.918]  So what that person does is looks online and looks at all the different eye formulas out there.
[01:42:47.918 --> 01:42:51.159]  Makes a whole ingredient list of what everybody else is using.
[01:42:51.159 --> 01:42:57.261]  And then takes four or five of those ingredients and mixes them up so their formula is not exactly the same as the other one.
[01:42:57.941 --> 01:42:58.101]  I don't
[01:43:19.565 --> 01:43:30.253]  You know, for DNA Force, people call and say, well, I can get one of these ingredients online for $20, but I can't find any other supplement that has more than two of these ingredients together in the same formula.
[01:43:30.253 --> 01:43:36.698]  Well, yeah, that's why it's so expensive, because you put seven or eight of the world's leading researched
[01:43:37.904 --> 01:43:42.828]  Yeah, because it's patented.
[01:43:42.828 --> 01:43:47.893]  I mean, we're buying this stuff from companies that sell to pharmaceutical giants.
[01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:03.695]  If you were to do the mark... You're saying some formulas, though, are 600?
[01:44:03.695 --> 01:44:05.936]  Some formulas are 600 a bottle.
[01:44:05.936 --> 01:44:06.917]  Yes.
[01:44:06.917 --> 01:44:13.700]  But what I'm saying is, you're still, you know, because the whole mission that I have is the same mission that you have.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:14.801]  To help the Earth.
[01:44:14.801 --> 01:44:18.203]  To give people the solutions they need to take care of their own health.
[01:44:18.203 --> 01:44:20.064]  To keep their immune system strong.
[01:44:20.064 --> 01:44:23.045]  To prevent all these things from damaging their body.
[01:44:23.045 --> 01:44:24.446]  To keep their mind sharp.
[01:44:24.446 --> 01:44:25.567]  To keep their eyes sharp.
[01:44:26.147 --> 01:44:31.330]  To keep their body decreased, to keep their self-healing mechanism working.
[01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:39.435]  And notice, why do we have to buy this from a major Japanese company based in America, that everybody knows the name of, just one of the ingredients?
[01:44:39.435 --> 01:44:43.257]  It's because the Japanese elite, you can read it in their newspapers, are obsessed with this gobbling it.
[01:44:43.257 --> 01:44:45.679]  Because they want to live.
[01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:49.401]  But they're gobbling the individual ingredient, not putting it all together.
[01:44:50.097 --> 01:44:50.980]  Like we're doing.
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:51.220]  Right.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.286]  Because that's where a lot of the research comes from is Japan.
[01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:55.894]  It's like what happens with the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:44:55.894 --> 01:44:56.937]  They find a plant...
[01:44:57.864 --> 01:45:09.172]  They take one ingredient out, an active ingredient, and they synthesize it, and it ends up destroying the body and covering up the scent, never working on the root cause of the problem, and it makes you even worse.
[01:45:09.172 --> 01:45:13.095]  There's a synergistic relationship with herbs and with compounds.
[01:45:13.095 --> 01:45:18.419]  Each individual herb might have 20 different compounds in there.
[01:45:18.419 --> 01:45:20.541]  Why do you think those 20 compounds are there?
[01:45:20.541 --> 01:45:22.963]  Because they have to work together in unison.
[01:45:22.963 --> 01:45:24.384]  If you take 10 of them out,
[01:45:26.226 --> 01:45:34.435]  Then you might be, in most cases, reducing the ability of that herb to work.
[01:45:34.435 --> 01:45:45.066]  Now, with DNA Force and some of the stuff that we do, we use the full-spectrum herbs or we use individual ingredients combined with other individual ingredients that are going to enhance the effect
[01:45:45.666 --> 01:45:47.908]  Of those other ingredients.
[01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:49.549]  So these all work together.
[01:45:49.549 --> 01:45:54.372]  We're not going to put something in there that's going to block the action of this or alter the action of this.
[01:45:54.372 --> 01:45:54.952]  Absolutely.
[01:45:54.952 --> 01:46:00.956]  So Occuforce is a Rolls-Royce quality product at an extremely affordable price.
[01:46:00.956 --> 01:46:01.016]  $29.95.
[01:46:01.016 --> 01:46:02.977]  It will sell out in the next few days.
[01:46:02.977 --> 01:46:04.758]  And I appreciate all your support out there.
[01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.259]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:09.682]  Then we'll do our best in Phase 2 to get enough of the products.
[01:46:10.282 --> 01:46:10.622]  I don't know.
[01:46:37.062 --> 01:46:41.523]  We've now built up to this major launch level against the globalists.
[01:46:41.523 --> 01:46:47.005]  And, you know, we expect all sorts of attacks, and we've been dealing with those as well, but that's part of this war.
[01:46:47.005 --> 01:46:49.286]  And we're learning as we go.
[01:46:49.286 --> 01:46:51.346]  I just want to thank all of you for your support.
[01:46:51.346 --> 01:46:57.168]  Infowarslife.com, Occupower, a dietary supplement for the eyes.
[01:46:57.168 --> 01:46:58.569]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:58.569 --> 01:47:01.910]  Now let's hurry here, Dr. Gribb, and get through these points here.
[01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:06.395]  And go over these issues we haven't gotten to.
[01:47:06.395 --> 01:47:06.956]  Ebola.
[01:47:06.956 --> 01:47:09.639]  They're now declaring martial law in multiple countries.
[01:47:09.639 --> 01:47:11.482]  Let me find my Ebola stack.
[01:47:11.482 --> 01:47:18.291]  They've got riot police on the streets in areas of Africa trying to contain it.
[01:47:18.291 --> 01:47:20.273]  This is definitely the biggest Ebola outbreak.
[01:47:20.974 --> 01:47:21.594]  Uh, ever.
[01:47:21.594 --> 01:47:25.996]  But I've seen the reports that just having proper hydration and things in U.S.
[01:47:25.996 --> 01:47:29.276]  hospitals cuts it from a 90 plus percent death rate down to 50.
[01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:42.180]  Uh, what are some of the things, not just for Ebola, but flesh eating bacteria, MRSA, all these threats emerging out of modern medical medicine, uh, that's helping mutate these viruses and bacteria in many cases.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:44.261]  What are some of the basic things on Ebola epidemic?
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:51.726]  Most of these, uh, organisms, as you know, are, uh, bioweapons that, uh, are created.
[01:47:51.726 --> 01:47:56.951]  And from the sources that I've, uh, talked to, uh, because my phones have been ringing off the hook, too, what do we do about this?
[01:47:56.951 --> 01:48:01.175]  So many people in the U.S., because of the fear-mongering thing, are worried about it transferring.
[01:48:01.175 --> 01:48:03.658]  Lyme disease did come from Plum Island.
[01:48:03.658 --> 01:48:04.258]  Absolutely.
[01:48:04.258 --> 01:48:05.760]  From a bioweapons lab, on record.
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.062]  It's tick-borne syphilis.
[01:48:08.442 --> 01:48:14.389]  Actually, the influenza virus kills more people a year than, and is more contagious than the Ebola.
[01:48:14.389 --> 01:48:18.094]  But from what we know about this Ebola strain, it did come from a U.S.
[01:48:18.094 --> 01:48:21.858]  bioweapons, well, it's not confirmed, but this is just what I'm hearing.
[01:48:21.858 --> 01:48:22.739]  It did come from a U.S.
[01:48:22.739 --> 01:48:24.621]  bioweapons lab in Kenema.
[01:48:25.462 --> 01:48:51.383]  uh... and and what it's uh... it's it's altered itself so it's not so rapid you know that the old Ebola that you got you would die very rapidly so now that the viruses have a way of kind of changing themselves giving up a little bit of this and taking a little bit of that this one seems to have a longer incubation period so that in order for that to happen that means it's going to spread more readily and more readily and you've mentioned the study with the pigs and the monkeys with
[01:48:51.923 --> 01:48:52.963]  It's airborne.
[01:48:52.963 --> 01:48:58.464]  It's going airborne in air droplets and the mainstream media is saying, well, you know, it's not airborne.
[01:48:58.464 --> 01:49:00.745]  The point is it's making that journey now.
[01:49:00.745 --> 01:49:02.165]  It's becoming airborne.
[01:49:02.165 --> 01:49:02.525]  Yes.
[01:49:02.525 --> 01:49:12.207]  And I actually know of a study going on right now in Africa where they're giving colloidal silver in two to three mils every single hour.
[01:49:12.207 --> 01:49:16.548]  And it's in a location and they're actually having pretty good success with it.
[01:49:17.228 --> 01:49:21.129]  And I will be coming out with a program here fairly soon, which I'll share with you.
[01:49:21.129 --> 01:49:22.610]  You can post on your website.
[01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:30.752]  But the gist of it is, these are the things that are going to work the best to protect and to strengthen your immune system and that are very strong antivirals.
[01:49:30.752 --> 01:49:35.154]  Colloidal Silver and about a 10 part per million solution.
[01:49:35.974 --> 01:49:38.916]  Chaparral works really good as an antiviral.
[01:49:38.916 --> 01:49:42.558]  Oregano oil works really good as an antiviral.
[01:49:42.558 --> 01:49:45.941]  And a product called MMS works really good as an antiviral.
[01:49:45.941 --> 01:49:58.549]  The MMS is a miracle mineral supplement and it's basically you take a chlorine, it's not chlorine that actually harms you, but it's converted to chlorine dioxide in your body.
[01:49:59.289 --> 01:50:02.951]  And it's a very strong, fast antiviral.
[01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:14.158]  Now, of course, you know, the Gates Foundation and everything else, which is a whole other story, is planning on coming out with a vaccine in 2015, just like we talked about a month ago when Ebola was just happening.
[01:50:14.158 --> 01:50:16.399]  And you were saying, well, what's the story behind Ebola?
[01:50:16.399 --> 01:50:20.582]  I said, well, we're probably going to see a vaccine coming out here sometime shortly.
[01:50:20.582 --> 01:50:23.424]  So, you know, the big question is,
[01:50:24.325 --> 01:50:31.121]  What is in the vaccine and what is the long-term effects of this Ebola?
[01:50:32.845 --> 01:50:35.486]  Whoever receives the vaccines, what are they putting in the vaccine?
[01:50:35.486 --> 01:50:38.066]  And by the way, guess who else is involved with Bill and Melinda Gates?
[01:50:38.066 --> 01:50:39.106]  Monsanto.
[01:50:39.106 --> 01:50:40.106]  Monsanto.
[01:50:40.106 --> 01:50:42.847]  Is behind, we just put that article on screen.
[01:50:42.847 --> 01:50:44.487]  Ebola outbreak, can it be controlled?
[01:50:44.487 --> 01:50:50.188]  Monsanto invests in Ebola treatment drug company as pandemic spreads.
[01:50:50.188 --> 01:50:56.349]  And of course, the foot and mouth that was weaponized in England in 2001, we said it was government weaponized.
[01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:59.590]  It turned out it was weaponized government and was released by the government.

[01:54:16.966 --> 01:54:17.426]  We've got
[01:54:30.518 --> 01:54:34.421]  Richard Gage of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth with a lot of breaking information.
[01:54:34.421 --> 01:54:37.083]  He was just on C-SPAN a few weeks ago.
[01:54:37.083 --> 01:54:38.463]  Joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:54:38.463 --> 01:54:43.147]  I want to open the phones up for the next 30 minutes, the first half of the next hour.
[01:54:43.147 --> 01:54:55.055]  The toll-free number if you have a herbal question, a question about Ebola, anything with Dr. Group who really is an extremely informed person.
[01:54:56.616 --> 01:55:03.279]  Or if you'd like to give us your take or your breakdown on any of the Infowarslife.com products, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:55:03.279 --> 01:55:03.380]  800-259-9231.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:07.021]  You know, Dr. Group, I love how they allow the FDA melamine to a certain level, a pretty high level,
[01:55:22.031 --> 01:55:27.811]  And that headlines the Associated Press a few years ago with the Chinese melamine scare of don't worry some melamine isn't bad for you.
[01:55:28.826 --> 01:55:35.368]  And they would allow bisphenol A, and they would allow hundreds of chemicals from the factories that they call fluoride.
[01:55:35.368 --> 01:55:36.628]  It's not just fluoride.
[01:55:36.628 --> 01:55:40.569]  That's what always gets medical doctors and people that were for it to go, wait, now I'm against it.
[01:55:40.569 --> 01:55:48.872]  For those that don't know, it's all over the news in Canada, Europe, you name it, where they're taking the fluoride out in England, in most cities, because they're going, what's the supply?
[01:55:48.872 --> 01:55:52.673]  I know we need calcium fluoride, but this is hydrofluorosilicic?
[01:55:52.673 --> 01:55:54.353]  And then it's hundreds of other things?
[01:55:54.353 --> 01:55:56.294]  It's just toxic waste that we pay to drink.
[01:55:57.219 --> 01:56:05.564]  So they do that, but then, oh my gosh, we've got this Prop 65 in California.
[01:56:05.564 --> 01:56:14.269]  Explain that to people, because then it makes it literally impossible for people to basically get almost every supplement there is.
[01:56:14.269 --> 01:56:16.170]  Explain the numbers to folks.
[01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:23.754]  Prop 65 in California was a team of attorneys that basically got together and wanted to
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:35.042]  Pass a law restricting the amount of lead in anything, really, from glassware to lawnmowers to whatever you were going to purchase.
[01:56:35.042 --> 01:56:47.084]  The problem is they kind of misled the individuals during voting and they basically said, you know, vote for Prop 65 to protect yourself from excess levels of lead or anything like that.
[01:56:47.084 --> 01:56:50.645]  They set the limits at 0.5 micrograms per gram of lead.
[01:56:51.505 --> 01:57:09.843]  Which means that after Prop 65 got signed in by the government of California, then every single company that produced anything got sued by these ravenous attorneys everywhere that just wanted to take advantage of it and get as much money as they possibly could out of this.
[01:57:10.905 --> 01:57:21.651]  All the nutraceutical companies, all the food suppliers got sued, all the glassware, because crystal and glass has high levels of lead, they all got sued.
[01:57:21.651 --> 01:57:23.893]  Ammunition got sued, companies.
[01:57:23.893 --> 01:57:28.836]  I mean, you name it, and practically every commodity and everything in California has been sued since.
[01:57:30.979 --> 01:57:33.401]  Basically, let me take that a step back.
[01:57:33.401 --> 01:57:50.495]  They had to put a warning, basically they had to test all their products, and if your product contained over 0.5 micrograms of lead, then you could use one specific warning, which basically said that this product is known to cause birth defects and reproductive harm.
[01:57:50.495 --> 01:57:55.720]  If a product was over one something percent lead, you had to say this product is known to cause cancer!
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.681]  But here's the issue, though.
[01:57:57.681 --> 01:58:03.065]  There's more of it in the air, or in an apple, than in the cleanest supplements out there.
[01:58:03.065 --> 01:58:07.047]  So they knew they were setting a standard to be able to shut everything down selectively.
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:30.323]  ...shouldn't be pertained to food, and so Whole Foods is in a lawsuit with them.
[01:58:30.323 --> 01:58:31.024]  But let's explain.
[01:58:31.024 --> 01:58:38.090]  That means if something has less than one part per million, they're saying it's bad.
[01:58:38.090 --> 01:58:38.831]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:58:38.831 --> 01:58:40.012]  We're gonna come right back.
[01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:42.193]  Dr. Gribbs, our guest, InfoWars.com.
[01:58:42.193 --> 01:58:43.595]  We're gonna take your phone calls.
[01:58:43.595 --> 01:58:43.675]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:43.675 --> 01:58:45.096]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:58:49.855 --> 01:58:56.025]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:58:56.025 --> 01:59:00.592]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:00.592 --> 01:59:05.159]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:05.539 --> 01:59:08.480]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:13.923]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:59:13.923 --> 01:59:21.306]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:59:21.306 --> 01:59:25.448]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:59:25.448 --> 01:59:30.230]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:38.992]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:59:38.992 --> 01:59:43.433]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:59:52.576 --> 01:59:54.956]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.956 --> 01:59:57.757]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.595 --> 02:00:10.417]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.417 --> 02:00:12.018]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.018 --> 02:00:13.579]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.579 --> 02:00:17.761]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.761 --> 02:00:22.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.963 --> 02:00:32.228]  Alright, you hadn't gotten to the zinger yet, but we'll start going to some phone calls.
[02:00:32.228 --> 02:00:33.769]  Dr. Ed Griggs, our guest here.
[02:00:35.822 --> 02:00:39.865]  The California standards, correct me if I'm wrong, are 10 times the federal.
[02:00:39.865 --> 02:00:54.957]  Well, the federal standards, the FDA and the USDA, all the federal standards when they test for metals or any type of toxins require less than 10 parts per million or 10 micrograms per gram or something like that.
[02:00:54.957 --> 02:00:59.741]  California is 0.5, not even 1 microgram, the Prop 65.
[02:00:59.741 --> 02:01:00.942]  Oh, so it's more than 10 times?
[02:01:02.503 --> 02:01:03.563]  More than 10 times.
[02:01:03.563 --> 02:01:14.028]  So anything that you get anywhere in the United States that's under 10 parts per million of any type of lead or arsenic or anything like that is generally considered safe.
[02:01:14.028 --> 02:01:19.370]  But from the science I've read in mainline studies, if you didn't have any arsenic or any lead, you'd die.
[02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:28.954]  I mean, isn't it true that even though it's poisonous in moderate levels or even small levels, in the super tiny trace level, is that wrong science in your view?
[02:01:30.257 --> 02:01:33.560]  I mean, because arsenic is in apples.
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:36.722]  Well, all of those are naturally occurring.
[02:01:36.722 --> 02:01:39.664]  I mean, they're naturally occurring in soils and plants and everything else.
[02:01:39.664 --> 02:01:41.105]  It just depends on what plant and which.
[02:01:41.105 --> 02:01:44.167]  And you were saying in the air is way above.
[02:01:44.167 --> 02:01:46.529]  In the air, you have high mercury content in the air.
[02:01:46.529 --> 02:01:49.091]  You have high aluminum content in the air.
[02:01:49.091 --> 02:01:52.033]  In some parts of California, they've stated that it's 55.
[02:01:52.033 --> 02:01:55.796]  You breathe in a main city, you may breathe up to 55.
[02:01:57.637 --> 02:02:01.258]  Micrograms of lead per day.
[02:02:01.258 --> 02:02:01.418]  55.
[02:02:01.418 --> 02:02:06.060]  And Prop 65 is 0.5, not even 1 microgram.
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:09.141]  It's ridiculous and the people in California are upset about it.
[02:02:09.141 --> 02:02:18.785]  Yeah, because if this was put on food, which they could do, which they'd use to starve us, you were saying how many green peas as a... Well, like one green bean would be over Prop 65.
[02:02:18.785 --> 02:02:19.445]  A lot of foods.
[02:02:19.445 --> 02:02:23.307]  I mean, even organic apples are high in lead and some of the compounds.
[02:02:23.307 --> 02:02:26.108]  But is there any truth from your research that we do need a little bit of the bad things?
[02:02:27.043 --> 02:02:28.264]  Uh, you do need a little bit.
[02:02:28.264 --> 02:02:29.384]  Everything in moderation.
[02:02:29.384 --> 02:02:33.706]  You know, there's always a point where it becomes too much, and it depends on what source it is, too.
[02:02:33.706 --> 02:02:37.928]  I mean, there's a lot of different aluminum byproducts, aluminum oxides, just like fluoride.
[02:02:37.928 --> 02:02:46.132]  I mean, it depends on, is it naturally occurring in nature, the chemical structure of it, and... How much calcium fluoride do we need?
[02:02:46.132 --> 02:02:48.693]  Uh, zero.
[02:02:48.693 --> 02:02:52.034]  So you think we don't even... Maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit.
[02:02:52.034 --> 02:02:53.395]  So fluoride period is bad?
[02:02:56.939 --> 02:03:07.507]  In minute amounts, in parts per million, if it's soil-based, or if it's from any type of zeolite, or deposit, or naturally occurring, taken up by plants.
[02:03:07.507 --> 02:03:13.010]  Because, here's the thing, you have minerals in the soil, but there's something that happens with those.
[02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:17.954]  It can change the electron spin from a positive to a negative electron spin.
[02:03:17.954 --> 02:03:23.738]  Usually, if it's a positive, it's synthetic, but if it's a negative charge, it all depends on the electrical charge of
[02:03:24.338 --> 02:03:26.260]  The element as it comes in your body.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:31.705]  And that's what makes hydrofluorosilic so deadly is they've made it super positive.
[02:03:31.705 --> 02:03:31.945]  Right?
[02:03:31.945 --> 02:03:32.626]  Yes.
[02:03:32.626 --> 02:03:33.447]  Yes.
[02:03:33.447 --> 02:03:35.149]  And that's why it's so dangerous bouncing around.
[02:03:36.465 --> 02:03:41.008]  That's why it's so dangerous, but also you have to look at just one compound.
[02:03:41.008 --> 02:03:44.090]  What happens when you combine that compound with another compound?
[02:03:44.090 --> 02:03:46.712]  That's why if you stuck your hand in it, it would eat the flesh right off your hand.
[02:03:46.712 --> 02:03:49.154]  It eats through glass, it eats through metal, it eats through everything.
[02:03:49.154 --> 02:03:53.257]  It's like the, you know, it comes with a skull and crossbones on the label.
[02:03:53.257 --> 02:03:54.258]  I mean, it's like...
[02:03:54.978 --> 02:04:05.060]  What you said, we get, we are actually buying the world's most toxic waste products from China, and they're sitting over there laughing, sending all this toxic material.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:09.120]  And it's even been on the news, from China, and they tested like 300 poisons.
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.981]  And it's got, exactly, it's got arsenic, high levels of arsenic, lead, mercury, all.
[02:04:13.981 --> 02:04:23.183]  And they make these cities, put in these multi-billion dollar water treatment deals that have no arsenic in them, and then this perfect water comes out, and they dump Chinese toxic waste in it, and I mean,
[02:04:24.163 --> 02:04:26.745]  It's just, it's cuckoo!
[02:04:26.745 --> 02:04:36.990]  I've got a newscast, I think it was out of Oklahoma, like six, seven years ago, we played it a bunch, where they actually, like the news director, did a tour of the water plant and saw the skull and crossbones and it said China.
[02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:39.371]  So he got it and they took it and had it tested and that was over 300.
[02:04:41.176 --> 02:04:42.257]  I've got to find that old newscast.
[02:04:42.257 --> 02:04:44.097]  It was on YouTube.
[02:04:44.097 --> 02:04:45.778]  But that's what real news should do.
[02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:50.060]  And it was like, whoa, you mean it's hundreds of chemicals and we're paying to dump it in the water?
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:57.082]  It's like when they tested the tobacco in one of the mainstream cigarettes and they found 600 and something different chemicals in it.
[02:04:57.082 --> 02:04:58.343]  Yeah, you're not really smoking tobacco.
[02:04:59.818 --> 02:05:01.079]  Another major health threat.
[02:05:01.079 --> 02:05:06.061]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:05:06.061 --> 02:05:08.722]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:05:08.722 --> 02:05:15.765]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:05:15.765 --> 02:05:18.746]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:05:18.746 --> 02:05:21.708]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:05:21.708 --> 02:05:23.729]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:05:23.729 --> 02:05:26.550]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:32.372]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:05:32.372 --> 02:05:35.873]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:05:35.873 --> 02:05:38.974]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:05:59.813 --> 02:06:03.474]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:03.474 --> 02:06:07.755]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:07.755 --> 02:06:09.535]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:06:59.477 --> 02:07:05.639]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:05.639 --> 02:07:10.201]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:14.763]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:15.183 --> 02:07:18.104]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:18.104 --> 02:07:23.546]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:23.546 --> 02:07:30.948]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:30.948 --> 02:07:35.069]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:40.191]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:40.191 --> 02:07:41.031]  This is innovating.
[02:07:41.331 --> 02:07:48.655]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[02:08:08.007 --> 02:08:09.148]  Well, the Ferguson governor
[02:08:11.374 --> 02:08:14.516]  Here's the liner.
[02:08:14.516 --> 02:08:22.342]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:22.342 --> 02:08:25.004]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.004 --> 02:08:28.646]  We are back live on this Thursday Worldwide Transmission.
[02:08:28.646 --> 02:08:33.530]  We're going to take a closer look at 9-11, who was really behind it.
[02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:39.034]  Coming up, at the bottom of the hour, about to go to your phone calls, the Governor of Missouri has come out.
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:47.546]  And said just minutes ago that he's ordering the National Guard off the streets of Ferguson.
[02:08:47.546 --> 02:08:50.668]  Governor Nixon orders National Guard to withdraw from Ferguson.
[02:08:50.668 --> 02:08:57.915]  Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to begin withdrawal from the city of Ferguson on Thursday, citing continued improvement in security there.
[02:08:57.915 --> 02:09:02.059]  The situation is greatly improved with fewer incidents of outside instigators.
[02:09:03.266 --> 02:09:07.207]  Yeah, because as bad as some of the cops are, and I'm not knocking the National Guard,
[02:09:32.153 --> 02:09:35.777]  If they were veterans, I mean, big zombies that I've never seen people this young.
[02:09:35.777 --> 02:09:39.481]  I mean, they look like younger than privates I've seen.
[02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:42.905]  I don't know where they got these people, but their commanding officer looked like he was about 14.
[02:09:42.905 --> 02:09:44.326]  And I'm not being mean.
[02:09:44.326 --> 02:09:49.953]  I mean, it just, it was like kids with guns milling around like not, not knowing what they were doing.
[02:09:49.953 --> 02:09:50.753]  Very bizarre.
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:53.141]  Just a total mess.
[02:09:53.141 --> 02:09:54.602]  Only a matter of time.
[02:09:54.602 --> 02:09:56.223]  Somebody hit me with a rock and I had a gun.
[02:09:56.223 --> 02:09:57.464]  I didn't want to shoot him.
[02:09:57.464 --> 02:10:00.406]  And I'm 40 years old and I know how to control myself a little bit better.
[02:10:00.406 --> 02:10:01.847]  That's why I won't even go to Ferguson.
[02:10:01.847 --> 02:10:04.488]  Because I've got anger issues.
[02:10:04.488 --> 02:10:06.990]  And I just can't imagine.
[02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:08.591]  It's a total mess.
[02:10:08.591 --> 02:10:12.213]  We had that cop threatening to shoot our reporters and others saying, I'll effing kill you.
[02:10:12.213 --> 02:10:15.095]  Just for no reason.
[02:10:15.095 --> 02:10:16.837]  And that's now national news.
[02:10:17.887 --> 02:10:19.628]  The people are calling us anti-cop.
[02:10:19.628 --> 02:10:21.628]  We're not doing anything to the police.
[02:10:21.628 --> 02:10:22.709]  We're not antagonizing them.
[02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:24.689]  We're being respectful.
[02:10:24.689 --> 02:10:26.610]  We first got there when it was just thugs burning things.
[02:10:26.610 --> 02:10:29.271]  The day after it happened, we were supportive of the police.
[02:10:29.271 --> 02:10:34.633]  Why do you think the police, what have they been told to be so hateful towards reporters?
[02:10:34.633 --> 02:10:38.614]  I've never seen anything like this, Dr. Group.
[02:10:38.614 --> 02:10:40.474]  I think it's condition number one.
[02:10:40.474 --> 02:10:44.736]  I mean, starting from a young age with, you know, the
[02:10:45.976 --> 02:11:09.126]  The police officers, I mean, not all police officers are bad, obviously, but the ones that they're getting now, I think they're molding into what they want to fight against citizens in case there, or when there's going to be, you know, militia on the streets, which there already is in some cases, and when there's going to be, when they're going to be rallying everybody up in case of Ebola or whatever, you know, martial law or whatever happens.
[02:11:09.126 --> 02:11:09.367]  That's it.
[02:11:09.367 --> 02:11:12.448]  They want to control the info and they've been told the press is the enemy.
[02:11:12.828 --> 02:11:14.570]  That ought to freak everybody out.
[02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:23.697]  So, I don't know what vaccines police officers get, but I've talked to military recently and I know they've upped their vaccine schedules and stuff like that, and I know that you look at the mind.
[02:11:23.697 --> 02:11:25.098]  I mean, it's all about the mind.
[02:11:25.098 --> 02:11:28.801]  You know, when you have the anger and the rage, what does all that boil down to?
[02:11:28.801 --> 02:11:37.027]  It's usually people that have poor diets, they're drinking the tap water, they've been conditioned to believe a certain way against... They're operating on rage and stress.
[02:11:37.848 --> 02:11:38.468]  Exactly.
[02:11:38.468 --> 02:11:38.989]  Like I do.
[02:11:38.989 --> 02:11:44.011]  You can't focus that way and you're going to have anger issues and you're going to be in that kill state.
[02:11:44.011 --> 02:11:45.051]  Kill, kill, kill.
[02:11:45.051 --> 02:11:47.853]  And, you know, that's pretty much what's going on.
[02:11:47.853 --> 02:11:49.373]  They'll get you.
[02:11:49.373 --> 02:11:55.056]  I couldn't imagine pulling people over all day in 110 degree heat and dealing with people all day.
[02:11:55.056 --> 02:11:56.557]  I could never be a cop.
[02:11:56.557 --> 02:11:59.618]  I mean, I was just... The thing is, they want people like you.
[02:11:59.618 --> 02:12:04.561]  They want the police officers that are going to fire on the American citizens.
[02:12:04.561 --> 02:12:05.841]  I mean, I would blow up.
[02:12:05.841 --> 02:12:07.322]  And they're getting rid of the ones that won't.
[02:12:08.319 --> 02:12:15.293]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm good in a crisis dealing with things, but it's the long-term stuff.
[02:12:15.293 --> 02:12:16.976]  Like, something just keeps happening.
[02:12:18.469 --> 02:12:19.630]  That becomes really irritating.
[02:12:19.630 --> 02:12:29.698]  There is no more the commercials, you know, that you saw 30 years ago with the police officer walking the lady across the street and helping you carry your groceries to the car and everything.
[02:12:29.698 --> 02:12:38.205]  Now, now the commercials for, you know, to become a police officer, they're showing SWAT teams in the streets, you know, firing tear gas down the road.
[02:12:38.205 --> 02:12:41.888]  I mean, you remember those when we were growing up, you know, you had the... Officer friendly.
[02:12:42.268 --> 02:12:50.599]  Officer-friendly, come to your local officer, and now if you look on TV for anybody who's running an ad or anything like that for the police department, it's completely opposite.
[02:12:50.599 --> 02:12:59.389]  It's all anti-civilian, anti-support for the population, and we've completely flipped over.
[02:12:59.389 --> 02:13:00.391]  But it's all part
[02:13:01.661 --> 02:13:25.075]  of dumbing people down so you know and throwing it in their face through movies and through media and through all the other million things that are out there that are conditioning people to say okay just it's gonna be okay this is what I'm going to have to expect just like outbreak and all the Ebola stuff movies that came out ten years ago now everybody knows Ebola could kill you the fear-mongering everything else I mean Hunger Games all the stuff that they've put in
[02:13:26.291 --> 02:13:33.937]  You know, to our brain, deep in our brain, and they fried our brain with all the chemicals and everything else.
[02:13:33.937 --> 02:13:35.978]  You know, they don't want people.
[02:13:35.978 --> 02:13:37.339]  They want people that are dumbed down.
[02:13:37.339 --> 02:13:43.904]  They don't want people that are easily controllable and to control the population.
[02:13:43.904 --> 02:13:46.006]  Let's go to some phone calls here.
[02:13:46.006 --> 02:13:48.648]  Any other points you want to add before we go to calls that we haven't gotten to?
[02:13:49.198 --> 02:13:51.520]  I just want people to know that they can do something about it.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:14:01.687]  I mean, just listen to the show and really the best way to protect yourself and your family is to keep your body clean and to make sure that you have a good survival plan.
[02:14:01.687 --> 02:14:03.128]  You know, you need to get out of the city.
[02:14:03.128 --> 02:14:06.871]  If there's Ebola that comes into your city, you need to have a bug out plan.
[02:14:06.871 --> 02:14:08.212]  You need to have some stuff packed.
[02:14:08.212 --> 02:14:09.953]  You need to have some storable food.
[02:14:09.953 --> 02:14:14.557]  You need to have enough supplements for your friends and your family or wherever you're going to go.
[02:14:14.557 --> 02:14:14.937]  Really, look,
[02:14:17.817 --> 02:14:21.778]  Alex is telling you this stuff every day, reporting on it.
[02:14:21.778 --> 02:14:26.119]  You need to have some sort of a plan because you're the one that knows.
[02:14:26.119 --> 02:14:30.639]  You know the answers, you know, and you know how to defend yourself and your family.
[02:14:30.639 --> 02:14:36.220]  Where everybody else is just going to sit there and they're not going to know what to do and they're going to rely on the government exactly what they want to happen.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:36.861]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:36.861 --> 02:14:38.741]  The government is digging in.
[02:14:38.741 --> 02:14:41.421]  Government's getting ready for martial law worldwide.
[02:14:41.421 --> 02:14:44.142]  Government is destabilizing, funding radical groups.
[02:14:45.407 --> 02:14:49.315]  While telling low-level government we're setting up a police state to stabilize things.
[02:14:49.315 --> 02:14:53.003]  They create the crisis, offer the solution, Hegelian dialectic.
[02:14:53.003 --> 02:14:56.009]  All I know is government's massing food and weapons.
[02:14:57.245 --> 02:14:59.086]  Elites are hardening their homes.
[02:14:59.086 --> 02:15:01.226]  Elites are moving to rural areas.
[02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:02.367]  That's all over the news.
[02:15:02.367 --> 02:15:12.289]  I mean, every major economist we have on says, I've moved out because everyone can see the writing on the wall, open borders, de-industrialization, food prices exploding.
[02:15:12.289 --> 02:15:14.190]  This is just the beginning.
[02:15:14.190 --> 02:15:18.951]  And I literally now, I'm just not even shaken.
[02:15:18.951 --> 02:15:24.393]  I am bracing internally, Dr. Grubb, to know that we've already are hitting the beginnings of it.
[02:15:25.373 --> 02:15:46.698]  And we can see the response as they prepare for total martial law and use Ferguson as a beta test that we need the liberty movement, the patriots out there to A, be prepared, B, be out educating people now so that as things get worse, as Ron Paul has said, folks know this was engineered and blame the collectivist and not the free market and capitalism.
[02:15:46.698 --> 02:15:53.260]  This is the socialist takeover plan, the communist takeover plan directed by the ultra-rich that are exempt with UN diplomatic immunity.
[02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.780]  This is their consolidation.
[02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.380]  This is it.
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.321]  And they're gonna let Al-Qaeda attack us?
[02:15:59.321 --> 02:16:00.322]  Guaranteed.
[02:16:00.322 --> 02:16:01.262]  That's in the news now.
[02:16:01.262 --> 02:16:01.742]  U.S.
[02:16:01.742 --> 02:16:06.124]  braces for Al-Qaeda attack while the borders open.
[02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.625]  And people say, oh, you're saying the government did the Al-Qaeda attack.
[02:16:08.625 --> 02:16:09.346]  No.
[02:16:09.346 --> 02:16:17.189]  I'm saying the criminals that run our government are allowing them to get ready to attack us because then they'll take our rice.
[02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:19.330]  It's so easy to understand how they're operating.
[02:16:20.171 --> 02:16:21.612]  And they admit they're doing this.
[02:16:21.612 --> 02:16:22.974]  This is not my opinion.
[02:16:22.974 --> 02:16:24.995]  James in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[02:16:24.995 --> 02:16:27.177]  Then we'll go to Adam, Red, Jay, and Kelly.
[02:16:27.177 --> 02:16:30.661]  Go ahead, James, you're on the air with Dr. Group.
[02:16:30.661 --> 02:16:35.425]  Yeah, I had a question about the X2-Nation Iodine.
[02:16:35.425 --> 02:16:39.689]  My thing is, is it okay to give to kids, or should it be diluted?
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:42.241]  You know, just your professional opinion.
[02:16:42.241 --> 02:16:43.261]  That's a really good question.
[02:16:43.261 --> 02:16:44.061]  That is a good question.
[02:16:44.061 --> 02:16:45.121]  I give it to my kids.
[02:16:45.121 --> 02:16:53.304]  I mean, the fact is, children are really, really, really deficient because most of the pregnant mothers were severely deficient in iodine.
[02:16:53.304 --> 02:16:59.206]  So I would definitely dilute it in a little bit of water or orange juice, whatever.
[02:16:59.206 --> 02:17:00.206]  It doesn't really matter.
[02:17:00.206 --> 02:17:02.087]  You know, iodine is pretty stable the way it is.
[02:17:02.087 --> 02:17:08.609]  So just take maybe an ounce of water and put, depending on how old the child is,
[02:17:09.710 --> 02:17:16.737]  Um, you know, I would probably, I mean, if it were me, I would give my child, you know, from an early age.
[02:17:16.737 --> 02:17:18.019]  I mean, it's definitely not going to hurt.
[02:17:18.019 --> 02:17:22.744]  I'd even mix it in with the milk, you know, that I'm, you know, feeding the child or whatever.
[02:17:22.744 --> 02:17:26.528]  But it is completely safe to use.
[02:17:26.528 --> 02:17:27.530]  What is the dosage level?
[02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:30.334]  Well, that just depends on how old the child is.
[02:17:30.334 --> 02:17:31.035]  How old is the child?
[02:17:31.035 --> 02:17:32.397]  And he should consult a physician.
[02:17:32.397 --> 02:17:37.245]  But, I mean, look, five years ago, every medical doctor said, don't give a pregnant woman vaccines.
[02:17:37.245 --> 02:17:40.410]  They knew it caused all sorts of problems in utero.
[02:17:40.410 --> 02:17:41.652]  It caused miscarriages.
[02:17:41.652 --> 02:17:42.753]  That was on the insert.
[02:17:43.294 --> 02:17:44.935]  Then they said, no, we're going to double down.
[02:17:44.935 --> 02:17:45.495]  It's good.
[02:17:45.495 --> 02:17:47.056]  Take more when you're pregnant.
[02:17:47.056 --> 02:17:59.784]  They don't tell them that there's literally hundreds of studies over a hundred years, literally going back over a hundred years, but dozens just last few years in China, the US, you name it, about all of the birth defects and problems from lack of iodine.
[02:17:59.784 --> 02:18:03.366]  They know this, but their medical doctor will not tell you.
[02:18:03.366 --> 02:18:05.427]  People say, yeah, you said consult a physician.
[02:18:05.427 --> 02:18:06.568]  I went to him and they said, well,
[02:18:07.978 --> 02:18:16.745]  Yeah, I guess you need some iodine, but, you know, maybe get a vitamin that has a little bit of it in it or something, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, or, you know, get, get, get... I mean, they just know nothing about nutrition.
[02:18:17.751 --> 02:18:27.318]  It's a lack of iodine that causes, that can be linked to a lot of the mental disabilities that children are seeing in school, that you're seeing in schools.
[02:18:27.318 --> 02:18:37.866]  I mean, low IQs, the dumbing down, because iodine protects against fluoride and chlorine and bromine accumulation in the brain and in the thyroid gland.
[02:18:37.866 --> 02:18:40.908]  And the thyroid gets messed up, your metabolism gets mixed up.
[02:18:40.908 --> 02:18:46.372]  I mean, it can be linked to practically every single disease out there, from obesity to anything else.
[02:18:46.832 --> 02:18:53.238]  China had so many birth defects, and this has been in the mainstream news, that they make people supplement with iodine.
[02:18:53.238 --> 02:19:01.387]  I mean, they knew why they had so many towns where the kids were being born with all different sorts of disorders and things.
[02:19:01.387 --> 02:19:05.090]  I mean, they know, but our government doesn't want us to have it.
[02:19:05.090 --> 02:19:05.611]  Why is that?
[02:19:07.253 --> 02:19:09.595]  It's counterintuitive to what they're trying to do.
[02:19:09.595 --> 02:19:21.245]  I mean, if you're trying to make a population sick, and you're trying to increase the funds of the pharmaceutical companies, and the oil and gas industry, and everything else is all connected, you want to take away the health-giving things.
[02:19:21.245 --> 02:19:30.613]  I mean, I've said a bunch of times, I'm not the type of person that promotes a lot of different supplements, because I believe that, you know, if you keep your body clean on the inside, that's really all you need.
[02:19:31.654 --> 02:19:33.836]  I do recommend everybody take iodine.
[02:19:33.836 --> 02:19:44.625]  I do recommend people take, you know, things to clean their body like fluoride shield and some of the things that actually support cellular function like DNA force and stuff like that because that's where it all happens.
[02:19:44.625 --> 02:19:46.206]  It happens at a cellular level.
[02:19:46.206 --> 02:19:48.588]  So iodine would be great for kids.
[02:19:48.588 --> 02:19:49.789]  What about the detoxing though?
[02:19:49.789 --> 02:19:52.251]  Because I kind of felt bad two weeks into it like you predicted.
[02:19:52.791 --> 02:19:59.880]  Well, whenever you start releasing those bromides, iodine is also, by the way, a very, very strong anti-viral and anti-microbial.
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:02.623]  You owe the IRS money that you can't pay.
[02:20:02.623 --> 02:20:05.606]  Are tax liens and levies ruining your life?
[02:20:05.606 --> 02:20:09.010]  Are you tired of being afraid just to go to the mailbox?
[02:20:09.010 --> 02:20:12.615]  If this describes you, then Dan Pilla can help.

[02:21:02.109 --> 02:21:06.251]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[02:21:06.251 --> 02:21:08.512]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:21:08.512 --> 02:21:13.675]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:21:13.675 --> 02:21:15.496]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[02:21:15.496 --> 02:21:17.057]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:21:17.057 --> 02:21:18.538]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:21:18.538 --> 02:21:21.580]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:27.263]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:27.263 --> 02:21:36.609]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[02:24:15.246 --> 02:24:16.587]  Man, I hogged the time with Dr. Group.
[02:24:16.587 --> 02:24:19.208]  We have another guest coming up, so let's race through your calls.
[02:24:19.208 --> 02:24:20.308]  Adam in Canada.
[02:24:20.308 --> 02:24:22.229]  You want to talk about DNA Force with Dr. Group.
[02:24:22.229 --> 02:24:24.150]  Go ahead.
[02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.390]  Yeah.
[02:24:24.390 --> 02:24:24.890]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:24.890 --> 02:24:25.990]  Nice to speak with you again.
[02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:27.231]  Good day, Dr. Group.
[02:24:29.413 --> 02:24:33.238]  I do have one question for Dr. Group and then a comment for Alex and listeners.
[02:24:33.238 --> 02:24:37.804]  I take the Young Joe, the healthy start pack, plus a survival shield every day.
[02:24:37.804 --> 02:24:43.071]  Are there any counterindications for taking other nutraceuticals like DNA Force or Supermeal Vitality?
[02:24:44.115 --> 02:24:45.436]  That's a good question.
[02:24:45.436 --> 02:24:51.640]  No, I always recommend that you give yourself a little bit of time between each nutraceutical that you take.
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.583]  I mean, I don't like to take a lot of nutraceuticals or all the nutraceuticals at once.
[02:24:56.583 --> 02:25:00.185]  Clinically, I've found that you get a way better benefit
[02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:03.085]  If you spread them out at least by two hours.
[02:25:03.085 --> 02:25:09.047]  So take one, then you can take another supplement two hours later.
[02:25:09.047 --> 02:25:14.548]  It's kind of hard to do it that way, but if you want the best results, you should split up and at least give an hour to two hours.
[02:25:14.548 --> 02:25:20.769]  I'm doing stuff like not eating ice cream a couple times a week at 10 o'clock at night watching a movie on the couch.
[02:25:20.769 --> 02:25:22.890]  I'll just go have a big glass of water and some iodine.
[02:25:24.123 --> 02:25:25.804]  Or I'll go over and have some herbal tea or something.
[02:25:25.804 --> 02:25:29.085]  It's not like I'm some super health nut now, but I've lost a lot of weight.
[02:25:29.085 --> 02:25:30.406]  I'm a lot healthier than I was.
[02:25:30.406 --> 02:25:33.947]  It's a slow process to do it right and keep it off, though.
[02:25:33.947 --> 02:25:37.969]  But you deal with stuff like Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:40.870]  That's just a bunch of minerals and organic vitamins together.
[02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:42.471]  Full spectrum, absorbable.
[02:25:42.471 --> 02:25:44.151]  Infowarshealth.com.
[02:25:44.151 --> 02:25:44.852]  That's great.
[02:25:44.852 --> 02:25:50.254]  And I take it at least once a day as a snack or something, again, instead of eating candy or something.
[02:25:51.547 --> 02:25:57.030]  That's how I've made myself start taking supplements, because my whole life I didn't do it.
[02:25:57.030 --> 02:26:00.092]  Because I was never in the habit, or I would start and get off.
[02:26:00.092 --> 02:26:05.875]  Now I've gotten good about staying on it, at least partially, and I'm getting better about it.
[02:26:05.875 --> 02:26:14.620]  And the more I take, because I'm not even taking that much right now, but it's a lot compared to a couple years ago, the better the benefits.
[02:26:15.455 --> 02:26:37.618]  Yeah, it's just getting your body used to doing things, and at the same time, what you should be doing when you're taking supplements is looking at your environment, cleaning up your house, not buying any more chemicals, but replacing them with natural and organic solutions instead, and avoiding all the things that are actually causing or can cause any type of disease or malfunction in your body, you know, especially the endocrine disruptors,
[02:26:38.178 --> 02:26:40.199]  You know, you know, getting cell phone protectors.
[02:26:40.199 --> 02:26:52.143]  I mean, the list goes on, but taking supplements is one thing because you need to clean the inside of your body, but you also need to clean your outside environment, and that means your food, what you're drinking, and wherever you're living.
[02:26:52.143 --> 02:26:54.264]  That environment needs to be clean as well.
[02:26:54.264 --> 02:26:54.984]  All right, thank you.
[02:26:54.984 --> 02:26:56.605]  Let's move on to the next caller here.
[02:26:56.605 --> 02:27:00.126]  Red in Texas wants to talk about DNA Force as well.
[02:27:00.126 --> 02:27:02.247]  Too bad that's sold out.
[02:27:02.247 --> 02:27:03.988]  People... Go ahead, Red.
[02:27:06.394 --> 02:27:09.556]  I want to thank you so much for everything you do, Alex.
[02:27:09.556 --> 02:27:10.176]  I feel for you.
[02:27:10.176 --> 02:27:11.497]  I mean, I'm the same.
[02:27:11.497 --> 02:27:11.797]  Both you are.
[02:27:11.797 --> 02:27:14.399]  I have anger issues and stress and everything else about this evil government we live under.
[02:27:33.479 --> 02:27:46.412]  With regards to that, Dr. Group, I heard you a couple of weeks ago talk about something you could take for stress and depression.
[02:27:46.412 --> 02:27:46.913]  What kind of?
[02:27:47.589 --> 02:27:54.414]  I mean, I've seen double-blind studies stuff years ago about St.
[02:27:54.414 --> 02:27:57.917]  John's warts being a lot better than Prozac, right?
[02:27:57.917 --> 02:28:10.047]  Actually, you know, InfoWars Live is going to be coming out with a product that we were talking, we're going to be talking about more today, specifically addressing depression, stress, anxiety, because it's such a huge deal.
[02:28:10.547 --> 02:28:15.730]  It's the thing that knocks your immune system down by 50% instantaneously.
[02:28:15.730 --> 02:28:20.433]  Some of the things that are going to be in there, like lithium orotate, which I love, and that's not lithium.
[02:28:20.433 --> 02:28:21.834]  This is a safe form.
[02:28:21.834 --> 02:28:22.915]  It's called lithium orotate.
[02:28:22.915 --> 02:28:24.756]  There's plenty of research online.
[02:28:24.756 --> 02:28:28.578]  Dr. Nieper in Germany has done research on it since the 1940s.
[02:28:28.578 --> 02:28:35.722]  That's one of the best things that I've used forever that has been able to conquer any type of mental illness.
[02:28:35.722 --> 02:28:37.744]  Tibetan rhodiola is another thing.
[02:28:39.384 --> 02:28:43.285]  There's a lot of different... You're talking about plant-based lithium.
[02:28:43.285 --> 02:28:44.366]  Plant-based lithium.
[02:28:44.366 --> 02:28:53.168]  It's actually a plant-based lithium bonded to an erotic acid and it is incredible to use for a multitude of things.
[02:28:53.168 --> 02:28:59.750]  As a matter of fact, people are using it right now for military, for post-traumatic stress disorder and reducing the suicide rate
[02:28:59.890 --> 02:29:06.494]  Well, I mean, I've been to a bunch of prestigious child psychologists, and more and more, they're rebelling and not trying to push drugs on kids.
[02:29:06.494 --> 02:29:10.076]  They're going to that, the plant-based lithium, and just seeing incredible response.
[02:29:10.076 --> 02:29:12.438]  Because it's not turning the kids into zombies at all!
[02:29:12.438 --> 02:29:15.520]  Because it's such a small dose, and it's organic, it just literally...
[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:18.081]  It just cuts it all out.
[02:29:18.081 --> 02:29:25.065]  Yeah, right now, I mean, we're seeing so many suicides with people getting put on antidepressants, antipsychotics, and everything like that.
[02:29:25.065 --> 02:29:41.554]  So we're going to come out with a product that's going to, you know, reduce suicides, help regulate brain function, you know, keep you in a state to where you're calm, your anger is depressed down, and your anxiety too, and then you'll be able to also, if you reduce all those, you'll be able to sleep better at night.
[02:29:42.771 --> 02:29:43.612]  Amazing.
[02:29:43.612 --> 02:29:45.074]  Dr. Ed Group is our guest.
[02:29:45.074 --> 02:29:45.996]  I've got to do a couple more minutes.
[02:29:45.996 --> 02:29:49.140]  We're getting Gage on, but I want to finish two more callers with Jay.
[02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:49.941]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.941 --> 02:29:51.003]  We're going to go to Jay.
[02:29:51.003 --> 02:29:53.026]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.026 --> 02:29:53.967]  Alex Jones and the GCO Network.
[02:29:53.967 --> 02:29:54.909]  Maybe Brian and a few others.
[02:29:54.909 --> 02:29:56.992]  Quick questions, then we'll go right to Richard Gage.
[02:30:00.129 --> 02:30:06.291]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:30:06.291 --> 02:30:10.853]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:30:10.853 --> 02:30:15.395]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:15.815 --> 02:30:18.737]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:30:18.737 --> 02:30:24.180]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:30:24.180 --> 02:30:31.585]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:30:31.585 --> 02:30:35.708]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:30:35.708 --> 02:30:40.491]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:40.811 --> 02:30:49.275]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:30:49.275 --> 02:30:53.697]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:06.665]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:06.665 --> 02:31:09.007]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:09.007 --> 02:31:14.291]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:14.291 --> 02:31:19.455]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:19.455 --> 02:31:22.497]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:22.777 --> 02:31:26.861]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:26.861 --> 02:31:31.165]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:31.165 --> 02:31:41.414]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:41.414 --> 02:31:43.916]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[02:31:44.116 --> 02:31:52.327]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:52.327 --> 02:31:56.292]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:59.562 --> 02:32:10.108]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:32:10.108 --> 02:32:16.571]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:32:16.571 --> 02:32:18.912]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:32:18.912 --> 02:32:22.014]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:32:22.014 --> 02:32:28.878]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:32:29.358 --> 02:32:33.021]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:33.021 --> 02:32:37.285]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:37.285 --> 02:32:39.066]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:39.066 --> 02:32:46.932]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:46.932 --> 02:32:48.073]  But for how long?
[02:32:48.073 --> 02:32:50.295]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[02:32:50.295 --> 02:32:54.718]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[02:32:54.718 --> 02:32:56.600]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:57.541]  Just won't quit.
[02:33:17.057 --> 02:33:21.138]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:21.138 --> 02:33:26.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:29.781]  There are a lot of great products at infowarslife.com.
[02:33:29.781 --> 02:33:32.742]  It's how we also fund a lot of our operations.
[02:33:32.742 --> 02:33:38.904]  You can simply go to infowars.com forward slash eyes
[02:33:40.174 --> 02:33:54.985]  InfoWars.com forward slash eyes and you can find the sub page InfoWarsLive.com that has the new OcuPower not just for the eyes but for a lot of the cells in the body and I'd almost say it's like a poor man's DNA force.
[02:33:54.985 --> 02:33:56.426]  That's what we're trying to do here.
[02:33:56.426 --> 02:34:08.615]  It's more than just eyes but we're calling it OcuPower and Dr. Grip helped us develop it and it's the highest quality at the lowest price and it is going to sell out because people have learned that
[02:34:09.502 --> 02:34:23.268]  We have trouble keeping this stuff in because of the funds just to produce it, and to source it, and to get stuff so clean, so pure, and such high quality, and to not just do what most of our competitors do, putting out crud, which is shocking.
[02:34:23.268 --> 02:34:27.030]  I mean, now that I'm inside this for a few years, really studying it.
[02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:29.591]  So, Occupower, available at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:35.114 --> 02:34:42.241]  Richard Gage is going to be with us for a little bit of overdrive into the next hour as well with AE911Truth.org.
[02:34:42.241 --> 02:34:44.803]  We're going to salute him here in just a moment and get the latest.
[02:34:44.803 --> 02:34:48.026]  He was on C-SPAN a few weeks ago, had a big effect.
[02:34:48.026 --> 02:34:57.515]  Now that we see that criminal elements of our government are openly funding Al-Qaeda, new name IS or ISIS, running around doing all their horrible things, we see
[02:34:59.566 --> 02:35:01.907]  How these radical groups are being protected.
[02:35:01.907 --> 02:35:10.769]  When we say it is an inside job, criminal groups in the government were clearly working with Saudi Arabia and jihadis to hit us on 9-11.
[02:35:10.769 --> 02:35:15.771]  They are getting ready to hit us again and take our rights away in the name of protecting us.
[02:35:15.771 --> 02:35:19.072]  The average military person, the average cop, has nothing to do with it.
[02:35:19.072 --> 02:35:25.513]  But when they do another 9-11 and you got cops saying, get back, they're going to bring down building 7, the cops were told, get back, we're going to blow it up.
[02:35:25.513 --> 02:35:27.194]  I've talked to the cops that are there on CNN.
[02:35:28.308 --> 02:35:29.129]  I have one of them on air.
[02:35:29.129 --> 02:35:31.351]  He got so many threats, he disappeared after that.
[02:35:31.351 --> 02:35:35.294]  We interviewed the deputy head of emergency management.
[02:35:35.294 --> 02:35:37.956]  He died two weeks later.
[02:35:37.956 --> 02:35:39.037]  So, I mean, listen.
[02:35:39.037 --> 02:35:40.798]  People say it would come out.
[02:35:40.798 --> 02:35:41.639]  No, no.
[02:35:41.639 --> 02:35:42.199]  It came out.
[02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:43.901]  They had charges in all three buildings.
[02:35:46.192 --> 02:35:46.432]  And that's
[02:36:01.192 --> 02:36:07.973]  I'm going to get Mr. Gage back up close to 9-11 for a full hour and have him building seven clips and the other towers blowing up.
[02:36:07.973 --> 02:36:10.714]  Maybe even get him here in studio to really go over all of this.
[02:36:10.714 --> 02:36:14.274]  Because of course I was there before 9-11 and on the day saying it was an inside job.
[02:36:14.274 --> 02:36:17.715]  And I said they're going to launch a bio-attack now on 9-11 on record.
[02:36:17.715 --> 02:36:18.955]  And they launched the anthrax attack.
[02:36:18.955 --> 02:36:20.816]  I just know how they operate.
[02:36:20.816 --> 02:36:21.596]  And now they're in the news.
[02:36:21.596 --> 02:36:23.576]  Get ready, Al-Qaeda is going to hit us any minute.
[02:36:23.576 --> 02:36:24.296]  Oh my gosh!
[02:36:24.296 --> 02:36:26.177]  Well, who gave Al-Qaeda the weapons?
[02:36:26.177 --> 02:36:27.117]  Who let them reform?
[02:36:28.035 --> 02:36:37.617]  And then I don't want Fox News with Bill O'Reilly saying I said 9-11 never happened, or that space beings did it, and all their disinfo, or that radical Muslims don't exist.
[02:36:37.617 --> 02:36:39.378]  That's not what I'm saying!
[02:36:39.378 --> 02:36:50.801]  They are protecting them, and our border's wide open, and I'm not gonna have my rights taken when a bunch of crazy jihadis come in here and blow stuff up in downtown Austin, or Dallas, or San Antonio, or Houston.
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:53.121]  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to start ranting.
[02:36:53.121 --> 02:36:56.823]  I've got to finish up with two medical questions or supplement questions for Dr. Group here.
[02:36:56.823 --> 02:37:01.505]  Then we're going to Richard Gage of AE911Truth.org.
[02:37:01.505 --> 02:37:03.026]  But let's go ahead and go to Jay in Canada.
[02:37:03.026 --> 02:37:04.367]  You have a question for Dr. Group.
[02:37:04.367 --> 02:37:04.767]  Go ahead.
[02:37:04.767 --> 02:37:09.149]  Okay, that was a good question.
[02:37:09.149 --> 02:37:09.970]  Thank you.
[02:37:09.970 --> 02:37:11.370]  Brian in Indiana.
[02:37:11.370 --> 02:37:11.991]  You're on the air.
[02:37:11.991 --> 02:37:12.331]  Go ahead.
[02:37:14.642 --> 02:37:15.704]  Hey Alex, how you doing buddy?
[02:37:15.704 --> 02:37:16.665]  I'm alright, go ahead sir.
[02:37:16.665 --> 02:37:17.566]  Question for Dr. Group.
[02:37:17.566 --> 02:37:19.769]  Yeah, I got two questions for Dr. Group.
[02:37:19.769 --> 02:37:28.762]  First question is you recommend, or at least didn't recommend it, but you said orange juice would be okay for your iodine and I kind of wonder about that because the first pass effect would block some of it?
[02:37:29.674 --> 02:37:32.195]  Or let too much of it through, and that might cause liver damage.
[02:37:32.195 --> 02:37:33.995]  You sure about that?
[02:37:33.995 --> 02:37:35.915]  Uh, well, I always recommend water.
[02:37:35.915 --> 02:37:50.519]  I mean, if, you know, for a kid, if that's the only thing that they can take, then, you know, definitely, it would have to be freshly squeezed orange juice, and it would be organic, because anything that you're going to get from the store is going to be contaminated with all kinds of chemicals and might actually have fluoride in it anyways.
[02:37:50.519 --> 02:37:53.199]  But what is he talking about iodine with orange juice might hurt the liver?
[02:37:53.199 --> 02:37:55.260]  Doesn't the iodine go right into your blood anyways?
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:57.321]  Well, this form of iodine would.
[02:37:57.321 --> 02:38:08.348]  I think the main concern would be the type of orange juice that you're using because it might be contaminated with BPA residue and other stuff if it's in a carton and it's probably from a concentrate and has all kinds of chemical preservatives.
[02:38:08.348 --> 02:38:10.249]  But again, there's this whole purist thing.
[02:38:10.249 --> 02:38:21.776]  We're being hit by the big mega attacks of fluoride, aluminum dioxide, GMOs, waters full of crap, and then we're worried about, I agree BPA's bad,
[02:38:23.525 --> 02:38:31.351]  In the plastic linings of these so-called paper containers, it's just that I don't... Anyways, caller... Bottom line is, just take it with water.
[02:38:31.351 --> 02:38:33.232]  I mean, distilled water is going to be the best.
[02:38:33.232 --> 02:38:38.175]  If you're going to administer it to anybody, including yourself, it should be administered with pure distilled water.
[02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:40.497]  And remember, consult your physician or healthcare provider.
[02:38:40.497 --> 02:38:43.499]  We're just giving you what he would do.
[02:38:43.499 --> 02:38:44.319]  What was your other question?
[02:38:44.319 --> 02:38:44.680]  He's gone?
[02:38:46.767 --> 02:38:48.988]  I wasn't mad at him, I was just getting irritated.
[02:38:48.988 --> 02:38:58.772]  You know, just that, like, we're worried about one part per billion or whatever it is of arsenic in the city water supply while they clean it and then dump poison in it before it's sent down to the people.
[02:38:58.772 --> 02:39:00.092]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[02:39:00.092 --> 02:39:05.954]  It's like, we're making it against the law to thump someone in the nose, but we're gonna hit them 50 times with a hatchet in the head.
[02:39:05.954 --> 02:39:09.916]  You know, it just... Beverly in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:39:11.593 --> 02:39:15.056]  Well, to preface this, my mom and dad died when I was 13 and 14.
[02:39:15.056 --> 02:39:17.819]  My mother had cancer, my father had a heart attack.
[02:39:17.819 --> 02:39:21.042]  Every one of my relatives have died of some kind of horrible disease.
[02:39:21.042 --> 02:39:24.065]  My sister has fibromyalgia, the other one has diabetes.
[02:39:24.065 --> 02:39:28.889]  Seven years ago, my chiropractor said, you don't have to die of cancer, which was like, what?
[02:39:28.889 --> 02:39:33.954]  And so I started eating organic, started drinking pure water, eight years ago.
[02:39:34.514 --> 02:39:37.476]  And within a month or so, it was like a light switch went off.
[02:39:37.476 --> 02:39:38.916]  I could think clearer.
[02:39:38.916 --> 02:39:39.877]  I could see stuff.
[02:39:39.877 --> 02:39:46.320]  The same stuff that you're talking about right now, before I even knew you, my husband and I were going, man, this is like taking the red pill.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:50.783]  We're seeing all kinds of horrible things that our government's doing with the food and all like that.
[02:39:50.783 --> 02:39:53.924]  So anyway, we've moved to the country, to the lake.
[02:39:53.924 --> 02:39:55.465]  We catch our own fish.
[02:39:55.465 --> 02:39:57.186]  We grow our own food and all this stuff.
[02:39:57.186 --> 02:39:59.667]  And plus, we buy organic at other places.
[02:40:01.363 --> 02:40:04.764]  I have ordered some of that iodine because I'm really interested about that.
[02:40:04.764 --> 02:40:06.845]  But I want to know, are we doing okay?
[02:40:06.845 --> 02:40:07.906]  I mean, do I need this?
[02:40:07.906 --> 02:40:12.848]  Do we need these supplements because we're doing what we're supposed to?
[02:40:12.848 --> 02:40:15.208]  Do you need to take supplements?
[02:40:15.208 --> 02:40:18.590]  It depends on how often you actually cleanse the inside of your body.
[02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:21.991]  And that would mean like intestinal cleansing, liver and gallbladder cleansing.
[02:40:21.991 --> 02:40:26.253]  I mean, even people that are vegetarians or eat all raw, they think they don't have to clean.
[02:40:26.253 --> 02:40:29.034]  But you got to remember, you take 30,000 breaths every single day.
[02:40:29.714 --> 02:40:47.560]  And the air that you're taking in, there's all kinds of chemicals and stuff like that and that all goes into your intestines and you know, unless you had a greenhouse and you controlled the air and everything that was grown in it with the... We live in a highly toxic environment and I know this, I don't live as good as you do ma'am.
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:49.201]  All I know is the clarity of thought...
[02:40:50.061 --> 02:40:53.705]  Not getting as angry, being more focused, getting more done.
[02:40:53.705 --> 02:40:58.989]  Iodine, high-quality iodine, the herbs and the super male vitality has just been life-changing for me.
[02:40:58.989 --> 02:41:01.392]  And my friends and family take it and then want more.
[02:41:01.392 --> 02:41:09.499]  But obviously we're funding this whole news operation off, you know, once a month or so having a big, you know, plug for this, selling t-shirts, things like that.
[02:41:09.499 --> 02:41:14.344]  I mean, I sell a t-shirt that says Molon Labe, come and take it, because I'm defending the Second Amendment.
[02:41:14.784 --> 02:41:21.662]  And I'm funding the message to defend the Second Amendment and raise the alarm selling shirts that it's called synergy.
[02:41:22.924 --> 02:41:24.365]  And so it's the same thing.
[02:41:24.365 --> 02:41:31.030]  I promote key organic vitamins and minerals, and we're going to let you go, ma'am, and then go to our guests.
[02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:33.112]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:33.112 --> 02:41:41.719]  I mean, regardless, try the iodine, try the super female vitality, try the acupower, and then you know you're supporting this radio show.
[02:41:41.719 --> 02:41:48.024]  I mean, you know you're winning there, you know that's a win, and then I know that when you try it,
[02:41:49.813 --> 02:41:50.933]  Almost everyone I know of.
[02:41:50.933 --> 02:41:53.154]  In fact, it sounds wrong if I say everyone's loved it.
[02:41:53.154 --> 02:41:57.775]  Actually, all we've gotten is positive reviews, which is unprecedented in the, quote, supplement industry.
[02:41:57.775 --> 02:42:00.356]  I mean, it's just unprecedented.
[02:42:00.356 --> 02:42:02.276]  Unprecedented.
[02:42:02.276 --> 02:42:06.558]  And so, I mean, we're here just bringing you high quality.
[02:42:06.558 --> 02:42:09.938]  And maybe you're so healthy you don't need it.
[02:42:09.938 --> 02:42:10.839]  So there you go.
[02:42:10.839 --> 02:42:13.740]  I don't think you know until you've tried it.
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:18.781]  I mean, is, you know, ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter we can find out there anywhere.
[02:42:20.019 --> 02:42:21.400]  You know, is it absolutely perfect?
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:23.361]  Does it cut out 100% of everything?
[02:42:23.361 --> 02:42:23.741]  No.
[02:42:23.741 --> 02:42:28.964]  It cuts out 100% of a lot of stuff, reduces things down to non-detectable levels in other areas.
[02:42:28.964 --> 02:42:31.865]  But it's certainly better than the tap water.
[02:42:31.865 --> 02:42:33.106]  None of this is perfect.
[02:42:33.106 --> 02:42:34.186]  It's like the sun.
[02:42:34.186 --> 02:42:38.528]  The sun will damage your skin, but you'll die without getting sun.
[02:42:38.528 --> 02:42:42.330]  So it's kind of like this is the process here.
[02:42:42.330 --> 02:42:43.270]  Dr. Group, any comments?
[02:42:43.270 --> 02:42:44.271]  Then we're going to go to our guest.
[02:42:44.764 --> 02:42:46.125]  No, that's exactly what it is.
[02:42:46.125 --> 02:42:54.309]  It's about eliminating your exposure or reducing your exposure to a point where your body can deal with things when it does become exposed.
[02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:55.530]  I mean, bottom line, that's it.
[02:42:55.530 --> 02:43:00.872]  That's the root cause of all disease is too much stuff coming in and not enough stuff coming out.
[02:43:00.872 --> 02:43:03.274]  And they don't want us having high quality iodine.
[02:43:03.274 --> 02:43:05.134]  They want us having the other bad halogens.
[02:43:05.134 --> 02:43:05.815]  What does that tell us?
[02:43:06.684 --> 02:43:14.010]  That tells us that we need to keep our bodies clean on a regular basis, and we need to make sure that we combat that in every way, shape, and form.
[02:43:14.010 --> 02:43:17.233]  By drinking pure water, by eating clean food, exactly what she's doing.
[02:43:17.233 --> 02:43:18.935]  Congratulations, by the way.
[02:43:18.935 --> 02:43:21.297]  I live a very, extremely clean life.
[02:43:21.297 --> 02:43:22.938]  I mean, organic, everything.
[02:43:22.938 --> 02:43:24.640]  And I still take all this stuff.
[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:28.963]  Any male is going to be reduced of hormones regardless of how clean your body is.
[02:43:28.963 --> 02:43:32.145]  It's just a natural order that you're going to reduce your hormones after the age of 28.
[02:43:32.145 --> 02:43:34.787]  Well, medical doctors are on record in the studies.
[02:43:34.787 --> 02:43:36.128]  Sperm counts are down.
[02:43:36.128 --> 02:43:37.689]  Genitals are shrinking.
[02:43:37.689 --> 02:43:38.629]  Hormones are lower.
[02:43:38.629 --> 02:43:39.630]  We've been jacked with.
[02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:43.313]  It doesn't matter how much, you know, it doesn't matter how much you eat.
[02:43:43.313 --> 02:43:46.275]  You cannot get the type of nutrients in foods anymore.
[02:43:46.275 --> 02:43:50.137]  Look, all I know is I take Supramel Vitality and it's like I'm 20 again.
[02:43:50.137 --> 02:43:52.459]  In the, you know, what department?
[02:43:52.459 --> 02:43:53.460]  And, I mean, come on.
[02:43:54.434 --> 02:43:56.476]  That's, I mean, this stuff's real.
[02:43:56.476 --> 02:44:01.821]  All I'm saying is that this is changing relationships and changing people's lives and that's what it's all about.
[02:44:01.821 --> 02:44:08.728]  It's about feeling the way you did when you were young again, you know, getting your life back, getting your confidence back, you know, looking in the mirror and say,
[02:44:09.861 --> 02:44:11.382]  You know, I feel good again.
[02:44:11.382 --> 02:44:12.242]  I feel healthy.
[02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:13.402]  I feel self-confident.
[02:44:13.402 --> 02:44:16.484]  I mean, right now we have a bunch of people that have been off of work for three years.
[02:44:16.484 --> 02:44:18.144]  You know, they're getting unemployment.
[02:44:18.144 --> 02:44:21.966]  They're not doing anything but sitting on the couch, getting fat, getting unhealthy.
[02:44:21.966 --> 02:44:27.088]  And, you know, right now it's time to step up to the plate, especially with all this stuff that's going on.
[02:44:27.088 --> 02:44:29.489]  Yeah, for me, this has helped snap me out of the trance.
[02:44:30.609 --> 02:44:31.790]  Dr. Group, we'll talk to you after the show.
[02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:32.330]  God bless you.
[02:44:32.330 --> 02:44:32.791]  Thank you.
[02:44:32.791 --> 02:44:35.252]  BubbleHealingCenter.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:35.252 --> 02:44:38.535]  Okay, I apologize to Richard Gage for getting him on about 10 minutes late.
[02:44:38.535 --> 02:44:41.697]  We just got Group on a little bit late because of breaking news today.
[02:44:41.697 --> 02:44:44.379]  Richard Gage, AE911Truth.org.
[02:44:44.379 --> 02:44:47.461]  A few weeks ago, he was on for a whole hour on C-SPAN.
[02:44:47.461 --> 02:44:50.683]  They got a lot of great reviews, a lot of people watched it.
[02:44:50.683 --> 02:44:53.765]  Breaking down the impossibilities of the official 9-11 story, AE911Truth.org.
[02:44:57.968 --> 02:44:59.148]  O-R-G.
[02:44:59.148 --> 02:45:05.130]  For those that don't know, Underwriting Laboratories has been forced to admit that the building fell at freefall, Building 7.
[02:45:05.130 --> 02:45:06.490]  The government's been forced to admit it.
[02:45:06.490 --> 02:45:09.711]  Richard Gage and others were able to prove this.
[02:45:09.711 --> 02:45:12.972]  And Gage has been doing this now, I guess, about 8, 9, 10 years.
[02:45:12.972 --> 02:45:13.492]  I forget.
[02:45:13.492 --> 02:45:23.455]  And he joins us now to give us the state of 9-11 truth from AE911truth.org and all the new stuff we've been discovering.
[02:45:23.455 --> 02:45:25.095]  Richard Gage, thank you for coming on today.
[02:45:26.144 --> 02:45:26.924]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:45:26.924 --> 02:45:29.646]  It's always my honor to be on with you.
[02:45:29.646 --> 02:45:31.507]  Well, there's so much to talk about.
[02:45:31.507 --> 02:45:33.388]  Where do we start?
[02:45:33.388 --> 02:45:36.589]  We've got to start about... Let's start with September.
[02:45:36.589 --> 02:45:40.872]  This September is the 13th anniversary of 9-11.
[02:45:40.872 --> 02:45:53.418]  And AE911 Truth has been at it for eight years, since I woke up after hearing David Ray Griffin on the radio, now an author, of course, of nine books, ten books, on the subject of
[02:45:54.039 --> 02:45:54.219]  9-11.
[02:45:54.219 --> 02:45:55.501]  And we have plans.
[02:45:55.501 --> 02:45:58.184]  Last year we had a $500,000 program raised by donors.
[02:45:58.184 --> 02:45:59.386]  $100 increments to put
[02:46:07.682 --> 02:46:15.708]  Billboards around the world in 12 international cities, including of course New York with our 50 foot tall billboard.
[02:46:15.708 --> 02:46:25.515]  And we are going to be back in New York in a big way because the American people deserve to know what really happened to all three of those towers on 9-11.
[02:46:25.515 --> 02:46:35.463]  So since the New York Times, for instance, has been completely censoring the subject of the scientific evidence for the controlled demolition
[02:46:36.141 --> 02:46:50.429]  Of the three high-rises, we are putting right in their face a 30-foot tall billboard targeting their chief editor.
[02:46:50.429 --> 02:46:56.993]  He said, we found no evidence to suggest that anything other than planes brought down the tower as well.
[02:46:56.993 --> 02:47:02.556]  There's all kinds of evidence, and we're putting it right there in front of his nose, in this billboard.
[02:47:03.398 --> 02:47:11.284]  With the Rethink 9-11 campaign, it says Rethink911.org, the evidence might surprise you.
[02:47:11.284 --> 02:47:24.453]  So, once again, we're back right in front of the faces of not only the New York Times, but in the backyard of the City Hall, who arbitrarily dismissed 30,000 signatures of their citizens.
[02:47:24.833 --> 02:47:36.716]  We're demanding that we have a ballot initiative called the High-Rise Safety Initiative that the New York Coalition for Accountability now has raised a hundred thousand signatures for.
[02:47:36.716 --> 02:47:46.078]  We're taking the city to court, we being the NYC can, to challenge them on this grievous
[02:47:47.226 --> 02:47:52.931]  Irresponsible act defying the will of the New York people.
[02:47:52.931 --> 02:48:02.099]  This initiative will require the investigation of any high-rise that collapses, starting with building 7, as you highlighted earlier.
[02:48:02.099 --> 02:48:09.245]  Here's a 47-story skyscraper, Alex, that dropped into its own footprint on the afternoon of 9-11.
[02:48:10.826 --> 02:48:13.987]  Just like a controlled demolition.
[02:48:13.987 --> 02:48:19.990]  I mean, we're talking free-fall acceleration in under seven seconds.
[02:48:19.990 --> 02:48:31.435]  This massive building, the tallest in most of our state, but of course right next to the Twin Towers, which it was a part of the World Trade Center, it may not seem that tall.
[02:48:31.435 --> 02:48:37.498]  Those were the tallest buildings in the world at one time, but this building dropped like a rock.
[02:48:37.498 --> 02:48:37.978]  Now it had 40
[02:48:39.459 --> 02:48:55.832]  1,000 tons of structural steel in it and yet to drop at free fall all 80 columns on at least eight floors in this case would have to have been removed virtually at once.
[02:48:55.832 --> 02:49:02.057]  Now fires, the official cause of this building's collapse, cannot possibly explain that.
[02:49:02.057 --> 02:49:05.520]  So we know that individually pre-placed explosives
[02:49:06.078 --> 02:49:14.043]  Thousands of them, or incendiaries, in this case, would have to have removed that structural support.
[02:49:14.043 --> 02:49:21.388]  So we have all the evidence in our DVD, 9-11, explosive evidence, experts speak out.
[02:49:21.388 --> 02:49:32.776]  People can just Google, experts speak out, or go to our website, of course, as you mentioned, it's AE911Truth.org, where all this evidence is.
[02:49:32.776 --> 02:49:35.378]  And we have put it in a format
[02:49:35.936 --> 02:49:51.362]  That activists in New York, this September, and around the country, in fact, all around the world, can take to friends, relatives, co-workers, elected representatives, media, people in the media.
[02:49:51.362 --> 02:49:54.663]  We have a new brochure, which is very, very exciting.
[02:49:54.663 --> 02:49:56.344]  9-11 Truth.
[02:49:56.344 --> 02:49:58.084]  Good for America.
[02:49:58.084 --> 02:50:00.705]  Why is 9-11 Truth good for America?
[02:50:00.705 --> 02:50:04.067]  I mean, this is the subject of your radio show.
[02:50:05.617 --> 02:50:09.680]  There's a reason that you were a hero to millions of people, Alex.
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:16.946]  You're pointing out the wars of aggression that 9-11 Truth will stop, because they started most of them.
[02:50:16.946 --> 02:50:24.471]  It'll restore our economy, because 9-11 Truth devastated our economy, as you know, with a $4.5 trillion global war on terror that
[02:50:30.196 --> 02:50:35.921]  And now, stay there, I want to come back and talk about that.
[02:50:35.921 --> 02:50:41.146]  Now, Al-Qaeda in Iraq is IS, armed by our government to attack Syria.
[02:50:41.146 --> 02:50:44.549]  Now our government's supposedly fighting them over there, and I've looked at all the videos.
[02:50:44.549 --> 02:50:47.372]  Looks like a few trucks getting blown up, totally staged.
[02:50:47.372 --> 02:50:52.476]  They're going to use the new Al-Qaeda threat to totally take our freedoms and are saying, get ready for them to hit.
[02:50:53.357 --> 02:50:58.812]  And when we bring up, hey we funded these guys, shut up conspiracy theorists, when that's a fact, wow!
[02:51:01.229 --> 02:51:03.510]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:06.830]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:09.571]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[02:51:09.571 --> 02:51:13.532]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:51:13.532 --> 02:51:17.293]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:51:17.293 --> 02:51:18.693]  Ours is not immune.
[02:51:18.693 --> 02:51:20.354]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:51:20.354 --> 02:51:20.914]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:51:25.675 --> 02:51:28.377]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:51:28.377 --> 02:51:33.941]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[02:51:33.941 --> 02:51:37.323]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:51:37.323 --> 02:51:38.624]  The choice is yours.
[02:51:38.624 --> 02:51:39.784]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:51:39.784 --> 02:51:40.845]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:51:40.845 --> 02:51:41.866]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:51:41.866 --> 02:51:42.046]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[02:51:55.916 --> 02:51:56.477]  Extension 116.
[02:52:00.475 --> 02:52:02.757]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:52:02.757 --> 02:52:10.181]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:52:10.181 --> 02:52:21.009]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:52:21.009 --> 02:52:30.255]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:52:30.975 --> 02:52:35.037]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:52:35.037 --> 02:52:38.799]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:52:38.799 --> 02:52:40.860]  Experience the new formula.
[02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:43.422]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:52:43.422 --> 02:52:44.762]  Shield your family.
[02:52:44.762 --> 02:52:46.583]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:52:46.583 --> 02:52:49.745]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:52:49.745 --> 02:52:53.727]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:52:59.158 --> 02:53:02.060]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[02:53:02.060 --> 02:53:05.602]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:53:05.602 --> 02:53:07.764]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[02:53:07.764 --> 02:53:17.070]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[02:53:17.070 --> 02:53:23.074]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.
[02:53:23.074 --> 02:53:29.058]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.
[02:53:29.418 --> 02:53:34.260]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[02:53:34.260 --> 02:53:36.041]  That means big savings.
[02:53:36.041 --> 02:53:40.483]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:53:49.267 --> 02:53:50.228]  That's 877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[02:53:50.228 --> 02:53:52.569]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:10.479]  We're going to do five minutes of overdrive with Richard Gage.
[02:54:10.479 --> 02:54:12.960]  I'll be back tonight, Nightly News, seven o'clock central.
[02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:16.302]  Our reporters are in Ferguson.
[02:54:16.302 --> 02:54:19.083]  Some of the headlines up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:19.083 --> 02:54:26.027]  Former CIA officer says ISIS and Mexican drug cartels are communicating and working on the border.
[02:54:26.027 --> 02:54:28.609]  James Foley beheading what they're not telling you.
[02:54:28.609 --> 02:54:34.832]  A breakdown of how it's meant to launch a new war in Syria to, quote, knock out the group our government funded.
[02:54:34.832 --> 02:54:35.653]  This is so sick.
[02:54:36.823 --> 02:54:44.807]  Again, school kids suspended and arrested for imagining shooting a dinosaur.
[02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.288]  It's a thought crime.
[02:54:46.288 --> 02:54:49.329]  ISIS abducts more Westerners, promises beheadings.
[02:54:49.329 --> 02:54:54.292]  UK police merely watching James Foley's beheading video is an act of terrorism.
[02:54:54.292 --> 02:55:00.495]  So the border's wide open, but we've all got to give our rights up because Al-Qaeda's about to hit us.
[02:55:00.495 --> 02:55:04.097]  But then meanwhile, Al-Qaeda's renamed itself and is being allowed to operate.
[02:55:05.529 --> 02:55:10.153]  It's the clash of civilization and the elite use that clash to take over our lives.
[02:55:10.153 --> 02:55:15.939]  Talking to the founder and head of AE 911 Truth, Architects and Engineers 911 Truth, Richard Gage.
[02:55:15.939 --> 02:55:18.361]  Richard, we can get into the science all day.
[02:55:18.361 --> 02:55:24.587]  I was covering the controlled demolition hours after it happened.
[02:55:24.587 --> 02:55:26.409]  We've gone through the physics, we've covered it.
[02:55:27.597 --> 02:55:31.521]  A lot of people worldwide, a majority believe that it's a fishy story.
[02:55:31.521 --> 02:55:35.105]  A large portion of America is putting on the poll on a new investigation.
[02:55:35.105 --> 02:55:38.809]  This far out from it, I think we've already won in the court of public opinion.
[02:55:38.809 --> 02:55:41.472]  People don't buy anything the government says anymore.
[02:55:41.472 --> 02:55:44.315]  A lot of conservatives that were mad at me for saying it was an inside job.
[02:55:46.537 --> 02:55:53.961]  Now, looking back, see what a fraud the Iraq war was, see how our government's funding Al-Qaeda today, and was doing it then.
[02:55:53.961 --> 02:55:56.902]  I don't think we know exactly what happened on 9-11.
[02:55:56.902 --> 02:56:01.184]  I'm not saying George Bush had a plunger, like Wiley Coyote blowing up the towers.
[02:56:01.184 --> 02:56:02.585]  I just know NORAD stood down.
[02:56:02.585 --> 02:56:04.506]  I know there's bombs in those buildings.
[02:56:04.506 --> 02:56:07.247]  I know on CNN, cops said, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[02:56:07.247 --> 02:56:08.988]  They blew it up.
[02:56:08.988 --> 02:56:10.529]  I'm not saying those cops did it.
[02:56:10.529 --> 02:56:11.689]  They were told, get back.
[02:56:11.689 --> 02:56:13.170]  And I talked to the cops, heard the countdown.
[02:56:14.192 --> 02:56:21.236]  The Red Cross of all people, usually your CIA fronts, not your low-level Red Cross, but high-level folks, look that up.
[02:56:21.236 --> 02:56:23.337]  They were getting the countdown.
[02:56:23.337 --> 02:56:25.258]  And it was on the news they were going to bring 7 down.
[02:56:25.258 --> 02:56:27.759]  I heard it on CBS Radio that afternoon.
[02:56:27.759 --> 02:56:35.484]  So, for me, proving it all, I mean, I heard them say, and we have the newscast, that they were going to blow up Building 7 to protect other buildings.
[02:56:36.158 --> 02:56:38.639]  Well, you can't plant bombs in a couple hours.
[02:56:38.639 --> 02:56:39.839]  So they didn't want that looked at.
[02:56:39.839 --> 02:56:46.860]  The point is they're lying about what really happened, Richard, and they used it to launch all these wars and to set up a police state.
[02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:52.062]  And now they say Al-Qaeda is about to hit us again when our government opened the door for them.
[02:56:52.062 --> 02:56:59.283]  My rights should not be taken because this criminal government is allowing Al-Qaeda to survive and thrive.
[02:56:59.283 --> 02:57:01.864]  What do you get off that basic gestalt statement I just made?
[02:57:03.675 --> 02:57:21.336]  What we need to realize is that if people just listen to Alex Jones and don't do anything about his message or the message of AE911 Truth, then we'll get what we got for the last 13 years, the greatest crime of the century.
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:27.568]  So what we're doing this September is to respond to exactly that question.
[02:57:27.568 --> 02:57:33.055]  We're taking action and we're encouraging all of your listeners to take action where they can.
[02:57:33.055 --> 02:57:39.123]  If they can come to New York, we'll have the premiere of Anatomy of a Great Deception.
[02:57:39.663 --> 02:57:54.134]  Which is one man's effort to resolve his own inner conflict upon waking up to the scientific evidence of 9-11, as presented by a 9-11 truth in the case of David Hooper, this filmmaker.
[02:57:54.134 --> 02:57:55.455]  So at 2 p.m.
[02:57:55.455 --> 02:58:00.959]  on September 11, we want everybody to come to the premiere, downtown New York.
[02:58:00.959 --> 02:58:05.182]  And then on Friday, we're going to be doing street action in front of the New York Times.
[02:58:05.629 --> 02:58:08.852]  To wake people up, employees and visitors.
[02:58:08.852 --> 02:58:21.902]  We're going to also be in front of the 9-11 Museum, one of the greatest, second greatest frauds in history, to ensconce the official story with our alternative guide to the museum.
[02:58:21.902 --> 02:58:24.845]  What you will not see in the museum.
[02:58:24.845 --> 02:58:28.488]  And then on Saturday we'll have a conference at 2 p.m.
[02:58:28.488 --> 02:58:29.769]  on the 13th.
[02:58:29.769 --> 02:58:34.553]  So we've got to take action and that's what got us on C-SPAN is taking action
[02:58:35.111 --> 02:58:36.372]  I want to talk about C-SPAN.
[02:58:36.372 --> 02:58:36.773]  Stay there.
[02:58:36.773 --> 02:58:38.554]  We're back in one minute.
[02:58:38.554 --> 02:58:39.976]  So important to expose 9-11.
[02:58:39.976 --> 02:58:43.339]  They're getting ready to launch more false flags.
[02:58:43.339 --> 02:58:46.702]  Like Oklahoma City, blame it on the Liberty Movement.
[02:58:46.702 --> 02:58:48.804]  We must break the weapon of the false flag.
[02:58:49.909 --> 02:58:52.391]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[02:58:52.391 --> 02:58:59.097]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[02:58:59.097 --> 02:59:01.879]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[02:59:01.879 --> 02:59:03.820]  If not, then I want to know why.
[02:59:03.820 --> 02:59:06.122]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[02:59:06.122 --> 02:59:10.326]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[02:59:10.606 --> 02:59:11.748]  I say, so what?
[02:59:11.748 --> 02:59:13.971]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[02:59:13.971 --> 02:59:17.356]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[02:59:17.356 --> 02:59:21.602]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[02:59:21.602 --> 02:59:25.949]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[02:59:26.189 --> 02:59:27.430]  And I'm still fighting.
[02:59:27.430 --> 02:59:30.672]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[02:59:30.672 --> 02:59:32.493]  The Infowar is worldwide.
[02:59:32.493 --> 02:59:36.815]  Tell your friends about Infowars and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull.
[02:59:36.815 --> 02:59:40.537]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[02:59:40.537 --> 02:59:47.781]  Step up and take your friends and family to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfowars.com.
[02:59:47.781 --> 02:59:49.242]  The truth will set them free.
[02:59:50.819 --> 02:59:54.409]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.409 --> 02:59:57.617]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.871 --> 03:00:07.172]  Big Brother.
[03:00:07.172 --> 03:00:08.933]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.933 --> 03:00:10.694]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.694 --> 03:00:12.294]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.294 --> 03:00:13.835]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.835 --> 03:00:18.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.018 --> 03:00:25.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.802 --> 03:00:27.663]  Showing the power of the new media.
[03:00:29.161 --> 03:00:35.685]  Police were just indiscriminately arresting innocent journalists because they didn't want them there in Ferguson two nights ago.
[03:00:35.685 --> 03:00:44.010]  We put the video out of our reporter having the gun aimed at him and then threatening another reporter, the Ferguson cop, to kill them for no reason.
[03:00:44.010 --> 03:00:48.332]  He's been suspended indefinitely.
[03:00:48.332 --> 03:00:57.718]  It just shows the us-against-them mentality that they have there because they've been told to go after the journalist.
[03:00:58.439 --> 03:01:00.581]  And that's the same thing that's happened to 9-11 Truth.
[03:01:00.581 --> 03:01:12.409]  You know, I came out for 9-11 Truth the first day because I could see them building up the police state, and, oh, there's going to be a terror attack, and when it comes, we're going to take your liberties to keep you safe.
[03:01:12.409 --> 03:01:14.851]  Well, I knew if you take our liberties, we're not kept safe.
[03:01:14.851 --> 03:01:19.134]  I mean, let's say the official story's true, okay?
[03:01:19.134 --> 03:01:22.797]  Let's say Easter Bunny is real as well, and Santa Claus.
[03:01:22.797 --> 03:01:26.039]  Are we safe for giving up our freedoms and having the NSA illegally spy on us?
[03:01:27.412 --> 03:01:28.513]  Invading all these countries.
[03:01:28.513 --> 03:01:30.935]  And the answer is no!
[03:01:30.935 --> 03:01:33.056]  Al-Qaeda is more powerful than ever!
[03:01:33.056 --> 03:01:34.558]  And being armed by our government.
[03:01:34.558 --> 03:01:37.520]  I mean, it's a fact they were given heat-seeking missiles.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:41.383]  It's a fact they were given chemical weapons to attack Assad and he was blamed.
[03:01:41.383 --> 03:01:45.166]  Al-Qaeda does the dirty work for the globalists that have hijacked our country.
[03:01:45.953 --> 03:01:47.633]  I mean, it's real simple.
[03:01:47.633 --> 03:01:50.454]  I get into the political realm, the geopolitical.
[03:01:50.454 --> 03:01:56.175]  Richard Gage, an architect and engineer, gets into the science of it.
[03:01:56.175 --> 03:02:03.597]  How many thousands of architects and engineers, Richard, you as an architect, do you now have in the organization?
[03:02:03.597 --> 03:02:11.459]  We have 2,200 architects and engineers putting their reputation online, demanding a real investigation.
[03:02:11.459 --> 03:02:15.520]  And the message that they have is, as you suggested, not just about
[03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:42.332]  Scientific evidence, which as you mentioned is overwhelming, but it's about take action people do something come to New York if you can and get the brochures for the Download them for free for the 9-11 truth good for America Campaign which is also the 9-11 truth good for the world campaign we have brochures for international use so I I'm just hoping that
[03:02:42.752 --> 03:02:57.055]  Alex, that people will go to the website and look at the 2200 architects and engineers and do what they're suggesting, which is talk to everybody you know.
[03:02:57.055 --> 03:02:59.276]  Get these brochures out.
[03:02:59.276 --> 03:03:03.856]  They are free on our website, AE911Truth.org.
[03:03:03.856 --> 03:03:04.977]  Free to download.
[03:03:04.977 --> 03:03:07.377]  More people can purchase them too.
[03:03:07.377 --> 03:03:10.818]  But there's signs, there's banners, there's t-shirts, there's hats.
[03:03:11.297 --> 03:03:24.724]  There's DVDs of the new DVD, Anatomy of a Great Deception, premiering all over the world including Oakland and Detroit and Houston and Tempe.
[03:03:24.724 --> 03:03:27.886]  There's just no end of the things that people can get into.
[03:03:27.886 --> 03:03:29.907]  Well that's right, and the reason this is so important
[03:03:30.808 --> 03:03:37.854]  Is that when they staged the underwear bombing a few years ago, we had a lawyer and his wife, both lawyers, on that flight back from Amsterdam.
[03:03:37.854 --> 03:03:40.476]  They saw the feds get him on the plane without a passport.
[03:03:40.476 --> 03:03:45.921]  They saw he was drugged, Haskell and others.
[03:03:45.921 --> 03:03:47.722]  They witnessed it all.
[03:03:47.722 --> 03:03:49.964]  It ended up coming out in Congress a month and a half later.
[03:03:49.964 --> 03:03:50.605]  We broke that.
[03:03:51.845 --> 03:03:57.089]  And my point is, so many times now, people are aware of false flags.
[03:03:57.089 --> 03:04:00.131]  When there's a new terror attacker event, people are watching.
[03:04:00.131 --> 03:04:01.332]  Experts are.
[03:04:01.332 --> 03:04:08.778]  Police, military, lawyers, investigators, professors, average folks know what to look for now.
[03:04:08.778 --> 03:04:14.382]  That's really freaking the system out that we expose that Al-Qaeda launched the chemical attack, not Assad.
[03:04:14.382 --> 03:04:16.863]  We're not fans of Assad, but he's not attacking anybody.
[03:04:16.863 --> 03:04:18.365]  He's not sawing Christians' heads off.
[03:04:19.085 --> 03:04:30.370]  We're not fans of Hazi Mubarak, but he was our ally for 33 years, and the country was a lot more stable, and tourists could go there, and people could live in peace, so they tried to overthrow him and put in basically Al Qaeda.
[03:04:30.370 --> 03:04:38.393]  Our government is working with radical Wahhabists, and we need to expose it, and they're getting ready for another terror attack.
[03:04:38.393 --> 03:04:43.695]  So we've got to expose... And 9-11 Truth ends all of that, Alex.
[03:04:43.695 --> 03:04:47.297]  It's the domino that starts the other dominoes blowing.
[03:04:47.297 --> 03:04:47.517]  I know.
[03:04:49.847 --> 03:04:54.840]  It's the false flag of false flags until they set a nuke off and blame it on the Patriot movement.
[03:04:54.840 --> 03:04:56.084]  Or Al Qaeda.
[03:04:56.084 --> 03:04:57.929]  Alright, Richard Gage, thank you so much.
[03:04:57.929 --> 03:04:58.671]  Nightly News Tonight at 7.
