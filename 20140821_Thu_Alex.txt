[00:46.000 --> 00:50.920]  going to be live here today for the next three hours and man it is the age of
[00:50.920 --> 00:58.480]  staged global destabilization on every front we are going to be looking at the
[00:58.480 --> 01:08.240]  latest ISIS activities as stage provocations are developed and deployed
[01:08.240 --> 01:16.360]  ahead of possible US Syria war only in the bizarro world of the new world order
[01:16.360 --> 01:22.960]  with an ignorant global population about how the world really works could you
[01:22.960 --> 01:34.200]  have a situation where rebels funded and armed by the West from Israel to Turkey
[01:34.200 --> 01:45.080]  to Jordan to the United States to France to England NATO all involved for
[01:45.080 --> 01:54.760]  four years arming Wahhabist jihadi Islamic State al Qaeda in Iraq scum of the
[01:54.760 --> 02:04.360]  earth to attack Assad to attack Qadhafi to attack the Egyptian government our
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.960]  supposed ally that got double-crossed they're now attacking Jordan who helped
[02:08.960 --> 02:16.280]  train them they're now even threatening Saudi Arabia that's funding them it's
[02:16.280 --> 02:20.560]  just a bunch of wild murdering demons who have just been turned loose so they're
[02:20.560 --> 02:24.600]  attacking anything and everything including each other it's like a
[02:24.600 --> 02:29.080]  satanic ideologies only way to describe it and they are now running around like a
[02:29.080 --> 02:36.520]  pack of starving piranhas with all these heat-seeking missiles I talked to a
[02:36.520 --> 02:43.400]  quote city official yesterday that I ran into at Barton Springs and he said you
[02:43.400 --> 02:47.800]  don't know about the service air missiles and I knew the guy was I wouldn't
[02:47.800 --> 02:52.000]  look him up among us as name he goes this is off record you know who I you know
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.440]  my name you can bring it up you didn't know that they found service to air
[02:56.440 --> 03:01.280]  missiles just a couple years ago crossing the border out of Mexico and we're
[03:01.280 --> 03:08.760]  found at the Salvation Army in Austin so I'm gonna have to investigate into that
[03:08.760 --> 03:16.360]  he said that's all I'm telling you look into it and I'm sure the police out
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.600]  there that are more senior they know about it maybe you can call in and give
[03:19.600 --> 03:28.360]  us the specifics but that's just how bizarre all of this is getting just
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.280]  crates outside the Salvation Army show up in the alley I guess to be picked up
[03:32.280 --> 03:35.280]  by somebody else and somebody else went and looked at them and said what are
[03:35.280 --> 03:43.400]  these and called the police and notice you never heard about it on the news and
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.440]  his words were it was quite a few crates I don't mean to go off on a jag about
[03:47.440 --> 03:55.440]  that it's just that's how bizarre the world is and I've been so busy this
[03:55.440 --> 03:59.360]  summer I hadn't even been to Barton Springs but one other time so I went
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.640]  over there I guess day afternoon I forget a bunch of errands and company
[04:03.640 --> 04:12.000]  work done and his fellow comes over I knew I recognized him and he introduced
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.680]  himself about two minutes in the conversation sitting there in the
[04:16.680 --> 04:26.040]  springs he said oh yeah we're talking about al-Qaeda and serviced air missiles
[04:26.040 --> 04:30.720]  and he said do you heard about the Salvation Army in the missiles right I
[04:30.720 --> 04:37.880]  said excuse me no I never heard about that imagine what else is going on
[04:38.640 --> 04:45.000]  imagine I mean we confirmed missing nukes out of Dias earlier this year and
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.480]  remember right after we reported all hell broke loose the next three days with
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.520]  threats of nukes going off right where we said they went and Lindsey Graham going
[04:52.520 --> 04:57.680]  on CBS News and saying brace for nukes to go off I mean it's a bunch of weird

[10:16.760 --> 10:23.560]  am your host Alex Jones we have architect and engineer Richard gauge
[10:23.560 --> 10:28.280]  joining us with updates on the scientific impossibility that was the
[10:28.280 --> 10:34.440]  official narrative of 9 11 and his progress getting tens of thousands of
[10:34.440 --> 10:38.080]  other engineers and others to go public and a lot of new evidence that's come
[10:38.080 --> 10:44.600]  out and we'll tie that into ISIS and al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia all basically
[10:44.600 --> 10:51.760]  being protected by criminals inside of Western systems both corporate
[10:51.760 --> 10:58.880]  governmental in the security apparatus that wishes to fully take over society
[10:58.880 --> 11:06.400]  and set itself on a throne of the Talatarian surveillance and paramilitary
[11:06.400 --> 11:13.720]  oppression martial law eternal over all economic systems over religious systems
[11:13.720 --> 11:21.760]  over the family the total control freak technocracy the scientific dictatorship
[11:21.760 --> 11:29.440]  and it's being delivered to us through contrived medical crises collapsing
[11:29.440 --> 11:40.520]  border crises radical Islamic jihadi crises energy crises where every sector
[11:40.520 --> 11:48.200]  of the economy is gained let's just give you some of the headlines here UK
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.640]  police say merely watching a James Foley bedding video may be an act of
[11:52.640 --> 12:03.520]  terrorism man you talk about political correctness England is the model of
[12:03.520 --> 12:08.440]  mental oppression where you can't even criticize youth burning down your city
[12:08.440 --> 12:13.640]  or you're a racist and they're bringing that here last year people thought we
[12:13.640 --> 12:16.760]  were joking when reported it was mainstream news with a straight face
[12:16.760 --> 12:21.520]  they said do not bring brown bags to city buildings they are racist no one
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.680]  ever claimed a brown bag had any that's like saying you can't have white sheets
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.520]  on your bed because it secretly means you're a clan member or you can't have
[12:30.520 --> 12:34.200]  a white car a black guy is driving a white car he must be a clan member
[12:34.200 --> 12:40.640]  and again they know it's mentally ill they're they're getting you to accept an
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.520]  idea where all human activity and all information is basically a crime
[12:45.520 --> 12:52.080]  selectively enforced it's like the different supplement laws they've
[12:52.080 --> 12:58.680]  passed in California where you can't even have one part per million of lead in
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.520]  any of your supplement when there's like you know 20 parts per million in one
[13:03.520 --> 13:12.400]  bite of cabbage on average or you breathe in 55 parts per million a day
[13:12.400 --> 13:20.400]  basically anywhere in the country but a supplement can't even have over 0.5 one
[13:20.400 --> 13:26.840]  parts per million nothing basically there's nothing out there but things
[13:26.840 --> 13:32.800]  like pure iodine that doesn't have something else in it so they can then
[13:32.800 --> 13:35.640]  selectively shut down all the supplements just like they passed gun
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.240]  regulations in California that are impossible to follow so all the
[13:40.240 --> 13:45.960]  manufacturers leave because micro stampings of fraud doesn't work see this
[13:45.960 --> 13:48.640]  is how they're shutting us down before I get into all the news let me give any
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.400]  examples I was thinking about this yesterday as a sign of the country
[13:53.400 --> 14:00.520]  collapsing just three or four years ago a good stake was $20 then you go to the
[14:00.520 --> 14:09.320]  same restaurant a year later it's $35 then it's $45 now that same stake is
[14:09.320 --> 14:14.800]  $60 this is why my Republic stuff I was looking at a menu last night at a
[14:14.800 --> 14:21.480]  steakhouse when I was some friends and I and I literally couldn't even order a
[14:21.480 --> 14:25.400]  steak and eat it I was so freaked out that that that all the steaks were like
[14:25.400 --> 14:30.640]  $60 or more and it wasn't that I didn't have the money to buy the steak it was
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.000]  that I was freaked out the sign they say Joe Kennedy sold out of all his stock a
[14:36.000 --> 14:44.640]  week before the crash of 29 because he was out front his brokerage firm and a
[14:44.640 --> 14:50.280]  shoe shine boy ran up to him telling him what stock to buy and it's basically
[14:50.280 --> 14:56.280]  like one of those signs of just how everything is teetering and how the
[14:56.280 --> 15:02.280]  inflation is exploding and poor people just can't get by now to pay for the
[15:02.280 --> 15:06.960]  gas and the insurance and the food and the clothes for their kids and they're
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.040]  working two three jobs on you know just trying to make it and their kids are
[15:12.040 --> 15:15.520]  being raised by television and by the gangster kids in the neighborhood and
[15:15.520 --> 15:19.680]  it's all designed to destroy the family to turn women into slaves the
[15:19.680 --> 15:23.720]  government to make them work to make them pay taxes you can just see it
[15:23.720 --> 15:31.440]  degenerating faster and faster here's a microcosm I know the beef business
[15:31.440 --> 15:38.040]  we've raised cattle for well since you know 1829 in the same area of East
[15:38.040 --> 15:44.880]  Texas and I know people that are in the steakhouse business and I know people
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.200]  that are in the meatpacking business and I know the people that own some of the
[15:49.200 --> 15:57.600]  biggest herds in the country so I'm not a super expert like a cattleman but I
[15:57.600 --> 16:00.920]  understand the business I know how it works that's why I told you a few years
[16:00.920 --> 16:04.960]  ago get ready for your beef prices to double triple quadruple which they've
[16:04.960 --> 16:11.600]  now done because let me explain this almost everyone is going bankrupt in
[16:11.600 --> 16:14.240]  the cattle business because the government has set up regulations and
[16:14.240 --> 16:20.200]  rules where it's basically impossible to make money while the beef is the most
[16:20.200 --> 16:30.400]  expensive it's ever been because of two different issues a the big meat packers
[16:30.400 --> 16:34.320]  there's only three big ones now got together got federal rules pass control
[16:34.320 --> 16:40.920]  the inspectors to shut down thousands of meatpacking facilities that have been
[16:40.920 --> 16:45.240]  open in some cases over 200 years in the case of the East Coast to shut down
[16:45.240 --> 16:50.880]  family owned and and small corporate chains all over the country they were
[16:50.880 --> 16:57.400]  providing poultry beef fish you name it using regulations there are no more real
[16:57.400 --> 17:00.720]  cattle auctions that go on if they still have the cattle auction it's being
[17:00.720 --> 17:06.320]  controlled by the big three they get all the meat they then fix the prices
[17:06.320 --> 17:09.880]  behind the scenes so you would think that the rancher will be making record
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.400]  profits no no no no they're going bankrupt because it's so game they've
[17:14.400 --> 17:22.720]  got to sell it for the lowest price ever then it all goes up to the meatpacking
[17:22.720 --> 17:27.400]  facilities who are literally above the law can have all the violations they want
[17:27.400 --> 17:31.840]  you name it do unspeakable things the quality goes down they can ship in meat
[17:31.840 --> 17:38.040]  they want but only by the big cartels of griefs Congress and the states and then
[17:38.040 --> 17:41.240]  you have the dollar being devalued so that's why meat across the board is
[17:41.240 --> 17:49.840]  going up because the eggs are gained now fish is gained now see people think
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.200]  business now is just about having the best product or the best marketing and
[17:53.200 --> 17:56.920]  that's part of it but more and more it's just being smart enough to be able to
[17:56.920 --> 18:01.560]  navigate all of the gangsters in government and corporations that
[18:01.560 --> 18:06.400]  literally try to shut you down if you do anything if you have a news website if
[18:06.400 --> 18:11.360]  you sell supplements if you sell films if you sell made in America t-shirts if
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.880]  you hire a casting facility to make a few thousand belt buckles the bureaucrats
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.760]  come in and try to shut it down they don't want anybody operating in this
[18:21.760 --> 18:25.760]  country that's why they've had thousands of arrests and fines across the country
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.200]  in what forms magazine called the war on lemonade stands that's why they're
[18:30.200 --> 18:35.040]  having wars on farmers markets and wars on Amish and wars on people put up their
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.840]  own solar power that isn't hooked into the grid you hook up wind power across
[18:38.840 --> 18:42.640]  this country or solar on your own farmhouse you're gonna have inspectors
[18:42.640 --> 18:46.400]  showing up within a year freaking out want to tear it off your house and just
[18:46.400 --> 18:50.960]  hyperventilating they're here to shut this country down you understand this is
[18:50.960 --> 19:01.600]  an agenda 21 war and I was talking to one of the biggest cattleman in Texas who
[19:01.600 --> 19:06.440]  was going to build his facility with the state of the art stainless steel they
[19:06.440 --> 19:11.920]  were about to buy the property two years ago to then bring their premium black
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.720]  angus you know one of the top breeders in the country directly to market to sell
[19:17.720 --> 19:23.920]  the steakhouses across Texas and in their own steakhouse and came to the
[19:23.920 --> 19:34.960]  conclusion you're just not allowed to that's America that's America rich people
[19:34.960 --> 19:39.640]  can't start a business in America because you're not part of the made mafia
[19:39.640 --> 19:43.760]  and that's what creates a third-world country and that's what the political
[19:43.760 --> 19:47.400]  parties are doing the only reason Texas is doing okay compared all the other
[19:47.400 --> 19:51.400]  states is we never allowed a bunch of that mafia crap to go on here we're
[19:51.400 --> 19:55.920]  falling as well it's all happening now here it is so sad to see our country fall
[19:55.920 --> 20:00.160]  we'll give you the latest on Isis Ferguson and more coming up gold isn't for
[20:00.160 --> 20:04.000]  you Ted Anderson president of Midas Resources one of the world's premier gold
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.840]  and precious metal investing firms I get it you wouldn't buy gold if you

[24:21.320 --> 24:39.040]  you go back about 15 years ago on the subject I was just covering before the
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.440]  break how a gen 21 is regulation to shut down all competition that the
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.680]  globalist then exempt themselves from you'll notice most water systems in
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.480]  Canada and the US are now owned by European companies and they'll come
[24:54.480 --> 24:57.760]  into small towns you name it and say you can't even have so many parts per
[24:57.760 --> 25:02.600]  million of arsenic in your water well basically any water in the world is
[25:02.600 --> 25:09.120]  gonna have tiny trace amounts of arsenic in it they don't care if there's fluoride
[25:09.120 --> 25:16.320]  hundreds of other deadly things are even adding what they call fluoride they
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.120]  don't care about that they only got that regulation passed with the lawyers so
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.040]  they can make towns and cities upgrade in some cases billions of dollars to put
[25:26.040 --> 25:31.600]  in new expensive systems that with all the filtration and the rest of it ends
[25:31.600 --> 25:37.680]  up adding more toxins back in but then you get a waiver and it's okay and then
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.200]  they give you this toxic toilet to tap crud that fish would die in if they were
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.880]  put in it but you put fish in clean aquifer water they would live oh but
[25:49.880 --> 25:54.600]  you can't have aquifer water we've got to add fluoride and chlorine to it and
[25:54.600 --> 25:57.640]  we've got to put it through all these expensive filtration systems so these
[25:57.640 --> 26:04.120]  Dutch and and and British and and German and French companies can literally
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.520]  rake us over the coals because they understand how business is done in an
[26:07.520 --> 26:11.240]  oligopoly in a monopoly they just come over get the laws passed by the
[26:11.240 --> 26:16.760]  legislatures get their specific patented filtration systems approved and then
[26:16.760 --> 26:28.160]  you've got to buy it see how that works and if the locals won't sign on to it
[26:28.160 --> 26:37.240]  well you just send in the EPA oh you've got a range rover that's 20 years old
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.600]  we're gonna send a SWAT team of six people to your house from Homeland
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.640]  Security to bust down your door oh you're at a SWAT meet selling fake Dallas
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.680]  cowboy hats we're gonna send a SWAT team from Homeland Security see it's all
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.760]  about these all our borders can be wide open mainstream news is reporting that
[26:55.760 --> 27:03.320]  ISIS is working with the drug cartels on the Texas border that's come out of the
[27:03.320 --> 27:08.360]  CIA we're gonna get into that report but none of that's a threat you could have
[27:08.360 --> 27:13.000]  GMO that sterilizes the rodents that eat it you can have glyphosate in almost
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.640]  every water supply that literally destroys your kidneys feminizes men and
[27:16.640 --> 27:25.080]  gives women breast cancer on record estrogen based tumors all of that is
[27:25.080 --> 27:38.080]  okay but if you've got one part per million of arsenic in your water well
[27:38.080 --> 27:47.520]  then you can't drink it even though that's a low-level naturally in any
[27:47.520 --> 27:54.840]  water supply on the earth whether it's the ocean or Lake Superior just like the
[27:54.840 --> 28:02.040]  EPA and the FDA and the rest of them are passing thousands of pages of new
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.720]  regulation every year even if Congress won't sign on to it what do they do they
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.720]  just say oh well it's our policy to shut down our power plants nothing comes out
[28:10.720 --> 28:15.200]  of a fifth generation they're going into sixth generation now cold-powered
[28:15.200 --> 28:21.520]  plant nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide that plants live off of then
[28:21.520 --> 28:27.520]  they put off oxygen the life cycle nothing nothing comes out zero with
[28:27.520 --> 28:31.160]  federal sensors on the top of the smokestacks because they're not smokestacks
[28:31.160 --> 28:35.920]  they're steam stacks and the media will point cameras at those and say look at
[28:35.920 --> 28:41.160]  our polluted world look at all the smoke look at the smog
[28:42.600 --> 28:46.400]  meanwhile Mexico has no controls and builds power plants right across the
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.080]  border and oh our government's happy to have the power from Mexico come in or to
[28:50.080 --> 28:54.680]  have our jobs sent to India or China with no controls where black smoke and soot
[28:54.680 --> 29:00.040]  comes out of these totally dirty and rains down on the whole world that's
[29:00.040 --> 29:04.640]  okay see would you rather have the coal burned here to have clean jobs and clean
[29:04.640 --> 29:11.360]  industry or burned in China dirty we'll see Al Gore and the Rockefellers and the
[29:11.360 --> 29:14.520]  Rothschilds and the globalists and the Dutch royalty and the British royalty
[29:14.520 --> 29:17.960]  look at who owns it they all own the major industries in China with the
[29:17.960 --> 29:23.600]  Communist Party they put in power in 1949 and they want it there so incredibly
[29:23.600 --> 29:28.680]  cheap nobody can compete and then they act like they're the ones behind the
[29:28.680 --> 29:32.200]  environmental movement in this country that they allowed to grow and then took
[29:32.200 --> 29:36.240]  over and uses a tool of oppression I didn't mean to go off on that jag about
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.000]  regulations and how they operate and how they work I don't I want people to
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.600]  understand what this is really all about when we come back I promise we're
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.240]  gonna get into huge news on Ferguson and now have contractors on the ground ISIS

[32:11.440 --> 32:15.320]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans
[32:15.320 --> 32:19.680]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there
[32:19.680 --> 32:23.920]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[32:23.920 --> 32:27.720]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the

[32:31.080 --> 32:34.800]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[33:55.680 --> 33:59.080]  pretty heavy words
[34:14.440 --> 34:20.720]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central we're here let's get into the
[34:20.720 --> 34:25.920]  news and then we're gonna get our reporters on for a breakdown on the
[34:25.920 --> 34:33.480]  incredible developments in Ferguson some very good developments also some bad
[34:33.480 --> 34:40.360]  developments but here are the headlines UK police merely watching James Foley
[34:40.360 --> 34:46.280]  beheading video may be an act of terrorism that's right the head of the
[34:46.280 --> 34:51.720]  7-7 bombings was British MI-6 intelligence my film Terror Storm breaks
[34:51.720 --> 35:00.800]  that down our government the British government has openly funded Al Qaeda in
[35:00.800 --> 35:08.840]  Iraq renaming them ISIS and then IS and now they think we're so dumb they're
[35:08.840 --> 35:14.920]  saying we have to topple Assad because that's where ISIS has a base in Syria
[35:14.920 --> 35:22.000]  that's how stupid remember Kerry said last year we must hit Syria they have
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.280]  chemical weapons they will attack us we have the proof turned out it was a
[35:26.280 --> 35:31.480]  false flag launched by Al Qaeda ISIS out of Saudi Arabia working with Turkey
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.720]  that's been in the BBC that's been admitted and no one got in trouble that
[35:36.720 --> 35:46.160]  that's the incredible part about this now used to give a president got caught
[35:46.160 --> 35:49.800]  using the IRS to go after innocent people for political purposes they had to
[35:49.800 --> 35:54.160]  step down like Richard Nixon now it's like MSNBC says of course we're coming
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.480]  after the Tea Party you're racist scum of course the IRS is gonna arrest you
[35:59.480 --> 36:07.080]  I'm Rachel Maddow flaming authoritarians these are not liberals these are scary people
[36:07.080 --> 36:12.560]  that's why when they indicted Rick Perry he's facing 99 years the Texas
[36:12.560 --> 36:16.440]  governor we have a great report it was out two days ago I might play that
[36:16.440 --> 36:19.560]  today it's so powerful that John Bowen went down and got the whole press conference
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.920]  not just snippets and I've been a big critic of Rick Perry but Rick Perry
[36:24.920 --> 36:29.640]  compared to Obama that that is a lesser or two evils sure he worked for Al Gore
[36:29.640 --> 36:35.240]  sure he was a Democrat sure he's a politician sure I know who Rick Perry
[36:35.240 --> 36:42.680]  really is but I know the state law I know what he did I knew what all the
[36:42.680 --> 36:45.960]  lawyers would come out even Axelrod the former chief of staff of the White
[36:45.960 --> 36:54.640]  House Obama's mentor said this is shady and wrong it is a fraud folks if you can
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.600]  arrest a governor for threatening to veto state funding through a state
[36:59.600 --> 37:08.080]  program that's what a governor is supposed to do it's the office of the
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.800]  governor the office of Texas the legitimacy of separation of powers
[37:12.800 --> 37:16.040]  that's what I said day one that's what Rick Perry said because that's the truth
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.920]  see they're not attacking Rick Perry now folks they're attacking everybody if
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.160]  they could put him in jail for 99 years for following the law everybody's in
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.720]  trouble that in Rick Perry folks that's Matt Drudge that's Alex Jones that's
[37:31.720 --> 37:37.640]  Joseph Farrah that's the free press that state government up there now people
[37:37.640 --> 37:40.520]  are like yeah but they're a bunch of politicians don't you want to see him go
[37:40.520 --> 37:47.320]  to jail that's mindless Roman decline that you just celebrate some big guy
[37:47.320 --> 37:55.040]  falling if if if if Rick Perry got indicted if it was found that he took
[37:55.040 --> 37:59.960]  money from Merck to push Gardasil on people throw him in jail and I but to
[37:59.960 --> 38:04.200]  see they'll never send somebody to jail because then they'd all go to jail for
[38:04.200 --> 38:15.160]  all the real stuff they're doing think about all the stuff Obama's done I've
[38:15.160 --> 38:19.120]  even gone off on that there is so much news is like I can't even cover it it's
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.640]  just it's just overwhelming do you know how many hundreds of Republicans and
[38:23.640 --> 38:29.120]  libertarians they've been arresting for trumped up crap if you're in a
[38:29.120 --> 38:32.440]  Democratic controlled area it's the Democrats that are doing it and you
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.320]  bounce one check when you haven't bounced a check in 20 years I saw a case of
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.760]  this they're watching it in live time and the banks report it through data
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.680]  systems now and the cops come and arrest you if you have overdue library books
[38:46.680 --> 38:52.440]  and you're a conservative tea partier they'll come arrest you that's called
[38:52.440 --> 38:58.480]  Nazi Germany folks that's when they come in and take you before some weird
[38:58.480 --> 39:03.760]  Democrat jury that's why all these professors are on TV saying if you're
[39:03.760 --> 39:06.760]  in the tea party don't come in my class I'll kill you I'll put you in a body
[39:06.760 --> 39:10.240]  bag that's why they're on the news going Alex Jones is behind the boss and
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.760]  bombing and deeply racist and he wants to kill police they're demonizing me
[39:14.760 --> 39:21.480]  ahead of setting me up that's what they do before they set you up Rick Perry
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.480]  actually put some troops on the border and actually ordered the state police
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.480]  to arrest people that are felons and and to hold them and to make this the
[39:30.480 --> 39:34.720]  feds deport them and so they're coming after Rick Perry folks because Rick Perry
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.680]  smelled the wind picked up the scent of the tide of fortune and he knows the
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.000]  tea party could take the country over and so he has actually been moving in a
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.440]  libertarian direction for real for the first time in his life not just a bunch
[39:49.440 --> 39:53.880]  of talk he sees Ted Cruz and Rand Paul at the head of the pack with integrity
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.560]  not being politicians and so he's getting in line and they're scared of
[39:58.560 --> 40:04.600]  him now because the words from hollow the Republicans was last round they
[40:04.600 --> 40:11.680]  thought he was the only one that could beat Obama but he had spinal surgery was
[40:11.680 --> 40:19.320]  on drugs and that's why it was acting weird legal drugs prescription drugs for
[40:19.320 --> 40:23.640]  spinal pain so he could have surgery on his spine and a day later be on the
[40:23.640 --> 40:29.680]  campaign trail boy whoever had that it was an idiot ever had spinal problem
[40:29.680 --> 40:32.680]  just a little or you can get out of bed you're in screaming pain Rick Perry got
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.080]  hopped up on oxy cotton or something like it's the word he said serious
[40:37.080 --> 40:41.560]  medication member and went out didn't know who he was and so that's the only
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.120]  reason Rick Perry didn't give Obama a run for his money they want to destroy
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.280]  him folks and it's not that I think he's some great hope against the Democrats
[40:50.280 --> 40:55.080]  it's that if they can start arresting front runners in a political campaign do
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.520]  you think we're just about done as a country stick a fork in us I'm gonna say
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.160]  it again if they arrested Michael Moore for putting a film out against Bush I
[41:05.160 --> 41:09.520]  would come to his aid and say it is terrible and we're all in danger but
[41:09.520 --> 41:15.480]  nobody arrested out Michael Moore they arrested Dexter Susan and they're
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.440]  coming after anyone who doesn't want to destroy this country even if you're a
[41:20.440 --> 41:23.920]  boss hog politician that just wants business as usual but doesn't want to
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.160]  bring down the country even if you're corrupt but but don't want to sink the
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.800]  nation they're coming after you folks because Eric Holder and the globalist
[41:32.800 --> 41:37.800]  hate this country they want to bring it down do you understand that they don't
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.120]  like prosperity they don't like wealth they don't like success they have a
[41:42.120 --> 41:46.600]  vendetta and it's called a gen of 21 we're gonna go to our reporters in
[41:46.600 --> 41:53.640]  Ferguson ISIS abducts more Westerners promises beheadings propaganda theater
[41:53.640 --> 41:59.280]  ahead of us invasion of Syria and they're on the news saying we told you John
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.840]  Kerry we told you we had to go into Syria or ISIS Al Qaeda would get a
[42:04.840 --> 42:12.760]  foothold you didn't listen now we excuse me we have to bomb for ISIS to take
[42:12.760 --> 42:20.360]  over or ISIS will take over and they were planting this a year ago you watch
[42:20.360 --> 42:23.840]  these radical Muslims are gonna cause trouble in the region if we don't go in
[42:23.840 --> 42:30.840]  and take out a sod and them after giving them the weapons talk about Machiavelli
[42:30.840 --> 42:36.080]  I'm John Kerry yes we've got to take all your rights away or Al Qaeda will
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.080]  hit you in America yeah Al Qaeda you armed it Benghazi I mean it's so
[42:40.080 --> 42:47.640]  incredible how criminal these people are and so yeah if you've seen me throw
[42:47.640 --> 42:50.880]  myself behind the tea party in the last year it's because the whole system came
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.240]  out against them the Republican leadership came out against them all the
[42:54.240 --> 42:57.560]  big think tanks came out against them all the foreign money came out against
[42:57.560 --> 43:01.880]  them because they know it's one of the only hubs for this country to peacefully
[43:01.880 --> 43:07.520]  beat the system they know Liberty's popular they know if it gets sold to
[43:07.520 --> 43:13.800]  Hispanics and blacks it's game game over they know if people rediscover
[43:13.800 --> 43:19.640]  Americana and wealth and prosperity and freedom and justice it's all over for
[43:19.640 --> 43:23.880]  the new world order and so they're all hands on deck trying to shut down the
[43:23.880 --> 43:29.280]  tea party right now they already tried to take it over that didn't work now
[43:29.280 --> 43:34.080]  they're trying to gut it and not because it's perfect but because it's real it
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.840]  knows about the Federal Reserve it's pro family it's pro gun it's pro life it's
[43:38.840 --> 43:45.160]  pro sovereignty it's anti welfare state it's anti corporate welfare it's anti
[43:45.160 --> 43:54.840]  banker bailout it's anti monopoly it's pro American industry pro farmer pro
[43:54.840 --> 44:02.200]  man pro woman pro child and they're on TV saying two plus two equals five they're
[44:02.200 --> 44:05.800]  on TV senior kids belong to the state then you didn't build your business now
[44:05.800 --> 44:10.360]  do you think radicals like this are scared of the tea party they call us the
[44:10.360 --> 44:14.680]  counter revolutionaries in their meetings they are the revolutionaries and
[44:14.680 --> 44:20.360]  they know it and they're not going to give up ladies and gentlemen without a
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.200]  fight now if you were them what would you do you'd provocateur race war you'd
[44:25.200 --> 44:28.840]  open the borders up you'd shut down the industry to bankrupt people on to the
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.240]  dole so that you had enough people on the system so you could get them to vote
[44:33.240 --> 44:37.000]  to enslave the others with homeland security lined up to crush the tea
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.000]  party and they don't play ball by staging a false flag to then demonize the tea
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.720]  party and arrest this leadership that's now in the army training manuals and
[44:45.720 --> 44:48.960]  they're training you take on the gun owners and demonizing the founding
[44:48.960 --> 44:53.880]  fathers to the army general enlisted now that's why the military woke up so
[44:53.880 --> 44:59.160]  much the last few years and swole the ranks of our listers we went from very
[44:59.160 --> 45:04.000]  popular with the military to the most popular I mean for real because they
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.880]  know what they're hearing here is real because they're getting the training and
[45:06.880 --> 45:12.520]  they're going George Washington's bad gun owners rural people I'm training to
[45:12.520 --> 45:22.960]  take on the Christians we now have video of National Guard and of private
[45:22.960 --> 45:30.800]  contractors in uniform in Ferguson you just heard me right ladies and gentlemen
[45:30.800 --> 45:34.560]  you just heard me right big-time
[45:35.560 --> 45:42.320]  headlines up on info wars calm the company officially put out the statement
[45:42.320 --> 45:51.680]  asymmetric solutions we've been to Baghdad Kabul KL Manila Peshwar and
[45:51.680 --> 45:58.560]  Bogota never guess we deploy to high-threat team in our own city to
[45:58.560 --> 46:03.720]  clarify we are not protecting state law enforcement or those exercising the
[46:03.720 --> 46:10.400]  right to assemble escort detail augment for individual that's the attorney
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.320]  general we are saddened that such service is needed and what is normally a
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.360]  peaceful harmonious metropolitan area full of good people so basically have a
[46:20.360 --> 46:25.800]  blackwater type company safe tour job complete on direct observation seems
[46:25.800 --> 46:32.600]  media has made protesters out to be more bloodthirsty than they are oh why
[46:32.600 --> 46:35.480]  because you were there for a few hours with the attorney general how about our
[46:35.480 --> 46:40.840]  people there for two weeks and this is how it creeps in oh they'll never be
[46:40.840 --> 46:44.720]  blackwater on the streets oh that's a conspiracy theory oh you didn't see
[46:44.720 --> 46:49.640]  somebody in a blackwater shirt doing a marijuana raid in LA yes we did we have
[46:49.640 --> 46:55.560]  video of it and now joining us is former staff sergeant Joe Biggs the other
[46:55.560 --> 46:59.640]  big news out of Ferguson is the policeman who named a gun at him and
[46:59.640 --> 47:03.480]  others and said I will kill you three times on tape has been suspended
[47:03.480 --> 47:08.080]  Reuters went with a headline policemen suspended for pointing a rifle and a
[47:08.080 --> 47:13.760]  peaceful protestor in Missouri no that's spinning it down he was suspended
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.600]  indefinitely for saying I will kill you I will shoot you I will kill you I will
[47:19.600 --> 47:25.720]  kill you with a bunch of f things thrown in so that is the right thing if the
[47:25.720 --> 47:32.320]  department wouldn't have done that boy we know they're bad with zero provocation
[47:32.320 --> 47:38.720]  some crazy guy running up with his gun sticking in people's chest I mean that
[47:38.720 --> 47:45.400]  is crazy town let's go to Joe Biggs Joe what have you been witnessing I know
[47:45.400 --> 47:49.320]  thunderstorms came through so that cleared people out the same night that
[47:49.320 --> 47:53.080]  the Attorney General was there so this murk groups just says everything's
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.400]  wonderful there I guess you haven't seen people throwing rocks or Moloff
[47:56.400 --> 48:01.800]  cocktails no but the cops haven't been shot at I mean I'm not even mad at this
[48:01.800 --> 48:05.800]  murk group I just don't like them operating inside the country the issue is
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.920]  though what kind of propaganda is that when they were there for one day you
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.840]  know to tell people nothing's going on Joe Biggs St. Louis here we're right
[48:16.840 --> 48:21.160]  outside of Ferguson right now and like you said we've been here two weeks also
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.320]  want to give credit to the the man that was directly the threat was pointed to
[48:26.320 --> 48:29.720]  you know I had the gun pointed at me as well but the man that actually had to
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.480]  happen to was at Revolutionary underscore Z the police out here have been
[48:34.480 --> 48:39.040]  completely and totally out of control and what happened yesterday was a video
[48:39.040 --> 48:43.760]  the video went viral we got footage our own footage put it on our website
[48:43.760 --> 48:47.960]  there's quite a few footage people saw what happened and this man has now been
[48:47.960 --> 48:51.960]  removed that's one bad cop off the road that's one cop that I don't have to worry
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.880]  about shooting me because he's trigger happy the guy was deranged and out of
[48:55.880 --> 48:59.600]  his mind that was the first time since I've been here I felt like I was actually
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.440]  had a good chance of dying you know you know you're doing something good when
[49:04.440 --> 49:07.800]  I've got people who are in the surrounding areas texting me and saying
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.080]  hey they've heard on local radio shows people are making threats towards myself
[49:12.080 --> 49:16.200]  and the info wars as well because we're actually reporting on what's really
[49:16.200 --> 49:19.240]  happening you know you're doing something right when people are at that
[49:19.240 --> 49:24.080]  point where they get so fierce they're willing to make threats what do you know
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.880]  about this mercenary group asymmetrical warfare group that was there
[49:29.880 --> 49:36.160]  protecting the Attorney General asymmetric solutions I know quite a bit
[49:36.160 --> 49:40.400]  about asymmetric warfare groups I'm I'm sure everyone remembers the video that
[49:40.400 --> 49:47.360]  David and I have being arrested by those guys they're a bunch of ex-special
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.720]  forces green beret Navy SEAL types you know the fact that they're coming down
[49:52.720 --> 49:58.600]  here for that it's funny how the the mainstream media spins things so where
[49:58.600 --> 50:05.280]  it isn't what it is but then he has this special forces group come in to protect
[50:05.280 --> 50:10.560]  them it's a mind-blowing the links they'll go to to say one thing but then do
[50:10.560 --> 50:16.280]  another why do you think they threw in the statement there that the media is
[50:16.280 --> 50:23.040]  over hyping the protest I don't see that at all you know from what I've seen you
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.520]  know there's a lot of people who don't have a lot of money they come out here
[50:26.520 --> 50:30.240]  they're trying to film and catch little things like what happened with that cop
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.160]  you know there's people I hear with just cell phones filming you know I haven't
[50:35.160 --> 50:41.120]  seen one journalist anybody antagonize provoke any kind of riot or anything
[50:41.120 --> 50:44.680]  since I've been exactly that's the shot up with the police and then these
[50:44.680 --> 50:49.280]  mercenaries and the military is attack the press demonize the first amendment
[50:49.280 --> 50:54.680]  what they do is they infiltrate they have they had a guy that night get led

[56:03.920 --> 56:07.920]  everything they can to put bad halogens into the food and water not the good
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.240]  halogen and even the iodine that the government put in the salt before wasn't
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.320]  even the type that's really powerful but in the old days the government wanted
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.840]  you to have iodine because they weren't totally evil now they put the bad halogen
[56:21.840 --> 56:28.160]  in the water fluoride and take the good halogen the iodine out so for me this has
[56:28.160 --> 56:37.840]  been the basically my personal revolution in my health against this
[56:37.840 --> 56:43.400]  estrogen-based fluoride bad halogen based assault info wars life comm or

[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:06.600]  day he's not a president and it's the arrogance it's just thumbing their
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:12.480]  nose at everybody meanwhile if you're al-qaeda you can walk across the border
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:19.080]  you can be given hate-seeking missiles by the US government but if you're a

[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.760]  beheading or the IS beheading is an act of terror in England but the government
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.360]  literally funding and running them and arresting you have any free speech you
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:51.680]  want in England but you do or the UK you do not criticize Muslims you will be
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.480]  arrested you will be banned you will be thrown out of the country everybody

[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.640]  you know Islam and all the rest of it I've been pointing out that criminal
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.440]  elements have been working with it for a long time to overthrow the West and that
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:13.800]  these people attack moderate Muslims who are the majority in my experience but
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.720]  when ISIS and all these groups are turned loose to kill Christians in mass and
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:23.640]  say they're coming to America to chop my my head off I got to be honest in an
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.440]  instinctive level when a guy's pointing a knife at me and saying I'm coming to
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.600]  kill you Americans I mean I just really want to get put in a ring this guy can
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.160]  have a knife and I can have a knife it as a man I want to kill members of
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.920]  Al Qaeda they are just they kill children women they cut little kids heads off but
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.040]  remember that's the manipulation the globalist are funding them so we get
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.520]  mad at them so then they use our anger to set up a police state that's aimed at

[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:24.720]  ISIS has come out ladies and gentlemen is in the Financial Times of London and
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.840]  they're basically saying they're Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda has been commending them
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:35.040]  all around the world ladies and gentlemen ISIS was founded out of Al Qaeda in
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.280]  Iraq that is on the Defense Department's own website the British Ministry of
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.920]  Defense it's in the newspapers we've been following this for four years this is
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.520]  the group taking over part of Eastern Iraq Western Syria they are the first
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.680]  group to attack Assad four years ago they are 60 plus percent of the main
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.680]  battle force they have been attacking the non radical Muslims if you can call
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.240]  them that that are more secular and want to overthrow Assad because he's a
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.960]  dictator and then Kerry says well we've got to then go back those groups against
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.720]  ISIS because they've taken over part of Syria and Iraq when our government put
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.760]  them in training bases the Israeli government's been protecting them and
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:25.440]  working with them that's in Israeli news they're on their border with areas with
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:31.440]  Syria where Al Qaeda is operating they've been giving Israeli ambulances to the
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.720]  Al Qaeda forces and taking them to hospitals and notice ISIS and IS and
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.400]  all of them have said we're not gonna attack Israel remember that they're
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.280]  going to attack Jordan who actually let them train there they're gonna attack
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.040]  Egypt they're gonna attack African countries they're gonna destabilize
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:55.920]  everywhere and then they pull back and then the West has an excuse just like in
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:01.240]  ivory coast last year the president went public of that country and said the
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.160]  Al Qaeda forces come in and attack the oil refinery then then white men western
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.000]  blonde-haired men commando show up have a fake fight with them and take over the
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.480]  oil rigs and then say they're protecting them and then start basically
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:22.360]  diverting the oil to tankers Al Qaeda works like two peas in a pod with the
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.760]  West it was created in 1979 by was a big presence key who is Obama's main
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.440]  advisor right now it doesn't mean they're not real doesn't mean they wouldn't
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.280]  kill our troops and didn't that's how this full spectrum dominance is you
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.880]  turn these groups loose everywhere they'll have real wars our troops will go
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:47.240]  and fight and die with these people it's only their triple and double agent
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:54.560]  commanders that are higher up that are working with Western intelligence did
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.800]  they bomb their convoys of death when they came in did they take them out when
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.120]  they invaded Iraq a few months ago no they stood down now they blow up a
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.200]  Toyota truck or what looks like artillery and there's never anybody
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.240]  standing around it and guaranteed they're scripting it guaranteed the word
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.960]  goes that here's the grid we want some of your equipment that doesn't work
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.800]  parked here they put the trucks they put the grid you can see it staged never
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:26.440]  anybody running away never a big cache of weapons never one of their bases it's
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.680]  staged just like in 2001 the real Al Qaeda was flown out to safety and then
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.200]  our troops had a real war with the Akhani network and with the Taliban who
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:46.680]  didn't like them being there Al Qaeda starts the wars then that gives the
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.720]  West the pretext to come in and not even put a good government in they want to
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.280]  destabilize collapsed post-industrial society in the Middle East just like the
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.280]  globalists want to shut down our farms our ranches our factories our power
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.840]  plants they tell us parents aren't parents the state is the parents
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:09.400]  everything is about getting you dependent on the system destabilization
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:15.840]  extreme violence lies in the ISIS DNA and then they go on to admit that the
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:30.760]  murder of American journalist James Foley was done by Al Qaeda of course it's
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:36.800]  done by Al Qaeda the black flag with Arabic is the Al Qaeda flag I am so
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:42.680]  sick of it's like it's like if the army had American flags and was running around
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.360]  murdering everybody and was the American army and then people were saying gee I
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:53.200]  wonder about kites involved it is Al Qaeda it's a total brand name IS ISIS all
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:13:01.040]  this is a total brand name to confuse us we're getting big problems Rand Paul and
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.640]  Alex Jones all these people are exposing that we're Al Qaeda's air force
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.640]  we're working with in the military is really upset and they won't fight for
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:12.960]  Al Qaeda what do we do you just change the name that'll confuse them but every
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.080]  time a journalist talks to Al Qaeda they're not getting direct orders that
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.040]  they just can turn loose and armed they go we are Al Qaeda we will blow up the
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.000]  White House we will kill Americans we will cut your heads off your wives and
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.520]  children we're coming to murder you and they have like hearts on TV chewing on
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.720]  them just completely whacked out of their brains I mean you look at videos
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.640]  and photos of these jihadis I've never seen soldiers that look like this or act
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.280]  like this they're completely whacked out of their brains only thing I ever saw
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:46.080]  close to this was some of the state police and local police in Ferguson who
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.120]  looked totally hateful of reporters I don't know what they've told the cops to
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.720]  hate them so much where they just run up and stick guns in their chest and say
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:59.800]  I'll effin kill you I mean it's still not one-tenth as crazy-eyed but it's one
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.080]  thing to have like 50 cops and maybe 10 of them are crazy-eyed that's bad when
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.880]  you watch videos of ISIS and Al Qaeda there'll be hundreds of them and they
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.800]  all just look like they're demon-possessed I mean who chops off two
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:21.320]  year-old's heads and then goes I mean it makes me want to throw up it's like
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.840]  watching Satanism or something when they're chopping people's hearts out it
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.440]  makes me get really angry so everybody's like yeah bomb ISIS they're not
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:35.800]  bombing ISIS they're only bombing them so they paint in the lines paint by the
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.160]  numbers and stay in the area they're supposed to have divide in the country
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:46.040]  in three pieces I'm gonna shut up I really appreciate Dr. Group coming in
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:51.960]  studio with us today there's so much happening in this world and there are
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.120]  so many solutions out there when it comes to our own daily lives watch less
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.560]  television try to eat organic drink more purified water spend time with our
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.040]  families breathe deeply something I've been trying to do I still look like
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.840]  hell but Dr. Group got out of his car this morning same time I did when he
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:12.840]  drove up from South Texas he said man you look a lot better and every time he
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.840]  comes he can see that but everybody sees me on the streets you name it I
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.400]  still you know after 15 years and no exercise and eating like a pig and
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.960]  working eight hours a day I got wrecked it's taken me four or five years to just
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.960]  try to get back to some semblance but I can exercise less work even harder now
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.840]  and with the supplements he developed and that we've developed I have been able
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.440]  to maintain and go to the next level and and just really improve my quality of
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.440]  life with a super mill vitality the survival shield x2 nason iodine the
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.320]  lung cleanse when I can't get rid of a cold with antibiotics I don't know why I
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.600]  took antibiotics this year didn't work bunch of colloidal silver it worked
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:55.360]  infowarslife.com now he's not here to infomercial today but I am going to
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.560]  roll out a new product that he advised us on but that is not a product that
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.520]  we're basically in business on but he called it a bad of the bone super
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.320]  product to quote him earlier giving us his assessment before we got well went
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.800]  live calling it one of the best I formulas he's ever seen because this is
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.360]  something I care about you can keep according to medical literature a lot of
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.080]  bad things happening with a proper nutrition with the eyes that's a fact
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:29.600]  we have a patented very expensive ingredient in here that is known to do a
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.040]  lot of important things to the eye and everybody knows what carrots do for the
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.320]  eye well this is this is this is carrot squared basically and it's occupier
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.680]  we're talking about it later towards the end of the hour open your eyes dietary
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.720]  supplement it's more affordable than something like DNA force that's sold
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.320]  out and is the role it's Royce of just super supplement which will hopefully
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.440]  have in a few months we weren't kidding about it selling out this will probably
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.360]  sell out in a couple of days because it's based on some of the same research
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:06.960]  and principles of DNA force some of the same regenerative principles but at a
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:13.160]  more affordable price it's 2995 for this not 130 like DNA force by DNA force is
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.920]  a $600 formula with leading competitors but ours is even stronger for 130 it's a
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:26.040]  nutraceutical the stuff in it cost us $12,000 from Mitsubishi developed right
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.240]  here in America and it's the only pure true form of we could buy cheaper Chinese
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:35.160]  forms and it's it's patented only one type this this has something that's
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:39.600]  that's a lot less expensive but that is patented as well and I'm taking it and
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.640]  and that's one reason we're gonna skip this network break because I don't want
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.520]  to take any of Dr. Grip's time here but Dr. Group you heard me just ranting
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.120]  about world events I didn't mean to get to you know into Occupower there's now
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:57.200]  available at infowarslife.com infowars.com forward slash eyes to find the
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.440]  subsection of the site where it's been since last week but I didn't want to
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.800]  roll it out and start you know in promoting it here on the air and endorse
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.840]  it until I had you here to break it down with us infowars.com forward slash
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.400]  eyes or you just go to infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com and go to the
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:20.520]  supplement area to find it but let's just since I since I jumped the gun and
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.960]  and prematurely launched here just getting exciting about Occupower this
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.200]  supplement for the eyes that I just sort of taken a few months ago before it was
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.120]  even officially out I know you didn't come here today to really talk about
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.800]  this but since you helped advise us on it but why do you call it a bad to the
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.000]  bone super eye formula or I mean those were your words but break it down for me
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.040]  well you know when you guys came to me and said hey we want an eye formula I
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.840]  was started doing the research and I don't really need to do the research
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.640]  because I have people that call my office every single day that are having
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:57.080]  eye problems macular degeneration cataracts glaucomas I mean we're in a
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.880]  situation now where practically every person over the age of 40 has to have
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.440]  reading glasses I mean look at all the laser surgeries that are out there look
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.400]  at all the glasses my eyes have just started to go always had incredible
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.320]  vision it is so bizarre to have them start to go a little bit and since I've
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.200]  been on this I've seen a difference right now there's a major epidemic going on
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.880]  especially with the over 40 individuals males and females and if you look at the
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.120]  eyes it all boils back down to one thing which is too many toxins like we talk
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.760]  about coming in and not enough coming out I mean works the eyes especially are
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.440]  exposed to more damaging UV rays right now they're also exposed to all the
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.520]  chemicals and everything in the chemtrails all the chemicals leaking out
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.640]  of your pillow and everything else and what's happening is people aren't
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.840]  cleaning their bloodstream enough their arteries are becoming clogged and the
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.920]  small tiny tiny tiny little veins in the eyes and the arteries in the eyes are
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.360]  becoming clogged a little bit and not providing the amount of oxygen and the
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.280]  nutrients that the eyes need to continue seeing really good like lutein and
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:04.520]  vitamin E and astaxanthin and some of the other compounds that we have in the
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:13.120]  ocular power and so because of the fact that I've had so many requests for it
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.480]  and actually my aunt has been suffering for a long time and from problems with
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.200]  her eyes as pertain each your eyes as pertain I mean you know it's a
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.720]  combination of all kinds of things and especially to looking at computer screens
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.840]  all day long I mean I know people in their 20s and 30s right now that are
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.800]  having eye problems and they're seeing bad because I've seen the studies
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.400]  admitting that especially the new screens are frying our eyes what's
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.960]  happening there Wi-Fi electromagnetic frequencies being next to eyes are very
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.600]  sensitive you know you have your rods and your cones in there and we talked
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:48.240]  about that before on how sensitive the rods and the cones are because the
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.560]  pineal gland also has rods and cones and when you put in fluoride and chlorine
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.080]  and bromine and the other halogens which the iodine helps remove you also get
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.840]  calcification in the two areas the pineal gland and the eyes the right
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.720]  rods and cones of the eyes so those also need to be detoxified when you guys
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.940]  came and said hey we want to do an eye formula and I was basically like well
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.160]  let me help you out you know right now I'm busy with all the other stuff but
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.680]  let's put together a formula that I would take on a regular basis and that I
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.160]  would feel comfortable sending people over here to buy for their eyes then I
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.400]  started looking at the different you know substances and found out that they're
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:28.320]  really again is not some company out there that has all of these ingredients
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:35.160]  in one high-tech formula the reason infowarslife.com is so popular is that
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:41.320]  we with your help and others we really do go out and try to make the best formula
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.960]  the strongest formulas at the best price it's so bizarre how many supplements
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.680]  now that I'm really getting into this where the companies are just cheap they
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.800]  don't want to spend 50 something dollars on the ingredients into a bottle they
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.120]  want to spend two dollars and tell you it's really expensive I mean I mean they
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.360]  don't want to really give you all the stuff that's known as good for the eye
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:07.160]  it's all marketing bull I can't believe it it's absolutely out of control I mean
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.440]  you know there are some good companies out there they're very very few good
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.120]  companies out there that actually go through the quality control and the
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:20.440]  testing of the raw materials and look I mean just for let's say DNA force I mean
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.960]  Astragalus in there I mean there's a hundred different suppliers you can get it from
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:30.040]  China for as low as $16 a kilogram but yes it's probably high in arsenic lead
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.400]  cadmium all of the toxic chemicals mercury or you can get a clean US source
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.960]  you know for maybe $30 a kilogram there's a big difference when you're
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:44.160]  sourcing out raw materials but still we do it have to pay for the expensive
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.960]  testing and still sometimes it we find it's not in the California standard
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.040]  that's basically impossible that they did on purpose to shut down supplements it
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.960]  can cost us up to $5,000 just to test each individual batch that comes off the
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:00.440]  line before now so here's what we're saying nobody's perfect but we are
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.760]  neurotic to try to give you the absolute over-the-top best but in this
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.320]  contaminated world it's not even I mean it's just it's it's it's that insane I've
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.080]  been talking to growers I was just in California for 20 days and tour to some
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.520]  of the organic farms and went up into the forest and talked to some people the
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.320]  park services up there they have no clue about Fukushima and what's happening
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.680]  the herbalists and the medicinal people they do because the food shortages up
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.760]  there are going crazy the drought is devastating things I was in the redwood
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.400]  forest and a hundred feet from me a tree that was you know as big as a car just
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.240]  fell over and the guys were telling me yes because of the radiation coming over
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.440]  and because of the drought and because of everything else affecting the land out
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:48.320]  here it's like microwave energy it's rotting the trees from the inside out
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:52.160]  and they're just falling over and I was talking to an herbalist and she said we
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.280]  can't even go in the forest anymore and and and Wildcraft a lot of these herbs
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.520]  because they're all dying back and there's not anything available so people
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:05.640]  don't understand the well you listen to thousands of smoke stacks of the totally
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:10.080]  dirty coal plants in China the jet stream all range down over the U.S.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.560]  exactly I mean just it's just well I mean we've shown the news reports for all
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.960]  over the country just aluminum dioxide in the soil is just is just killing the
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:25.320]  plants I mean this is this causing the soil to become extremely acidic and all
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.760]  this getting sucked up into the into the trees I mean that the land is
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.800]  unhealthy the earth is unhealthy the waters are contaminated the air is
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:39.680]  contaminated that's the reason why you know the only solution to this which I
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.360]  always like to talk about solutions is becoming educated and knowing what you
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.200]  need to do and what to protect yourself and protect your family especially like
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.720]  stuff with Ebola and all these new things there's always a lot of diversions
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.920]  like what you were saying there's a fight going on politically around the
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.960]  world there's a fight going on with health care around the world there's a
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:02.400]  fight going on with you know nuclear stuff around the world there's all these
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.320]  different fights going on with pandemics and and all this stuff coming
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:10.160]  together which is just the earth is version the earth is reaching its
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.480]  carrying capacity and and you'll hear that from the eugenicist but there is a
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.880]  carrying capacity with the level of technology we've got now then the
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.720]  globalists are working to destabilize things in their own words to bring in
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.440]  the global crisis so that we will then accept all their demands this is a
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:30.720]  perfect storm of evil because it's easier for them to ride and direct the
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.640]  crises both created ones but ones that are naturally there to get more power
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:40.160]  than to try to fix it it's hard to fix things instead they've just decided to
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.720]  make it as bad as they can burn down the world and then they will inherit it
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.840]  because they're posing as the saver do you see what I'm saying I see what
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.600]  you're saying but the good news in that it's not as hard as people think to fix
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.960]  things because you can look at the human body it it takes a beating over 40
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.720]  years it might take you 30 or 40 years with patients coming in destroying
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.480]  their body with bad food and bad air and everything else but the good news is
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.720]  we've been able to turn that around in less than 90 days and we know that
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.320]  delivery generates in 90 days the skin tissue regenerates in 24 hours so you
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.920]  could completely destroy the body for 30 years straight and regenerate it and
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.040]  you know a really good regeneration could happen in your body in 90 days of
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.720]  you just drinking water eliminating all those toxic artificial sweeteners the
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.120]  chemicals all the other stuff that we talk about that's right I've only
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.760]  eliminated to the earth can clean itself really fast as well so there is a good
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.240]  positive solution if we just look at how we regenerate the plants regenerate the
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.280]  same way the water regenerates we just have to eliminate all the stuff that's
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.200]  actually killing us and poisoning us undoubtedly the government is engaged in
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.120]  geoengineering I've talked to meteorologists on air multiple meteorologists
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:59.840]  that have TV shows on news and they said no clearly there's planes off the coast
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:05.400]  the West Coast spraying to block weather fronts and to knock that Pacific
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:13.960]  moisture down what's the long-term plan of the globalist to turn California into
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.320]  a desert I mean I guess they're gonna run everybody out and make it collapse
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.280]  and then come back in and I guess turn the water back on because even Klamath
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.960]  Falls and other areas where lakes are full of water they'll just dump it in the
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.600]  ocean and redirect it over some suckerfish that isn't even indigenous so
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.920]  the farmers go bankrupt this has been going on for 10 years I mean at every
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.000]  level they are systematically trying to bankrupt us well you got to remember
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.680]  that most of the food's grown in California too so you know when there's a
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.520]  food and food prices are going through the roof right now they're attacking our
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.400]  bread basket they are I mean I've talked to restaurant suppliers I was on the
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.080]  phone with one of the main guys that I'm not gonna say the name of the restaurant
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:56.400]  but it's a higher-end restaurant that's all around the world and he said
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.400]  they're having an extremely hard time right now with beef and pork and all
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.680]  the commodities because they're such an in short supply and they're raising the
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:09.280]  price today steaks are now $50 putting them out of business completely really
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:18.360]  yes yes I mean look at it what you need how many gallons per day for a cow to you
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.960]  know you a cow needs to drink something like 30 gallons of water a day or
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:26.800]  something like that they don't have any you know the droughts the chemicals
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.760]  what are the cows eating right now the grass which is contaminated with
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.280]  aluminum oxides and everything they're being shot up with hormones so they can
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.000]  get ready to butcher in one year instead of three you know all the pigs are
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.040]  contaminated because they're being fed a bunch of GMO food as well as the cows I
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.440]  mean sooner or later it's gonna come to a breaking point and then you're gonna
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.440]  have that all roll over into the restaurants and into the human situation
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.800]  so yeah I mean restaurant the food so we all know that the food supply and
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:05.640]  that's one of the mechanisms of many that is done by design to make you more
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.240]  dependent fear and make you more dependent and make you more sick and
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.040]  then who does the government demonize anybody that tries to get off the grid
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.640]  and be self-sufficient that's who they watch so they want so so what's the plan
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.360]  why do they want is totally dependent as they turn the resources off agenda has
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.840]  to do with agenda 21 I mean you know they want districts they want
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:29.280]  agricultural districts they want capital districts they want all the districts
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.400]  they want control and they want to control the population and they which is
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.200]  also in rollerball yeah they want you dependent upon them yeah everything yeah
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.360]  I mean that's all in Club of Rome when you see rollerball or you see or hunger
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:45.200]  games or read hunger games that's art imitating life we're see folks we're not
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.600]  here saying it's it's you know we're not copying hunger games well this is the
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:53.680]  hunger we're on the March we'll be back stay with tires on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.360]  the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.960]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.520]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.520]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.760]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.600]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.920]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.760]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.280]  that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.880]  began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start

[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.000]  night about to a radio interview and in the old days i just go drink
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.080]  half a bottle of red wine that would kind of wake me up
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:42.080]  because alcohol has a stimulant effect now i don't do that i take three squirts
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:46.240]  of uh it's not even a stimulant i'm not going to tell you what it is yet

[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.200]  structure of something that's very well known and i've taken it before
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.200]  other brands and it's had some effect undoubtedly
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.480]  this should be sold as the ultimate energy drink but we're not going to have
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.680]  it as an energy drink but people are going to want to get this and put it in
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.040]  energy drinks it's actually something that's very very very good for you and
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.000]  you might pay up to $200 for an injection of
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.280]  this at different places around the world don't give it away
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.040]  nobody's put these two ingredients together that's actually
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.800]  what you need it does be it's like having three cups of coffee but it
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.040]  doesn't give you the jitters how many people do you know that are just
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.200]  run down and not having enough energy and not being able to sleep properly and
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.400]  believe it or not what this is i would say
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.720]  probably a good 50 to 75 percent of the people probably even more than that i
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.520]  probably say 90 percent of the people on the planet
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.560]  are deficient in these nutrients that we're putting in this formula it's just
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:54.880]  like iodine you know you can study 100 people and 99 of them are
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.080]  going to be deficient in iodine well that's what the scientists as you know
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.640]  discovered about areas in japan and the mountains
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.320]  and areas in italy and places where you would just have tons of people living
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.000]  to 105 110 and even the unhealthy guys that smoke
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.400]  cigarettes live into 90 and it was because they had volcanic soil
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.840]  that was the right kind of volcanic soil to give them all the essential trace
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.920]  elements and minerals that they needed then the plants were growing in that as
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.160]  well so it was then in a bioavailable form for the
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.120]  body but most people don't live in those
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.480]  areas or they're not getting fruits and vegetables from those areas
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.320]  that's a basic and then you get into the super foods and the super nutrients and
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.560]  things that are in dna force and in the occupier
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.200]  it's just not out there i mean you were talking about
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.080]  in the dna force that you developed for us uh that particular extract you were
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.800]  saying was the equivalent of how many blueberries
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.720]  about uh 500 cases of blueberries would be the equivalent of the
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.640]  pteropurin it's an extract from the blueberries is that per bottle or per
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.880]  pill uh i think it's per serving per so two pills
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.960]  yep two pills or capsules that's pretty powerful i mean it's you know
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.320]  anytime i do anything i always make sure it's the best out there because i
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.200]  i personally don't want there to be a product
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.880]  out there anywhere on the market that's better and when that's right our whole
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.280]  future knowing how we're under scrutiny especially
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.240]  is about being absolutely neurotic but still this world's so crazy you know
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.120]  they can take anything and try to make it something down the road we expect that
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.800]  we expect to be attacked but but but we are literally working around the clock
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.640]  to bring you the best right i mean all of the products that i develop if you
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.160]  look at the reviews which have four five six hundred reviews
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:43.280]  for you online they're all five star four and a half star i mean you know
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.760]  that is unheard of in the nutraceutical industry that's why we've got some of the
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.880]  biggest names calling us wanting to basically merge with us or buy us
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.960]  right i mean it's it's so hard to to do something that's going to be so
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.320]  effective on a broad range of people from 15 year olds up to 100 year olds
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.320]  i mean you know considering the fact that every single person has different
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:08.080]  psychological profiles every single person has different exercise
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.960]  patterns every person has different dietary habits
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.560]  they all have a different environment in which they live i mean
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.160]  we're all different some of us get an hour sun every day some of us
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.400]  get no sun every day some of us eat healthy some of us don't eat healthy so
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.160]  it's hard to be able to develop something because
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.440]  based on the amount of absorption that you're going to have
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.280]  considering your current state of health how clean is your body you could take
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.800]  a nutritional supplement but your body is so out of whack because you're eating
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.200]  gmo food well everybody knows i still work sometimes all night and
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.560]  and and still eat some bad stuff but i've cut back a lot
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:47.360]  literally when i started getting on your supplements and i was already taking
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.080]  some really great ones the engemony products info wars
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.600]  health.com they're awesome as well but yours is
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.560]  i guess you go look at what the key things are
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.480]  that people haven't really recognized that are hiding in plain view
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.800]  i mean take the iodine that's so simple i mean i was really getting into iodine
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.440]  previously because ben fuchs and others had told me to get into it it was helping
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.200]  me but it would give me stomach aches it it it it wasn't
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.040]  most of stuff out there isn't real nascent iodine and you know
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.680]  it turns black or or or red on paper ours is red but it turns electric blue
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.680]  well because it's from the real electric blue
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.120]  crystals there's nothing you know we always look for purity too i mean you
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.120]  know but no one else has the x2 electric blue crystals
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.480]  i mean why was it you that went out and got a deep earth source
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:40.560]  not a sea source so i mean everyone's so damn lazy excuse my excuse me lord
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.800]  for taking that i didn't mean that in vain it's just people are so lazy i want
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.600]  to innovate i want to bring people the most
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.200]  incredible stuff i'm the same way i mean if there's
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.360]  a million well no that's why we work with you but
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.920]  you found the the the the the the crystal source why had no one else done
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.320]  that because the first thing that people do
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.560]  formulators first of all formulators most of the time
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.800]  are just individuals that have a little bit of a nutraceutical experience and
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.240]  this is what they do let's say the the president of the
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.040]  company says we need an i formula we have a registered dietician we have
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.720]  somebody that was trained in the standard
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.800]  modern system of medicine which you can't have that because they're going to
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.680]  look at synthetic vitamins and everything they learn in biochemistry
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.680]  and nutrition courses and what they're going to do and i and this is this is
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.960]  broad spectrum across the board i've talked to many nutritional formulators
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.920]  that supposedly out there are the best they look on they say the the president
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.960]  says we want an i formula so what that person does is looks
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.840]  online and looks at all the different i formulas out there
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.040]  makes a whole ingredient list of what everybody else is using
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.800]  and then takes four or five of those ingredients and mixes them up so their
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.840]  formula is not exactly the same as the other one
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.680]  and then looks at sourcing those raw materials once they start sourcing those
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.240]  raw materials they're going to look at the cheapest one
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.480]  that they can find because it's all about cost i was the first one in the
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.080]  nutraceutical industry to throw cost out the window and that's whenever i
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:17.200]  contact some of these supplies they're like are you crazy what are you doing
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.840]  you're you no one's ever done that you know for dna force people call and say
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.760]  well i can get one of these ingredients online for 20 but i can't find any other
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.200]  supplement that has more than one two of these ingredients together in the same
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.320]  formula well yeah that's why it's so expensive because
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.000]  you put seven or eight of the the world's leading
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.160]  researched ingredients into a formula of course it's going to be expensive
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:45.600]  yeah because it's patented i mean we're buying this stuff from
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.920]  companies that sell the pharmaceutical giants like you said the cost of dna
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.680]  force if you are any other person any other nutraceutical
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.040]  that retail on the market would be going for around
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.880]  three hundred and ninety nine dollars a bottle if you were to do the mark you're
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.600]  saying some you were saying some formulas though or six hundred
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:06.800]  some formulas are six hundred a bottle yes
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.240]  but what i'm saying is you're still you know because
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:14.320]  the whole mission that i have is the same mission that you have to help the
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.080]  earth to give people the solutions they need to take care of their own health
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.400]  to keep their immune system strong to prevent all these things from damaging
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.000]  their body to keep their mind sharp to keep their eyes sharp
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.240]  to keep their body decreased to keep their self healing mechanism
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.560]  working and notice why do we have to buy this from um you know a major japanese
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.200]  company based in america everybody knows the name of just one of the ingredients
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.160]  it's because the japanese elite you can read it in their newspapers are obsessed
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.640]  with this gobbling it because they want to live i mean you know but but but
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.920]  they're gobbling the individual ingredient not putting it all together
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.480]  like we're doing right because that's where a lot of research comes from
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.400]  japan it's like what happens with the pharmaceutical companies they find a
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.640]  plant they take one ingredient out an active ingredient
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:04.080]  and they synthesize it and it ends up destroying the body
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:07.360]  and covering up the scent never working on the root cause of the problem
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.840]  and it makes you even worse there's a synergistic relationship with herbs
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.280]  and with compounds each individual herb might have 20 different compounds in
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:20.400]  there why do you think those 20 compounds are there
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.080]  because they have to work together in unison if you take 10 of them out
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:32.640]  then you you might be in most cases reducing the ability of that
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:36.960]  herb to work now with dna force and some of the stuff that we do
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.440]  we use the full spectrum herbs or we use individual ingredients combined with
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:45.440]  other individual ingredients that are going to enhance the effect
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.360]  of the of those other ingredients so these all work together
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:52.400]  we're not going to put something in there that's going to block the action of
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.360]  this or alter the action of this absolutely so so
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:59.440]  hockey force is a Rolls Royce quality product an extremely affordable price
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.720]  $29.95 it will sell out the next few days
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:06.080]  and i appreciate all your support out there m4slife.com
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:10.240]  then we'll do our best in phase two to get enough of the products
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.520]  with the profit that comes in to be able to really stock up on it and to be able
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.320]  to not have shortages of it like we had in the first few rounds with x2
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.680]  any other products something we've been through here as we try to capitalize
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.600]  m4s to the next level to get the reporters to get the riders to do
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.080]  everything we do we are doing this free market style not with taxpayer money
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.200]  this is literally this whole operation is one seed planted

[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.280]  we've now built up to this major launch level against the globalist
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.080]  and you know we expect all sorts of attacks and we've been dealing with
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.440]  those as well but that's part of this war
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.480]  and and and we're learning as we go that's want to thank all of you for your
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.360]  support m4slife.com
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.960]  occupower a dietary supplement for the eyes
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.920]  available at m4slife.com now let's hurry here doctor group
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:04.560]  and get through these points here and go over
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.720]  these issues we haven't gotten to Ebola they're now declaring martial law in
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.280]  multiple countries we find my Ebola stack they've got riot police
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:18.480]  on the streets in areas of Africa trying to contain it this is
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.720]  definitely the biggest Ebola outbreak ever but i've seen the reports that
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:25.520]  just having proper hydration and things in
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.000]  us hospitals cuts it from a 90 plus percent death rate down to 50
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.760]  what are some of the things not just for Ebola but flesh eating bacteria
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.960]  MRSA all these threats emerging out of modern medical
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.120]  medicine it's helping mutate these viruses and bacteria in
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:45.040]  many cases what are some of the basic things on Ebola epidemic
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.280]  most of these organisms as you know are
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.040]  bio weapons that are created and from the sources that i've
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:56.400]  talked to because my phones have been ringing off the hook to what do we do
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.120]  about this so many people in the u.s because of the fear
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.160]  mongering thing or worried about it transferring lives disease did come from
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:05.600]  Plum Island absolutely from bio weapons lab on record
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.320]  these SARS H1 it's tick-borne syphilis
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.400]  actually the influenza virus kills more people a year than
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.920]  and is more contagious than the Ebola but from what we know about this Ebola
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.840]  strain it did come from a u.s bio weapons uh well
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.640]  it's not confirmed but this is just what i'm hearing it did come from a u.s
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:28.560]  bio weapons lab and kinema and and what it's uh it's it's altered
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.480]  itself so it's not so rapid you know that the old Ebola that you got you would
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.200]  die very rapidly so now that the viruses have a
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.960]  way of kind of changing themselves giving up a little bit of this and
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.560]  taking a little bit of that this one seems to have a longer incubation
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.840]  period so that in order for that to happen
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.200]  that means it's going to spread more readily and more readily and you've
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.760]  mentioned the study with the pigs and the monkeys with
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.040]  it's airborne Ebola you're going airborne and and air droplets in the
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:58.560]  in the mainstream media saying well you know it's not airborne you need
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.080]  bodies it's making that journey now it's becoming airborne
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.240]  yes and i actually know of a study going on right now
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.600]  in Africa where they're giving colloidal silver in
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.560]  uh two to three mils every single hour and they it's in a location and they're
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.120]  actually having pretty good success with it
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.960]  and i will be coming out with a program here fairly soon which i'll share with
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.640]  you can post on your website but the gist of it is these are the things that
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.680]  are that are going to work the best to protect and to strengthen your immune
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.000]  system and that are very strong antivirals colloidal silver and about a
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.520]  10 part per million solution chaparral works really good as an
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.240]  antiviral oregano oil works really good as an antiviral
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.840]  and a product called mms works really good as an antiviral
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:51.120]  the mms is a miracle mineral supplement and it's
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:55.920]  basically you you take a chlorine it's not it's not chlorine that actually
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:59.120]  harms you but it's converted to chlorine dioxide in your body
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:03.360]  and it's a very strong fast uh antiviral now
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:07.120]  of course you know the gates foundation everything else which is a whole
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.200]  another story is planning on coming out with a vaccine in 2015 just like we
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.640]  talked about a month ago when Ebola was just happening me and you were saying
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.600]  well what's what's the story behind Ebola i said well we're probably going to
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.360]  see a vaccine coming out here sometime shortly so
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:28.080]  you know the big question is what is in the vaccine and what is the what is the
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.720]  long-term effects of this Ebola and
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.760]  whoever receives the vaccines what are they putting in the vaccine and by the
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.000]  way guess who else is involved a bill in the gates
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.280]  monsanto monsanto is is behind we just put that
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.040]  article on screen Ebola outbreak can it be controlled monsanto

[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:20.640]  i love how they allow the the FDA melamine to a certain level a pretty
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:23.120]  high level and that headlines the associated
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:25.440]  press a few years ago with the chinese melamine scare
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.640]  oh don't worry some melamine isn't bad for you
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.680]  and they would allow bisphenol and they would allow
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:35.680]  hundreds of chemicals from the factories that they call fluoride
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.640]  not just fluoride that's what always gets medical doctors and people that were
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.840]  for it to go away now i'm against it for those that don't know it's all over the
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.040]  news in canada europe you name it where they're taking
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:49.120]  the fluoride out in england in most cities because they're going what's the supply
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:52.480]  i know we need calcium fluoride but this is hydrofluorosalistic
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:57.120]  and then it's hundreds of other things it's just toxic waste that we pay to drink
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:05.440]  so they do that but then oh my gosh we've got this prop uh 65 in california
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.400]  explain that to people because then it makes it literally impossible
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:14.160]  for people to basically get almost every supplement there is
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.480]  explain the numbers to folks prop 65 in california
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:26.160]  was a team of attorneys that basically got together and wanted to pass a law
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.360]  restricting the amount of lead in anything really from glassware to
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.880]  lawnmowers to whatever you were going to purchase
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:40.160]  the problem is they they kind of misled the individuals during voting and they
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.160]  basically said you know vote for prop 65 to protect yourself from
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.800]  excess levels of lead or anything like that they set the limits at 0.5
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:54.720]  micrograms per gram of lead which means that after prop 65 got
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.920]  signed in by the government of california then
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:02.160]  every single company that produced anything got sued by these
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.960]  by these ravenous attorneys everywhere that just wanted to take advantage of
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.720]  it and and get as much money as they possibly could out of this
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:15.280]  all the nutraceutical companies all the food you know suppliers got sued
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:19.520]  all the glassware because you know crystal and glass has
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:24.240]  high levels of lead they all got sued ammunition got sued companies i mean you
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.240]  name it and practically every commodity and everything in california has been
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:32.800]  sued since and so basically let me let me take that a
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:37.920]  step back they had to put a warning it basically had to test all their products
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:42.320]  and if your product contained over 0.5 micrograms of lead
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.840]  then you could use one specific warning which basically said that
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:50.320]  this product is known to cause birth defects and reproductive harm
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:54.240]  if a product but over one something percent or you had to say this product
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:57.520]  is known to cause cancer but here's the issue though
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.640]  there's more of it in the air or in an apple
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.160]  than in the cleanest supplements out there so they knew they were setting a
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:07.600]  standard to be able to shut everything down selectively
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.360]  it was all about money it was all about the attorneys making tons of money off
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.960]  it and they have made tons of money off and now whole foods is whole foods has
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:18.960]  been in a lawsuit with them because dietary supplements fall under date
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:22.800]  desha they fall under a food okay
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:29.680]  that prop 65 is not uh shouldn't be pertain to food and so whole foods is in
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:32.800]  a lawsuit but let's explain that that means if something has
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.720]  less than one part per million they're saying it's
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:39.680]  bad hold on stay there we're gonna come right back
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.720]  drgroupsartguestinfallwarch.com we're gonna take your phone calls

[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.800]  i began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.920]  family so much get healthy and detoxify
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.360]  most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:03.920]  around the world iodine is key to so many of the body's functions
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.440]  especially the thyroid i discovered a product being developed by
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.280]  drgroup you now know it as survival shield true
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:15.440]  nascent iodine that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said

[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:23.600]  rare earth deep earth crystals and the results that i personally have had
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.840]  have been life changing nobody else has got iodine
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.600]  based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen this is innovating
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.160]  and the best part is it helps fund info wars.com the radio show the tv show the

[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:10.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:17.600]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:28.880]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:31.600]  all right you hadn't gotten to the zinger yet we'll start going to some
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.680]  phone calls dr ed griggs our guest here
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:40.480]  the california standards are 10 times the federal well the federal
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.520]  standards the fda and the usda all the federal
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.760]  standards when they test for metals or any type of toxins require
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.680]  less than 10 parts per million or
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:54.880]  10 micrograms per gram or something like that
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:01.600]  california is 0.5 not even one microgram the prop 65 so it's more than 10
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.200]  times more than 10 times so anything that you get anywhere
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:09.680]  in the united states it's under 10 parts per million
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.600]  of any type of lead or arsenic or anything like that is generally considered
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.440]  safe but from the science i've read in mainline studies if you didn't have
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:21.360]  any arsenic or any lead you die i mean isn't it true that even though it's
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:25.520]  poisonous in in in moderate levels or even small levels in the super tiny
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:30.000]  trace level is that wrong science in your view
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.680]  that i mean because arsenic is in apples well it's all of those are are
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.480]  naturally occurring i mean they're naturally occurring in soils and
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.280]  plants and everything else it just depends on what plant and what you were
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:45.120]  saying in the air is is is way above in the air you have high
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.880]  mercury content in the air you have high aluminum content in the air in you
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:53.360]  in some parts of california they've stated that it's 55 you breathe in a
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.520]  in the main city you may breathe up to 55
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:05.840]  micrograms of lead per day 55 and pop 65 is 0.5 not even one microgram
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:09.200]  it's ridiculous and the people in california are upset about it yeah
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.400]  because if this if this was put on food which they could do which they use the
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:17.200]  starvis he was saying how many green peas as a well like one green bean would
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.400]  be over pop 65 a lot of foods i mean even organic apples are high in in lead and
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.120]  in some of the companies there any truth from your research that we do need a
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:28.160]  little bit of the bad things you do need a little bit
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:30.960]  everything in moderation you know there's always a point where it becomes
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:34.320]  too much and it depends on what source it is too i mean there's a lot of
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.080]  different aluminum byproducts aluminum oxides just like fluoride i mean it
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.440]  depends on is it naturally occurring in nature the chemical
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.720]  structure of it and how much how much calcium fluoride do we need
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.600]  zero so you think we don't even maybe a little bit maybe a little bit
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:56.400]  but that's a fluoride period is bad
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.880]  in in my nude amounts in parts per million if it's if it's soil based
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:04.720]  or if it's from any type of zeolite or deposit
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:08.160]  or naturally occurring taken up by plants because
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.760]  here's the thing you have minerals in in the soil but the there's something that
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:15.600]  happens with those it can change the electron spin from a positive to a
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:19.360]  negative electron spin usually if it's a positive it's
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.440]  synthetic but if it's a negative charge it all depends on the electrical charge
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:26.960]  of the element as it comes in your body and that's what makes
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.600]  hydrofluorosalistic so deadly is they've they've they've made it super positive
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:36.320]  right yes yes and that's why it's so dangerous bouncing around it's
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:39.760]  that's why it's so dangerous but when you it's it's also you have to look at
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:43.600]  just one compound what happens when you combine that compound with another
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:46.160]  compound that's why if you stuck your hand in it would eat the flesh right off
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:49.200]  your hand it eats through glass it eats through metal i mean it's everything it's
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.920]  like the you know it comes with a skull and
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:54.880]  crossbones on the label i mean it's it's like
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:00.640]  what you said we get we are actually buying the world's most toxic waste
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:04.240]  products from china and they're sitting over there laughing sending all this
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.040]  toxic material that's even been on the news from china
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.480]  and they test it like 300 poisons and it's got exactly it's got
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.960]  arson high levels of arsenic lead mercury all and they make these cities put
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.840]  in these multi-billion-dollar water treatment deals to have no arsenic in
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.760]  them and then this perfect water comes out and they dump chinese toxic waste in
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:26.560]  it and i mean it's just it's cuckoo
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.680]  i've got a newscast i think it was out of oklahoma like six seven years and we
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:33.440]  played it a bunch where they actually like the news director
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.800]  did a tour of the water plant and saw the skull and crossbones and said china
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:40.640]  so he got it and they took it and had it tested and that was over 300
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.320]  and i've got to find that old newscast it was on youtube it's like but that's
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.320]  what real news should do and it was like whoa you mean it's hundreds of chemicals
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.760]  and we're paying to dump it in the water it's like when they tested the tobacco
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:55.040]  in one of the mainstream uh cigarettes and they found 600 and something
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.680]  different chemicals in it yeah you're not really smoking tobacco
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:03.440]  another major health threat this one in teledo ohio where everybody in the

[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:41.200]  governor of missouri has come out
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:45.280]  and said just minutes ago that he's ordering the national guard
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:49.040]  off the streets of furguson a governor nixon orders national guard to
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.080]  withdraw from furguson j nixon ordered the national guard to begin
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:56.560]  withdrawal from the city of furguson on thursday citing continued improvement
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:00.320]  in security there the situation has greatly improved with fewer incidents
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:04.720]  of outside instigators interfering with peaceful protesters
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:08.000]  and fewer acts of violence that nixon said in a statement
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.080]  the governor called the guard on monday and charged them with protecting the
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:16.400]  command center where officials were considering the response to protesters
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:19.520]  that erupted after police shooting of an unarmed team
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.640]  nixon said the guard will work with the state highway patrol
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.240]  and carrying out a systematic process of withdrawing
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:29.360]  yeah because as bad as some of the cops are and i'm not knocking the national
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:34.240]  guard uh if they were veterans i mean big saw me
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:38.160]  said i've never seen people this young i mean they look like younger than
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.880]  privates i've seen i don't know where they got these people but their
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.280]  commanding officer looked like he was about 14
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:47.280]  and i'm not being mean i mean he just it was like kids with guns
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.840]  milling around like not not knowing what they were doing very bizarre
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.680]  just a total mess only a matter of time just somebody hit me with a rock and i
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:58.480]  had a god but you don't want to shoot him and i'm 40 years old and i had to
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:01.760]  control myself a little bit better that's why i won't even go to furguson
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:07.120]  because i've got anger issues uh and uh it's i just can't imagine it's a
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:10.160]  total total mess we had that cop threatened to shoot our reporters
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:14.880]  and others saying i'll effing kill you just for no reason
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:19.680]  and uh that's now national news and the people are calling us anti-cop we're
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:22.880]  not we're not doing anything to police we're not antagonizing and we're being
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.680]  respectful uh we first got there when it was just
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:29.200]  thugs burning things the day after it happened we're supportive of the police
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.640]  why do you think the police what have they been told
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.400]  to be so hateful towards reporters i've never seen anything like this dr group
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.880]  i think it's condition number one i mean starting from a young age with
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:48.480]  you know uh the the police officers i mean not all police
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.360]  officers are bad obviously but the ones that they're getting now i think they're
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:54.480]  molding into what they want to fight against
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.640]  citizens in case they're or when there's going to be
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:02.160]  you know militia on the streets with dirt which there already is in some cases
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.760]  and when there's going to be when they're going to be rallying everybody up in
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:09.280]  case of a bowler or whatever you know martial law or whatever that's it
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:12.640]  they want to control the info and they've been told the press is the enemy
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:16.560]  and you gotta freak everybody out so i don't know what vaccines police
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.200]  officers get but i've talked to military recently and i know they've
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:23.120]  up their vaccine schedules and stuff like that and i know that you look at the
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.560]  mind i mean it's all about the mind you know when you have the anger in the
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.960]  rage what is all that boiled down to it's usually people that have poor diets
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.320]  they're drinking the tap water they've been conditioned to believe a certain
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.760]  way against they're operating on rage and stress
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.600]  exactly like i do you can't focus that way and you're going to have anger
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.280]  issues and you're going to be in that kill state kill kill kill and
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:48.480]  you know that's pretty much what's going on they'll get you
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:52.160]  they'll i couldn't imagine the militia i couldn't imagine pulling people over
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:55.600]  all day and 110 degree heat and dealing with people all day i could never be a
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:59.120]  cop i mean i would just give it thing is they want people like you
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.720]  they want to pee they want the police officers that are going to fire on the
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.680]  american citizens well i would i mean i would blow up
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.160]  and they're getting rid of the ones that won't
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:12.320]  well we yeah i mean i mean i mean i'm good in a crisis dealing with things
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.160]  but it's the long term stuff like something just like
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:20.880]  keeps happening you know that becomes really irritating there is no more the
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.960]  the commercials uh you know that you saw 30 years ago with the police officer
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.720]  walking the lady across the street and helping you carry your groceries to the
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:31.920]  car and everything now now the commercials for you know
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:35.440]  to become a police officer they're showing swat teams in the streets
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:39.440]  you know firing tear gas down the road i mean remember those when we were
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:42.160]  growing up with you know you had the officer friendly
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:46.320]  officer friendly come to your local officer and now if you look on tv for
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.360]  anybody who's running an ad or anything like that for the police department is
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:54.240]  completely opposite it's all anti-civilian anti-support for the
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.760]  for the population and you know we've completely
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:03.440]  swept you know flipped over but it's all part of dumbing people down so you know
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.120]  and throwing it in their face through movies and through media and through
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:10.560]  all the other million things that are out there that are conditioning people to
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:14.640]  say okay just it's going to be okay this is what i'm going to have to expect
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:18.400]  just like outbreak and all the Ebola stuff movies that came out 10 years ago
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.560]  now everybody knows Ebola could kill you the fear mongering everything else i
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:26.160]  mean hunger games all the stuff that they've put in
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:31.360]  you know to our to our brain deep in our brain and they fried our brain with
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:36.000]  all the chemicals and everything else you know they don't want people they
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.560]  want people that are dumbed down they don't want people
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:44.320]  they're easily controllable and to control the population let's go to some
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:47.840]  phone calls here any other points you want to go to calls that we
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:50.240]  haven't gotten to i just want people to know that they
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.120]  can do something about it i mean just listen to the show and
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:56.160]  and really the best way to protect yourself and your family is to keep your
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.520]  body clean and to to make sure that you have
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.520]  a good survival plan you know you need to get out of the city if this is
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.720]  if there's a bowl that comes into your city you need to have a bug out plan
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:09.760]  you need to have some stuff packed you need to have some storeable food
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:13.600]  you need to have enough supplements for your friends and your family or
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:16.720]  wherever you're going to go really look
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:20.080]  we're Alex is telling you this stuff every day
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.000]  reporting on it you need to have some sort of a plan
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.520]  because you're the one that knows you know the answers
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:30.480]  you know and you know how to defend yourself and your family
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:33.280]  where everybody else is just going to sit there and they're not going to know
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:35.760]  what to do and they're going to rely on the government exactly what they want
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:38.560]  to have well exactly god government is digging in
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:41.280]  government's getting ready for martial law worldwide
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:45.200]  government is destabilizing funding radical groups
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.160]  while telling low-level government we're setting up a police state to stabilize
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.360]  things they create the crisis off of the solution
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:57.120]  Hegelian dialectic all i know is government's massing food and weapons
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:01.120]  elites are hardening their homes elites are moving to rural areas
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:04.320]  that's all over the news that i mean every major economist we have on says
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.160]  i've moved to the out because everyone can see the writing on the wall
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.160]  open borders deindustrialization food prices exploding
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.160]  this is just the beginning and i literally now
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:21.680]  i'm just not not even shaken i am bracing internally doctor group
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:25.200]  to know that we've already are hitting the beginnings of it
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.120]  and and we can see the response as they prepare for total martial law
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:32.880]  and use Ferguson as a beta test that we need the liberty movement the patriots
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:38.400]  out there to a be prepared be be out educating people now
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.120]  so that as things get worse as Ron Paul has said
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.960]  folks know this was engineered and blame the collectivist and not the free
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:48.160]  market and capitalism this is the socialist takeover plan
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:51.760]  the communist takeover plan directed by the ultra rich that are exempt
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:55.680]  with you and diplomatic immunity this is their consolidation
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:59.280]  this is it and they're going to let al-qaeda attack us
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:02.880]  guaranteed that's in the news now u.s races for al-qaeda attack
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.680]  while the borders open and people say oh you're saying the government did the
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:10.880]  al-qaeda attack no i'm saying the criminals that run our
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:14.240]  government are allowing them to get ready to attack us
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:18.560]  because then they'll take our rights it's it's so easy to understand how
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:21.520]  they're operating and they admit they're doing this
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:24.880]  this is not my opinion james in colorado thanks for holding
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:28.240]  then we'll go to adam red jay and kelly go ahead james you're on the air with
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:32.160]  dr group uh yeah i just uh i had a question
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.880]  about the x2 nation iodine um my thing is uh is it
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.480]  okay to give the kids or is it should it be diluted
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:44.000]  you know just your professional that's a really good question is a good question
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.480]  i give it to my kids i mean the fact is children are really really really
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:51.680]  deficient because most of the pregnant mothers were severely
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.680]  deficient in iodine so i would definitely dilute it in a
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:59.200]  little bit of water uh or orange juice and whatever it
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.640]  doesn't really matter you know iodine's pretty stable the way it is so just to
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:08.320]  take maybe an ounce of water and put depending on how the how old the child
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:13.360]  is um you know i would probably i mean if it were
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.440]  me i would give my child you know from an early age i mean it's definitely not
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:20.960]  going to hurt i'd be even mixing in with the milk you know that i'm
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:25.280]  you know feeding the child or whatever but uh it is completely safe
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:29.200]  um to use what is the dosage level well that just depends on
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.640]  on how old the child is how does the and he should consult a physician but i
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:35.760]  mean look five years ago they every medical doctor said don't give a
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.040]  pregnant woman vaccines they knew it caused all sorts of
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.200]  problems in utero it caused miscarriages that was on the insert
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.240]  then they said no we're going to double down it's good take more when you're
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:48.160]  pregnant they don't tell them that there's
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.560]  literally hundreds of studies over a hundred years
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.080]  literally going back over a hundred years but dozens just the last few years
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:58.480]  in china the us you name it about all of the birth defects and problems
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.320]  from lack of iodine they know this but their medical doctor
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:05.920]  will not tell you people say yeah you said consult a physician i went to them
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.120]  and they said well yeah i guess you need some iodine
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.200]  but you know maybe get a vitamin that has a little bit of it in there or
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.560]  something or blah blah blah blah blah blah you know get get get
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:17.600]  i mean they just know nothing about nutrition
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:22.240]  it's a lack of iodine that causes that can be linked
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.320]  to a lot of the mental disabilities that children are seeing in school that
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:30.960]  you're seeing in schools i mean low IQs the dumbing down because iodine
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:34.720]  protects against fluoride and chlorine and bromine
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:38.640]  accumulation in the brain and in the thyroid gland and the thyroid gets
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:42.480]  messed up your metabolism get mixed up i mean it can be linked to practically
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:46.800]  every single disease out there from obesity to anything else but
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:50.560]  china had so many birth defects and this has been in the mainstream news
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:54.480]  that they make people supplement with iodine i mean
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:58.240]  they knew what why they had so many towns where the kids were being born with
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.200]  all different sorts of disorders and things i mean they know
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:07.120]  but our government doesn't want us to have it why is that
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:10.400]  it's counter-intuitive to what they're trying to do i mean if you're trying to
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:13.920]  make a population sick and you're trying to increase the funds of the
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:17.440]  pharmaceutical companies and the oil and gas industry and everything else is
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:20.240]  all connected you want to take away the
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:23.760]  health-giving things i mean i've said a bunch of times i'm not the type of person
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:27.360]  that promotes a lot of different supplements because i believe that
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:30.640]  you know if you keep your body clean on the inside that's really all you need
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:34.000]  but i do recommend everybody take iodine i do
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.760]  recommend people take you know things to clean their body like fluoride shield
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:41.360]  and some of the things that actually support cellular function like dna
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:44.480]  force and stuff like that because that's where it all happens
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:48.800]  it happens at a cellular level so iodine would be great for kids what about
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:51.760]  the detoxing though because i kind of felt bad two weeks into it like you
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:54.240]  predicted well whenever you start releasing
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:58.400]  those bromides iodine is also by the way a very very strong
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:02.480]  antiviral and anti you know my money that you can't pay

[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.640]  between each nutraceutical that you take i mean i don't
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:56.480]  like to take a lot of nutraceuticals or all the nutraceuticals at once in
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.880]  clinically i found that you get a way better benefit
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:04.560]  if you spread them out at least by two hours so take one then you can take two
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.880]  out one you know another supplement two hours later i know it's
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:12.320]  it's kind of hard to do it that way but if you want the best results you should
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:15.600]  split up and at least give an hour or two hours i mean i'm doing stuff like
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:18.640]  not eating ice cream a couple times a week at 10 o'clock at night watching a
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:21.280]  movie uh you know on the couch i'll just go have
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:25.360]  a big glass of water and some iodine uh or i'll go over and have some herbal tea
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.640]  or something it's not like uh and i'm some super health nut now but i've lost a
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:32.080]  lot of weight i'm a lot healthier than i was it's a slow process to do it right
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:36.000]  and keep it off though uh but you deal with stuff like
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.520]  you know beyond tany tangerine that's just a bunch of minerals and organic
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:42.400]  vitamins together full spectrum absorbable
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:47.200]  invoarshealth.com that's great and i you know i take it at least once a day
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:51.200]  you know as a snack or something again instead of eating candy or something
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.720]  that's how i've made myself start taking supplements because my whole life i
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:58.000]  didn't do it uh because i was ever in the habit
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.280]  or i would start and get off now i've gotten good about staying on it at least
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:06.880]  partially and i'm and i'm getting better about it and the and the more i take
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.440]  that because i'm not even taking that much right now but but it's a lot
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:15.280]  compared to a couple years ago the better the benefits
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:18.800]  yeah it's just getting your body used to doing things and at the same time what
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:22.400]  you should be doing when you're taking supplements is looking at your
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:26.240]  environment cleaning up your house not buying any more chemicals but
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:29.440]  replacing them with natural and organic solutions instead
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.080]  and avoiding all the things that are actually causing or can cause any type
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:36.880]  of disease or malfunction in your body you know especially the endocrine
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:39.520]  disruptors you know you know getting cell phone
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.680]  protectors i mean the list goes on but taking supplements is one thing because
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:46.400]  you need to clean the inside of your body but you also need to clean your
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:50.000]  outside environment and that means your food what you're
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.080]  drinking and wherever you're living that environment needs to be clean as well

[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:46.480]  plant-based lithium it's actually a plant-based lithium

[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:44.080]  nine eleven truth dot org we're going to salute him here in just a moment and
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:46.480]  get the latest he was on c span a few weeks ago
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:50.400]  had a big effect now that we see that criminal elements of our government are
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:56.000]  openly funding al-qaeda new name i s or isis running around doing all
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.120]  their horrible things we see uh how these radical groups are
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:04.400]  being protected when we say it is an inside job
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.560]  criminal groups in the government were clearly working with Saudi Arabia and
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:12.480]  jihadis to hit us on nine eleven they are getting ready to hit us again and
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:15.600]  take our rights away in the name of protecting us
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:18.960]  the average military person the average cop has nothing to do with it
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:21.840]  but when they do another nine eleven and you got cops saying get back they're
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:24.640]  going to bring down building seven the cops were told get back we're going to
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:28.160]  blow it up i've talked to the cops that are there on cnn
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:31.200]  i have one of them on air he got so many threats he disappeared after that
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.120]  we interviewed the deputy head of emergency management
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:40.880]  he died two weeks later so i mean look listen people say it would come out no
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:46.000]  no it came out they had charges in all three buildings
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.760]  and that's how compartmentalization works once the official story is out
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  no one would dare want to challenge it so the narrative the the
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:58.080]  santa claus is real uh syndrome you know don't tell the kids he hidden
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.280]  now 13 years later can't you see i want to get
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:05.040]  mr gage back up close to nine eleven for a full hour and have
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.400]  building seven clips and the other towers blowing up maybe even get him
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:11.520]  here in studio to really go over all of this because of course i was there
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:14.880]  before nine eleven and on the day saying was an inside job and i said they're
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:17.520]  going to launch a bio attack now on nine eleven on record
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:20.960]  now they launched the anthrax attack i just know how they operate and now
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:23.360]  they're in the news get ready all kind is going to hit us any minute
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:27.920]  oh my gosh well who gave al-qaeda the weapons who let them reform
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:32.240]  and then i don't want fox news with bill riley saying i said nine eleven never
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:34.880]  happened or that space beings did it and all their
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:39.280]  disinfo or that radical muslims don't exist that's not what i'm saying
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:43.200]  they are protecting them and our borders wide open and i'm not going to have my
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.960]  rights taken what a bunch of crazy jihadis come in here and blow
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.760]  stuff up in downtown austin or dallas or san antonio or houston
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.320]  i'm sorry i didn't mean to start raining i got to finish up with two medical
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:57.920]  questions or supplement questions for dr group here then we're going
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:01.360]  to richard gauge of a e nine eleven truth dot org
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:04.240]  but let's go ahead and go to jay in canada you have a question for dr group
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:06.720]  go ahead
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:11.840]  okay that was a good question thank you uh brian in indiana you're on the year
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:14.240]  go ahead
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:17.440]  hey alex how you doing buddy i'm all right go ahead sir question for dr group
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:21.440]  yeah i got two questions for dr group uh first question is you recommend or
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:24.800]  he at least didn't recommend it but you said uh orange juice be okay for your
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:27.120]  iodine and i kind of wonder about that because the first
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:31.040]  pass spec would block some of it or let too much of it through and that might
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:35.840]  cause a liver damage you share about that uh well i always recommend water i
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:39.920]  mean if you know for a kid if that's the only thing that they can take then
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:43.680]  you know definitely it would have to be freshly squeezed orange juice and it
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:46.400]  would be organic because anything that you're going to get from the store is
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:49.040]  going to be contaminated with all kind of chemicals and might actually have
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:52.320]  fluoride in it anyways but what is he talking about iodine with orange juice
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:55.600]  might hurt the liver doesn't the iodine go right into your blood anyways
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:59.120]  well this form of iodine would i think the main concern would be
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:02.400]  the type of orange juice that you're using because it might be contaminated
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:05.920]  with bpa residue and other stuff if it's in a carton and it's probably
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:08.800]  from a concentrate it has all kinds of chemical preserved but again there's
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:13.440]  this whole purist thing we're being hit by the big mega attacks of fluoride
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:19.680]  aluminum dioxide just gmo's you know it water is full of and then we're
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:24.960]  worried about i agree bpa's bad in the plastic linings of these so-called
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:28.640]  paper containers it's just that i don't
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.400]  anyways color line is just take it with water i mean distilled water is going
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:35.440]  to be the best if you if you're going to administer to anybody including
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:38.480]  yourself it should be administered with pure distilled water and remember
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:41.280]  consult your physician or healthcare provider okay we're just giving you what
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:44.400]  he would do and what was your other question he's
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:48.000]  gone i wasn't mad at him i was just getting
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.040]  irritated you know just that like we're worried about
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:54.800]  one part per billion or whatever it is a arsenic in the city water supply while
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:58.320]  there they clean it and then dump poison in it before it's set down to the
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:01.120]  people i mean it's just a joke it's like we're making it
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.000]  against the law to thump someone in the nose but we're gonna
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.680]  hit them 50 times with a hatchet in the head you know it just
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:11.520]  beaverly in texas go ahead you're on the air
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:15.520]  well to preface this my mom and dad died when i was 13 and 14 my mother had
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:19.520]  cancer my father had a heart attack every one of my relatives have died of
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.960]  some kind of horrible disease my sister had fibromyalgia the other one has
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:26.560]  diabetes seven years ago my car practice said you don't
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.440]  have to die of cancer which was like what and so i started eating organic
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:35.440]  started drinking pure water terrorists eight years ago and within a month or
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:38.800]  so it was like a life which went off i could think clearer
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:42.000]  i could see stuff the same stuff that you're talking about right now before
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.920]  i even knew you my husband and i were going man this is like taking the red
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:48.480]  pill we're seeing all kinds of horrible things that our
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:52.480]  government's doing and with the food and all like that so anyway we we've moved
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:56.640]  to the country to the lake we catch our own fish we grow our own food and all
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:00.240]  this stuff and plus we we buy organic at other places
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:04.160]  now i have ordered some of that iodine because i'm really interested in about
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:09.040]  that but i want to know are we doing okay i mean do i need this do we need to
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:12.720]  see supplements because we're we're doing what we're supposed to
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.120]  do you need to take supplements uh it depends on how often you actually
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:20.560]  cleanse the inside of your body and that would mean like intestinal cleansing
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:23.920]  liver and gallbladder cleansing i mean even people that are vegetarians or
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:26.960]  eat all raw they they think they don't have to clean but you got to remember
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:30.800]  you take 30 000 breaths every single day and the air that you're taking in
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:33.600]  there's all kinds of chemicals and stuff like that and that all goes into your
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:37.840]  intestines and you know it's unless you had a greenhouse and you
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:42.160]  control the air and everything that was grown in it with the we live in a
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:46.240]  highly toxic environment and i and i know this i don't live as good as you
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:49.920]  do ma'am all i know is the clarity of thought
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:53.440]  not getting as angry being more focused getting more done
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:57.680]  iodine high quality iodine the herbs and the supermill vitality has just been
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.600]  life changing for me and my friends and family take it and then want more but
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:04.400]  obviously we're funding this whole news operation
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:07.760]  off you know once a month or so having a big you know plug for this
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:12.160]  selling t-shirts things like that i mean i sell a t-shirt that says molon lobby
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.640]  come and take it because i'm defending the second amendment
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:17.840]  and i'm funding the message to defend the second amendment and raise the
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:22.720]  alarm selling shirts that it it's called synergy
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.800]  and and so it's the same thing i promote key
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.160]  organic vitamins and minerals and we're gonna let you go ma'am and then
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:32.960]  and i go to our guests i appreciate your call
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:36.400]  i mean regardless try the iodine try the super female vitality
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.760]  try the occupier and then you know you're supporting
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:45.920]  this radio show i mean you know you're winning there you know that's a win
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:49.680]  and then i know that when you try it
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:52.880]  almost everyone i know of in fact it sounds wrong if i say everyone's loved
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:54.960]  it actually all we've gotten is positive reviews
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:58.320]  which is unprecedented in the quote supplement industry i mean it's just
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:04.640]  unprecedented unprecedented and so i mean we're here
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:09.840]  just bringing you high quality and maybe you're so healthy you don't need it
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:13.520]  so there you go i don't think you know until you've tried it
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:18.080]  i mean is you know pro pure uh is the best gravity fed filter we can find out
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:21.920]  there anywhere uh you know is it absolutely perfect is it cut out a
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:24.720]  hundred percent of everything no it cuts out a hundred percent of a lot of
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:28.880]  stuff reduces things down to non-detectable levels in other areas
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:31.760]  but but it's it's certainly better than the tap water
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.480]  none of this is perfect it's like the sun the sun will damage your skin
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:40.480]  but you'll die without getting sun so it's it's kind of like this is the
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:43.600]  process here uh doctor group any comments that we're
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:46.400]  going to go to our guest no that's exactly what it is it's about
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:50.720]  eliminating your exposure or reducing your exposure to a point
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:54.480]  where your body can deal with things when it does become exposed i mean
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.360]  bottom line that's it that's the root cause of all disease
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:00.720]  is too much stuff coming in and not enough stuff coming out
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:03.920]  and they don't want us having high quality iodine they want us having the
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:07.840]  other bad halogens what does that tell us that tells us that we
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:11.120]  that we need to keep our bodies clean on a regular basis and we need to make
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:14.960]  sure that we combat that in every way shape and form by drinking pure water
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:18.720]  by eating clean food exactly what she's doing congratulations by the way
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:22.800]  i live a very extremely clean life i mean organic everything
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:27.280]  and i still take all this stuff any male is going to be reduced of hormones
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:30.320]  regardless of how clean your body is just just a natural order that you're
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:33.600]  going to reduce your hormones after the age of 28 while medical doctors are on
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:36.000]  record in the studies sperm counts are down
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.760]  genitals are shrinking hormones are lower we've been jacked with
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:43.200]  doesn't matter how much you know it doesn't matter how much you eat
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:47.360]  you cannot get the type of nutrients in foods anymore look all i know is i take
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:50.000]  supermail vitality and it's like i'm 20 again
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.320]  in in the you know what department and i mean come on
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:58.480]  that's i mean this this is stuff's real all i'm saying is that this is changing
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:01.840]  relationships and changing people's lives and that's what it's all about it's
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:04.480]  about feeling the way you did when you were young again
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:07.840]  you know getting your life back getting your confidence back you know looking
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:11.680]  in the mirror and say you know i feel good again i feel
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:14.880]  healthy i feel self-confident i mean right now we have a bunch of people that
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:17.360]  have been off of work for three years you know they're getting
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:20.880]  unemployment they're not doing anything but sitting on the couch getting fat
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:25.440]  getting unhealthy and you know right now it's time to step up to the plate
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:28.240]  especially with all this stuff that's going on yeah for me this has helped

[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.600]  we just got a group on a little bit late because of breaking news today
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:46.000]  richard gauge ae911truth.org a few weeks ago he was on for a whole
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.560]  hour on c-span they got a lot of great reviews a lot of people watched it
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:55.040]  breaking down the impossibilities of the official 911 story
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:00.480]  ae911truth.org for those that don't know
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:03.600]  underwriting laboratories has been forced to admit that the building fell at
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:06.400]  freefall building seven the government's been forced to admit it
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:10.640]  richard gauge and others were able to prove this and gauge has been doing this
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:14.560]  now i guess about eight nine ten years i forget
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:18.160]  and he joins us now to give us the state of 911
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:23.280]  truth from ae911truth.org and all the new stuff we've been discovering
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:27.520]  richard gauge thank you for coming on today thank you alex it's always my
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.280]  honor to be on with you well there's so much to talk about
[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:34.720]  where do we start we've got to start about
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.280]  uh let's start with september this september is the end of 13th anniversary
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:44.480]  of 911 and ae911truth has been added for eight years
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:48.640]  since i woke up after hearing uh david ray griffin on the radio
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.400]  now an author of course of nine books uh ten books
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:59.120]  on the subject of 911 and uh we have uh plans last year we
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:06.160]  had a $500,000 program raised by donors $100
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:11.760]  increments to put billboards around the world in 12 international cities
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:15.520]  including of course new york with our 50 foot tall billboard
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:20.240]  and we are going to be back in new york in a big way because the american people
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:24.640]  deserve to know what really happened to all three of those
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:28.400]  towers on 911 so since the new york times for instance
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:32.640]  has been completely censoring the subject of the
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.960]  scientific evidence for the controlled demolition of the three
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:40.960]  highrises uh we are putting right in their face a 30 foot tall
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:46.880]  billboard uh targeting their chief uh
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:51.200]  what is he the chief editor uh he who he said
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:54.640]  we found no evidence to suggest that anything other than
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:58.320]  planes brought down the tower as well there's all kinds of evidence and we're
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:01.680]  putting it right there in front of his nose in the
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:05.040]  in this billboard uh with the rethink 911
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.200]  campaign it says rethink 911.org the evidence
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:13.040]  might surprise you so once again we're back
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:16.480]  right in front of the faces of not only the new york times but
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.480]  in the backyard of the city hall who arbitrarily
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:26.320]  dismissed 30 000 signatures of their citizens who were demanding that we
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:29.440]  have a ballot initiative called the high rise safety
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:33.200]  initiative that the new york coalition for accountability now
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:38.160]  has raised 100 000 signatures for but we're taking the city to court
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:45.520]  we being the nyc can um to to uh challenge them on this uh
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:51.680]  grievous uh irresponsible act uh defying the will of the new york
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:57.120]  people uh this initiative will require the investigation of any high rise
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:02.240]  that collapses starting with building 7 as you highlighted earlier
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.480]  here's a 47 story skyscraper alex that drops
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:10.720]  into its own footprint on the afternoon of 911
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:14.720]  just like a controlled demolition i mean
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:18.640]  we're talking free fall acceleration in under seven
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:24.320]  seconds this massive building the tallest in most of our state um but of
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:27.920]  course right next to the twin towers of which it was a part of the world trade
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:31.680]  center it uh it may not seem that tall those were
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:36.080]  the tallest buildings in the world at one time but this building
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:41.760]  drops like a rough now it had 40 000 tons of structural steel in it
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:49.120]  and yet uh to drop uh at free fall all 80 columns on at least eighth floors
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:53.200]  in this case would have to have been removed
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:58.960]  virtually at once now fires the official cause of this building collapse
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:03.040]  cannot possibly explain that so we know that
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:07.120]  individually pre-placed explosives thousands of them
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.280]  or incendiaries in this case uh would have to have
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:16.000]  removed that structural support so we have all the evidence
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:22.800]  in our dvd 911 explosive evidence experts speak out people can just google
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:26.960]  experts speak out or go to our website of course as you mentioned it's
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:33.280]  eg 911truth.org where all this evidence is and we have
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:38.080]  put it in a format that activists in new york this
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:42.160]  september and around the country in fact all around the world
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:47.280]  can take to friends relatives co-workers elected
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:50.960]  representative media people in the media
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:54.720]  uh we have a new brochure which is very very exciting
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:50:00.480]  uh 911 truth good for america why is 911 truth good for america
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.240]  i mean you this is the the subject of your radio show
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:09.600]  i mean uh there's a reason that you were a hero to millions of people alex
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.320]  you're you're pointing out the wars of aggression that 911 truth will stop
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:18.720]  because they started most of them it'll restore our economy
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:22.640]  because 911 truth devastated our economy as you know with a
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.360]  4.5 trillion dollar global war on terror that
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:32.320]  owes its roots to 911 it takes its justification from 911
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:35.840]  as and now stay there i want to come back and talk about that
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:41.040]  now al-qaeda in iraq is is armed by our government to attack syria
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:43.520]  now our government supposedly fighting them over there and i've looked at all

[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:30.000]  james foley beheading what they're not telling you a breakdown of how
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.920]  it's meant to launch a new war in syria to quote knock out the group our
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:38.720]  government funded this is so sick again school kids suspended
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:44.800]  and arrested for imagining shooting a dinosaur
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:49.120]  see thought crime isis abducts more westerners promises beheadings
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:54.080]  uk police merely watching james foley beheading video is an act of terrorism
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:57.920]  so the border is wide open but
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:00.640]  we've all got to give our rights because al-qaeda is about to hit us but then
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:05.360]  meanwhile al-qaeda has renamed itself and it's being allowed to operate
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:08.560]  it's the clash of civilization and the elite use that clash
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:13.120]  to take over our lives talking to the founder and head of a e 9 11 truth
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:16.880]  architects and engineers 9 11 truth richard gauge richard
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:21.520]  we can get to the science all day uh i was covering the control demolition
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:27.440]  hours after it happened um we've gone through the physics we've covered it
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:31.360]  a lot of people worldwide a majority believe that it's a fishy story
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:35.040]  a large portion of america spending on the poll on a new investigation
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.000]  this far out from it i think we've already won in the court of public
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.280]  opinion people don't buy anything the government says anymore
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:46.480]  a lot of conservatives that were mad at me for saying it was an inside job
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:50.480]  now looking back see what a fraud the iraq war was
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.400]  see how our government's funding al-qaeda today and was doing it then
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:57.600]  i don't think we know exactly what happened on 9 11 i'm not saying george
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:00.240]  bush had a plunger like wiley coyote blowing up the
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:03.200]  towers i just know nor had stood down i know there's
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:06.320]  bombs in those buildings i know i'm singing in cops said get back they're
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:10.400]  going to blow it up they blew it up i'm not saying those cops get it
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:14.080]  they were told get back and i talked to the cops heard the countdown
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:17.440]  the red cross of all people who usually your cia fronts
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:20.320]  not your low-level red cross but high-level folks looked that up
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:24.080]  they they they were getting the countdown and it was on the news they're
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:28.240]  going to bring seven down i heard it on cbs radio that afternoon so
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:31.520]  for me proving it all i mean i heard them say
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:34.560]  and we have the newscast that they were going to blow up building seven to
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:37.840]  protect other buildings well you can't plant bombs in a couple
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:41.760]  hours so they didn't want that looked at the point is they're lying about what
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:45.200]  really happened richard and they used it to launch all these wars
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:49.760]  and to set up a police state and now they say al-qaeda is about to hit us again
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:54.320]  when our government opened the door for them my right should not be taken
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:59.120]  because this criminal government is allowing al-qaeda to survive and thrive
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:03.600]  what do you get off that basic gestalt statement i just made
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:07.120]  what we need to realize is that if people just
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:12.160]  listen to alex jones and don't do anything about his message
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:18.640]  or the message of a e 911 truth then we'll get what we got for the last 13
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:21.760]  years it's the greatest crime of the century
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:27.760]  so what we're doing this september is to respond to exactly that question we're
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:30.960]  taking action and we're encouraging all of your listeners
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:34.000]  to take action where they can if they can come
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:39.440]  to new york we'll have the premiere of anatomy of a great deception
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:46.320]  which is one man's effort to resolve his own inner conflict upon waking up to
[02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:50.320]  the scientific evidence of 9 11 that's presented by a
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:54.000]  9 11 truth in the case of david hooper this filmmaker
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:59.280]  so at 2 p.m on september 11 we want everybody to come to the premiere
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:02.560]  downtown new york and then on friday we're going to be
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:05.520]  doing street actions in front of the new york time
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:10.320]  to wake people up employees and visitors we're going to also
[02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:14.640]  be in front of the 9 11 museum one of the greatest
[02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:18.960]  second greatest frauds in history to ensconce the official story
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:23.520]  with our alternative guide to the museum what you will not see
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:28.320]  in the museum and then on saturday we'll have a conference at 2 p.m
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:33.520]  on the 13th so we've got to take action uh and that's what got us on c span
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:36.800]  is taking action i want to talk about c span stay there we're
[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:40.320]  back in one minute so important to expose 9 11
[02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:43.200]  because they're getting ready to launch more false flags
[02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:46.560]  like oklahoma city blaming on the liberty movement
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:51.600]  we must break the weapon of the false flag this is scottis john for info wars
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:53.440]  dot com i know that most of you here in this
[02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:57.280]  commercial already know about the new world order eugenics and all the other
[02:58:57.280 --> 02:59:01.280]  issues covered here at info wars the question is do your friends and family
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:05.360]  know if not then i want to know why oh i know it's tough to talk about this with
[02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:09.200]  some people they might call you names or they just want to talk about sports
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:13.760]  are so poppers i say so what there's a battle going on out there right now
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:17.120]  the ammunition is information and the soldiers are you
[02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:21.440]  it's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:24.800]  we from scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the
[02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:28.000]  last thousand years and i'm still fighting if we don't all
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:32.400]  stand up right now we're going to lose everything the info war is worldwide
[02:59:32.400 --> 02:59:36.240]  tell your friends about info wars and let them know that info wars doesn't print
[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:41.120]  bull it's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact step up and
[02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:45.600]  take your friends and family to info wars dot com prison planet dot tv
[02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:50.720]  and planet info wars dot com the truth will set them free
[02:59:50.720 --> 02:59:54.320]  coast to coast direct from austin
[02:59:54.320 --> 03:00:05.760]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:10.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:17.840]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:25.680]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:31.040]  showing the power of the new media police were just indiscriminately arresting
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:34.000]  innocent journalists because they didn't want them there in ferguson
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  two nights ago we put the video out of our reporter having the gun aimed at
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.400]  him and then threatening another reporter the cop the ferguson cop to kill
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:48.160]  them for no reason he's been suspended indefinitely
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:53.120]  it just shows the the us against them mentality
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:58.240]  that they have there because they've been told go after the journalist
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:01.840]  and that's the same thing that's happened to 911 truth you know i
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:07.200]  came out for 911 truth the first day because i could see them building up
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:10.000]  the police state and oh there's going to be a terror attack and when it comes
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.200]  we're going to take your liberties to keep you safe well i knew if you take
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:17.280]  our liberties we're not kept safe i mean let's say the official story's
[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:20.320]  true okay let's say easter bunny is real as
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:24.560]  well in santa claus are we safe for giving up our freedoms and having the
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:29.680]  nsa illegally spy on us and invading all these countries
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:32.800]  and the answer is no al qaeda is more powerful than ever
[03:01:32.800 --> 03:01:36.320]  and being armed by our government i mean it's a fact they were given heat
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:40.000]  seeking missiles it's a fact they were given chemical weapons to attack Assad
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.120]  and he was blamed al qaeda does the dirty work
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:47.440]  for the globalist that have hijacked our country i mean it's real simple
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:51.200]  i get into the political realm the geopolitical richard gauge and
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:56.560]  architect and engineer gets into the science of it how many
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:00.880]  thousands of architects and engineers richard you as an architect do you now
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:06.400]  have in the organization we have 2200 architects engineers
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:11.280]  putting their reputation online demanding a real investigation
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:15.120]  and the message that they have is as suggested not just
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:19.440]  about scientific evidence which as you mentioned is overwhelming
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:23.520]  but it's about take action people do something
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:27.200]  come to new york if you can and get the brochures
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:33.280]  for the download them for free for the good 911 truth good for america
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:37.520]  campaign which is also the 911 truth good for the world
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:40.720]  campaign we have brochures for international use
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:44.560]  so i i'm just hoping alex that people will
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:52.160]  uh go to the website as and look at the 2200 architects and engineers
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:56.960]  uh and do what they're suggesting which is talk to everybody you know
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:01.040]  get these brochures out they are free on our website
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:06.000]  ae911truth.org free to download or people can
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:10.160]  purchase them too but this is their sign there's banners there's t-shirt
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:15.360]  there's hat there's dvd of the new dvd anatomy of a great
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:18.960]  deception premiering all over the world including
[03:03:18.960 --> 03:03:24.640]  oakland and detroit and houston and tempi
[03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:28.400]  there's just no end of the things that people can get and well that's right
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:32.240]  and and the reason this is so important is that when they staged the
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:35.920]  underwear bombing a few years ago we had a lawyer and his wife both lawyers
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:39.520]  on that flight back from amsterdam they saw the feds get them on the plane without
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:42.800]  a passport they saw he was drugged
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:47.520]  uh haskel and others they witnessed it all
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:51.280]  it ended up coming out in congress a month and a half later we broke that
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:55.040]  and and and my point is so many times now
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:58.960]  people are aware of false flags when there's a new terror attacker event
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:03.680]  people are watching experts are police military lawyers
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:08.640]  investigators professors uh average folks know what to look for now
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:12.800]  that's really freaking the system out that we expose that al qaeda launched the
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:16.160]  chemical attack not a sod we're not fans of a sod but he's not attacking
[03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:20.080]  anybody he's not sawing christian's heads off we're not fans of hazy
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:24.080]  mubarak but he was our ally for 33 years and and the country was a lot more
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:27.280]  stable and tourists could go there and people could live in peace so they
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:30.160]  tried to overthrow him and put in basically al qaeda
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:34.560]  our government is working with radical wahhabist
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:38.240]  and we need to expose it and they're getting ready for another terror attack
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:42.080]  so we've got to expose nine eleven truth ends
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:45.680]  all of that alex it's the domino that starts the
[03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:50.320]  other darmanote slowing i know it's the day after nine eleven it's the false
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:53.600]  flag of false flags until they set a nuke off and blame it on the
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:57.440]  patriot movement or al qaeda all right richard gauge thank you so
[03:04:57.440 --> 03:05:16.800]  much not only is tonight seven
