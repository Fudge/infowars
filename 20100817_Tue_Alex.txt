[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:36.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.280]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome thank you for joining us on the 17th
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.080]  day of August 2010 this Tuesday edition David McMichael a former CIA analyst
[00:47.080 --> 00:54.880]  will be joining us today to deal with the top story Israel has eight days to hit
[00:54.880 --> 01:01.480]  Iran's nuclear site that is now in the French news agency today the top story
[01:01.480 --> 01:05.960]  on the drudge report a Kurt Nemo noticed these drum beats in the last two days and
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.560]  has written several articles dealing with it the neocons are saying that they
[01:11.560 --> 01:18.800]  need to strike by the 21st 22nd or 23rd because they don't actually turn the
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.600]  reactor on until a few days after that so here's the headline Israel has eight
[01:24.600 --> 01:29.280]  days to hit Iran nuclear site Israel has eight days to launch a military strike
[01:29.280 --> 01:33.920]  against Iran's Bosch year nuclear facility and stop Tehran from acquiring a
[01:33.920 --> 01:39.480]  functioning atomic plant a former US envoy to the UN has said Iran is to
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.960]  bring online its first nuclear power plant built with Russian help on August
[01:43.960 --> 01:49.240]  21st when a shipment of nuclear fuel will be loaded into the plant's core at
[01:49.240 --> 01:54.160]  that point Bolton warned it will be too late for Israel to launch a military
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.320]  strike against the facility because an attack would spread radiation and
[01:58.320 --> 02:04.080]  affect Iranian civilians so they have to attack it to save Iranians gotta love
[02:04.080 --> 02:09.360]  that spin once the uranium once those fuel rods are very close to the reactor
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.680]  certainly once they're in the reactor attacking it means a release of
[02:12.680 --> 02:16.920]  radiation no question about it Bolton told Fox Business Network so if Israel
[02:16.920 --> 02:20.360]  is going to do anything against Bosch here it has to move the next eight days
[02:20.360 --> 02:24.840]  and he said this yesterday and other neocons said over the weekend so how was
[02:24.840 --> 02:31.720]  it eight days the 21st is one two three four five days away it goes on absent
[02:31.720 --> 02:35.120]  and Israeli strike Bolton said Iran will achieve something that no other
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.920]  opponent of Israel no other enemy the United States the Middle East really
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.160]  has and that is a functioning nuclear reactor but when asked whether he
[02:44.160 --> 02:47.320]  expected Israel to actually launch attacks against Iran with the next eight
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.480]  days Bolton was skeptical I don't think so I'm afraid they've lost the
[02:51.480 --> 02:56.080]  opportunity he said the controversial former envoy the United Nations
[02:56.080 --> 03:00.520]  criticized Russia's role in development of the plant saying the Russians are as
[03:00.520 --> 03:06.760]  they often do playing both sides against the middle the idea of being able to
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.680]  stick a thumb in America's eye always figures prominently in Moscow he said
[03:11.680 --> 03:18.160]  Iran dismissed the possibility such an attack from its arch foes so we're
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.560]  going to be talking more about that coming up in 30 minutes with David
[03:23.560 --> 03:28.640]  McMichael we called to get Ray McGovern on former top CA analyst yesterday but
[03:28.640 --> 03:32.560]  he was going to be traveling today and tomorrow so he recommended his friend
[03:32.560 --> 03:38.840]  David McMichael who in his words was even more senior than he so I look
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.360]  forward to interviewing Mr. McMichael and to get his expert analysis of the
[03:43.360 --> 03:49.040]  situation coming up in about 30 minutes in fact exactly 30 minutes from now 33
[03:49.040 --> 03:55.800]  after when he joins us also after the break that's coming up Pentagon
[03:55.800 --> 04:01.600]  warning over China military buildup here's another headline Pentagon says
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.680]  China's military power is growing another headline China targets US troops
[04:06.680 --> 04:13.840]  with arms buildup another headline from Reuters China US playing risky game on
[04:13.840 --> 04:20.960]  the high seas China test space station module to launch in 2011 North Korea
[04:20.960 --> 04:27.640]  flew drone over sensitive border South Korea this is all AP Reuters Washington
[04:27.640 --> 04:35.000]  Times they're really introducing China as the enemy I've got an issue with that
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.120]  why did the globalist arm and fund China at the disadvantage of the United
[04:40.120 --> 04:45.720]  States and then now they're claiming China wants to get America when they
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.760]  put China in this position of power over this crumbling country it's all part of
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.880]  their master plan we'll discuss that coming up we'll also get into Dr. Paul

[08:00.720 --> 08:06.520]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.520 --> 08:13.160]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:14.840 --> 08:20.640]  what was it four months ago dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy of
[08:20.640 --> 08:23.840]  the department of the Treasury under Reagan the father of Reaganomics Wall
[08:23.840 --> 08:29.000]  Street Journal editor syndicated columnist retired but then he came right
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.480]  back from retirement because you can't keep a good guy down and said hey I'll
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.560]  start sending you my columns to publish an info wars.com and we're glad he did
[08:37.560 --> 08:41.520]  that because every week or so the drudge report is now linking to his columns
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.040]  something the drudge report didn't do previously and his latest article is the
[08:46.040 --> 08:50.680]  ecstasy of empire and the drudge report linked to it yesterday it's still up there
[08:50.680 --> 08:55.000]  today it's moved from the top of the page of the left-hand column the ecstasy
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.360]  of empire and the article ends with a quote here saying without a revolution
[09:02.360 --> 09:09.160]  Americans are history I would simply alter that to say without a restoration
[09:09.160 --> 09:13.560]  Americans are history but that's called revolution by the criminal
[09:13.560 --> 09:18.200]  corporations that have taken over this nation and on short notice he's agreed
[09:18.200 --> 09:23.200]  to come on I appreciate the crew getting on that he'll be joining us after David
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.480]  McMichael comes on coming up in about 25 minutes he's a former central
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.480]  intelligence agency top analyst ten-year veteran of the US Marine Corps he was a
[09:33.480 --> 09:38.440]  counterinsurgency expert in Southeast Asia for his four years there he also
[09:38.440 --> 09:42.560]  served as an analyst for the National Intelligence Council and of course a
[09:42.560 --> 09:47.200]  lot more he has a PhD in history from the University of Oregon and it just goes
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.920]  on from there he will be joining us to break down of course the most important
[09:51.920 --> 09:57.200]  news that we're facing we noticed that key neocon operatives like Jeffrey
[09:57.200 --> 10:02.400]  Goldberg of the Atlantic and of course Mr. Bolton a former UN ambassador under
[10:02.400 --> 10:10.080]  Bush are saying Israel has got to hit the Bashir reactor within three days of the
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.280]  fuel rods being delivered on the 21st they're supposed to be inserted by the
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.200]  24th or 25th because then it would create a chair noble type meltdown
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.640]  situation if they bomb an active reactor so they're pushing this like it's some
[10:23.640 --> 10:28.280]  type of humanitarian preemptive strike and of course three weeks ago Ray
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.920]  McGovern former top CIA analyst said the word is they've green-lighted a possible
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.040]  attack they're locked and loaded with the Israelis and the US military with a
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.080]  bombardment strategy targeting hundreds of installations inside Iran they're
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.240]  already preparing the blockade which is an act of war according to the Geneva
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.640]  Convention and what Ron Paul has talked about from the House floor so Israel has
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.800]  eight days to hit Iran's nuclear site Bolton says AFP this just came out in
[10:55.800 --> 10:59.440]  the French news agency and Reuters in the last three hours proud of Kurt
[10:59.440 --> 11:03.120]  Nemo catching all this war chatter over the weekend having the first big
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.720]  article out on it yesterday morning with the headline Iran attack within the
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.640]  next week so we will continue to break all of this down coming up and we'll
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.240]  look at the economy and the state of affairs with Dr. Roberts who'll be
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.880]  popping in for 30 minutes at the bottom of the next hour we'll have wide open
[11:22.880 --> 11:30.400]  phones in the third hour of the transmission today first I wanted to
[11:30.400 --> 11:37.320]  get into the Pentagon and the media are really beating the drum now that China
[11:37.320 --> 11:44.160]  is our enemy and that China is a threat and of course that's true but not in the
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.280]  perspective not in the way that they are presenting it if if you look at the
[11:49.280 --> 11:55.160]  deals that Richard Milhouse Nixon under Kissinger's directives engaged in back
[11:55.160 --> 11:59.440]  in the 1970s and you look at what the ambassador to China set up George
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.960]  Herbert Walker Bush in the 70s the globalist the council on foreign relations
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.080]  and others the Anglo-American elite went to China and said we will make you the
[12:08.080 --> 12:13.280]  heart of the future world government in the next century the 21st century will
[12:13.280 --> 12:18.000]  be the Chinese century we want to move our main base of operations over to
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.480]  China they then in subsequent administrations of Ford Reagan George
[12:26.480 --> 12:32.880]  Herbert Walker Bush Clinton George W and now Obama got laws passed and engaged
[12:32.880 --> 12:39.400]  in regulatory maneuvers where almost all of our industry moved to China they
[12:39.400 --> 12:44.320]  raised the taxes increased the regulations the harassment on the United
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.280]  States and then put tax incentives in to move industry to China the United
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.280]  States countless times has given our weapons technology to China they've
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.120]  conduit of the technology to Israel who publicly sells it to the highest bidder
[12:59.120 --> 13:05.760]  not just to China but to South Africa or France anybody else Russians who will
[13:05.760 --> 13:10.280]  buy it you're not supposed to criticize what what Israel is doing basically
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.520]  taking over many areas of the Pentagon and creating the office of special
[13:15.520 --> 13:20.760]  planning that creates the fake WMD propaganda and that uses the private
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.800]  contractors privatizing the military to feed disinfo I mean it's just
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.280]  incredible how this country's been taken over so the United States for all
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.120]  intensive purposes isn't even manufacturing most of its military
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.400]  hardware in the United States it's going on in Western Europe Eastern Europe
[13:38.400 --> 13:43.240]  and now in some cases China they're even starting some of their weapons
[13:43.240 --> 13:49.280]  contracts for some of the components in Vietnam in South Korea I mean this is a
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.760]  joke we can't even make our weapons here because the United States is being
[13:54.760 --> 14:01.840]  dissolved we supply poor people to be the manpower of the military because they
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.440]  can't get regular jobs that's the plan and the United States is having its
[14:06.440 --> 14:12.320]  credit card run up into astronomical stratospheric red to fund the
[14:12.320 --> 14:18.760]  globalization then the United States is to be blamed and is being blamed for all
[14:18.760 --> 14:24.600]  the ills of the world you see this with global media consortiums like news core
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.360]  in European publications they own they demonize the United States but then
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.280]  domestically they push the wars and all the propaganda and and and tell us that
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.960]  we're fighting a holy you know fight for Christendom in the clash of
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.480]  civilization so they're playing all different sides off against each other
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.960]  in this complex balancing act and now the Pentagon comes out and says oh my gosh
[14:47.960 --> 14:53.320]  China is now the second biggest economy within 12 months they're set to be the
[14:53.320 --> 14:58.960]  biggest economy there are the the biggest user of energy within three years
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.080]  they will completely dwarf us not only overtake us in China and India and a
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.640]  hundred plus other hundred plus other it's over 160 third world and developing
[15:08.640 --> 15:14.920]  world nations have zero environmental standards zero carbon taxes and then
[15:14.920 --> 15:19.600]  tax incentives for our businesses to move there of course the country is going
[15:19.600 --> 15:25.320]  into cardiac arrest of course all the new state and federal taxes are causing
[15:25.320 --> 15:31.360]  the economy to go into cardiac arrest even faster this is all a consolidation
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.520]  operation so all these people in the media that wrap themselves in the
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.040]  American flag and say that if you're against wars that of your against
[15:41.040 --> 15:49.320]  invasions that of your against all of this tyranny all of these individuals
[15:49.320 --> 15:54.880]  that are out there promoting this they know full well what they're doing they
[15:54.880 --> 16:01.440]  know full well what they are a part of and then they always tell you on naked
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.680]  body scanners and checkpoints and surveillance cameras and face scanning
[16:05.680 --> 16:10.520]  and license plate reading cameras on their fighting al-Qaeda but then you
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.160]  discover al-Qaeda is their creation to destabilize whether it's southern
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.560]  Serbia or whether it's Pakistan or Afghanistan it's a divide and conquer
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.520]  mode and you and you discover that almost all of the training that goes on
[16:23.520 --> 16:29.080]  I'd say over 95% of it or more is not for fighting turban to men from central
[16:29.080 --> 16:33.520]  Asia or the Middle East the entire architecture of this is designed and
[16:33.520 --> 16:38.560]  publicly admitted to be for the American people and there's a giant illegal
[16:38.560 --> 16:43.600]  covert intelligence operation now going public because they've completed it of
[16:43.600 --> 16:48.520]  threat fusion centers federalizing police with the CIA in control of the
[16:48.520 --> 16:55.400]  bases merging local police with the military this is all happening now so
[16:55.400 --> 17:00.520]  let's go over some of this latest propaganda they destroyed our industry
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.920]  they're coming in with the carbon taxes they're federalizing everything and then
[17:05.920 --> 17:11.040]  they tell you that China is supplanting the United States when it's the
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.720]  globalist and the council on foreign relations just search the term cfr.org
[17:16.720 --> 17:23.840]  the Chinese century and they brag with pleasure in countless c-span productions
[17:23.840 --> 17:27.760]  in the last decade before that they were having secret meetings and the CFR was
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.200]  almost completely secret now they're out in the open saying that this was part of
[17:32.200 --> 17:37.680]  their plan where we're totally dependent on China who is authoritarian and has
[17:37.680 --> 17:42.040]  enslaved their people and who is a eugenics state carrying out forced
[17:42.040 --> 17:46.520]  abortions and fantasied one-child policies and mass drugging of their
[17:46.520 --> 17:51.080]  water supplies just as our water supplies are drug they are on the
[17:51.080 --> 17:55.400]  globalist team they work with the bankers and now they're giving the public
[17:55.400 --> 18:01.000]  the narrative of why we're collapsing blaming it on the communist Chinese when
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.400]  they're only a large engine in the larger structure they're just one of the
[18:06.400 --> 18:11.560]  larger cogs in all of this Pentagon warning over Chinese military buildup
[18:11.560 --> 18:17.160]  French news agency China is extending its military advantage over Taiwan and
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.400]  increasingly looking beyond building up a force with power to strike in Asia as
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.840]  far afield as the US territory of Guam the Pentagon said well yeah now they
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.520]  menace us shores on the east and west coast Atlantic and Pacific with their
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.720]  nuke subs and an annual report to Congress the US Defense Department said
[18:34.720 --> 18:40.200]  Monday that China was ramping up investment in an array of areas including
[18:40.200 --> 18:45.440]  nuclear weapons long-range missiles submarines aircraft carriers and cyber
[18:45.440 --> 18:50.360]  warfare oh but the government will take over the free internet and and and
[18:50.360 --> 18:54.800]  shut down free speech and get rid of net neutrality to protect us from the
[18:54.800 --> 18:59.800]  communist Chinese they created and I remember old-timers writing about this
[18:59.800 --> 19:04.800]  Anthony Sutton who worked for Congress and others that in 49 Mao Zedong had
[19:04.800 --> 19:09.680]  been put in power and that Chiang Kai-shek had been double-crossed by the CIA and
[19:09.680 --> 19:16.040]  then years later I saw the CIA section chief in an interview from 1949 bragging
[19:16.040 --> 19:19.640]  that they put Mao in and David Rockefeller's now written books about it
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.200]  bragging how they put Mao Zedong into power who killed conservatively 64
[19:24.200 --> 19:30.400]  million people the Chinese government says 80 plus million the balance of
[19:30.400 --> 19:34.800]  cross-strait military forces continues to shift in the mainland's favor the
[19:34.800 --> 19:38.720]  report said the Pentagon said China's buildup on the Taiwan Strait has
[19:38.720 --> 19:42.560]  continued unabated despite improving political and commercial relations
[19:42.560 --> 19:48.280]  since the island elected Beijing friendly president may ying joe in 2008

[23:57.240 --> 23:58.920]  seven six two nine six six again eight hundred eight seven six two nine six
[23:58.920 --> 24:13.040]  six i want to quantify what's happening very simply globalism is where
[24:13.040 --> 24:18.640]  mega corporations come in buy off your federal and local governments and
[24:18.640 --> 24:23.040]  have the laws changed to give them unfair traded balance so they can
[24:23.040 --> 24:28.960]  consolidate control over every industry then they move into the police state
[24:28.960 --> 24:33.240]  phase knowing that those populations are going to resist them this is in the
[24:33.240 --> 24:39.080]  imf and world bank documents that linked in two thousand and two and of course the
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.160]  john perkins economic hitman he wrote about it many others have exposed it
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.800]  then they come in with a police state which they also privatize so they make
[24:47.800 --> 24:55.880]  profits off of oppressing you it's a extremely machiavellian program of
[24:55.880 --> 25:02.520]  control it's pure genius but only a dumbed-down public can be defeated by
[25:02.520 --> 25:07.160]  this system if you're aware of it and how illegitimate it is and cut through the
[25:07.160 --> 25:12.320]  propaganda and stand up and say no their system will fail but because it's
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.160]  always covert and they always deny to your face what they're admittedly doing
[25:17.160 --> 25:23.800]  it's hard to defeat when you've got a television head couch potato population
[25:23.800 --> 25:29.600]  that doesn't see themselves in the role of freedom fighters and if you go back
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.440]  to china 150 years ago it was taken over by western powers and divided into more
[25:34.440 --> 25:39.200]  than 10 different units in some cases there were more than 15 regions
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.920]  generally about 11 controlled by different european powers including the
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.000]  united states the united states had a sector of china that it controlled and
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  exploited and so the united states as we know it doesn't exist it's been
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.320]  absorbed by the north american union system and the transatlantic treaty of
[25:57.320 --> 26:03.120]  2007 with the EU under its rules and under these new rules the bill of rights
[26:03.120 --> 26:08.880]  and constitution and the congress itself has become ceremonial they're
[26:08.880 --> 26:15.640]  nothing but managers and erin boys that carry out these larger operations and so
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.840]  as this program of consolidation accelerates they will continue to play
[26:19.840 --> 26:26.520]  nationalist tensions to get more defense funding in the name of countering
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.800]  china that they have built up but they gave shine of the Panama Canal they
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.400]  relinquish many areas of Africa to China they've relinquished many areas of
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.560]  Asia to China they have allowed China to build up high-tech wet weapons systems
[26:43.560 --> 26:50.480]  they've given China these systems and China is now the new model of the new
[26:50.480 --> 26:56.280]  world order so the United States is just a exploitation ground by the globalist
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.080]  just like China is the American people are going into an authoritarian system
[27:01.080 --> 27:07.120]  our old free society is being phased out we are more and more becoming a
[27:07.120 --> 27:13.600]  unfree nation just like China has been under tyranny for centuries Mexico is
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.400]  under tyranny Europe is sinking into tyranny what is the EU a bunch of
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.320]  unelected bureaucrats paid off by major corporations looting their population
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.720]  it's the same global cabal a global corporate governance system that has
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.560]  removed checks and balances and is setting up high-tech surveillance and
[27:34.560 --> 27:42.720]  oppression grids and private mercenary systems to oppress what's left of free
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.080]  humanity and so the United States while it's been funding the global empire has
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.800]  been getting the blame for the crimes of the globalist and now as we enter the
[27:53.800 --> 27:58.920]  final phase the United States is being fully bankrupt and hung out to dry and
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.800]  Maury strong and coffee and and all these globalist are moving to China as their
[28:04.800 --> 28:10.320]  new command base and so we see the Pentagon now hyping all of these threats
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.600]  saying oh there's a warning over Chinese military China's military power is
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.760]  growing AP reports and challenging them Washington Times China targeting US
[28:20.760 --> 28:27.280]  troops with arms buildup Pentagon sites anti-access missiles in report that
[28:27.280 --> 28:30.960]  they're aggressively building up military forces to strike US forces in the
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.680]  western Pacific and elsewhere as part of the Pentagon calls an array of high-tech
[28:34.680 --> 28:42.200]  anti-access missiles submarines and war planes in its latest annual report so
[28:42.200 --> 28:46.120]  again we're all looking at this as a US versus China situation when it's the
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.240]  globalist above our nations playing us off against each other and profiting off
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.080]  the enslavement in both areas here's another one Reuters China US playing
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.920]  risky game on the high seas the game of military bluff the China the United
[28:59.920 --> 29:03.960]  States are playing off the Chinese coast could erupt in full-fledged crisis
[29:03.960 --> 29:09.800]  hitting the arteries of global trade if the Pentagon worries about missteps ever
[29:09.800 --> 29:16.080]  to come China has been investing big slices of its growing wealth we buy
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.800]  DVD players and television sets and toys and furniture and linens and
[29:20.800 --> 29:27.760]  everything else and they buy weapons and they produce it in their own country
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.920]  so they have an industry if you're gonna have a war economy it should at least
[29:30.920 --> 29:35.600]  help your own nation but notice we don't get to have that here China has been
[29:35.600 --> 29:39.480]  investing in big slices of its growing wealth in modernizing its military and
[29:39.480 --> 29:43.360]  turning its once cranky Navy into a blue water fleet that can project power far
[29:43.360 --> 29:50.760]  from its shores with nuclear subs and aircraft carriers will be right back we're

[35:53.600 --> 35:57.080]  McMichael I'll be with us about 15 minutes into the next hour he's a former
[35:57.080 --> 36:01.440]  Central Intelligence Agency analyst 10-year veteran of the US Marine Corps
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.400]  he was a counter-insurgency expert in Southeast Asia for his four-year tour
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.400]  there he also serves an analyst for the National Intelligence Council.
[36:10.400 --> 36:16.040]  McMichael graduated MA with a PhD in history from the University of Oregon
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.400]  and it just goes on and on with all of his whistleblowing he resigned from the
[36:22.400 --> 36:26.440]  CIA in July of 83 because he felt the agency was misrepresenting intelligence
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.680]  for political reasons but we see a lot of that today don't we where these
[36:30.680 --> 36:33.880]  contractors that have a stake in exaggerating things to get funds are
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.840]  caught lying constantly or the lies about WMDs in Iraq his public
[36:38.840 --> 36:42.720]  resignation from the agency gave credence and notability to the vocal
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.360]  indictment of the Reagan administration's policy towards Central America he was
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.720]  considered the key witness in the Nicaragua versus the United States the
[36:50.720 --> 36:54.600]  case was heard in 86 for the International Court of Justice and it
[36:54.600 --> 36:58.360]  just goes on from there he's a member of veterans of intelligence professionals
[36:58.360 --> 37:02.160]  for sanity founded by Ray McGovern and the Association of National Security
[37:02.160 --> 37:06.360]  Alumni and the Association of Responsible Descent and Outspoken Critic the Iraq
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.160]  War in the Bush administration he has participated in six documentary films
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.520]  and journalist John Pilger has described him as a CIA renegade and Ray McGovern
[37:15.520 --> 37:19.720]  said that he's one of the most important experts we can talk to about fake
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.680]  intelligence leading us not just into Iraq but now Iran and we have him on
[37:24.680 --> 37:30.520]  because in the last two days Bolton the former ambassador of the UN and Jeffrey
[37:30.520 --> 37:37.000]  Goldberg of the Atlantic who put out key disinfo about WMDs in 2002 their back
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.920]  all over national television promoting that Iran must be bombed or needs to be
[37:43.920 --> 37:50.040]  attacked as Bolton saying by next week middle of next week here's the headline
[37:50.040 --> 37:55.400]  Israel has eight days to hit Iran site Bolton says before they fuel the reactor
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.760]  because then if they hit it it'll cause a Chernobyl type meltdown and rain down
[37:58.760 --> 38:02.760]  radiation in the region will obviously be seen as a serious crime against
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.920]  humanity as for joining us is David McMichael David thank you for joining us
[38:06.920 --> 38:13.600]  well thank thank you for having me I that brother lengthy CV you gave me only
[38:13.600 --> 38:18.920]  proves I've never been able to hold a regular job well Ray McGovern we were
[38:18.920 --> 38:21.920]  getting him on he's a regular contributor to the show but he was gonna
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.960]  be traveling today so he couldn't come on he recommended you and said that you're
[38:25.960 --> 38:29.240]  even more senior in your knowledge so that's quite a compliment coming from
[38:29.240 --> 38:34.160]  Ray who we've seen stunning accuracy in his trends forecasting let's get into I
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.720]  mean you want to start at the beginning with Iraq or or or even before with
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.520]  disinformation you expose in the 80s or where we're going with Iran yeah well
[38:42.520 --> 38:49.520]  look the I mean you just take as a general statement that disinformation is
[38:49.520 --> 38:57.880]  a principal activity in a wartime situation and now that we're involved in
[38:57.880 --> 39:05.000]  a war on terror as we're previously involved in the Cold War part and
[39:05.000 --> 39:16.480]  parcel of the the government direction of that is disinformation and this is
[39:16.480 --> 39:24.720]  designed on the one hand to ensure public support for the policy decided
[39:24.720 --> 39:32.640]  upon by those in control of conduct of foreign policy and the second aspect of
[39:32.640 --> 39:41.560]  course is to delude and punish the designated enemy so disinformation is
[39:41.560 --> 39:47.720]  let me put this way in and going back to the CIA background and the conduct of
[39:47.720 --> 39:55.440]  covert operations a rule of thumb is 75% of covert operation is disinformation
[39:55.440 --> 40:01.120]  I mean just so that tells you what trust you can have in the statements that are
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.600]  produced by by government official and I've now seen public statements by the
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.480]  Pentagon in the last few years that now 90% of what they do is psychological
[40:11.480 --> 40:17.240]  warfare so they're converting even more into brainwashing propaganda disinfo
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.000]  or info war as they call it yeah that that that's very that's very much part
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.920]  of it and the many aspects to that going back to the Manchurian candidate
[40:30.920 --> 40:39.840]  days but but yeah that is a huge part of what this vastly expanded Pentagon plus
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.520]  of course this huge apparatus that was exposed in those remarkable articles of
[40:46.520 --> 40:53.680]  now 10 days ago or two weeks ago in the Washington Post on this huge expansion
[40:53.680 --> 41:02.680]  of this national security apparatus top-secret USA 800 that that that's
[41:02.680 --> 41:08.800]  precisely it that's much that's much reading for your listeners 854,000
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.840]  highest level private spies I mean this isn't this really the end of America a
[41:13.840 --> 41:21.080]  private corporate contractor offshore takeover of frontline combat troops
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.360]  intelligence supply logistics I mean everything and you look at these
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.600]  companies these are international this is this is it isn't the communist
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.280]  Chinese or the Arabs or the Russians overthrowing the United States it's the
[41:35.280 --> 41:38.600]  private intelligence takeover and the two trillion dollars a year of the
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.200]  Defense Department and the contractors are gobbling up yeah well look I mean
[41:43.200 --> 41:49.960]  you you don't have to speak of the the end of America you might reasonably speak
[41:49.960 --> 41:55.720]  the end of America the America that perhaps you and I grew up in but it
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.080]  certainly speaks to the the points made so accurately by Howard Zinn the
[42:02.080 --> 42:10.880]  recently deceased Howard Zinn I hate to say in his numerous books on you know the
[42:10.880 --> 42:16.160]  people's history and so forth is look you're what you're dealing with and I'm
[42:16.160 --> 42:21.640]  glad you raised the point Alec on the the use the privatization here the use
[42:21.640 --> 42:29.800]  of corporations and this the the law requires right there is right now the
[42:29.800 --> 42:35.320]  law as it's put forward in the courts of the United States and elsewhere as well
[42:35.320 --> 42:44.200]  contrarolling corporate behavior is that the fiduciary responsibility of the
[42:44.200 --> 42:51.880]  corporate leadership is to its shareholders and it is obliged again by
[42:51.880 --> 42:57.760]  law to take all actions which will benefit its shareholders and if this
[42:57.760 --> 43:07.600]  means in seeking contracts in the national security area to manufacture or
[43:07.600 --> 43:13.640]  enhance the alleged threat which would justify they're getting a contract
[43:13.640 --> 43:18.600]  that's what they're going to do and the more influential these people become and
[43:18.600 --> 43:24.560]  God knows they've been influential for a very long time this is this is the
[43:24.560 --> 43:29.400]  is the way it's going to go I don't consider that the end of America I'm
[43:29.400 --> 43:36.920]  just considering it the worsening of America well I mean look the CIA is
[43:36.920 --> 43:40.600]  barred under federal law from domestic operations but it's come out they're
[43:40.600 --> 43:44.240]  even running local fusion centers so they don't care and now they've got
[43:44.240 --> 43:50.320]  private contractors and the CIA and the army picking targets and running
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.400]  drone attacks and and and so that really is a covert takeover of the government
[43:55.400 --> 44:01.680]  when you have these private interests in in in many areas now dwarfing people
[44:01.680 --> 44:07.600]  that are in government service and I had Hamed ghoul the former head of
[44:07.600 --> 44:13.760]  Pakistani intelligence on yesterday and you know he was saying that look he said
[44:13.760 --> 44:17.760]  I'm not involved in the Taliban or al-qaeda this is ridiculous they're
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.000]  attacking people in Pakistan to stir up the tribal areas to destabilize our
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.480]  country so they have a pretext to widen the war here and he said these private
[44:26.480 --> 44:32.760]  contractors have an incentive to lie about this to expand the war and he was
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.760]  saying they were there two years ago depending on live now they admit they
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.400]  are there but but you know I don't know if he's telling the complete truth but
[44:40.400 --> 44:47.440]  I looked at Alex I think you're the key phrase if you used in quoting Hamed ghoul
[44:47.440 --> 44:53.520]  there was about these corporations that are involved is they have an incentive
[44:53.520 --> 45:00.240]  he said to manage to you know expand the alleged threat to create conditions in
[45:00.240 --> 45:06.160]  which their contracts will be extended expanded and inadequately supervised
[45:06.160 --> 45:13.280]  and that's that that's absolutely correct and that as I said is the by by
[45:13.280 --> 45:19.680]  corporate law as practice in court that is the obligation of the corporate
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.840]  leadership is to do everything legally possible to enhance the profits to the
[45:25.840 --> 45:30.920]  shareholders but the CIA isn't allowed without warrants on paper to spy on the
[45:30.920 --> 45:34.880]  American people how do they then come out and admit that there's almost a
[45:34.880 --> 45:40.040]  million private contractors with the highest security clearance spying on the
[45:40.040 --> 45:44.300]  American people I mean poindexter six to seven years ago got in trouble for
[45:44.300 --> 45:47.960]  total information awareness network and then the Washington Post reported well
[45:47.960 --> 45:52.480]  they just made it private so that's okay I mean to me that makes it even more
[45:52.480 --> 46:00.000]  illegal yeah well I would I would say the question of legality of course will
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.680]  be handled in the court than one of the unfortunate and I can tell you this
[46:04.680 --> 46:10.480]  from from a lot of direct experience with this in cases I used to put out a
[46:10.480 --> 46:16.040]  publication called unclassified for some years it's published about eight or
[46:16.040 --> 46:23.840]  nine years ago now a little longer than that but I had a section in there which
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.520]  they published every two months on shadow justice describing the way the
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.800]  United States courts that the local and especially at the federal level handled
[46:34.800 --> 46:41.680]  cases which in which the government came forward and argued the classified
[46:41.680 --> 46:50.200]  material national security and the general 99% was the exception by the way
[46:50.200 --> 46:56.560]  of the of Judge Walsh who handled the Iran contra cases who was my view one
[46:56.560 --> 47:03.760]  the great heroes of the American legal system so the default is the point the
[47:03.760 --> 47:07.560]  point I was planning on a make here is that when you're talking about the
[47:07.560 --> 47:14.480]  court and is it illegal is 90% of the cases the the federal court will wash
[47:14.480 --> 47:18.760]  their hands of any case in which the government comes forward at this
[47:18.760 --> 47:24.400]  national security classified material and I've heard this phrase used over and
[47:24.400 --> 47:30.840]  over again well as the judges you know we we can't understand the
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.960]  intricacies of the intelligence system which is like a great mosaic you see
[47:35.960 --> 47:41.560]  and if you only move one tile in it you know it could disrupt the whole thing so
[47:41.560 --> 47:47.320]  case dismissed well that's the issue since 1947 with the National Security
[47:47.320 --> 47:53.120]  Act tens of trillions of dollars spent total secrecy even if it began good
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.480]  which the evidence shows it clearly didn't I mean it's an absolute hundred
[47:57.480 --> 48:04.400]  percent prescription for tyranny well it it certainly leads that way and I
[48:04.400 --> 48:10.200]  think one of the things that I have focused on over the years is this use
[48:10.200 --> 48:17.200]  of the term national security which has no real definition and one of the you
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.960]  know marks that you can use the the plus mark you can give to Dwight Eisenhower
[48:21.960 --> 48:27.200]  who of course warned about the military industrial complex and leaving but
[48:27.200 --> 48:34.000]  who's deliberately refused to use the term national security is it national
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.960]  defense I can understand this national security what is that and there is no
[48:38.960 --> 48:44.880]  legal definition for it but it's been used to you know justify or at least
[48:44.880 --> 48:51.200]  rationalize a whole range of government activities over the years which you know
[48:51.200 --> 48:56.160]  I think you accurately described as as tyrannical certainly unconstitutional
[48:56.160 --> 49:01.040]  well David we know why Eisenhower really got upset he even wrote about it some
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.880]  LL Limser came to him and said we want to bomb DC in Miami attack Marine Corps
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.080]  bases and blame it on the Cubans and the Russians and he said no they brought it
[49:12.080 --> 49:16.680]  to Kennedy and he fired them so so we know why he was getting concerned oh
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.200]  yeah no there are believe me there are not you know when you say that you know
[49:21.200 --> 49:26.280]  the reaction of most people is to say well what kind of nutcases are those
[49:26.280 --> 49:32.560]  who can you know walk into the Oval Office then and you know give that sort
[49:32.560 --> 49:38.480]  of advice to a president United States that there must be something wrong with
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.280]  the system it allows these people to go around with you know not wearing a
[49:43.280 --> 49:49.400]  straight jacket but you know but there are these people and part of it of
[49:49.400 --> 49:57.440]  course is the reaction I like there's a famous instance early on in the history
[49:57.440 --> 50:03.680]  of the CIA when concern was being expressed about activities which going
[50:03.680 --> 50:08.240]  back to Iran with the the great success and overthrow in the elected
[50:08.240 --> 50:16.640]  government of Iran back in the 1950s operation Ajax yes of course and the
[50:16.640 --> 50:25.400]  you know when Alan dollars head of the CIA and a very crafty guy by the way you
[50:25.400 --> 50:31.400]  know proposed that to the Senate that he would like to bring in groups of
[50:31.400 --> 50:37.760]  senators and explain to me exactly what this new CIA was doing is the then
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.040]  senior senator from Massachusetts told them no no no there are things we'd
[50:43.040 --> 50:48.760]  rather not know about so there's also this implied consent where the
[50:48.760 --> 50:52.920]  government really does know what's going on they just like to basically have
[50:52.920 --> 50:57.600]  that plausible deniability stay there sir retired senior CIA analyst will talk
[50:57.600 --> 51:02.760]  more with him straight ahead attention this is a special alert to all
[51:02.760 --> 51:07.240]  Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS the IRS is now
[51:07.240 --> 51:10.800]  accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically
[51:10.800 --> 51:14.640]  lowering amounts owed due to the financial crisis in America the IRS has
[51:14.640 --> 51:18.120]  announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers financial troubles into
[51:18.120 --> 51:22.720]  today's economy if you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS an open
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.840]  phone line has been established by American tax settlement for you to call
[51:25.840 --> 51:30.840]  and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75% number to call is 800 902
[51:30.840 --> 51:35.880]  6969 again the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe
[51:35.880 --> 51:39.600]  back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy if you are struggling
[51:39.600 --> 51:43.920]  with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS you now may be eligible for a
[51:43.920 --> 51:48.400]  dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars for free
[51:48.400 --> 51:51.760]  information and to see if you qualify call the open phone line into American
[51:51.760 --> 52:01.520]  tax settlement now 800 902 6969 800 902 6969 again 800 902 6969 the question is
[52:01.520 --> 52:06.480]  where should the American people draw their line in the sand what have we got
[52:06.480 --> 52:12.040]  a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects
[52:12.040 --> 52:16.400]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[52:16.400 --> 52:19.760]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.680]  children our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will
[52:25.680 --> 52:30.440]  tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising
[52:30.440 --> 52:34.920]  we have the facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we

[54:08.560 --> 54:13.280]  McMichael this is a short segment so let's get right to it we appreciate you
[54:13.280 --> 54:20.360]  joining us sir oh we're seeing a near identical repeat of the propaganda used
[54:20.360 --> 54:29.600]  on Iraq eight years ago again when I ran can you speak to this yeah this has been
[54:29.600 --> 54:37.360]  going on for a very long time and I call it the creation of a false crisis
[54:37.360 --> 54:51.040]  involving it Iran and its nuclear program out of to put it in the shortest way possible
[54:51.040 --> 54:56.440]  Iran which is a an original signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.160]  back in the 1970s under the Shah's government of course when the United
[55:01.160 --> 55:12.960]  States was very eager to assist Iran in developing a nuclear power industry is
[55:12.960 --> 55:18.800]  being has been charged since the overthrow of the show on the establishment
[55:18.800 --> 55:29.600]  of the Islamic Republic with the intention to not simply to develop a
[55:29.600 --> 55:36.240]  nuclear power industry but that is a cover for its desire to produce nuclear
[55:36.240 --> 55:43.520]  weapons which of course is prohibited by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty the
[55:43.520 --> 55:49.560]  NPT well these accusations have been made for a very long time the Iranians have
[55:49.560 --> 55:54.600]  been assisted as a matter of fact their chief spiritual leader and I have my
[55:54.600 --> 56:03.120]  problems with the sharia types who dominate a certain aspect of Iranian
[56:03.120 --> 56:08.760]  public life they have emphasized even in that period that the Islamic law
[56:08.760 --> 56:15.720]  prohibits the manufacture or use of these weapons of mass destruction nuclear
[56:15.720 --> 56:22.000]  weapons and so forth but in any case it's been an article of faith excuse the
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.480]  expression coming both from certain elements in our foreign policy
[56:29.480 --> 56:37.520]  establishment and especially from Israel and its adherents and followers in the
[56:37.520 --> 56:44.360]  United States I think we use the AIPAC the American Israeli political action
[56:44.360 --> 56:50.800]  committee is the symbol of this to insist that Iran is deliberately
[56:50.800 --> 56:58.600]  pursuing this creation of nuclear weapons which represents a existential
[56:58.600 --> 57:05.920]  threat to Israel particularly and subsequently of course to the United
[57:05.920 --> 57:12.040]  States and its interests in the in the Middle East now I should emphasize that
[57:12.040 --> 57:20.120]  the IAEA the International Atomic Energy Agency which is charged under the
[57:20.120 --> 57:27.520]  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to investigate and the nuclear programs of
[57:27.520 --> 57:36.120]  every country in the world consistently found that Iran was not engaged in the
[57:36.120 --> 57:42.680]  or intending the production of nuclear weapons three years ago there was a
[57:42.680 --> 57:48.040]  national intelligence estimate either products produced by the National
[57:48.040 --> 57:52.280]  Intelligence Council the grouping of all the United States intelligence
[57:52.280 --> 58:06.520]  agencies which found that despite the uproar that Iran had ceased any nuclear
[58:06.520 --> 58:14.000]  weapons programs back in 2003 and had not reconstituted them now I know a
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.200]  little bit about these types of programs Brazil even Sweden Argentina other
[58:20.200 --> 58:24.200]  countries have them ever at any country which has a significantly sized
[58:24.200 --> 58:30.560]  military has nuclear weapons programs in the sense that studies are done within
[58:30.560 --> 58:37.160]  their military David McMichael we've got a break we're back in 70 seconds we'll

[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:22.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.320]  well AP Reuters French news agency they've all got the same headline Israel
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:33.360]  has eight days to hit Iran's nuclear site that's the former US ambassador to the
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:41.560]  UN Bolton they've got Jeffrey Goldberg the admitted Israel operative running
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:47.320]  around saying we've got to do it at the new Atlantic all of this is happening
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:52.480]  and we're talking to a former senior CIA analyst who also worked at the National
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.560]  Intelligence Council who found three years ago that Iran was a decade away
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.200]  from a nuke and that they suspended their program and of course that's what the
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.560]  council had said about Iraq's WMD's that had been suspended in in the early 90s
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.920]  but that they just created a new office in the Pentagon to put out this info so
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:19.560]  we're seeing the same thing now and sir ominous war clouds gathering from your
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.840]  years of experience it looks like you're trying to sell an attack on Iran now and
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:31.800]  what would come of that if there is an attack well if there were an attack and
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:37.160]  of course the what kind of an attack and I think what most people have in
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:46.960]  mind reflecting the rhetoric coming out of Tel Aviv is that this would be an
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:58.960]  Israeli aerial attack on Iraq's nuclear installations and that the United
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:07.560]  States that this could not happen without either an open or a tacit approval by
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.840]  the United States government because the aircraft would have to overfly areas
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:20.120]  controlled by the United States Iraq for for example and so this has become a
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:26.360]  major issue as you point out the well the one thing you didn't point out of
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:34.760]  course is that as of yesterday the long-planned Russian
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:44.240]  designed and assisted nuclear power plant at Boucher in Iran was open because
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:54.400]  the Russians delivered to the plant the nuclear fuel to get it running it has not
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.000]  yet been installed and that's what gets to this eight-day thing that's been
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.600]  raised it will take approximately another week to get this all the fuel in
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:11.120]  there and it's being argued by Bolton and others that the plant must be
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.920]  destroyed before the fuel is in there because if the fuel is there and then
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.640]  it is bombed then you set up a Chernobyl type situation with radioactive
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.760]  material spreading all over the whole Middle East which is kind of
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:32.720]  suicidal for anybody that gets involved in this this has been magnified if you
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:40.320]  will and publicized very highly by this article by Jeffrey Goldberg whom you
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.480]  rightly described as basically an Israeli asset if you will in the United
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:57.920]  States in the Atlantic monthly which showed it really is focused as much on
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:05.280]  our current United States government the Barack Obama administration that the
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:12.840]  that the only way the United States can really prevent Israel from carrying out
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:20.360]  such an attack is by itself taking a more direct military power military
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:30.480]  economic role in forcing the Iranian government to abandon its its current
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:38.640]  nuclear power program so this as I say this all comes about but I think from my
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:48.400]  perspective one of the main factors to consider here is that this elevating and
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.680]  it's been high pretty high profile for quite a while I tell you what I'm
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.880]  sorry sorry interrupt let's hit that key point straight ahead with our final

[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.800]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.080]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.960]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.640]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.200]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.600]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.760]  well he was a senior CIA analyst course in the Marine Corps before that in
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.560]  intelligence and he's a famous well-known whistleblower exposed fake
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.520]  intelligence back in the 80s and it's the same story just on a bigger scale if
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.360]  you look at even the hawks in government they admit that an attack on Iran and
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:40.240]  they published three years ago some of the attack plans hundreds of sites their
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.240]  Navy their power plants their bridges their infrastructure being annihilated a
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:50.480]  crime against humanity our government has overthrown Iran in 53 it's done all
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.040]  sorts of horrible things to them covert operations bush psi her six years ago
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.520]  reported on this two years after that four years ago the White House put out a
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.560]  press release saying yes we're running four different sectarian groups three of
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.840]  them al Qaeda related while hobbyists connected out of Saudi Arabia inside Iran
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.400]  sabotaging and staging terror attacks I mean this is admitted it's like bush two
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.320]  months ago came out and said yeah I ordered torture and I'd order it again
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.240]  but he sent people to prison that followed his memos from John you and
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.800]  from Alberto Gonzalez the Attorney General it's so criminal and now with
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:33.400]  Obama it's continuing and we left off with the former you know IDF prison guard
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:38.920]  Jeffrey Goldberg writing in the Atlantic that America the United States needs to
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.320]  attack Iran and most analysts think it could trigger World War three but
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.360]  regardless it's going to double or triple oil prices a global z-hod not fake
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.400]  terror real attacks are going to begin and I think serve that they want to
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.120]  invoke this clash of civilizations they want to stir up the Muslim hornet's
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.440]  nest in Central Asia into the Middle East and then into Eastern Europe and the
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.920]  United States but I mean specifically what do you think the grand design here
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.640]  is what is a pack looking for what are the Hawks at the Pentagon looking for and
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.400]  do you believe they are moving towards a green light on an attack on Iran well I
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.880]  would agree your last minute they are moving toward it you know the the
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:30.960]  likelihood of giving this green light is greater than it was let's say a year
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.760]  year and a half ago when especially the Israelis were in some sort of a panic
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:41.480]  trying to figure out what the Obama administration's actual policy in the
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:46.920]  Middle East would be and they've they've been I think they've been relieved I
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.640]  think they have the very strong elements directly within the White House I
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.920]  need merely say Rahm Emanuel then there there are several others very close in
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:03.960]  the so-called national security admitted member of the Israeli military
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:14.360]  White House he's right there as you know basically an Israeli
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:21.520]  representative in in the White House and he's very hawkish and so forth now the
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:30.840]  that said I'd like to refer your your listeners our listeners at this point
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:37.640]  to the comment which Martin Indyk the former US ambassador to Israel and
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.300]  currently a vice president of the Brookings Institution in here in
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:48.280]  Washington commented on the the Goldberg article and came up with the
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:56.240]  conclusion that the United States was more likely than Israel to bomb Iran in
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.920]  other words if if in fact the United States determined that that Israel would
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.560]  go ahead with this and would be and that the United States would be put in a bad
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.600]  position if you will by moving effectively to prevent Israel from doing
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.280]  it then the United States would be more likely to take the action to destroy the
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:25.840]  installation at Boucher and show its determination this would really be you
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:32.800]  know Obama's complete transformation into the new bush in there and I I think
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:41.320]  there is that Indyk certainly knows the region you know makes makes a certain
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.000]  amount of sense in coming to this conclusion the point I was going to
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.920]  make before we went to break last time which makes this whole situation you
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:13:02.280]  know less predictable and more chancey than it was before this is happening in
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:09.360]  the middle of the run-up to the congressional elections this fall and
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:17.640]  God knows the Republican Party will play the Israeli card on this one there
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:24.120]  are many elements within the Democratic Party which will also play the Israeli
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:31.960]  card on it and arguably force Obama's hand force a decision which says oh god
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.160]  for political purposes if nothing else we've got to take some dramatic action
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:44.080]  here in in the Iran situation well that was my next point we saw in the
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.320]  Financial Times of London two weeks ago or now three weeks ago former top
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.160]  Clinton advisor also advising Obama Robert Shapiro saying if we don't have
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.920]  an Oklahoma City or a new 9-11 or some big event to make Obama look strong to
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.840]  make people rally around him there's going to be a complete sweep of the
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.320]  Democrats and so they understand that at least short term of the new war people
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:15.840]  will rally around the leader you know at that sociological primitive level and
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.640]  so that that's why Ray McGovern and many others and I guess you're saying
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.840]  the same thing are saying that this is the prime zone of danger going into
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:31.760]  November yeah well I told you know I feel very strongly about this and you
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:38.300]  use one of the words that shakes me up completely is this concentration on the
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:45.320]  word leader I told this to the junior senator from the Commonwealth of
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.960]  Virginia where I reside during the elections when he you know I was talking
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.720]  to him in a local coffee shop and he said well we've got this I'll show a
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:59.120]  strong leadership on this I said to him governor I don't want you to show
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.760]  leadership I want you to represent me yes I feel very strongly about that
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.600]  because this is a government of we the people and a rule of law in our Republic
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.800]  not Germany or Stalinist Russia or Maoist China we don't we don't need
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:21.200]  people to lead us we need them to represent us what we need homeland
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:28.480]  security excuse me brother that was one of the great shocks to me is the
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.360]  adoption of that name for a branch of the United States government yeah for
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.940]  those that don't know it's in a direct translation of Reich security the
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:40.120]  Germans just put the words backwards or from their perspective correctly you know
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:46.400]  so so land security or or Reich meaning the homeland security we now have
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.600]  homeland security yeah and it's you know that I know this is a long-term trend as
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:57.920]  you know many comments are made on on this all the time especially I I guess
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:05.120]  I could classify you as a libertarian and the the constant you know comment and
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:12.080]  something worried me for a long time both as an academic and in government is
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:20.040]  this constant expansion of executive authority particularly in the one area
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:26.080]  where the drafters of our Constitution were most concerned which was going to
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:35.440]  war and the you know putting that power in the hands of the Congress and not of
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:44.360]  the executive and you know as we saw in the aftermath of Vietnam one of the
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.200]  great fold-ups of the Congress as far as I'm concerned was the War Powers Act of
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:57.600]  1973 which effectively told the president I say we can go to war anytime you
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.880]  want just let us know every six months how it's going and that does give you a
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:09.200]  fewer type precept I mean it's completely the opposite of what our
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:15.400]  Republic was founded on well I I think you what could say that and they did
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.680]  whatever argument one wishes to make about the you know the need for strong
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:27.800]  leadership in the foreign policy area and so forth is that when you see
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:35.600]  developing because of the belief in this there's hugely magnified national
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.200]  security establishment the enormous financial costs that go with it and we
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:50.680]  when you realize that just two or the two weeks ago that the renewed funding
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.320]  for the war in Afghanistan was put through an additional thirty billion
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.680]  dollars that's just for the part of it and incidentally if you go back to that
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:08.960]  House resolution on that you'll find that the actual title of it is a law to
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:16.920]  extend certain funding for education and other domestic projects that to me was
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.280]  the height of hypocrisy so now it's education I have to have the biggest
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.520]  war machine the planet's ever seen sir what about stage terror or provocateur
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.360]  actions as a pretext to attack Iran I mean we know the CIA has declassified
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:38.320]  part of the NATO option Gladio Ajak Gulf of Tonkin was a staged event in
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.640]  and now declassified I mean how much danger are we in though for this
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.840]  military industrial complex to stage events or to let people attack us open
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.600]  the door as a pretext to expand I think all your listeners need to do is go
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:02.000]  back to the long since declassified information on Operation Northwood which
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.400]  was a program put forward and passed through the joint chiefs of staff and
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:15.200]  put up to then president Kennedy calling for the staging of fake attacks on
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:26.520]  United States aircraft in the air near Cuba and even accepting the not just
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:32.320]  not military aircraft either passenger aircraft and even expect accepting the
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:40.120]  loss of American life as a justification for an open military attack on on on
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.760]  Cuba though David this is been thought of before and they've been done before
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:52.400]  and I think the you know the purpose of people like yourself as journalists

[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:09.280]  final segment with former high-level CIA analyst and whistleblower David
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:14.320]  mcmichael we appreciate his time today every time he gets into something really
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.720]  important we have to go to break but the breaks are pre-programmed here for our
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.760]  radio affiliates out there we're getting into operation north woods and
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:27.280]  there's so many other instances of plans and actual events where government
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.880]  stage terror attacks you have all these private corporate interests they've
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.560]  gotten away with murder now Fox News has a raldo interviewing Marine Corps
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:41.360]  colonels admitting that they're helping grow the opium and we've always known
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.520]  that they're involved in narcotics trafficking I mean there's no end to
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.960]  this evil and now the banks around the country they've stolen trillions they're
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.600]  stealing trillions more finishing up with stage terror I mean it's pretty
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.960]  clear for me a student of history and just a layman but you have a degree a
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:02.400]  PhD in history that going back to Julius Caesar they used fake crises or
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.120]  hype crises as a pretext for control and they built this huge apparatus that
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.800]  rivals the NKVD in Soviet Russia and it's all aimed at the American people
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.320]  law enforcement sent me the homeland security reports none of this has to
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.800]  do with turban to men in caves they're worried about landowners gun owners
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.600]  libertarians conservatives anti-war people your comments on the conversion of
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.200]  America to a police state of you agree and false flag terror sir yeah well
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.520]  look there has been this enormous elaboration of you know and again the
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:46.000]  term security comes in there there's security firms etc that make money off
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.120]  this you know among the more interesting phenomena if you will of recent
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.560]  years and this country has been the you've talked about privatization and
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:02.680]  the military intelligence operation but the privatization of the prison system
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:10.040]  which gives an immense incentive for the Correctional Corporation of America
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.960]  the biggest firm and others that are in there you know to push for legislation
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.680]  that keeps more people locked up and you know there's more money coming into
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:29.520]  their coffers so yes this is this is a if you will police state magnification of
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:36.640]  powers of the so-called security element and the combination of course of local
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:43.960]  security into the into the national apparatus and it's an unfortunate
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.680]  circumstance I'm going to give you one more almost north woods related thing
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:54.640]  for you in terms of the way covert operations work in these circumstances
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:01.160]  years ago after the Castro revolution in Cuba we arranged with the British
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.160]  Leyland Motor Company which had big contracts with the New
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:11.480]  Government in Cuba to replace the the motor bus system in Cuban cities so the
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.400]  buses that were delivered to Cuba had been sabotaged the point where they
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.600]  weren't functioning and now we're getting quite credible reports out that
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:30.520]  the nuclear power equipment that Iran is buying from other countries has been in
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:36.440]  many cases effectively sabotage before it ever reaches Iran so these are I
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.520]  mean these are the things that in my experience over the years which
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:48.000]  intelligence quote-unquote intelligent systems tend to do and I'll give you
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.640]  before we leave a quick definition of covert operations it was first made
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:28:03.080]  official in the defense budget act of 1993 is a covert operations are those
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.880]  activities of a military economic or political nature carried out by the
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:14.480]  United States government to influence or control activities in other countries
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.640]  which are done in such a manner that the participation of the United States is
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:26.400]  concealed or if revealed can and here's the key phrase plausibly be denied yes
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.360]  and finally sir I hope to have you back up in the near future we appreciate your
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.800]  time one minute left knowing about north woods and Ajax and the rest of it do you
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:44.640]  question 9-11 ever you know there's you know as a you know a non-scientist back
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:49.600]  out on that one but you know the arguments made about the the grave
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:56.960]  difficulty of you know taking down buildings like that through the you
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:03.040]  know the burning of aviation fuel after a crash is you know not too convincing
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:09.360]  to me and I was just closed with telling you that back in 1945 when I was a 17
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.560]  year old kid working as a longshoreman on the New York waterfront you know I
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.160]  think on the Jersey side I looked up one morning and saw this big hole in the
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:24.920]  Empire State Building remember that was a B-25 which went off course and flew
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:29.400]  right into the into the Empire State Building knocked an immense hole in the
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.880]  building but it certainly didn't set it on fire and melt it down and we see how
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:41.080]  9-11 was used to further destroy our freedoms well yeah no freedom what has

[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:11.920]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:20.400]  we're going to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts talk about the economy the collapse of
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:23.920]  this nation that is now accelerating and we're almost past the point our return
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:27.800]  according to his analysis and many others that I respect according of course to
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:33.240]  my own breakdown of history and understanding and war with Iran Bolton
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.120]  said yesterday eight days people said well wait a minute that's only four days
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:42.840]  until the 21st when they load the fuel into the reactors at Bosch year now
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.560]  he's in the Jerusalem Post saying yes he meant three days so he says we must
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.120]  strike them now so we'll talk about that with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts the reason I
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:55.920]  got him on hurriedly two weeks ago Drudge Report linked to and then it was
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:04.960]  carried in literally thousands of websites his article about the collapse
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:10.080]  of the United States in 2017 and he's written a new one called the ecstasy of
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.080]  empire where he talks about the fact that if there isn't a revolution in this
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.640]  country we're history and I wanted to get his take on what type of revolution is
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.480]  he specifically talking about Dr. Paul Craig Roberts we're going to him in
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.640]  just a moment because again this article is getting a lot of attention and I
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:29.800]  never saw his columns previously posted at the Drudge Report I'm glad the Drudge
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.560]  Report is now linking over to those because they're so important of course
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.640]  he formally wrote and was an editor for the Wall Street Journal but I wanted to

[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:04.400]  the word okay we go now to dr. Paul Craig Roberts and dr. Paul Craig Roberts was
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.400]  the head of policy number two at the treasury the father of ergonomics wall
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.320]  street journal editor many time best-selling author syndicated columnist
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:16.880]  and his latest book is how the economy was lost the war of the worlds in his
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.480]  editorial that we posted we have a link at the bottom where you can go over and
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:27.200]  get the book at Amazon dot com but I'm very excited that drudge would post an
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.480]  article critical of the neocons in Israel this is a big deal and drudge reads
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:36.040]  all these before he posted we commend his courage but I mean you know it's the
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.440]  Hawks it's the military national complex it's Israeli and others who want this and
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.320]  Obama wants it for a political distraction an attack on Iran we just
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.400]  had a former high-level CIA analyst on earlier breaking all of that down but we
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:54.840]  go now to dr. Paul Craig Roberts to talk about his story the ecstasy of empire
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:01.000]  good to have you doc thanks Alex I mean let's go over it this is exciting to see
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.440]  you that that I mean your articles would get international attention in the
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.960]  wall street journal but but but now since you're just going with you know the
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:14.740]  info war they're getting even more attention as seems to be the case well
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:19.360]  break it down sir I mean I mean this article I mean is frightening in its
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.640]  reality and how you link to all the data to back up what you're saying encapsulate
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.280]  what your story covers and then let's expand where you leave off saying if we
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:33.960]  don't have a revolution we're history well Alex I know what the article does
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.320]  is to sort of bring together many of the messages I've been making partly over
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:45.280]  your show over the years that the economy has been destroyed by the
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:54.000]  offshoring of the middle-class jobs and so this has produced I think since 2007
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:01.160]  a loss of approximately 10 to 11 million jobs now those jobs simply aren't here
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:06.400]  so their stimulus programs can't put people back to work in jobs that have
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.680]  been moved offshore the reason the jobs are moved offshore is it increases the
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:17.800]  profits of the firms in the short run it makes money for Wall Street it makes
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.920]  money for shareholders and the executives can pay themselves huge
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.360]  bonuses so they've sold out the American economy and of course their own
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.360]  workforces their own communities in order to enrich themselves so here you
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:44.520]  see the small oligarchy fouling its own nest because the intermediate run
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:50.160]  consequence beyond the short run the consequence is to destroy the domestic
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.920]  consumer market and also destroy their own power base so we have an economy
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:04.600]  that's deserted by the elite in business and in the government and of
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:10.560]  course as you as you well know the so-called mainstream media is part of
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:19.040]  their control apparatus so so what I concluded is that unless there is a
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:28.520]  revolution and these very small private interests that control the country are
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:35.120]  destroyed then America is destroyed because the basis for the country has
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:40.760]  been taken away from it now I don't know what kind of revolution it would be you
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.440]  know sometimes revolutions are organized but I think most often they just
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:52.920]  happen you know people get it's like Gerald Slinty says when people have
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:42:00.440]  nothing left to lose they lose it and so oftentimes revolutions just just happen
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:06.480]  and it's never clear who will take them over that we think of the Bolshevik
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.240]  Revolution but actually the February Revolution which displaced those are it
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.120]  was not led by the Bolsheviks their revolution occurred several months
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.200]  later they simply took advantage of the chaos to seize power so none of that is
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:27.560]  predictable we can't say what who will end up with it but we do know that the
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:33.440]  people who rule the country now do not rule it in anyone's interest but their
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  own very narrow interest and the rest of the country is suffering suffering
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.600]  tremendously I mean look at the food stamps we now have a record number of
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:49.040]  Americans own food stamps it's an extraordinary number of people and so
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:56.560]  what did Congress do recently they cut food stamps these types of policies
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:02.360]  themselves produce revolutions and when you have a when you have a record
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:05.720]  number of people on food stamps when you have predictions that the number is
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:10.880]  going to climb and then Congress cuts it that's like saying oh how can the
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.880]  government help to undermine itself and cause a revolution well that's a let them
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.640]  eat cake statement that's the let's me cake statement and there's so many of
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:26.040]  those statements there's so many of the let them eat cake statements and I think
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.800]  that's I mean we'll see the same thing with the unemployment benefits you know
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.760]  they're now have they've been extended and extended and extended which you would
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:41.520]  expect and now they're running out and yet the unemployment rate then the
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:47.960]  number of unemployed people continued to rise so there's so many let them eat
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:57.120]  cake statements that I think that the result has to be a revolution well
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.640]  doctor going over this we also see the establishment involved in a race to the
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.520]  bottom now that they do realize that the debt is mathematically impossible to
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.840]  pay back they are accelerating their looting they're accelerating their
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:20.600]  their cutthroat strip mining of society they kind of have a nihilistic you
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.240]  know party attitude of eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die I mean I'm
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.480]  seeing that not just in the truly wealthy or the controllers but I'm seeing it in
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.600]  yuppies and people you know who are not making 200,000 a year now they're making
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:41.960]  100,000 but they seem to be getting even more crazy and so it I mean this does
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:49.680]  look like Rome in its declining years well yes yes it is except the
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:57.240]  Rome's decline took a century or two and I think I was will be much more rapid you
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:05.040]  know rather than for me to try to speculate let me just point out how the
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.320]  economic information that's released for example the information released today
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:18.280]  how it deceives us for example Alex they reported that that we've had a an
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:26.360]  increase in housing starts in July well the way they got this increase and
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:34.440]  housing starts in July is that there was a massive downward revision of the
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:41.680]  housing starts that they proclaimed in June so they said more housing starts
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.480]  that occurred in June than dead so this month the revision in the June number
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.680]  downward then produces an increase in the July number do you see what I'm
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:59.440]  saying if they had not altered the June number then this month we would have had
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:05.120]  a decline in housing starts now they do that every month they they they give you
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.760]  good news and in the next month they secretly take it away they downward
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:13.960]  revise it and that then produces another month but what's happening it now is and
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:19.960]  I want you to speak to this place sir is reality is colliding with their Alice
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:26.880]  in Wonderland false reality and so the system is losing all credibility and I
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:31.680]  do see forms of peaceful revolution taking place take Arizona without any
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.840]  concerted organized effort in the last two years seen at news the Arizona
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:43.360]  Republic and others report that over 96% of people refuse to pay them or even
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:47.800]  show up and the system tried to threaten them and make examples but finally
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.840]  gave in and pulled all the cameras out so I mean that right there is an example
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:00.840]  of just non-compliance yes I suspect that non-compliance will rise as people
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:06.600]  lose resources they lose the ability to comply and they also lose their
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:12.160]  confidence in the government and and therefore they lose their willingness to
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:16.400]  comply so when you don't have the ability or the willingness then
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:24.040]  compliance has to fall that let me give you another example of of the way
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:29.440]  economic statistics mislead also today they announced that industrial
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:38.080]  production was up 1% and this led to a rise in the stock market but if you look
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:45.640]  at why is industrial production up 1% it's largely due I believe to the fact
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:50.440]  that all the disruptions in automobile production over the last year or two
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:56.040]  about GM's bankruptcy about the insolvency I think it's Chrysler you
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.880]  know everything was disrupted to the extent that just getting back to
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:10.360]  stability produces statistically a rise in industrial production another way
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.840]  they get rises in industrial production is they use as a as a way of measuring
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:22.800]  it power usage so if power usage is high they assume industrial output is
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:28.400]  rising but of course what when you have these massive heat waves what happens
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.080]  sure it's August and that's always the biggest of power consumption so they
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.200]  won't look at the months before or the months after they put it out there
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.840]  falsely as a trend well here's an example it's a monthly that's right it's a
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:44.080]  monthly report that they put out well I mean you know how they manipulate you
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.880]  know the cost earnings ratio you know a lot more than I do as an economist how
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.160]  all this works but I mean just to simply look at it Dr. Roberts what was it 15
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.800]  years ago they changed the rules where a hamburger place gets a manufacturing
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:04.840]  credit for putting cheese on a you know a piece of meat and and and putting
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:10.640]  bread on it and so here at my office simply making films and packaging them
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.560]  and shipping them I get the manufacturing credit I mean I take that
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:18.720]  credit but I'm not really manufacturing under the classical sense so they're
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:24.360]  changing definitions that's right that's exactly right Alex there's probably
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:29.720]  many more of these things than you or I are aware of and but I just wanted to
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:36.800]  give you and your listeners the two examples from today's economic reports
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:44.280]  to show how misleading they can be and so I think it's going to be a little bit
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:50.080]  longer I can't say how much longer before people or very many people catch
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:56.360]  on of course some people know already and have known for some time but even if
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:02.640]  you know you you suggested that perhaps the elite themselves realized that it's
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.640]  all the wealth but I'm not so sure because today's stock market rose
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:13.760]  substantially on the basis of good news which is consists of statistical
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:21.920]  artifacts that that aren't real so I'm not sure that people have caught on or
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.760]  that the elite have caught on generally the elite are so full of hubris and
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:35.960]  self-confidence and arrogance and revels so much in their power that they
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:41.760]  don't catch on they get stripped away and they're surprised and what happened
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:45.440]  no historically you're right dr. Robert stay there we're going to break I want
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:50.640]  to come back and go more into your excellent piece the ecstasy of empire
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.480]  and that hubris you're talking about and how you talk about we're almost past
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.200]  the point of no return what is that point of no return we'll be right back
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.000]  attention this is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.920]  back taxes to the IRS the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:12.520]  people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed due to
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:16.200]  the financial crisis in America the IRS has announced a leniency plan in
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:19.720]  recognition of consumers financial troubles in today's economy if you owe
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:24.120]  $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS an open phone line has been established

[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:33.800]  reduction by up to 75% never to call is 800 902 6969 again the IRS is now
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:37.480]  accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:41.400]  to the decline in today's economy if you are struggling with $10,000 or more in
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:45.160]  back taxes to the IRS you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by

[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:06.240]  attention what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.720]  nature a similar audacity called GMO or genetically modified organisms means
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.320]  that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.120]  in the balance now that summers here what better time to learn about the bounty

[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.760]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.440]  real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:16.160]  it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.920]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and solutions from
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:24.440]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:29.360]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.400]  dr roberts will be with us 15 minutes from the next hour I'm gonna cover a
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:14.760]  bunch of news and take your phone calls but the mere fact that so many radio
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:18.320]  stations are now turning the show on instead of getting one or two new
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.400]  affiliates a month over the years and then stations are bought and sold you
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.960]  lose some we're now getting two three four a week and these are big stations
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:31.720]  in the biggest cities the fact that the drudge report would pick up your story
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:37.240]  from info wars.com the fact that I mean a lot of people I talked to that are
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:41.320]  middle-class and nouveau riche working-class they are getting it now I
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:45.800]  agree with you the hubris filled super elites the ruling class a lot of them
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:52.080]  are very delusional but you spoke about the revolution in 1917 1918 and of
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:57.480]  course you're right you know as a researcher that the people rebelled then
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.360]  the communists came in from Germany England in New York and took it over and
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:05.200]  I see that is the great danger Ron Paul has said that that during this crisis
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.200]  we've got to be more active than ever so that people with horrible ideas don't
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:15.920]  use the crisis to get more control dr roberts that's right we there's no way
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:25.560]  to there's no way to predict the outcome of that and being vigilant but that
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:31.120]  requires organization which doesn't exist either so I don't know what we can do
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:36.920]  other than rejoice that it will sweep away the current the current bad crop it
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:41.840]  may give us the worst crop on the other hand the people may provide the kind of
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:46.280]  leadership at the time that's needed but Alex let's rather than speculate on
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:50.120]  these things let's let's talk about because you want to know you wanted to
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:58.080]  know at what point do we hit the point of no return yes can't get out of the
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:05.360]  crisis and as I've emphasized many times with you on your show the the big
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:11.080]  crisis is when do we lose the dollar as reserve currency and when can the federal
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.120]  government no longer finance its huge budget deficit except by printing money
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:23.280]  now so and I've made the point over and over you can finance a four or five
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:29.000]  hundred billion dollar deficit but you can't finance one that's one trillion
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.920]  four or five hundred billion and we've now into the second year of one and a
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:40.200]  half trillion dollar deficits how they being financed I think they're being
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:46.200]  financed in the following ways and the the flight of individual investors from
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:53.760]  stocks into what they regard as safe government bonds that's one way it's
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:59.040]  being financed now that can't go on forever once people have fled the stock
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.880]  market I don't mean the big money managing firm firms and the pension
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:10.440]  firms but the individuals they they are leaving they've left the other way the
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:16.200]  budget deficit is being financed is through the federal reserves purchase of
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:23.960]  all of the bad paper the subprime derivatives and so forth that the banks
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.680]  got themselves stuck with the Fed simply bought that from them gave them bank
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:34.080]  reserves and the banks use those bank reserves to buy the government bonds so
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.280]  that's the second way it's being financed again this can't go on forever
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:44.480]  either what what what's the well the feds now announced they're gonna start
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:51.680]  monetizing correct yes but what they were what they're talking about is what
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:57.000]  they're already doing they're going to buy financial instruments from the banks
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.080]  hoping that the banks then use the excess reserves to lend but of course
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:07.520]  they won't because there are no credit worthy borrowers and so if that doesn't
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:12.920]  lead to money creation the banks have to respond to that you see by creating new
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.960]  demand deposits making loans but they haven't been doing that instead they
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:24.480]  use the excess reserves to buy more treasury bonds so now the third way now
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:31.080]  third way the government is used is the Greek crisis stay there doctor we've

[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:46.840]  worlds tells how this country is why this country is disintegrating okay dr.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.560]  Roberts you're getting into the third way they plan to finance all of this at
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:55.480]  the point of no return go ahead all right it was it's the Greek crisis you know
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:00.800]  the Greeks it got heavily in debt and so the New York investment banks and the
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:08.320]  hedge funds you know made a run on them it caused the Greek crisis and then the
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.720]  New York investment banks and hedge funds multiplied the Greek crisis into
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:21.720]  the euro crisis and the financial press of course became an adjunct to the
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:27.520]  treasurer's financing needs and they spread all over that all the euro is
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:32.760]  going the euro won't last and the euro collapsed dramatically against the
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:39.320]  dollar well this caused all kinds of individuals and foreign central banks
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.840]  who had been holding euros as reserves as an alternative to the dollar to flee
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:50.320]  the euro and flee into the dollar that means buying treasury bonds so the
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:55.960]  United States government was able to use its financial its private financial
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:03.640]  apparatus to finance its deficit by drawing funds out of Europe but you
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:09.280]  said at the time it wouldn't last and it didn't no it doesn't but you see they
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:18.600]  may next start on Spain and Ireland and Portugal so they can keep it going and
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:26.720]  as long as they have some country in the EU that's sufficiently indebted that
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:31.680]  that the financial press can can create the image of a disaster and that the
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:37.040]  hedge funds and the investment banks you can make money by shorting or driving
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:44.800]  down so as long as they can produce these flights of fear from other
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:50.040]  countries holdings and from other currencies into the dollar they can
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:55.160]  keep this going but of course it is limited it can't go on forever and so
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:01.000]  what I think is the way they're playing this game is that the decline of the
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  United States will be sudden because the minute is no longer any way to finance
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.800]  the deficit it means they have to print the money the minute they do that the
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.680]  dollars no longer the reserve currency what about China that I see them hyping
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.360]  that China is going to have a depression and I see them talking about trying to
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:26.160]  manipulate China but China is our biggest holder and I've seen China getting
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:32.560]  angry devaluing the US treasuries and EU treasuries in the last month well
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.320]  that's that's correct and today there's an article on global research about we
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:44.720]  keep trying to provoke them militarily and we're making them very angry if you
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:48.680]  if you think about the behavior of the United States government it is irrational
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.560]  and it does look to be desperate I don't think they will would succeed in
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.920]  driving assets out of China into into the United States I don't think that's
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:10.080]  possible and but who knows nevertheless when they no longer can produce a flow
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:17.240]  into dollars or into US Treasury bonds out of some fear or some hyped crisis
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:23.120]  that's when the financing problem hits and that's when the dollar ceases to be
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:27.760]  the reserve currency and the minute that happens we can't pay our import bill
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:34.560]  and so the supply of goods and services in the United States from abroad are
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:40.560]  greatly curtailed and this of course includes petroleum Dr. Roberts we've got

[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.280]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:20.640]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:24.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:29.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:33.400]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:37.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:41.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:31.840]  spreading the word about the radio broadcast the films our guest the
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:35.280]  information we cover don't forget the free iPhone app even if you don't have

[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:44.160]  they want when they want and there's the free podcast at info wars.com we're
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:48.680]  talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and he was getting into all these news stories
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:53.440]  saying China wants to attack the US China's our enemy we've got to get ready
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:58.040]  they may attack us that's in the Associated Press today that the Pentagon says
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:03.960]  China may launch an attack now they're Al Qaeda after these very same corporate
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.480]  globalist had tax incentives and everything they could to move everything
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.800]  offshore not for free trade but to cannibalize our economy now more and
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.160]  more we've got to go into Pakistan we've got to attack Iran Bolton says eight
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:22.360]  days and now he says three days in the Jerusalem post now we've got to have war
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:27.840]  with Syria we've got to we've got to do it the media says Al Qaeda is about to
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:31.840]  hit and Obama is gonna have to take your rights we can really see them playing
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:38.800]  the false flag card I had former top-level CIA analyst David McMichael
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:42.680]  on earlier and he agreed he said we're in the prime danger of the government
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:49.680]  staging a terror attack so Dr. Roberts speaking about Iran China all of this and
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:53.560]  the method to their madness but they're now trying to pick fights with people
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.480]  that have hundreds if not thousands of nuclear weapons Pakistan's got more than
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:03.520]  20 with the medium range delivery systems China's got conservatively 2000 I
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.560]  mean this I mean these people may in the world I mean look at Cheney launching
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:11.800]  the attack through the proxy Georgia against the Russian-held South Ossetia
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:20.480]  and Abkhazia I mean they really are lunatics exactly the lunatics dangerous
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:25.280]  lunatics and they're playing all the fear cards it's you know it's just like
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:30.600]  George Orwell's 1984 big brother there was everywhere or at least the people
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.760]  are told they are we you know you never really know in the book whether those
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:40.520]  wars exist or they're just propaganda to keep the people under control but their
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:46.720]  lunatics that's exactly the case Alex let me add I left out one other way they
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.760]  can keep us financing of the go of the deficit going for another year and that
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:58.080]  is they can confiscate part of our remaining private pensions on the
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:03.360]  grounds that they are accumulating tax-free and that they shouldn't be
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:09.640]  tax-free so they can do that also they could require the pension fund managers
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:16.480]  to use our pensions to purchase treasury bonds so that's another financing
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:22.440]  means they have that I suspect they will resort to as they get a more desperate
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:26.160]  well to interrupt you said that here on this show three years ago it's now
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:29.920]  Bloomberg admits three months ago that that the feds are ordering private
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:34.080]  pension funds to quote invest in failed banks the Chicago Tribune said oh the
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:37.640]  state has changed the law and they gave the subsection I read it on area
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:42.000]  yesterday where the state doesn't have to give state workers their pension I
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.960]  mean I mean if they try that you talk about a recipe for revolution yes it's
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:53.840]  it's more of the let them eat Kate if you look at people who whose pensions
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:59.680]  were hurt by the dot-com bubble by the real estate bubble by the subprime
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.040]  derivative bubble they haven't got that much left so if they come in and and
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:09.480]  leave a tax on the pensions on the grounds that they haven't been taxed or
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.400]  they require the pension fund managers to use the pensions to buy a worthless
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:20.920]  government paper that's more provocation and more reason that I think
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:25.640]  Salente's point that when people have nothing left to lose they lose it and
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.720]  that's generally when you get a revolution now to get back to your
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:36.040]  your your point I really don't think the United States military wants to have a
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:41.200]  war with Iran they certainly don't want to have one with China the people
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:44.960]  pushing this or the or the neoconservatives who have this sort of
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:50.560]  empire ideology who they're totally unrealistic we haven't the resources for
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:56.800]  an empire and and the military security complex they push it because they have
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:01.960]  the profits on munitions and the in the war planes and everything else and of
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:05.600]  course they're related to the Pentagon but the generals themselves or at least
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:11.320]  most of them have I think too much sense and they've not they've not been very
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:16.720]  supportive of the notion of attacking Iran if you notice carefully statements
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:21.280]  of the top generals you don't find a whole lot of support yeah mullen has
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:26.640]  even told the Israelis it's nuts Fox Fallon refused and resigned three years
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:33.480]  ago or two years ago so it's incredible so they certainly won't want to
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:39.880]  starting to start anything with China it's not quite it's not clear to me
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:43.480]  that China would even have to fight that they could probably defeat us just by
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.800]  dumping their two trillion dollars worth of US assets because that would be the
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:54.280]  end of the dollar so what do you see in closing as the final bubble to pop I
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:58.920]  mean are you saying it's going to be the Treasury note bubble the final bubble
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:04.680]  to pop is when they cannot finance the government deficit except by printing
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:09.800]  money now when when the Federal Reserve directly buys the bond the new
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:15.080]  government bonds it pays for them by creating checking accounts for the
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:20.080]  Treasury which the Treasury immediately spins so that money goes directly into
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.360]  circulation it's different from when the Federal Reserve buys bonds from the
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:29.720]  banks relying on the banks to use the reserves to make loans and to create
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.360]  money that way but when the banks don't have any credit worthy customers to lend
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:39.280]  to they just sit on the reserves but if they buy the new bonds directly from the
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:43.800]  Treasury the money directly goes into circulation and starts driving up
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.880]  prices and I think the deficit is going to be much bigger next year because the
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.320]  economy is not recovering it's gonna in my opinion opinion of Gerald Salenty and
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:59.400]  opinion of John Williams who's the part of the best statistician on this we're
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:05.320]  we're about to move down substantially further so the budget deficit has to be
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:10.920]  financed will be bigger than one and a half trillion and a war a war would be
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:15.600]  politically expedient for the election but not good for the deficit correct
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:21.280]  it can't finance the war they can't finance the current deficit except by
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:25.600]  the way the means that I gave you and they're all short-term and some of them
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:31.200]  such as confiscating people's pensions will produce more revolution more
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:37.320]  more tendency toward non-compliance so I think that they're out far and a limb
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:41.040]  and they were let out there by the arrogance of the neocons and
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.640]  neoconservatives by the complicity of the mainstream media by the other
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:52.080]  stupidity of the Congress and by the greed of the military security complex
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.440]  and Wall Street and that's why we're in this fix that is the only reason when
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.360]  though those are the reasons that we're in this fix and in a fix one small
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:05.480]  caveat we're gonna let you go we appreciate your time we saw that the
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:12.000]  Harvard endowment dumped all of their Israeli stock holdings and then some
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.520]  Muslim groups came out and said oh that's because the Israeli boycott that's
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.320]  picking up steam worldwide but Harvard just said no we don't see this as good
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.760]  investments but that can't be a good omen to not just see Harvard but other
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:30.200]  big institutions racing away from Israel yes yes well I you know if if any
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:33.980]  country on earth is paying themselves in a worse corner than we have it's
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:43.440]  Israel and that's hubris hubris and and just total disregard for anyone but

[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:55.280]  and we're trying to educate people a lot of folks are waking up and you know the
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:59.320]  fact that again people like the dredge report and zero hedge are picking up our
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:05.000]  stories shows that the awakening is accelerating but regardless people got to
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  protect themselves and I give the advice that I heed myself guns gold and
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:17.360]  God you know getting self-sufficient getting healthy being informed getting
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.760]  into gold and silver with all this happening in the economy you bought the
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:25.480]  gold when it went down as we said the fall coming up it's only gonna go up
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:30.840]  that's what the trends show this dollar devaluation accelerating people need to
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.520]  get into precious metals and this is the deal this is a great deal you know
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:39.320]  Alex I got to say that it is and you're exactly right I just don't know of any
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:46.520]  other solution to hedging your bet and and ensuring your future financially I
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:50.840]  mean the United States dollar is gonna be doomed like Paul Craig's Roberts said
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:56.120]  when the federal government turns to the Federal Reserve system to finance its
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:00.360]  expenditures they spend that money into the economy that's Argentina that's
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:05.560]  Mexico that's Nigeria we know where this goes and and China's trying to get away
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:09.000]  from the dollar right now they're threatening that and and like I said
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.160]  that CBO document man if you if people haven't seen that they should call us
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:16.800]  right now just for that alone I don't care if you buy gold and silver you
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.360]  should see what the government has published and this is the congressional
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:25.520]  budget office and their title to it is the federal debt and risk of financial
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:30.240]  crises and they make a parallel they they compare us to Argentina and Greece
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.760]  right in this home that that's our government document coming out of our
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:39.040]  congressional office meanwhile the media is telling us everything's wonderful
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:43.640]  Ted what about silver list the coins that are massively discounted that you've
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:46.920]  got available so folks when they call for the special know what they're coming
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.080]  for oh absolutely I really think that people should be taking advantage of
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:55.960]  that walking Liberty half at 975 the bags of junk silver right now are at a
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:59.680]  great buy I'm just trying to think of all the different things those Lakota
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.200]  rounds we have the silver rounds the regular ones I mean there's a whole long
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.640]  list of different items the bars of silver I mean we just came out of the
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:12.200]  summer and you know what I don't know Alex if we'll get the opportunity to buy
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:17.240]  gold again at that 1180 dollars an ounce and that's over down there at that 15
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:24.040]  and a half 16 and then pass those savings on 800 686 2237 out of all the
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.760]  deals I've seen is the Frank still the best or is it the sovereign well the
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.440]  Frank with the full-year subscription to the international forecaster is going
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:36.200]  to be dollar-for-dollar the best value if you're just buying them straight up
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:40.320]  maybe the sovereign might be just pennies less than the Frank but still I mean
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:43.760]  that if you're getting a full-year subscription to that newsletter I don't
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:46.360]  know how you can beat that but the sovereigns of the Franks are both a
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:50.480]  good buy you know the buffaloes the Eagles I mean you name it I mean
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:53.600]  everything is at a bargain right now because we just came out of the summer
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.480]  and it always happens that the gold and silver sees its softness we passed that
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.160]  time period now now we have September October November let's remember that a
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:09.720]  month and a half ago the private central banks the IMF particularly sold into the
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:15.720]  market as much gold is is produced in mind in a year admittedly trying to
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.320]  drive down the price because gold competes with their fiat paper and it
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:25.400]  didn't even knock a dent in it golds right back where it was silver's racing
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:29.720]  back to where it was so people can literally get in a time machine and go
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:34.160]  back to the price of gold two three weeks ago and buy it now with all those
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:41.000]  savings factored in it's a win win win win win 800 686 2237 I've also got some

[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:59.400]  air hey Alex how you doing I'm all right my friend we're making headway against
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:05.280]  the globalist yeah I just want to I got a question about this recent bill
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:11.040]  Senate bill at 510 yes so that starts to ban people having their own gardens
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:13.960]  and selling their own food to each other what do you think this is a free
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:17.440]  country you think you're allowed to sell food to your neighbor you're a
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:21.720]  prisoner and in a giant prison prisoners aren't allowed to sell things to each
[02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:31.080]  other right and I emailed senator and Andrew Crenshaw about this issue let me
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:36.840]  guess they told you it didn't exist no actually he emailed me back and said it
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:44.560]  was they passed it it was HR 87 875 now in fact I had that in my stack yesterday
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:47.920]  today I didn't cover it guys will you print for me it's mainstream and I'll
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:52.720]  turn to the media reporting on it bill bands selling food to each other and it
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:56.320]  just more harassment written by the big agribusiness to shut down small farms
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.800]  and ranches they're calling in major cities like Tulsa Oklahoma to make you
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:04.760]  get a license to have a garden because you might grow marijuana again prisoners
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:08.960]  don't get to grow things in their backyard that's what al-qaeda does you
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.240]  don't you've got to be dependent on you don't collect rainwater they're passing
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:16.960]  laws everywhere to do that you are going to be bankrupt and worship the
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.320]  government 90% of people were self-sufficient in the great depression
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:25.680]  7 million starved to death according to university studies now 90 plus percent
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:30.160]  are urban or aren't self-sufficient and the government's doing everything it can
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:35.200]  to make sure you can't be self-sufficient but how can he pass that
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:39.280]  without the people approval well now they're gonna try to implement it it's
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:43.160]  kind of like campaign finance reform said talk show host six weeks before an
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:48.360]  election couldn't talk about policies we all just ignore it but you know they're
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:51.400]  a pack of criminals I mean how could they do anything they do Lewis I
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:57.720]  appreciate your call they're a pack of complete scum I mean what did congressman
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:02.480]  start say he said the federal government can do whatever it wants to you you have
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:07.480]  no rights and started giggling and laughing it's enjoyable for him he's
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:13.360]  your owner he's a bucket of pus and he's gonna make you give him a big wet
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:21.440]  kiss let's talk to Mike in Florida you're on the air hey Alex hey buddy I had a
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:28.760]  couple of questions for you okay go ahead sir how can the government keep
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:34.400]  changing the value of gold when they want to and how can they keep spending
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:40.360]  trillions like how much is really the gold and for it not worth at this point
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:44.360]  well they won't I mean there hasn't been a accounting of that gold in more than
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:48.560]  60 years the word is there's very little gold there they're just a display area
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:55.800]  and the big central banks can create unlimited money to go in and short the
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:00.560]  paper gold market to try to manipulate the physical market and there's some
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:03.560]  other ways they do it but there's even been congressional hearings on that and
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:07.640]  securities and exchange commission hearings on that we've had guests on
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.480]  who've been part of those hearings but overall they're not able to manipulate it
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:18.240]  it continues to go up what's happened to all this gold in the history of all the
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.040]  you know robberies of gold and all these boards of gold from these different
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:29.120]  places where is it gone is as it evaporated or no the elites the big
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:32.920]  central banks are the biggest owners of it they hoard it and they'll also do
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:37.120]  sales of the gold to each other but won't really sell it it's a paper sale
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:41.440]  then they'll switch it back later they'll sell it for reduced price you know
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:45.760]  massive tonnage and then a month later to drive gold down they'll sell it back
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.120]  at reduced price and then that scene is the market as that it's devalued but
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:55.920]  it's all smoke and mirrors all right one last question why should the American
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:02.000]  people obey the laws of a joke government where their priority is on
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  government dependency instead of self dependency for the individual well I
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:13.360]  mean the system wants us to be dependent but what's your question why should the
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.880]  people obey these laws when the government of like in those 12 states
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:22.600]  where you can't you know photograph police officers but they hold you
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:27.360]  accountable at for everything but they they're gonna take you and they're
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:32.160]  gonna surveil you without warrants but if you film your own house and they come
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:35.200]  they then arrest you and there's not even a law in those 12 states they're
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.320]  misappropriating there they're misapplying a wiretapping law and they
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:46.400]  know it no I mean the government is rogue it's criminal and the police are
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:49.640]  just where the rubber meets the road they're the extension of the tyranny
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:53.000]  most of them really aren't even bad people a lot of them are waking up but
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.840]  this is tyranny I mean how did Hitler do what he did how did Stalin now Julius
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:01.840]  Caesar Pol Pot that El Castro I mean they just do it I Vlad the impaler they
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:05.440]  just do it I appreciate your call good points Mike Jim in Oregon you're on the
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:13.080]  air sir hello Alex free man to have an obligation to overcome other men that
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:18.880]  wouldn't slave us and it seems to me that the China trade is one of the
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:24.920]  biggest in slave mits going on they got these dormitory factories over there
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:29.800]  were basically the workers whole life is controlled by the fact no that's
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:34.520]  associated press and that's not your opinion about half the population in
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.360]  the major cities are locked up at night and they live in tiny cubicles and
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:43.280]  work on average 15 hours a day and they have to put nets all around the
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:47.520]  factories because in some weeks hundreds commit suicide and now they're
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.880]  talking about drugging them or giving them vaccines that will turn them into
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:56.120]  biological androids and the media is like don't worry we're gonna give the
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:01.200]  Chinese worker shots that were viruses that help their brain actually attacks
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:05.160]  it and it's just oh we'll give you an injection no more pain and that doesn't
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:08.640]  freak yuppies out yuppies can't wait to march their 10-year-old and who's
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.600]  upset about life and inject them with a brain damage and chemical they love it
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.600]  I mean they just love death they're begging for mass death and so they're
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.320]  gonna get total enslavement like the Chinese slaves they want it they need
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:25.800]  it and they're going to get it they need it and they want it and they're going
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:30.560]  to get it I'm sorry American labor should not have to compete against slave
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:36.240]  labor or near slave labor to me that's a moral issue I think that is the one
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:40.880]  issue this China deal you've spoken to it written about it it's the one issue
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.680]  that frankly a lot of Americans can relate to because we've been off-shoring
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:51.280]  jobs just like your guests has been talking about for a long time now jobs
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:56.560]  that would have been created in America are being created in China there China
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:03.120]  systematically creating a family coming out with shots that'll make you be
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:10.440]  happy and not be upset please don't be with al-qaeda John please lobby the FDA

[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:55.600]  kind of domination al-qaeda talk no free man that resists slavery talk no it's
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.360]  totally normal to have the government media promoting injections that'll make
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:03.800]  you never get upset again with viruses that attack your brain everything's
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:08.960]  fine Jim I appreciate your call that was an extremist ladies and gentlemen did
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:13.160]  you hear him raise his voice becoming upset if CPS heard him raise his voice
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:16.560]  they may have to take his children they now take your children for raising your
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:22.920]  oh oh it's loving everything's fine the water's good naftan gatter good
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:28.600]  Goldman Sachs is good Obama's good everything's good oh let's talk to
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:32.440]  Robert and see if he's an al-qaeda operative Robert and West Virginia go
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:40.920]  ahead hi Alex I guess I would be an al-qaeda if that's the terminology yeah
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:44.080]  you don't want to take it a vaccine that brain damages your al-qaeda go ahead
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:53.000]  al-qaeda I want to introduce a a new terminology into the political lingo I
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:59.800]  know the majority of the info war is about semantics and what I like to do
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:04.400]  is I'd like to stop the double-fank you're getting fancy with words now
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:09.400]  that's al-qaeda I like to stop the double-fank of using the term illegal
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:15.960]  immigration that's a double-fank term I want to rename it and everybody to
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:22.480]  rename it mechs offender they're a mechs offender this majority of the
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:27.040]  illegals are Mexican they're mechs offenders when people hear mechs
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:32.880]  offender it's where it reminds them of sex offender and they become disgusted
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:39.760]  they need to use that term well my issue is Mexico is a failed state I want
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:44.240]  them to have a free society and not use the United States as a steam valve and
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:47.960]  then the big foundations Bill and Melinda Gates on record Ford Foundation
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:53.640]  billions of dollars in bringing in a foreign group and not inducting them
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:58.880]  into freedom but inducting them into globalism that's what's dangerous but
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:04.120]  that is an interesting point about 80% of the illegals are from Mexico and
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:07.960]  they've lost wars with the US they're taught that the US is evil they're
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.360]  taught that that's part of a reconquista we don't have these issues with other
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:14.480]  Latin American immigrants though the foundations are trying to hype them up
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:18.280]  against the United States you go to these rallies with illegal aliens waving
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:21.800]  the Mexican flags and chanting you know we're taking over it's it's it's the
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:26.880]  Mexicans the problem is there's for my study no more patriotic hard-working
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:33.440]  intelligent group than Mexicans who will tell you I'm an American okay and and
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:37.120]  so it's just a very sad situation they want us all of each other's throats but
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:40.360]  that's an interesting point of semantics you raised Robert you're thinking too
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:43.880]  much Robert you need to just take your vaccine take this new shot they're
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:47.160]  coming out with and everything's gonna be fine you want to learn more about it
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.280]  on a serious note Google brain-eating vaccines Alex Jones you can watch the

[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:39.280]  this year there were 30 40 or 50% losses for many years beekeepers have been
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:43.120]  plagued by colony collapse disorder which formerly healthy bees abruptly
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.720]  vanished from their hives the number of bee hives the United States dropped 32%
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:53.640]  2007 other 36% 2008 and 29% 2009 and the aggregate it's it's it's it's very close

[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:08.040]  programs aim to prevent tooth decaying communities where water is not sufficiently
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:12.280]  fluoridated there's not enough fluoride the Ohio Department of Health school
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:16.720]  based fluoride mouth rinse program will reinstate the upcoming school year so
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:19.360]  they're gonna cut food stamps but they got money for that fluoride because they
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:23.400]  care folks the health department suspended the program last year for state
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.200]  representatives passed a bill that required any prescription medications
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:28.960]  given to students in school to be administered by health professionals
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:32.560]  governor Ted Strickland signed legislation in May that made the exemption
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:37.440]  for fluoride mouth rinse and here's another one guess where your fluoride
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:42.760]  comes from China and we've talked a lot about this the majority some numbers
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.160]  are above 90% of fluoride coming into the US are from China with other poisons
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:52.480]  added and there's been newscast covering this but that's like saying you know the
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:55.840]  bullets we're shooting you in the head with they're coming from China not from
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:01.400]  America there's other poisons in there not just the regular poison I'm almost
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:07.520]  out of time but let's go to Aaron in Oklahoma Aaron you're on the air hey
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:12.000]  there Alex this is Aaron yeah I didn't I don't have anything to talk about for
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:18.320]  the bees or anything but I wanted to talk to you about specifically HR 192 and
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:23.320]  discharging debt I made the mistake of going to school at ITT tech of all
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:28.880]  places and I have been loaned by Otis Valley May and I'm wondering if you
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:33.080]  know if you heard of anyone actually been able to get away with discharging
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:38.160]  this debt using the uniform commercial code specifically HR 192 you know that's
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:42.280]  a very complex issue and I I'm not going to give financial advice on it that
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:46.640]  there's some reality to all that but mainly it's paid Patriot mythology and
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:51.160]  stuff that people make up now there's a lot of contract fraud in mortgages and
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:55.360]  things that companies do that's unlawful and so there is some success
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.480]  fighting it there but as for magically just doing something and it all goes
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:03.120]  away that's a good way to get in deep trouble I appreciate your call from my
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:06.880]  experience but you you figure it out for yourself let's talk to Rick and
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:11.320]  Michigan Rick you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I just had a quick question
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:18.040]  about the 2012 elections if you feel grand and Ron Paul would run and win it
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:23.800]  and if the elites are gonna engineer a third party that'd be crazy if you had a
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:30.000]  father-son ticket Ron Paul president Rand Paul vice president but Ron Paul's
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.240]  gonna run unless he has health problems and he's in pretty good shape I mean you
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:39.720]  I mean he hadn't told me that but he's you know he's gonna run just watch and
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:43.720]  I'll support that because bottom line he'll be able to educate tens of
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:48.160]  millions from those debates and that bully pulpit he's gonna have but at the
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:51.880]  same time I'd like to focus on the states and counties and cities where we
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:55.160]  can really take things back under the ninth and tenth amendment that's the
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:58:00.000]  main remedy for peaceful resistance to an out-of-control federal government and
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:03.200]  so that's where people need to have their focus not have 60% turnouts for
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:08.840]  federal elections and then 8% national average for local how about 60% local and
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:15.520]  60% or even higher national right right and last year on September 12th when
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:20.040]  they had CC was covering with over 2 million people that was marching at
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:26.240]  the Capitol yes and I mean it's about to be September 12th again and hopefully
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:30.440]  that I mean we'll have a better turnout this year resistance is a victory
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:34.400]  resistance is victory we're out of time for this hour you can always listen to
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:38.680]  the retransmission info wars.com great job to the crew two powerful
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:41.960]  guests coming up stay with us
