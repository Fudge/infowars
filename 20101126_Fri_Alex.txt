[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:31.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:41.600]  Congressman Ron Paul scores of newspapers are now picking up on the theme that I identified
[00:41.600 --> 00:50.280]  more than three weeks ago that this TSA issue may be the trigger that shows the people that
[00:50.280 --> 00:56.080]  they can stand up and say no to oppression the globalists know that it's a trigger for
[00:56.080 --> 01:02.200]  them if they're successful to train us to be dominated and put up with anything including
[01:02.200 --> 01:10.720]  forced inoculations DNA blood draw and cheek swab checkpoints on the highways this is all
[01:10.720 --> 01:15.600]  done from a psychological warfare perspective and they're trying to break our will and set
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.480]  the precedent that they're above the law now they civilly created these TSA groups back
[01:22.480 --> 01:31.080]  in 2002 and airports don't have to be part of this the problem is the same military
[01:31.080 --> 01:36.600]  industrial complex it's involved in taking over our society will put more bombs on airplanes
[01:36.600 --> 01:41.480]  if people don't submit to them and their plan is to then bomb malls and put checkpoints
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.400]  in malls and then bomb highways and put checkpoints on highways this is their mission creep just
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.720]  like al-qaeda is a set piece they move around the world wherever they want to invade it's
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.360]  like a throw down gun like a corrupt cop wants to kill you they blow your head off and throw
[01:59.360 --> 02:05.760]  a throw down gun on you and claim that you pulled it and it's some untraceable gun and
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.880]  that's what al-qaeda and the stage care and all of this is about we're told it's about
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.480]  extremist muslims and some of those do exist but then the system manufactures these fake
[02:15.480 --> 02:22.720]  ones as a pretext to control our lives so it's now being noticed all over the place
[02:22.720 --> 02:37.560]  that this is a giant groundswell of resistance and so it's a lot bigger than just the tsa
[02:37.560 --> 02:49.840]  and the airports it's a lot bigger than just that
[02:49.840 --> 02:56.800]  now we're not just going to cover tsa news today but there's a lot of important information
[02:56.800 --> 03:04.080]  that we will be covering that is unfolding on that front we do have the district attorney
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.040]  from out in san francisco area san mateo county joining us coming up later in the hour in
[03:10.040 --> 03:15.080]  fact he scheduled the next segment district attorney says feds are not above the law that's
[03:15.080 --> 03:21.120]  a quote and they are committing crimes when they grab people's genitals that's a felony
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.600]  when they go under the clothes and do it it's a misdemeanor when they do it on the outside
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.800]  according to california law and he says he will enforce it if the complaints come in
[03:30.800 --> 03:38.680]  also sanford airport to opt out of tsa screening and hire their own security firm and so there
[03:38.680 --> 03:45.720]  is an exodus away from this slave training that is going on ron paul has given an impassioned
[03:45.720 --> 03:53.520]  speech against it we're going to be playing that coming up a little bit later in the broadcast
[03:53.520 --> 03:59.680]  our headline is ron paul unleashes on tsa says enough is enough the drudge report actually
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.520]  has a link directly to the video we have that video also in our article but he's titled
[04:04.520 --> 04:08.640]  the video up there enough is enough that's what ron paul basically says ron paul also
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.520]  talks about how he's introduced a bill to make it illegal his tsa claims that they
[04:14.520 --> 04:18.920]  have this federal waiver to make them basically have to follow the same laws as everybody
[04:18.920 --> 04:24.000]  else so they'll be prosecuted when they do this but ron paul also talks about this is
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.520]  a big awakening people are finally revolting on this issue and it's up to us now whether
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.800]  we push this all the way through and bring down this chelcescu type system in a peaceful
[04:34.800 --> 04:41.720]  way but this is big now i got some really bad news coming up that we'll cover after
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.920]  we talk to the district attorney food safety bill clears key vote in the senate and so
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.160]  now they're putting it into a port rail package they say it's set to pass really horrible news

[06:34.400 --> 06:39.040]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[06:39.040 --> 06:43.200]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[06:43.200 --> 06:47.520]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[08:02.720 --> 08:24.320]  of political talk alex jones on the gcm radio network
[08:24.320 --> 08:33.080]  the revolt against the tsa radiation scanners the pat downs the hands in the pants actually
[08:33.080 --> 08:38.560]  touching the genitals that's now confirmed all over national news we had listeners talking
[08:38.560 --> 08:42.760]  about it you know last week and people couldn't believe it now they're going inside the pants
[08:42.760 --> 08:49.200]  it's always more more more the revolt is going into full swing ron paul is introducing federal
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.600]  legislation in congress next monday he made the announcement today is coming on the show
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.200]  as well next week to talk about it that he's going to try to get rid of the quote federal
[08:59.200 --> 09:08.880]  exemption and make this illegal so that they're not above the law we have wdbo television
[09:08.880 --> 09:15.760]  says sanford airport to opt out of tsa screening this is no law this is all civil and basically
[09:15.760 --> 09:22.400]  what the tsa is saying is hey it's like los vegas if you go and hire a prostitute to touch
[09:22.400 --> 09:29.000]  your private parts it's legal in nevada and they're saying when you buy a ticket you're
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.920]  consenting to come in here and basically have the tsa prostitutes put their hands on you
[09:34.920 --> 09:40.760]  because they're saying it's a service this is an act of dehumanization the next 15 minutes
[09:40.760 --> 09:49.160]  are so steve wagstaff who is the chief deputy d.a. he's now the d.a. elect going into office
[09:49.160 --> 09:56.400]  early next year of course he's in san mateo county that borders the san francisco bay
[09:56.400 --> 10:02.360]  area and some of the busiest airports in the country and he has said quote they are not
[10:02.360 --> 10:09.120]  above the law and that if they grab inside the pants or touch the genitals it's a felony
[10:09.120 --> 10:15.520]  on the outside that it is a misdemeanor and he says if the complaints come in that he is
[10:15.520 --> 10:22.840]  going to look at them and if they have merits he is going to prosecute and so we have d.a.
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.880]  elect steve wagstaff on with us from san mateo county they're in the bay area of california
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.400]  sir thanks for coming on with us thank you good morning break it down i mean well what's
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.080]  your concern here your statements made national attention other da's are starting to chime
[10:39.080 --> 10:44.040]  in state police are saying they believe what's happening is illegal how do we ever get here
[10:44.040 --> 10:49.040]  well the big difficulty is that you know if you give a certain amount of authority to
[10:49.040 --> 10:54.000]  an organization to try and keep it safe that's the original intent of the legislation when
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.480]  it gets taken further than what the intent is and what is necessary well then you get
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.080]  exactly what you just talked about you get people all over the country saying wait a
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.800]  second that's gone way beyond the line that's way too far and we're not going to take that
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.280]  and that's sort of what we're encountering these days i think and here in our county
[11:10.280 --> 11:14.960]  in san mateo county which is where the san francisco airport is located it's not in san
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.640]  francisco it's located in our county and any actions out there are crimes that occur out
[11:19.640 --> 11:24.640]  there they come through our office we've made it very clear that if anybody does these type
[11:24.640 --> 11:30.480]  of actions in touching whether doing it with what we call a lewd or sexual intent we will
[11:30.480 --> 11:36.480]  prosecute them the same as we would any other citizen or any other as i've said if a police
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.400]  officer in our county or any other county does something like that where they've gone
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.400]  beyond what's necessary for the job well that can be a crime and we're not going to simply
[11:44.400 --> 11:50.720]  say you get special treatment because of a position you're in we've also now seen reports
[11:50.720 --> 11:58.000]  confirmed of tsa agents planting fake cocaine and demanding reportedly sexual favors we've
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.760]  had tsa people go crazy in in los angeles and start announcing that they're god and
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.160]  then having to be restrained i mean a lot of these people are just wanting a job and do
[12:08.160 --> 12:13.520]  think they're protecting people but quite a few of them are really control freak folks
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.520]  who would be getting ten dollars an hour at seven eleven and now they're getting to abuse
[12:17.520 --> 12:24.480]  people and i personally was out in california sir just three weeks ago at the san jose
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.920]  airport and all i watched for twenty minutes was women and children sent through the scanners
[12:28.920 --> 12:34.720]  no men and i did watch babies with men and women putting their hands between their legs
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.120]  and i watched men doing it to women i mean this is unprecedented that is unprecedented
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.080]  that's done standard rule for police officers throughout the nation is you don't do cross
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.480]  gender type of touching in that area you stay certainly within the gender at a minimum when
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.560]  it's called for when it's necessary you're right when you when you decide to take it
[12:54.560 --> 12:59.280]  a different direction say we don't care about cross gender we'll have men touching women
[12:59.280 --> 13:03.560]  in private parts well i think most people do feel you know what that's gone way beyond
[13:03.560 --> 13:07.880]  the authority that's needed we can still keep our airport safe without needing to go to
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.200]  that direction well i live in texas but i've also seen the federal code i've looked up
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.760]  the california laws and it's pretty much the same all across the country unless it's
[13:16.760 --> 13:22.680]  an emergency situation a police officer can't touch your crotch even through the clothes
[13:22.680 --> 13:28.120]  and if they have to because it's an arrest situation they call the same gender because
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.960]  statistically and psychologically on average that's less traumatic but now we have confirmed
[13:32.960 --> 13:38.880]  reports in front of witnesses in amorello texas of pulling the woman's blouse down with her
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.040]  breast exposed running their hands through her hair men coming over and saying tsa hey
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.320]  honey after she went to the gate you know i can't wait to go look at the video of that
[13:50.320 --> 13:57.720]  i mean this is this is something that's gotten way out of control and and and and the fact
[13:57.720 --> 14:04.080]  that tsa has tried to brazenly just say let them eat cake and ignore the public sentiment
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.800]  i don't think i've ever seen such a grassroots revolt but also a revolt by members of congress
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.360]  i mean people are angry you know what if what you just described for me have you know pulling
[14:14.360 --> 14:20.160]  a woman's blouse um blouse down touching her breast in that fashion hands through the hair
[14:20.160 --> 14:24.040]  that case came into our office that person would be in our courts be um and being called
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.120]  a defendant that you can't do that that's clearly being done for a lewd lascivious purpose
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.240]  that's unacceptable in every state and in our federal government throughout this country
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.880]  it's not acceptable if the whole concept of what you mentioned a moment ago is that we
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.360]  very carefully train our police officers um anybody in that category and what we do is
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.160]  we know that on occasion there are exceptions we've a number of years ago prosecuted a
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.600]  police officer because he stopped a car with two young women in it and he then put saying
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.760]  he was just doing a pat down he fondled their breasts we prosecuted it convicted him for
[14:58.760 --> 15:03.400]  it punished him and he lost his job as an officer there is nothing anywhere that says
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.840]  tsa is uh has a different standard they have the same standard that we impose on our officers
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.360]  on our dentists our doctors everybody who has reason to touch somebody in any profession
[15:14.360 --> 15:18.760]  if they go beyond what is the reasonable acceptable line well that can be at a minimum
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.680]  a civil issue and potentially a criminal issue that we deal with well the san francisco airport
[15:24.680 --> 15:29.360]  i know it's one of the busiest airports in the nation uh and i've seen polls and roiders
[15:29.360 --> 15:36.680]  of up to 96 percent are against this and so i would imagine that you probably are going
[15:36.680 --> 15:41.520]  uh to get some complaints i think we may see some complaints on the other side of it what
[15:41.520 --> 15:47.240]  we're hoping does not occur is that people become so angry that they engage in conduct
[15:47.240 --> 15:52.440]  then or take it angry and they punch one of the tsa people that could then get referred
[15:52.440 --> 15:57.000]  to us to decide hey if they've committed a battery against a tsa person as to that we
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.520]  don't want that to happen we want people to deal with this in a civil and appropriate
[16:00.520 --> 16:05.520]  manner but we understand the anger completely that is uh something that is fairly stunning
[16:05.520 --> 16:11.520]  what's going on these days well there was just a case of a individual in indiana who
[16:11.520 --> 16:17.320]  is a handicap he has a colostomy bag and the report is that he was being made fun of in
[16:17.320 --> 16:21.920]  the scanners and he got mad and punched the guy in the chest and he's been arrested but
[16:21.920 --> 16:26.080]  i mean that's kind of like coming in and finding your wife with another man it doesn't start
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.560]  because i mean i'm not saying people should do it with any forethought but isn't isn't
[16:30.560 --> 16:37.720]  it i mean going to be a crime of passion if someone grabs a man's genitals or someone
[16:37.720 --> 16:43.800]  grabs a man's wife's genitals and the man gets mad i mean yes yes alice that's a case
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.080]  that we know it as a prosecutor's office uh we never would condone it we don't want people
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.320]  doing it but we know that uh terry's not good no terry in our county is going to convict
[16:52.320 --> 16:55.400]  somebody for that for the very reason you just mentioned they're going to understand
[16:55.400 --> 16:58.600]  what's going on but we don't want people doing it because we don't want them to have to go
[16:58.600 --> 17:03.160]  through that double hassle tough enough dealing with getting through security we don't want
[17:03.160 --> 17:08.760]  them to have to suddenly find themselves handcuffed on the ground being taken before you know
[17:08.760 --> 17:12.160]  in the court for us to have to judge whether we can do it but your assessment of it is
[17:12.160 --> 17:17.640]  accurate well i mean you're a lawyer you're the da there in your county i mean you're
[17:17.640 --> 17:23.720]  the guy to ask this question ron paul is saying the congressman is saying that the tsa is
[17:23.720 --> 17:29.720]  claiming that they have immunity and that he wants to pass a law saying they don't but
[17:29.720 --> 17:35.080]  with my lay understanding of a federal state and common law you only have immunity when
[17:35.080 --> 17:40.640]  you're executing the office properly but when these federal security guards who aren't
[17:40.640 --> 17:46.840]  even trained in law enforcement or law like a not one tenth of training that a green horn
[17:46.840 --> 17:52.480]  rookie cop has when they start operating outside of common law state law federal law they don't
[17:52.480 --> 17:58.200]  have the immunity yes hundred percent correct we have conveyed the message to the tsa here
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.320]  at san francisco airport that hey we know you have to do your job and we won't we want
[18:02.320 --> 18:05.840]  you to do your job and do it the right way to keep us safe but on the other side of
[18:05.840 --> 18:11.640]  it if any of your tsa employees take it beyond what is necessary takes it to where they are
[18:11.640 --> 18:16.640]  fondling a woman's breast touching a man's but it's on it with no purpose no reason
[18:16.640 --> 18:20.960]  a valid reason they're just going beyond the duty there's no protection they're going to
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.160]  be in the state court here and there there's no claim of immunity that'll protect them
[18:25.160 --> 18:33.680]  against that just as a private citizen what's your view on this as with everything anytime
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.160]  we give as a government we give power to an agency I'm I've given power the people of
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.440]  san mateo county have given me the power to prosecute people it's an enormous responsibility
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.320]  and power one has to exercise it properly reasonably and with an understanding of the
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.240]  role not with the arrogance not with the power hungry I'm now suddenly the boss it when one
[18:53.240 --> 18:57.320]  does that one exceeds their authority and you have to change it and that's what I think
[18:57.320 --> 19:02.040]  is everybody's concern here is again very well in meeting people certainly at the sixty
[19:02.040 --> 19:06.560]  seven thousand tsa employees at the various airports probably the fast book want to do
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.800]  it the right way but they've conveyed but there's been created this image that no we
[19:10.800 --> 19:16.040]  have a power above everybody else we get to do whatever we want and that's just wrong
[19:16.040 --> 19:21.000]  they are simply public servants and they have to serve the public just as I do as prosecutor
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.040]  for this county and that's what bothers me is that I've seen certain exhibits of arrogance
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.320]  and instead of dealing with it their leaders instead of saying we're not going to have
[19:29.320 --> 19:32.760]  this we're going to correct this we're going to do better training we're going to try and
[19:32.760 --> 19:37.560]  get it to where we get better people doing it instead we get this other sort of view
[19:37.560 --> 19:41.960]  that now wait we've got the power we've got the immunity we'll do whatever we want that's
[19:41.960 --> 19:46.320]  not a good situation and I think that's why we're seeing exactly the reaction nationwide
[19:46.320 --> 19:52.240]  that we have well absolutely in the same time the tsa now has viper teams they want to put
[19:52.240 --> 19:56.560]  on the streets of the country and they're already beta testing them and they're saying
[19:56.560 --> 20:01.960]  they've bought mobile trucks and I mean I won't fly with my family because of this next
[20:01.960 --> 20:06.680]  I'm going to have to face it on the street isn't that a jurisdictional issue with the
[20:06.680 --> 20:13.040]  counties and cities and states to to to now have people that aren't even sworn officers
[20:13.040 --> 20:21.280]  of the federal government but just a federal security goon force just just running around
[20:21.280 --> 20:26.160]  I mean this this sounds like a federalism issue that if that sort of a thing was occurring
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.880]  in our county I would sure be very quickly on the phone to the head of tsa and homeland
[20:30.880 --> 20:34.480]  security to say hey just what is the authority for this just how do you think you can do
[20:34.480 --> 20:39.800]  that here in our county because we've got a responsibility to our citizens and if that
[20:39.800 --> 20:43.840]  were to come into existence what you describe obviously that would be a major cause of concern
[20:43.840 --> 20:48.680]  as to what that's all about well sir I just have a few final comments we appreciate Steve
[20:48.680 --> 20:54.520]  Wagstaff the San Mateo County incoming DA he's already been the chief deputy DA there
[20:54.520 --> 21:01.320]  for years and again elected by the folks there in the county and and and we appreciate your
[21:01.320 --> 21:05.480]  courage in doing this I know you will say you're just doing your job and you are but
[21:05.480 --> 21:10.680]  it takes as George Arwell said in a time of universal deceit you're telling the truth
[21:10.680 --> 21:16.600]  a revolutionary act you say you've told the tsa this have you told them publicly or in
[21:16.600 --> 21:19.800]  a letter we know you've told them publicly went through our sheriff's office who they
[21:19.800 --> 21:23.800]  work with in the sheriff's office I had a long discussion with them yesterday and the
[21:23.800 --> 21:28.280]  sheriff's office then met with the tsa people and said listen here's what the rules are
[21:28.280 --> 21:34.600]  for San Mateo County what did the tsa say did they show the same we're god arrogance no
[21:34.600 --> 21:37.880]  what I understand is that they said no we understand we know the rules and we're going
[21:37.880 --> 21:41.800]  to try and work within them is what we were told we will uh you know words are cheap we'll
[21:41.800 --> 21:46.600]  see what the actions are sir specifically quantifying it uh in uh with california
[21:46.600 --> 21:51.600]  line oh it's similar to the rest of the nation you said sticking the hands in the pants because
[21:51.600 --> 21:56.920]  now they're going deep into the pants this is confirmed and actually and and the democrats
[21:56.920 --> 22:00.920]  are calling it love pats which I think is political suicide but but I've interviewed
[22:00.920 --> 22:05.480]  people on air it's been confirmed by journalists that it's happened to that they go in the pants
[22:05.480 --> 22:11.160]  and go in the crack of the buttocks uh then they go in the front and actually
[22:11.960 --> 22:17.400]  pat twice with pressure to make sure because I guess they're trained to know what a woman
[22:17.400 --> 22:21.880]  feels like or what a man I mean this is crazy I mean this is and is that that type of a thing
[22:21.880 --> 22:26.280]  um I sure hope that those are aboriginal and not the story because those are the type of
[22:26.280 --> 22:31.720]  things that can uh lead to problems for their agents so specifically what's a felony what's
[22:31.720 --> 22:36.840]  a misdemeanor felony is anytime that you have skin to skin touching up the privates of another
[22:36.840 --> 22:41.640]  person doesn't matter whether it's cross gender or regular gender and it's being done for uh with
[22:41.640 --> 22:46.920]  what we call a lute intent under california law it's being done with a uh for a sexual purpose
[22:46.920 --> 22:51.480]  if that occurs if it's through the clothing it's a misdemeanor if it's uh skin to skin it's a felony
[22:51.480 --> 22:56.920]  it's called sexual battery in the state of california and if that occurs that's crime and we prosecute
[22:56.920 --> 23:05.240]  them all right final question uh sir uh obviously uh you're the first da to come out yesterday and
[23:05.240 --> 23:09.080]  and put this on the record and have the sheriff's department go inform them of the law and that
[23:09.080 --> 23:14.200]  they're not above the law as you said in that tv newscast I'm seeing a few other da's now say
[23:14.200 --> 23:20.360]  they're looking at it uh but but clearly you've looked at the law uh what do you want to say to
[23:20.360 --> 23:25.320]  other prosecutors other law men and women uh other people that are charged in the courts
[23:25.320 --> 23:30.040]  with upholding justice I mean for me there's no question here you're doing the right thing
[23:30.680 --> 23:36.200]  shouldn't we see an army of district attorneys and county attorneys you know come out and say
[23:36.200 --> 23:41.400]  we're going to enforce the law I think you will Santa claire county which is uh Santa's a california
[23:41.400 --> 23:45.720]  the one right below us they have come out they came out yesterday and said yes we agree completely
[23:45.720 --> 23:51.000]  with San Mateo county and my belief is I don't think this is a complicated um process I think
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.960]  every prosecutor after they look at it will agree this is what the law is and that's certainly in
[23:55.960 --> 24:01.400]  california I'm sure all 58 district attorneys will have the same view there's there isn't a logical
[24:01.400 --> 24:05.320]  basis for any other view on it okay this is my last point because it's so important now that
[24:05.320 --> 24:10.600]  you brought that up I was in San Jose I witnessed things that if I went up in a park and did it
[24:10.600 --> 24:15.320]  I'd probably serve five years in prison to be a sexual predator I was there watching them
[24:15.320 --> 24:22.520]  go between the legs you know go down behind the pants I was witnessing it and I know that
[24:22.520 --> 24:26.440]  police don't have to have a complaint that crack cocaine's being sold down the street
[24:26.440 --> 24:33.080]  if a cop drives by and sees it he has to respond can't you just send your detectives from the county
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.880]  into the airport and if they see a crime being committed you give them the guidelines off the
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.520]  law and then go ahead and slap the handcuffs on them that can be done exactly that can be
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.160]  any one of our law enforcement agencies do have that power to do so exactly as you say Alex
[24:47.160 --> 24:50.920]  well we know that's going on so are you gonna not just warn them I mean I know you've given
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.720]  them fair warning are you gonna oh we've told we've told the sheriff's office who goes through
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.440]  our airport along with San Francisco PD exactly where we are what the rules are and what their
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.680]  authority is absolutely oh so you are now investigating in the airport well I'd say we've
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.320]  given the we've given the guidelines and the admonitions to the sheriff's office who's given
[25:09.320 --> 25:15.160]  it to TSA and the sheriff's office for San Mateo County is the one bested with the as you say the
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.560]  police authority if they and they bring us a case I've told them you bring us the case
[25:19.560 --> 25:23.960]  because here in the DA's office we don't have the investigators bureau to do that but our sheriff's
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.880]  office has said you bring us the case here are the guidelines if they do it we'll prosecute it
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.440]  well it was Benjamin Franklin that said those that will give up liberty for security will get
[25:32.440 --> 25:37.240]  neither and we're gonna get tyranny and thank god there's people like they're out you the first
[25:37.240 --> 25:44.120]  to stand up and say the emperor has no clothes I see this ending with this federal takeover
[25:44.120 --> 25:48.600]  failing it might and that's what we're all gonna watch I do have to run hey thank you so much for
[25:48.600 --> 25:52.760]  your time today and best of luck all right god bless you sir thanks for spending time with us
[25:52.760 --> 25:59.320]  all right there he goes ladies and gentlemen amazing show that's breaking news and I know
[25:59.320 --> 26:04.920]  Watson's getting married tomorrow but he is the hardest worker I think we've got when it comes
[26:04.920 --> 26:12.600]  to the riders and they're all great get me Watson online right now because you just heard the district
[26:12.600 --> 26:18.040]  attorney of San Mateo County where the San Francisco International Airport is located I just flew
[26:18.040 --> 26:27.560]  into that three weeks ago and flew out of San Jose just south of it you just heard him say
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.600]  they've got their investigators going through the airport and yes that's a big news development
[26:32.600 --> 26:41.880]  he's not just warning them now that if he gets complaints he's going to investigate him and may
[26:41.880 --> 26:51.000]  indict may go to the grand jury for an indictment now now he's saying that yes they are basically
[26:51.000 --> 27:00.760]  going to investigate in the airports the commission of these crimes and now the county just south of
[27:00.760 --> 27:06.840]  them where San Jose is located and that big airport they have now put them on notice so
[27:06.840 --> 27:14.600]  it's spreading it's happening you heard it here first Watson yeah I know you've got to go to dinner
[27:14.600 --> 27:20.200]  with your folks and your betrothed you felt like hammering out a top story that is super newsworthy
[27:20.200 --> 27:27.560]  and another major salvo on the enemy or do I need to call Nemo in here uh I could do it when I get
[27:27.560 --> 27:37.960]  back later Alex but I'm about to go now did you just hear the latest yeah this is huge all right

[27:51.560 --> 27:56.360]  well I think they're going to kick out this TSA groping before I have any children because
[27:56.360 --> 28:01.560]  I said they're not going to do that to them yeah but you can't people always say the world's so
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.360]  bad I may not have children well look what all of our ancestors went through I mean you know
[28:06.360 --> 28:11.640]  resistance is victory you remember what three years ago three and a half years ago when that human
[28:11.640 --> 28:18.760]  population eugenics lady was on the show uh you know with Prince Philip uh uh I mean he supports her
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.480]  and she was saying how horrible it is to have more than one child and I said that's it of course
[28:23.480 --> 28:29.880]  within two months I you know we'd conceived another so uh the resistance is victory Watson
[28:29.880 --> 28:36.520]  resistance is victory we need patriots to have children so that we've got the resistance force
[28:36.520 --> 28:42.200]  out there to fight the globalist well it's resistance is certainly going to be victory with
[28:42.200 --> 28:46.920]  this TSA story because it's only getting bigger and bigger and now they're talking about it they
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.800]  come in the foundation for a new rebellion in the form of the how the town hall fury that we saw
[28:53.800 --> 28:59.800]  last year became the foundation for the tea party and I hate to toot my horn Watson but three weeks
[28:59.800 --> 29:05.640]  ago I said that and the Cohen tell pro was like I'm sick of him covering this I'm just not gonna
[29:05.640 --> 29:09.960]  fly all he talks about is that he never talks about the banking on that and then of course they
[29:09.960 --> 29:16.200]  always complain all he talks about the economy and banking we know what's important we know what
[29:16.200 --> 29:24.440]  we're doing here okay that this TSA takeover is key to the globalist it's key it's key we got to
[29:24.440 --> 29:30.280]  take that key and break it and go you think you're going to train us to be slaves all right I'm going

[35:35.480 --> 35:39.960]  resistance to tyrants as obedience to god it's like they had laws saying blacks weren't human
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.120]  there are a lot of black folks who said you know what i'm not going along with that i'm a human being
[35:45.880 --> 35:49.640]  and they passed laws then saying okay you're two-thirds human and then i said you know what
[35:49.640 --> 35:56.360]  i'm full human and they passed laws saying blacks you can't own guns you can't own property and a
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.440]  lot of black folks went along with it just like a lot of people today black white doesn't matter
[36:00.440 --> 36:04.760]  hispanic go along with his tyranny but the minority of us stand up and say you know what
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.440]  you're not sticking your hands down my pants there's nothing to do with terrorism i've done the
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.400]  research your bosses are staging the terrorism to take over our society just like hitler blew
[36:13.400 --> 36:19.880]  up his own Reichstag i'm not stupid and then the majority the sheep will start to see it and they
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.600]  go yeah i don't like it either and then there's a huge revolt now something else is happening here
[36:25.480 --> 36:36.280]  most of the polls i've seen are 75 80 90 96 percent against this but then cbs has a poll and 83
[36:36.280 --> 36:44.920]  percent are for it i don't believe those polls because on the street all over liberal conservative
[36:44.920 --> 36:55.320]  libertarian i mean 99 percent of the news coverage i've seen even on cnn and fox is against this
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.480]  sean hannity who i've actually heard say that all children need microchips and planted in them
[37:01.480 --> 37:12.120]  two days ago um right after we had um oh doctor the talk show host on who had him stick their
[37:12.120 --> 37:19.080]  hand down his pants and actually pat his genitals hannity had him on and was defending it but then
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.960]  saying well i guess it is a little wrong well then by last night he was totally against it so we're
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.520]  going to take all these bootlickers kicking and strength screaming listen how about you have an
[37:28.520 --> 37:35.640]  airline with no security on it but the pilots armed and everybody's allowed to be armed you know this
[37:35.640 --> 37:41.160]  is private business and let's just have where everybody can fly with their firearms you can
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.640]  have a rule that they're checked by the security there that they're unloaded that's how it was in
[37:45.640 --> 37:51.400]  the old days just 20 years ago you can walk right on with your firearm because you were you know going
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.440]  on a business trip or you were you were going to go hunting you know you normally checked it but
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.160]  now it's uh you know the answer is a bunch of people with guns on the plane and you say well
[38:01.160 --> 38:08.680]  what if it depressurizes i just said they got to be unloaded or you have to have sheer safety
[38:08.680 --> 38:13.080]  slugs that the air marshals use yeah that could be the answer if you want to fly with your gun
[38:13.080 --> 38:19.560]  just make sure it's unloaded but um if you want it to be loaded in case there's a terrorist or
[38:19.560 --> 38:25.560]  something share safety slugs believe me that airline would have so much business now the globalist
[38:25.560 --> 38:29.880]  would try to put terrorist on board it you know that would happen or they try to put a belly bomb
[38:29.880 --> 38:35.080]  in or something you know in the packaging but you know what blow up one two ten planes i'm just
[38:35.080 --> 38:39.800]  gonna oh i'm gonna keep flying on that because there's enough people that know what's going on here
[38:39.800 --> 38:45.240]  i'm challenging your fraud i'm challenging your fear you don't think every time i get on an airplane
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.080]  i know the globalists couldn't bring it down it's one of their favorite ways to kill patriots
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.640]  you don't think i'm not aware they could cut the brakes on my car shinned in a homeless person
[38:53.640 --> 38:57.960]  they've paid off one of their favorite ways to kill people to blow my head off show what i don't
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.360]  care i'm calling your bluff i'm all in i don't care i'm all the way i don't want to die but you
[39:02.360 --> 39:09.880]  know what let's go let's go let's go come on come on get some i'm not saying come and take it but
[39:09.880 --> 39:14.280]  you attack me that's just the way it is you'll throw a hundred logs on the fire of liberty
[39:14.840 --> 39:18.520]  you'll water that tree of liberty so much with my blood you can't even imagine
[39:18.520 --> 39:26.760]  it this is survival of our species this is say a note of tyranny and at a certain point you stop
[39:26.760 --> 39:34.040]  worrying and it's that spirit of not being cowed not being dominated that's going to bring down the
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.320]  globalist now i got some really bad news for you on two fronts with legislation that's both of
[39:39.320 --> 39:45.880]  them off the charts but that's coming up after the good news on the tsa that multiple airports
[39:45.880 --> 39:49.800]  just a few hours ago it was one airport i did a search and found that there are other airports in
[39:49.800 --> 39:53.320]  fact that's another article we ought to get steve watson i guess he's there for the wedding
[39:53.320 --> 39:59.160]  or erin dykes i guess erin was up here late so he's still asleep um that's why we need more funds
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.000]  more listener support so i can hire more good writers just because we're over we don't have the
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.160]  staff here and it's hard to find folks who understand all this uh but that's that's newsworthy
[40:09.160 --> 40:16.840]  that other airports now joining tsa boycott i mean this is off the charts because everybody 90 plus
[40:16.840 --> 40:22.040]  percent are sick of it it's what i see on the street it's what i hear from all the spectrum of
[40:22.040 --> 40:27.400]  alternative and even mainstream news when the mainstream news is against something you know
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.560]  the general public's against it because they're always trying to force feed us some popular things
[40:31.560 --> 40:38.600]  they're capitulating and tsa admits they're upset they're angry hey don't you know that i'm concerned
[40:38.600 --> 40:45.800]  about being persecuted or uh recrimination next time i fly i don't care good recriminate
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.960]  go ahead take me in the back room and beat my brains out you're the thug you're the scum
[40:51.960 --> 40:55.000]  you're the one that's going to be brought down by what you're doing i'm not afraid of you
[40:55.720 --> 40:59.160]  i'm not afraid of the new or loader strapping me down and pulling my teeth out with pliers
[41:02.760 --> 41:07.160]  because we're going to show everybody just exactly who you are what what i'm committed to
[41:07.160 --> 41:13.000]  like a torpedo is blowing a giant hole in your lies in the info war and watching you go into the
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.400]  bottom peaceful resistance and what's a torpedo do when it hits its enemy it goes up in flames as well
[41:20.280 --> 41:26.280]  see you don't understand that globalist we're committed there's no defeating us no amount of
[41:26.280 --> 41:31.720]  fluoride no amount of gmo to dumb us down humans are designed to survive just like cockroaches
[41:32.440 --> 41:36.760]  the more you try to poison us the stronger we're going to get oh you're going to wipe out a lot
[41:36.760 --> 41:41.960]  of weak people but you're not going to wipe out people like me you understand that and those of
[41:41.960 --> 41:46.840]  you that look at my tiredness and and and and and and you know the fact that some days i look burnt
[41:46.840 --> 41:51.880]  out and unhealthy that's the sign of the vigor and the overall strength of the resistance that
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.560]  i'm breaking my back and spelling my guts out and my soul out in this fight that's part of the
[41:57.560 --> 42:08.040]  commitment you understand that that is the strength don't you get it don't you understand it
[42:13.160 --> 42:18.120]  i hope you get it because a candle burning at both ends does give off a lovely light
[42:19.400 --> 42:23.240]  by the way they could say i was stealing that from christopher hitchens who said in the guardian but
[42:23.240 --> 42:29.400]  he's stealing that from shakespeare baby all right ladies and gentlemen continuing here
[42:30.440 --> 42:36.600]  with the news and information i got the bad news coming up but let me give you the good news
[42:36.600 --> 42:42.680]  here's ron paul up there telling it like it is and and and now more and more media are pointing
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.480]  out this is going to be bigger than the tea party and whose movement launched that the liberty
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.080]  movement sure they tried to co-opt it but they're failing by co-opting it they had to speak our
[42:53.080 --> 43:01.320]  language and legitimize all these issues it's a trojan horse they think they're trojan horsing
[43:01.320 --> 43:06.600]  us it's the other way around and that's the same thing the globals are gonna try to try to co-opt
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.040]  this tea party movement oh they thought they found a bomb on a german plane today turned out they didn't
[43:12.040 --> 43:16.520]  lots more fear mongering and they'll probably blow a plane out of the sky in the next month
[43:17.160 --> 43:22.520]  unless we point that out and stop them from doing it and more people i'm seeing it all over mainstream
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.600]  blogs and in mainstream comments on mainstream articles about get ready the government's going
[43:26.600 --> 43:31.000]  to blow planes up get ready you know the people connected to these companies they're getting ready
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.400]  to stage something yeah and we hope they don't kill people but that's what they do and ron paul
[43:37.400 --> 43:43.000]  points out you can drown you can die in car accidents you can get killed by a honeybee
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.680]  i remember years ago the statistics came out of the legislature there were more football
[43:48.680 --> 43:52.440]  deaths nationwide something like 20 something that year in high school football and their
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.160]  worst school shooting deaths we're gonna ban football because people die people die going
[43:57.160 --> 44:03.800]  out the front porch people get struck by lightning in their yard people die okay get over it you're
[44:03.800 --> 44:09.000]  not gonna live anybody that tells you that they're gonna do a bunch of stuff for your safety and
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.960]  take all your rights to keep you safe they are the ones that are the terrorists terrorizing you
[44:13.960 --> 44:20.520]  to sell you on evil now we got max keiser coming up today we got jerry solante power pack transmission
[44:20.520 --> 44:24.920]  but i got all this other news i've got to get to let's go ahead and play this five minute ron paul
[44:24.920 --> 44:32.280]  speech okay here it is i rise this evening to announce that i introduced some legislation today
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.440]  dealing with the calamity that we have found at our airports with tsa something has to be done
[44:38.440 --> 44:44.280]  on everybody's fed up the people are fed up the pilots are fed up i'm fed up you know i've come to
[44:44.280 --> 44:49.960]  this floor many times over the past many years and complained about the terrible foreign policy
[44:49.960 --> 44:56.680]  we've had the terrible monetary policy we had the excesses spending and the debt and also the tax
[44:56.680 --> 45:03.560]  policy but what we're doing and what we're accepting and putting up with at this airport is so symbolic
[45:03.560 --> 45:12.360]  of us just not standing up and saying enough is enough i know the american people are starting
[45:12.360 --> 45:17.880]  to wake up but our government those in charge congress as well as the executive branch are
[45:17.880 --> 45:23.000]  doing nothing yes they're talking about maybe backing off and allowing the pilots go through
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.840]  but can you think how silly the whole thing is the pilot has a gun in the cockpit and he's
[45:28.840 --> 45:35.880]  managing this aircraft which is a missile and we make him go through this groping x-ray exercise
[45:35.880 --> 45:43.320]  having people feel in their underwear it's absurd and it's time we wake up the bill i've introduced
[45:43.320 --> 45:49.800]  will take take care of this but we have to realize that the real problem is that the american people
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.720]  have been too submissive we have been too submissive it's been going on for a long time
[45:55.720 --> 46:03.640]  and this was not this was to be expected even from the beginning of the tsa and it's deeply flawed
[46:03.640 --> 46:10.440]  private property should be protected by private individuals not bureaucrats but the the the the
[46:10.440 --> 46:15.560]  the bill that i've introduced will take care of it's very simple it's one paragraph long
[46:15.560 --> 46:21.800]  it renew it renew it remove it removes the immunity from anybody in the federal government
[46:21.800 --> 46:29.160]  that does anything that you or i can't do if you can't grope another person and if you can't x-ray
[46:29.160 --> 46:35.720]  people and endanger them with possible x-ray you can't take nude photographs of individuals
[46:35.720 --> 46:41.640]  why do we allow the government to do it we would go to jail if an individual he'd be immediately
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.920]  arrested if an individual citizen went up and did these things and yet we just sit there and calmly
[46:46.920 --> 46:53.480]  sit and say oh they're making us safe and besides the argument from the executive branch is that
[46:53.480 --> 46:57.960]  when you buy a ticket you have sacrificed your rights and it's the duty of the government to
[46:57.960 --> 47:03.880]  make us safe that is in the case you never have to sacrifice your rights the duty of the government
[47:03.880 --> 47:12.840]  is to protect our rights not to use them and do what they have been doing to us the pilots hopefully
[47:12.840 --> 47:18.200]  you know will be exempted from this but another suggestion i have that might help us let's make
[47:18.200 --> 47:24.040]  sure that every member of congress goes through this and get the x-ray take a look and make them
[47:24.040 --> 47:30.840]  look at the pictures and then go through one of those groping uh pat downs and then i think
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.160]  there'd be a difference have everybody in the executive branch anybody a cab member make them
[47:35.160 --> 47:41.000]  go through it and look at it maybe they would pay more attention but this it doesn't work
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.400]  it does this is not what makes us safer this is preposterous to think that the tsa has made us safer
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.480]  you know when you think about it if you look at what's happened over the past 10 years during
[47:53.480 --> 47:59.240]  this last decade we lost 3 000 on a terrible terrible day for america but since that time in
[47:59.240 --> 48:07.000]  this last decade we have also lost 6 000 of our military personnel going over there and trying
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.880]  to rectify this problem we have lost 400 000 people on our government run highways we have lost
[48:13.880 --> 48:21.880]  150 000 individuals from homicides so i think there's reason to be concerned reason to deal with
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.320]  this problem we're not dealing with the right way we're doing the wrong thing and groping people at
[48:27.320 --> 48:32.840]  the airport doesn't solve our problems what has solved our problems basically has been that they
[48:32.840 --> 48:37.320]  put a good lock on the door and they put a gun inside the cockpit that's been the greatest
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.720]  boon to to our safety safety should be the responsibility individual and the private
[48:43.720 --> 48:48.840]  property owner but right now we assume the government's always going to take care of us
[48:48.840 --> 48:55.560]  and we are supposed to sacrifice our liberties i say that is wrong we are not safer and we also
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.320]  know there are individuals who are making money off this michael schertock i mean here's a guy that
[49:01.320 --> 49:06.920]  was the head of the tsa selling the equipment and the equipment equipment's questionable we don't
[49:06.920 --> 49:12.440]  even know if it works and it may well be dangerous to our health you know the way i see this if this
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.840]  doesn't change i see what has happened to the american people is we have accepted the notion
[49:16.840 --> 49:22.840]  that we should be treated like cattle make us safe make us a cure put us in the bar bar feed us
[49:22.840 --> 49:29.000]  fatten us up and then they'll eat us and we're a bunch of cattle and we have to wake up and say
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.120]  we've had it i think this whole idea of an opt out day is just great we ought to opt out and make
[49:36.120 --> 49:41.800]  the point get us get somebody to watch and take a camera it's time for the american people stand
[49:41.800 --> 49:51.960]  up shrug off the shackles of our government at tsa at the airport well there you have it ladies
[49:51.960 --> 49:57.560]  and gentlemen congressman ron paul and i talked to his office yesterday and they said yeah i'm
[49:57.560 --> 50:01.240]  sorry we didn't get on this week we've been so busy but he wants to come on next week to talk
[50:01.240 --> 50:06.920]  about his bill in the tsa because the congressman realizes this is the start of a key rebellion
[50:06.920 --> 50:12.920]  against tyranny absolutely and now as you heard watson point out the media is starting to get it
[50:13.640 --> 50:18.760]  see as people realize they can stand up and find their dignity and realize that everybody else is
[50:18.760 --> 50:25.240]  angry like they are that final illusion that we're all by ourselves you don't like the government
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.800]  listening to your phone calls without a warrant you're a kook you don't like drinking sodium

[52:06.600 --> 52:12.840]  republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[52:12.840 --> 52:17.880]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our
[52:17.880 --> 52:24.760]  land they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define who we are
[52:24.760 --> 52:30.200]  and what we will tolerate somebody's going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising
[52:31.480 --> 52:35.240]  we have the facts we have the constitution we have the bill of rights we have common

[54:36.600 --> 54:43.960]  in your office when you violate the law you don't have immunity someone might instruct ron paul on
[54:43.960 --> 54:48.040]  that i know he's really smart but you heard me just play the clip and i and i brought it up to the
[54:48.040 --> 54:55.320]  da i said well da do we even need ron paul to pass a law saying that they're not exempt
[54:55.320 --> 55:02.440]  from law uh because sure the tsa claims they're exempt the queen of england claims she's exempt
[55:02.440 --> 55:13.720]  and sovereign when she's just a murderous old woman i mean she says she's god well look i'll tell you
[55:13.720 --> 55:21.320]  this here in this country oh you didn't know that she owns a big part of the world diamond
[55:21.320 --> 55:26.920]  monopoly in the oil systems and what she's financed in africa oh you don't know about all her
[55:26.920 --> 55:31.320]  oil companies and stuff running a takeover operations and funding the overthrow of countries
[55:31.320 --> 55:34.520]  yeah the queen of england is a gangster sorry side issue

[55:46.920 --> 55:52.360]  as immunity in the proper execution of the constitution the bill of rights and your sworn
[55:52.360 --> 55:59.000]  duties if you are in the proper position you have immunity just like i got immunity if somebody's
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.160]  busted in the back of my house at night and i kneel down on one knee and pump two or three rounds
[56:05.160 --> 56:11.400]  into their chest i've got immunity but it's not immunity i'm in the right being in the right
[56:11.400 --> 56:18.840]  is the immunity that's like with libel and slander the truth is 100 defense because it's not libel
[56:18.840 --> 56:27.160]  and slander and defamation if it's true you understand that i don't have immunity to say
[56:27.160 --> 56:34.360]  whatever i want you shouldn't call it immunity when you're in the right you're in the right when
[56:34.360 --> 56:41.800]  you're in the wrong you're in the wrong it's like george bush ordering torture we get the memos
[56:41.800 --> 56:45.480]  and then we're like why are you sending these people to prison that followed orders they're
[56:45.480 --> 56:50.920]  guilty but you're even more guilty and then they go to prison and then bush runs around writing
[56:50.920 --> 56:55.160]  books giving speeches about how he ordered torture well why aren't those people released from prison
[56:55.160 --> 57:02.040]  then just because you're the president they put out that furor precept and said that when the president
[57:02.040 --> 57:08.120]  does it it's not illegal remember cheney saying that remember alberto consolis saying it no
[57:09.240 --> 57:13.560]  this is what tyranny is it's a bunch of out of control people claiming they're doing it for
[57:13.560 --> 57:18.680]  our own good trampling over our bill of rights and constitution that was written up by some really
[57:18.680 --> 57:24.440]  smart people that had been around the block a few times you want to listen to john you and
[57:24.440 --> 57:28.680]  alberto consolis and dick cheney and george bush or do you want to listen to thomas jefferson
[57:28.680 --> 57:32.520]  and george washington i think i'm going to be with thomas jefferson and george washington
[57:34.200 --> 57:40.120]  i'm not going to be with dick cheney and bill clinton you're telling me the constitution's a
[57:40.120 --> 57:47.800]  living breathing document and all this other uh malarkey kaka may me
[57:47.800 --> 57:58.360]  be bovine i'm not going to say it look i just can't handle it anymore okay it's simple it
[57:58.360 --> 58:03.960]  didn't keep in your safe sticking your hand down your pants it's a joke real terrorists would just
[58:03.960 --> 58:08.280]  drive up in front of the airport and blow something up they don't care if you got a mirror into the
[58:08.280 --> 58:22.840]  car oh the point is great pass a law saying they're not exempt or you can pass a congressional law
[58:22.840 --> 58:27.560]  ordering them not to do it i mean they control the money congress could just cut the money out of
[58:27.560 --> 58:35.160]  tsa but you don't even need to say you're not exempt or you're not immune because they're already
[58:35.160 --> 58:44.040]  not immune they're not above the law nobody is we'll be right back you are listening to gcn

[58:50.600 --> 58:55.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.560]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.560 --> 59:04.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.600 --> 59:10.200]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:10.200 --> 59:15.320]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:15.320 --> 59:20.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[59:20.600 --> 59:25.080]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[59:25.080 --> 59:30.440]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[59:30.440 --> 59:34.280]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:12.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:21.880]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:29.000]  you know i enjoy the little things in life and we have a blessed wonderful nation still despite
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.160]  all our problems and our nation is filled with hardworking good people of every race color and
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:39.160]  creed i get negative sometimes and talk about us being a decadent demonic nation and certainly
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.520]  we got a big stripe of that down our back but if we don't point out how far we've fallen and
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.560]  repent for it we never have a chance of turning anything around and even if you're not a christian
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:55.480]  come on let's repent for killing a million iraqis let's repent for killing 50 million babies
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:01.960]  you know dehumanizing our own species let's you know let's repent for all the gmo crops
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:09.400]  that are hurting the environment and ourselves i mean it's a it's common sense says don't cross
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:15.240]  spiders with goats and then put them out in open pastures and then you go talk to the top
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.680]  genetic engineer scientists they admit it's giving rise to superviruses that are then
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:24.680]  carried by bacteria you start splicing insects and mammals it's very dangerous it can then cause
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:32.280]  uh insectoid type viruses and bacteria that are generally you know only confined to those groups
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:38.920]  to spread into mammals and then into humans a subset of mammals and i have to get into the
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:44.120]  science of it it's just it's all very dangerous and i'm sitting here watching humanity go crazy
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.600]  and more and more i agree with people the new world order is not all powerful they don't have all
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.480]  the answers they think they do but they're a bunch of ludatics with all this genetic engineering and
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.320]  all the wild things they're doing they claim they want world government to protect us from
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.200]  super technology and to sequester it but meanwhile they're handing it out like hotcakes they're a
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:10.440]  bunch of nihilistic control freaks like a bad kid who who who's self-destructive they're out of control
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.960]  and they're creating these armies of goons to humiliate people basically for their entertainment
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:24.760]  and to sell you know billions of dollars of radiation friars but i enjoy the little pleasures
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:30.280]  in life you know i haven't had this since my grandfather died my my mom's dad because he liked
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.480]  it and i remember when i was a little kid uh on my dad's side my grandpa would drink this and i
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.040]  my i guess my my living grandmother doesn't have to see more i ask her but it's tang and tea
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:48.280]  what what's the mixture jaren tang tea and allspice this is the exact super redneck recipe
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.720]  that i grew up on you know christmas at the grandma's house and i hadn't had this in probably 25
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:00.440]  years uh or you know 20 years and i'm telling you we got to bring this back i got a sore throat
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.320]  and jaren drinks and stuff every day during the fall his mom makes him a big old um big old jar
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.960]  of it and i told him have his mom make me some and i'll you know i'll pay her for the ingredients jaren
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:20.520]  hmm but under this new food preparation safety bill that's passed the key committee
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.000]  and now been packaged into a larger bill that's set to vote and reuters says it's going to be
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.880]  passed now some people have jumped the gun and are announcing it has passed not technically but
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:38.760]  not technically but then overall in the spirit of it you're right it's a done deal barring a
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:47.320]  miracle under that i guess uh jaren's mom cannot mix any food together and then even give it to
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.800]  anybody did you know that can't give it to people so i'm committing a hardcore crime i guess here
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.800]  in a few weeks uh you think i'm joking they're sending police out for people selling cupcakes
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:05.640]  kids selling um lemonade i said a million dollar fine ap reported it's a 15 million dollar federal

[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:39.160]  okay to be clear finishing up on the tsa this is now a national revolt against tyranny period
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.520]  and it's the people coming together and realizing the power they have to say no to the absurdity
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:51.800]  of big brother who practices absurdist over the top things you know why in special forces do they
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:58.920]  make people after they've been up for three days walk around sucking their thumbs with their pants
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:05.000]  down around their ankles it's just to see if you'll do what you're told this is mind control
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.800]  control you don't know where military modern training came from the germans developed it
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:16.200]  200 years ago they developed the theory of psychology four troops because they specifically
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:22.840]  wanted troops that would mindlessly die in battle and who would like robots follow orders
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:29.320]  they developed metals they said men will die for these little pieces of metal it's a sign of rank
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.640]  they said we've got to get them while they're young they created kindergarten
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.320]  to destroy critical thinking and to have children who could then become hessian mercs who would just
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:45.480]  regurgitate and repeat whatever they were told i'm not attacking any of these cultures i'm telling
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.400]  you they build it up like it's so wonderful and so good they give you sleep deprivation and shave
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:58.280]  your head and have you march like robots and yeah it's good for the military it's good to have brain
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:04.920]  wash robots but then they take brainwash robots and set them up as our rulers domestically and try
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:11.800]  to militarily train us to be slaves prisoner training and then the group they fear the most
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.520]  and hate the most is robots breaking their conditioning because there's nothing worse than
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:23.080]  somebody who's been a robot waking up to the robotic control because now they know the systems
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:30.920]  uh military and and force tactics and so they've got a wide ranging understanding so let me tell
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:37.400]  you who's the most profiled in this country police military government bureaucrats fbi type folks okay
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:43.000]  you are hated by the globalist but that's just like the soviets they hated their enforcers that
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.880]  was one of the most persecuted groups this is not a good train we're on this is not a good
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:56.280]  direction we're going in so here's the breaking big news we have the san mateo da steve uh wag staff
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:03.480]  on uh he was the chief deputy da now he's the da elect he just got elected he said clearly
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:09.000]  they are not exempt they are not immune because when they're violating a law they have no immunity
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.560]  in the government function you only have immunity if you're executing it under the constitution
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:18.440]  and that's the same immunity you have if somebody's breaking in your house at night you have a right
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:26.920]  to kill them it it's improperly called immunity it's called being in the right and he and now
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.520]  this is the key he said that yes they've got police going in and out of the airports and they're in
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:39.800]  there and they've been instructed to look for evidence of crime a patdown of the genitals
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:47.880]  are the buttocks on the surface is a misdemeanor if they go into the past and touch any skin it is
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:55.960]  a felony and now the da over one of the most frequently used airports in the country the
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:02.840]  airport is in san mateo the suburb of san francisco pull up uh the ranking of the san francisco
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.000]  airport i believe it's like the fifth largest in the country i may be wrong i believe it's number
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.440]  five one of the busiest airports in the world a giant airport in his county and he's saying
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.240]  not only am i warning him not only have i dispatched the sheriff's department
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:28.760]  to go talk to them and to tell them that you've been warned but now he's got sheriff's deputies
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:35.560]  in the airports and if they see a felony or a misdemeanor being committed they are going to
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:42.440]  slap the cuffs on them you don't just need a complaint for a crime okay if a cop's driving
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.560]  down the street at three a.m. and he sees suspicious people loading things in the back of a white van
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.280]  he doesn't he doesn't that's probable cause he doesn't need somebody to call it in okay
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.880]  it's that simple so you know this is going on you know a crime's being committed and he went
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:07.960]  further he said yes he thinks he will see more da's go public and he went further to say that he
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:14.280]  talked to the da from the county south of him where the san jose airport what county is that
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:21.000]  santa clara what county is that that uh that uh i mean let's just look it up to make that sure he
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.160]  sat on air but but let's just look up where santa rosa is that airport just south of san francisco
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:32.120]  the county that san jose is in let's just go to google and get that right now we're going to
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.880]  one of the other search engines y'all or whatever start page and get that let's do that right now
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.480]  he sat it on air but i want to put out the county again the county just south to him
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:51.800]  no no san meteo is the county there on san francisco that has the international airport the breaking
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:58.200]  news that i obviously if i'm such a bad communicator my staff doesn't even understand me i'm gonna i'm
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:05.000]  gonna slowly go over this right now san meteo is part of the overall suburbs of san francisco
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.280]  its da has warned them and sent sheriff's deputies to the san francisco international airport
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:17.400]  to tell them that if they grope people it's a felony or a misdemeanor depending on how they
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:23.240]  do it and that he's now going to slap them in cuffs then there's just south of that county
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:30.440]  there's another county that san san jose the town is in that has an airport that county
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:37.000]  another da has come out and said the same thing to him that's the breaking news now another da
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.480]  another california da via this da of san meteo the other da is just south of him in the county
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:54.440]  directly south of him is saying that he is going to prosecute it yes i was right it's santa clara
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:00.200]  county that the san jose international airport is in the one i flew out of three weeks ago
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:10.920]  with them groping the babies and the women only no men okay so that da told the da then that is
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:19.160]  very important that he is looking at going after us we need to get the da of san aclara county and
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:26.440]  give that to kurt for the article he's writing so this da steve wagstaff of san meteo said that he
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:33.880]  talked to the da of san aclara and that they're investigating what's going on at the san jose
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:43.240]  operation they're all clear for everyone and so the news here is this rebellion is now in high gear
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.440]  and we're saying the emperor has no clothes and this is illegal and the feds are not above the law
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:59.640]  and now da's around the country but especially in that area of central california the bay area
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.520]  are coming out and saying we are looking to prosecute you and they're not just warning them now
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:11.800]  they're saying the police are in the airport the police and the sheriff's deputies that the tsa who
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:18.520]  don't have real police power call over well what happens when somebody flies i'm almost tempted to
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.720]  fly in and then try to fly out of that san francisco airport but i'm not a woman or a child who they
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.520]  think they can make submit so they probably won't do it maybe have to fly with my wife and then have
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:32.600]  her say you do not permission to stick your hands in my pants you do not have your permission to do
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:38.360]  that and have them go ahead and do it and then just say all right get me the police over here right
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:49.640]  now you're going to jail and that's not entrapment that is you know just like you got muggings in a
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.520]  park you send a lady out in the park at night who's a cop you got the swat team hiding in the bushes
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:00.760]  it's very very simple they commit the crime don't worry though in these counties that are coming out
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.560]  for justice there's lots of angry people and and i forgot to ask them i bet complaints are already
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.680]  being filed since yesterday but it doesn't matter they have a duty to respond if they believe crimes
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:16.600]  are being committed and they know they're being committed so this is big big big news bagless
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:24.600]  what's going on got something to tell me come on in here bagless come on in here because they got
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:36.600]  some breaking news going on i'll help them this article is important i may just have to go off
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:47.000]  air because uh i mean it's just simple facts get it collated put it together there's san mateo
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.320]  county we had steve wagstaff on he talked to the da from santa clara county where the airport's
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:18:00.440]  based where it's also going on in san jose and this is big news to now have two da saying this
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:06.760]  and the biggest news is they're now going in to the airports and if their police or deputies see it
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:14.760]  in the airports they are going to affect an arrest that is big because it's brazen it shows the
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:24.120]  emperor has no clothes it shows what's going on out in the open this is so important if they fail

[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.840]  to have a label they don't even want you to be able to know they don't care about your food
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:33.240]  big mega agribusiness has lobbied for this because the bill openly states that it's broad
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:38.440]  they can do whatever they want and you already see them go after folks with cupcakes or lemonade
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.760]  or swat teaming amish or going after people that sell tomatoes on the side of the highway
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:52.920]  they don't want you doing anything in fact i've got a police state uh stack here uh in my news today
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.240]  and it just goes through they have a chess park in new york
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:05.240]  and it's been there for decades and they went and put up signs last week saying no adults here
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.520]  who aren't with children saying that any adults who want to go to a park or pedophiles and the
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.680]  people that have been going there into the chess park where the tables are boards these old men
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.840]  for decades the police came and gave them all tickets
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.240]  and more and more parks are doing this in england if you're at any park
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:32.040]  as a male or female by yourself this even happened to a wall street journal reporter i was talking to
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.720]  they come up and ask you you know basically are you a pedophile and you're like what
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.520]  what no i'm a tourist from the united states who wanted to come out here and see the canals
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.040]  see it's all about training you that you're a criminal and you've got to answer questions
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.440]  so no cupcakes no lemonade you think you're going to go to a park and play chess
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.600]  and meet like-minded people they don't want free association they want to make everything dirty
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  everything bad you can see some pedophile in a wife beater's shirt with mustard stains
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.880]  looking like a demonic zombie in a park you can pick out one of those guys you know from a million
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:18.840]  miles away you know kids know not to talk to adults who they don't know what are children doing at
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:26.680]  parks unattended huh huh my children sure aren't at parks unattended this is a bunch of bull
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.960]  again this park has had chess tables reportedly for decades
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:37.960]  men and women are there playing chess at lunch eating their cheese sandwich in the cop show

[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.520]  pedophile and then the news reporter there weren't even any kids there at lunch they go

[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:12.520]  way above the speed limit and read that in the examiner here's another one cops bus seven men
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.720]  playing chess in upper Manhattan park that's always been a chess park but they put up signs
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:24.760]  saying no adults without children in this park and they've got chess tables and when they gave
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:30.360]  them these tickets locals report the old men have played there for you know over a decade
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:36.920]  and then they were at lunch there were no children in the park so on a school day there's
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:43.240]  you know guys out there playing chess with each other you don't do that in america man i mean
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:48.680]  this country is a joke meanwhile half the congress are pedophiles i mean it's just incredible
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:54.440]  but nobody wants to stop dying core kidnapping children so that's just an example of the government
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.640]  you know rockefeller over uh you know key committee that deals with the media says just get rid of
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:05.400]  free speech get rid of the internet get rid of fox news uh we've got uh cops going and they thought
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:13.960]  it was a joke when they gave them tickets see that's what tyranny is is is they want to police normal
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:19.880]  good people they want to abuse us they want to train us uh that we're bad and i want to talk
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:26.040]  to max keiser about jp morgan it's come out in the news that they're being sued over silver
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:32.360]  manipulation and they're able to hide what how they're devouring our currency to a certain
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:38.200]  extent by suppressing silver and gold and i've seen a lot of economists and analysts do the equation
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:43.640]  that if every american bought one piece of silver one one ounce you know basically twenty seven
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:50.120]  dollars twenty eight dollars that that would dry up all the real available silver and show their
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:54.280]  naked shorting for what it is i want to talk about that with max keiser and he really wants to get
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:58.840]  this out of the public since he mentioned it last week it's already viral uh but before we do that
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.400]  max because i promise to get to this and you have expertise in this area as well you predicted this
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:08.760]  a few weeks ago on the show congress will try by secret vote to retroactively legalize foreclosure
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.280]  fraud this is from washington's blog also up at info wars dot com and prismana dot com today
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.320]  congress will try by secret vote to retroactively legalize foreclosures fraud and forgery by the
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:28.280]  big banks call congress and say no now they've already passed the food safety takeover bill
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.520]  where you can't slice up tomatoes and put them in a can or serve food to anybody i mean that's
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.160]  how it that's how broadly it's written oh they won't shut down parks with people playing chess
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:42.200]  oh they won't go send cops after little kids selling uh cupcakes or lemonade oh they won't give
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.640]  you 15 million dollar fines for garage sales it's all happening yes they will they won't stick your
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:52.120]  hands down your pants and grab your genitals yes they will it's guarantee and they're not going
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:38:03.240]  to stop until we say no so now um they're reporting bill hr 3808 will retroactively
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.160]  basically in property rights in this country and say they can take property without having a deed
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:16.120]  and that multiple banks who have these sold them in derivatives can somehow fight with each other
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:22.280]  over it so you just have no property rights of this passes i want to get um your take on that
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:25.960]  first max keiser and what this is going to do that and then they've announced as we predicted
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.840]  they are going to cut social security they are going to pass a sales tax a vat on top of income
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:37.880]  taxes they're going to start with unpopular things like soda drinks first uh they i mean it's all
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.880]  happening it's all happening the austerity it's all happening max keiser first on this issue
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:50.280]  what do you see this doing yeah well alex remember the telecom retroactive immunity for all the
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:56.280]  telecom companies that were caught spying remember they they caught them hacking into the telecom
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:01.800]  networks and doing all that spying and congress passed retroactive immunity they came to taste
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:06.840]  of what they could do now all the foreclosure fraud of which there are thousands hundreds of
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:11.800]  thousands documents fraudulent we signed robo sign machine signs now they're just going to give a
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:18.680]  blanket retroactive immunity it falls into the theme that banks do not have to obey the law there
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:25.080]  are no laws for banks they are above the law or if they get caught doing something they can hit
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.360]  with a small fine or they simply write new laws when i was working on a wall street the management
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:34.760]  would come around and say don't worry about breaking the law we've got lawyers if you get into
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.600]  real trouble we'll lobby what we do and we'll get new laws and that's the attitude is that nobody
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.640]  ever breaks the law on the wall street they always say that the financial engineering is ahead of the
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.760]  law you see they're so smart that you're doing things that the law hasn't caught up with yet
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.440]  you see and that's the attitude that these foreclosure crisis is just that people don't
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:00.680]  understand so they have to rewrite the law but when you get right down to it the foreclosure
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.400]  crisis there's five ways of fraud they fraudulently induce the mortgages they fraudulently foreclose
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:11.240]  they fraudulently package securities and mortgage back securities they fraudulently made bets against
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:17.000]  their own customers using credit default swaps and then they fraudulently disclose to the regulators
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.400]  every quarter and every year on their annual quarterly statement their actual debt positions
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:28.120]  on their balance sheet they committed five different ways in this particular fraud you know
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.520]  five ways of fraud and and they're getting so what is this going to do to the bedrock of a free
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:39.400]  society if they pass this and say we're now allowed to robo sign we don't have to certify
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.520]  we don't have to prove in court we own something this is like giving the banks a letter of mark
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:52.280]  to just pillage the countryside there's no rule of law for the bankers and uh what what's happening
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:57.960]  and what this sets up is because there's no rule of law and because the bond investors who used to
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:03.960]  be very good about keeping certain forces in check because they've been co-opted and bought off the
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:09.000]  only people left now with any integrity or what I call the bond the gold vigilantes these are the
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.600]  guys who are saying enough is enough we're going to crash the banks we're going to crash the system
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:18.920]  by forcing gold and silver up through new levels and to just completely decimate these guys and
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.480]  and to hammer them where it hurts the most their stock price and just put them out of business and
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.560]  that's what the gold vigilantes are doing and they're succeeding you see it right now in silver
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:31.480]  let me give you an insight who originally thought up this idea let's give credit where credit is due
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:38.760]  well it originally came down the pike as an institutional idea uh the big hedge funds are
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.120]  talking about it I would say probably Eric Sprott of Sprott asset management and John
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.080]  Embry up there in Canada haven't talked about this uh Mike Krieger who's over there to zero heads
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:54.440]  and I talked about it when he was on my show recently and then I was on your show and we
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.800]  talked about it so those are some of the names but it's not a secret that JP Morgan assured
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:05.560]  3.3 billion ounces of silver they are short 3.3 billion ounces of silver there's a silver that
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:10.360]  they sold that they don't own if anyone comes to collect the silver they have to go into the
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:16.440]  open market to buy it to make that delivery now the silver market is not even one tenth that's
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  five so naturally when you have that much buying on a commodity that's a fractionally that much
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:29.800]  available it drives the price to up you know and to new highs that's why uh I'm I'm making this call
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:36.120]  I think we're going to see silver trade it's five hundred dollars five hundred dollar silver it's
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:43.160]  based on uh a couple of things number one we are also in the industry and people on your show see
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.040]  gold trading at ten thousand dollars an ounce that's the foregone conclusion at this point
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:53.160]  you've always got a twenty to one risk relationship between silver and gold so that's your five
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:43:00.120]  hundred dollars right there uh number two uh given JP Morgan's position they've got as I mentioned
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:07.640]  3.3 billion ounces of silver sold short as part of their overall balance sheet which is 1.5 trillion
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:14.360]  in derivatives that they can't cover the entire market capitalization of JP Morgan is 150 billion
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.800]  so they've got debts or derivatives 10 times bigger than the entire capitalization of them of
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:25.080]  their stock and all those derivatives are tied to their to their silver short position and these
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:29.480]  gold vigilantes and people buying silver all over the world are going to jack that price up
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.320]  and we can get to 500 silver and look what's happening right now if you look at the silver
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:41.880]  price right now it's trading at 2681 remember that recently it got down to around 25 now as I
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:47.800]  explained to you Alex my work my job on Wall Street for eight years I was a professional
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:53.000]  options trader that's how I made my bones on Wall Street 90% of my business was trading options
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.480]  the third Friday every month which is tomorrow is what's called option expiration day that 25
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:05.000]  dollars which call a strike price a 25 dollar price the fact that the uh JP Morgan to the world
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.160]  were unable to get the price down below 25 means that all of these option contracts thousands
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:17.080]  that be ruled tomorrow uh are going to be ruled in a way that requires every single one of these
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:23.400]  guys to put up more cash or to sell short more silver or to basically put them at greater risk
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:28.440]  James Turk who was probably the foremost authority in the gold and silver market says this is the
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:34.440]  beginning of what we saw back in the 1960s when the gold cartel broke apart and he started the
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:40.600]  action of gold from 35 to 800 you see this happening in silver right now right today this option
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.560]  expiration date is happening right now they're unable to keep the price below 25 he thinks that
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.720]  this price of silver could bolt well past 29 30 bucks in the next three to four days so the banks
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:58.840]  call right now 500 silver that's what making the call right now 500 silver okay so to be specific
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:04.680]  though so the the big mega banks they don't just want to suppress gold and silver because it exposes
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:12.120]  their fiat currency in the act of suppressing it it makes them be way short in actually physically
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.800]  holding it because they're going in there and making you know naked bets in layman's terms
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:25.800]  to manipulate the market but if they get called on it then their fraud gets exposed and I think it
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:32.200]  is important to expose this fraud the gold antitrust group has been exposing it insiders have been
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.960]  coming public and even in mainstream news they've had you know sec hearings as you know about this
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:46.040]  max in the last few months so this is a real issue out there but but if it went to 500 uh you know
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:49.640]  which some say it should be for inflation or whatever I I don't know if that's the case I'm
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:55.880]  not you know a technical expert like yourself or a bob Chapman but regardless I mean even if silver
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:04.360]  goes to 20 29 35 40 dollars an ounce wouldn't that catch them with their pants down I mean silver
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.240]  doesn't need to go to 500 to catch them to the with their pants down do you have some type of
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:16.840]  actuary number of what level silver has to go to to really reveal the chicanery well every single
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:23.480]  dollar it goes up now they for example if it's a silver makes a ten dollar move golden sacks
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.120]  is at something like five billion dollars right now right here and that's right off the top it
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.760]  doesn't get into into the ripple effect of their derivatives book it means that they've got unrealized
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.160]  losses on the derivative books probably 10 times greater than that and it just gets worse and worse
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:44.520]  at some point but but I want to make this point Alex that the $500 silver is well within the range
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:51.000]  of a normal market move given where we've been and what's happening in both gold and silver going
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.200]  forward there's always been a 21 ratio between gold and silver historically and gold at 10000
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:02.280]  you're talking $500 silver and this is a number that professionals are now considering as well
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:08.280]  within reach so and not only are you going to bust JP Morgan at these levels and you're buying this
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:13.320]  silver you're taking off the market you're exposing their short position and what this means is
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:20.840]  they sold people stuff for cash they have the cash that they sold they sold people stuff
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.880]  and they took people's cash now those people are buying back but they don't have this stuff
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:30.280]  delivered they're short there's nothing in the cupboard they have and again goldman sacks and
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:35.000]  JP Morgan they've been caught especially goldman sacks they've been paid what 500 million but they
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.800]  made billions so it was paltry they've been caught selling bad derivatives to their customers while
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.760]  they were secretly betting against it and of course you know they famously called it uh you
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:52.200]  know basically pure garbage but they used a cuss word for it so uh they collude with each other
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:57.000]  in other words that this is what James Turk is talking about the the cartel they all cooperate
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.120]  with each other to keep the price cheap because they all benefit by having the dollar the competitor
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.080]  to gold is over relatively strong but they can't suppress it anymore it's just like in the 60s
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:14.600]  when that cartel busts apart you had a move from 35 to 800 in in gold out 35 to 800
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:21.800]  so i'm saying so we're making a move from 26 to 500 is is historically well within the norm
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.840]  those are the kind of moves we're talking about parabolic you know mind-blowing moves
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:32.040]  we know if google and these other high tech stocks could that had no business plan whatsoever
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:39.320]  that had no profits whatsoever we're worth 100 200 300 billion dollars on the exchange based on
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.200]  uh market you know maneuvers back in the 90s think about something that actually has value
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:50.040]  like silver getting caught up in a global fiat no i understand a a a fleeing from all the fiat
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.080]  currencies that are being devalued through coordinated devaluation and then the media
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:00.680]  lies and calls it a currency war it's a race at the bottom now you've got a story up at maxkeiser.com
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:08.200]  called 500 silver and you've got an idea today max now the idea is google bump 500 silver this is
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:14.120]  the story i've written i call it the crash jp morgan buy silver manifesto or how to get hedge fund
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:19.160]  is to do your dirty work for you and drive the price of silver to 500 but very simply 500
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.920]  dollar silver and it just goes over you know the eight point plan it just walks through where we are
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:30.360]  what's going to happen every ounce of silver you buy you're putting pressure on the shorts and the
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:35.400]  thing about a monetary metal like gold or silver is that once it achieves these rarefied levels
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:40.920]  it becomes more viable that they that the central bank is considered as a reserve currency as
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.480]  robert zellick has said last week and then in the wall street journal they now want to consider gold
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.440]  as a reserve currency that means that if gold gets to ten thousand dollars an ounce of silver
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.560]  gets to five hundred dollars an ounce as part of a move toward a gold back global currency
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:59.560]  it's going to stay at those levels it's going to be stuck at those levels because that's the
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:05.720]  level determined by the global banks as the new standard by which all currencies are factored so
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.160]  you're making an investment in a in a move in a precious metal that once it achieves these price
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.800]  levels it'll stay at those price levels plus you've got these other central banks in china who are
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.400]  talking about moving to gold back currency the middle east was moving into gold the central
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.000]  banks are no longer net sellers of gold and that buyers of gold are buying hundreds of tons at a
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.480]  time china just said they're going to buy another 300 tons they said they to catch up to america
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:34.360]  china's got about seven thousand more tons of gold and gold and silver trade in tandem okay so you
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:39.480]  want thousand silver goes to five hundred so you're saying people should now five hundred okay so
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:43.080]  you're we're going to break here so you're saying five hundred dollar silver is the search term
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:47.960]  and uh folks think this is a good idea they could certainly go to max keiser dot com and read your

[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:32.600]  in about 35 minutes from now i've got huge breaking tsa info going up in t minus five minutes
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:41.800]  at info wars dot com this is the biggest news yet of everything that's happened this is the biggest
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:49.080]  news yet that not only are da's around the country now saying they're going to take complaints and
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:55.240]  investigate it and may prosecute now they got police in the airports looking for it because
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:55:03.800]  they know crimes are being committed think of the magnitude of that they know crimes are being
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.200]  committed we're going to get that video up very soon and and have it posted in curtain
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.400]  emmo's article as well as people can actually hear him say it in fact guys it'll take time to get
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:20.440]  that video up in the meantime we might just want to chop out the audio of that 15 minute
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:25.240]  interview with the da because that that would take seconds can we just convert that to an mp3
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:29.160]  because it'll take hours to get it up on youtube can we just convert that to mp3 and have curt
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:35.000]  add that in his article once it's up excellent bombshell i mean this is huge what's happening
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.560]  and so i'm gonna have a search term for you on this coming up about 10 minutes in the next hour
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:45.400]  be ready for that because this is where we're really having in fact max keiser of course
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:51.560]  of the keiser report at max keiser dot com i want you to get out 500 silver and if we do break the
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:56.920]  back of the central banks on this issue if we do show that they've been shorting silver which the
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:05.160]  evidence is clear they are this could be even bigger than the whole situation with the tfa what
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:10.600]  we're learning is we have ways to fight back max keiser you agree with that absolutely the group
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.720]  of bombing is definitely a fantastic way to win the information awards because it's all about
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:20.040]  information and to dominate those search engines you're you're playing you're fighting fire with
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:25.720]  fire with information it's fantastic the tfa thing you know is something that was not in the public
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:31.800]  domain but you drove it up the top of the search engine which drew the other media outlets that
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:36.280]  are totally driven by ratings and when they see something at the top of the ratings of a search
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:41.160]  engine then they'll cover the story they're at a self-feeding phenomenon just like buying silver
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:48.280]  the higher it goes the more risk jp morgan's balance sheet is and now the feeding frenzy on tsa
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.400]  is now the media admits this is a total rebellion against government this is just
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:58.280]  totally blowing up in their face they are panicking now yeah it is exactly that it is a
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:04.440]  feeding frenzy because it's the tipping point it's people finally the last humiliation has
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.640]  been born they simply putting someone putting their hand down your pants that was it the public is
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:14.360]  now awake we know you stood on your show for years when is the public going to be awake i think in
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.960]  my opinion you just flipped the switch that you just turned the lights on buddy they are now awake
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.760]  well i want to give the listeners credit i mean we took the initiative here but uh
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.920]  it is exciting max i mean because when people learn they have power then it that becomes a
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:37.960]  feeding frenzy on other issues it's all connected because at the center of all of these issues
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:44.760]  are a central group of folks who don't think the rule applies to them who are engaged in all manner

[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:31.000]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:46.120]  while we're busy watching the tsa and jp morgan and the silver manipulation that they've been
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:53.480]  engaged in they have passed the food safety bill out of the key committee into a larger bill that
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:01:00.440]  they say they have the votes to pass that's roiders they're trying to pass another piece of
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:07.400]  legislation to retroactively legalize the theft of houses without actually having the deed and
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:13.240]  legalizing this robo signing hr 3808 that'd be like if the president got caught killing somebody
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:19.240]  in congress gave him a pardon that's this is a congressional pardon and and and the end of
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:27.480]  property rights to a great extent separately and this is true with this what this emailer said to
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:32.840]  us it's hi alex jones i've been trying to get this message to you uh with the tsa in the news
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:36.120]  things are getting passed in the lame duck session we've been we've been covering it the whole show
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:42.920]  but you're right this one could shut down your website by the government and that sally um that
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.960]  sent me that i don't know if she wants her last name said so i'll just scratch over in fact don't
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:53.960]  you know show the email uh thank you immediate action needed please call your congress reps
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.240]  regarding the bill that she has a link to the government track um and basically it's a law to
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.520]  mirror with the secret copyright treaty where no judge no jury know nothing they just claim
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.840]  that even you know posting part of an article is copyright infringement now there's been some law
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.560]  firms that have been doing that lately but they've been losing in court and they've had to back off
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:23.000]  because it is fair use uh the problem is though if they change the law and say you can't even source
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.560]  or quote something including a hyperlink to something that kills the internet and the free
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.240]  flow of information and that's what they want they don't want you communicating because we're
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:36.920]  kicking their hind end in it is a bill to blacklist access to any website deemed infringing of copyright
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.960]  among other clauses by the federal government and it does more than that it makes everybody get their
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:48.360]  own internet id and that if you ever no judge no jury no due process uh do any quote infringing just
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.240]  because a private party claims it now you're banned from the internet from one year to three years
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:56.840]  some european countries have actually passed something similar they can effectively shut
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:01.480]  down sites like alex jones natural news if they don't agree with the sites agenda all the federal
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:06.440]  government would do is find just one article and miss quote or miss attributes the source and that's
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.320]  it they can shut it down the bill has been in committee before and imagine what this will do
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:16.120]  to social network stuff but was shot down due to protest by liberty loving activists unfortunately
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:21.400]  it looks like it's trying to get passed again in the lame duck session and that's the problem
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:26.280]  the democrats are out of there the republicans are on record they wouldn't pass this i'm not
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.040]  saying they're great but that's what they say they'll do and so they're just ramming everything
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:38.200]  through as a kind of middle finger to everyone here at the end and please take action or we may
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:43.480]  lose the internet as we know it yeah they plan to have internet regulations taxes id numbers the
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:49.400]  new microsoft platforms haven't built in to make you have id to get online it's not activated yet
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:54.440]  but they're trying to push it to be law so the infrastructure is already in place we got a boycott
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  microsoft as much as we can because of that horrible company totally globalist and so yes
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:10.040]  this bill is is is very very serious it's combating online infringement and counterfeits has nothing
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:16.440]  to do with that there's already laws in place for that okay you've already got the digital
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:21.960]  millennium act and all the rest of it this is saying just any company claims anything it's over
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:25.800]  you're done now if they try to pass this and implement it it's going to be lawsuit city it's
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:30.600]  going to shut down so much stuff so many patent trolling lawyers are going to get involved that
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:36.040]  it'll get rewritten as well but the point is they're trying all of this and by the way that
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:43.400]  dovetails with senator rockefeller and get that video ready uh FCC should take fox news msnbc off
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:48.040]  the air and remember his previous quote about we'd be better off without ever having an internet
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:53.480]  i mean these guys these guys are really doing it i mean you understand they're really taking the

[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:18.440]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:23.720]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:29.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:09.160]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:17.800]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network we're making history together against tyranny right now
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:23.320]  i want to play this clip dealing with internet and tv censorship without all these different
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:28.680]  obama's ours like cast sunstein over regulation we've had the FCC diversities are say we need a
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:37.320]  system like jugo chavez has of total government control uh and and j rockefeller you know the
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:44.920]  air to the roc to the rockefeller empire he openly bemoans that everybody'd be friendly if we got
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:54.200]  real news and he's going to decide what real news is he wants to have a happy dialogue to everybody
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:59.160]  to shut up and give their guns up and get rid of the border and let him shut down the internet
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:05.560]  as he's quoted as saying we'd be better off without ever having it because this stuff is
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:11.800]  like holy water to a vampire to these people the fact that we can speak that we have a soapbox
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:16.280]  we can get organized that we're talking to each other they thought they could spam the internet
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:23.560]  dominate it control it get us in fighting people got wise to it it doesn't work pal and so he wants
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:29.400]  to shut down fox and shut down msnbc notice msnbc is always calling for the fairness doctrine which
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:40.120]  is totally unfair notice they're always uh pushing uh and promoting ad nauseam over and over and over
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:46.440]  and over again that they want to censor fox news and talk radio oh we'll see now you're going to get
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:54.200]  censored too and as the dinosaur media falls apart they're not going to end up really censoring
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:00.440]  those guys they're going to selectively enforce on yours truly they cannot allow this information
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:04.840]  to continue to come out because we're having victories against them here's the curtain mo
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:10.360]  article rockefeller wants government to shut down fox and msnbc and he says it kind of half
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:15.080]  jokingly but he goes on to talk about how horrible it is what they're doing all of this in fighting
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:20.120]  we need to all just come together and do what we're told no the founders said it was the opposite
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:30.440]  let's go ahead and play that clip i hunger for quality news i'm tired of the right and the left
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:39.960]  there's a little bug inside of me which wants to get the FCC to say to fox and to and to msnbc
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:47.960]  out off and goodbye would be a big favor to political discourse our ability to do our work
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:53.160]  here in congress and to the american people to be able to talk with each other and have some
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.080]  faith in their government and in their more importantly in their future
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:05.800]  we need slim down channel packages that better respect what we really want to watch
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:12.760]  and we need to find ways to provide greater value for television viewers at lower cost
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:20.280]  because people are tired of always escalating rates again i thank you for being here today
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.400]  and i greatly respect senator carry and the interest he's shown in this whole area
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:33.000]  okay he is most expert so he wants to decide what type of news you see he says oh we need to
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.440]  decide what type of news we want to see but it's going to be the government deciding
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:44.040]  you know how about all the tax money you take from us for pbs and mpr with your fake liberal
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:50.440]  pro-war garbage and your and your pro-terrinary garbage i mean listen to mpr they they talk with

[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:03.720]  ca in the jungle book let's go to youtube and pull up a short clip of ca trying to hypnotize
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:10.680]  mogley of course we're more like sheer con and it doesn't work on those of us that aren't weak
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:16.200]  minded sure con just reaches out and grabs him with a throat when he's trying to hypnotize him
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:23.720]  he's the snake's trying to look at him got the pinwheels going come on come on go under

[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.920]  doesn't work see we need to get to the point when they when they try to hypnotize us for it to
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:40.440]  irritate us and make us angry and focused to quote emperor palpatine use your aggressive
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:46.920]  feelings boy i mean we have these aggressive feelings for a reason to stand up against tyrants
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:52.200]  and thugs the globalists are aggressive they use their aggressive feelings to dominate and
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:57.480]  control us and enslave us and they all were black to intimidate and lord things over us but then
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:06.840]  we're supposed to be sheep like and cow no no more now kaiser's got his search term and i think
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:16.520]  it's important but this one's really important da now sending deputies to san francisco airport
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:29.880]  to investigate felony groping and the search term needs to be investigate felony groping
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:37.320]  investigate felony groping and this will then have thousands of other da's there's tens of
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:43.960]  thousands of counties look at this listen to the audio and the video of my interview with a prominent
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:52.600]  da where the san francisco airport is based who talks about the da south of him where the airport
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:58.760]  in san josea is located also saying and i said well you know you don't have to just get complaints

[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:06.600]  sit us and complain you can go down there and observe it and bust them he said absolutely now
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:11.400]  i've already talked to my deputies who are in the airport to look for it and if they see it slap
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:18.760]  handcuffs on them and i said if they see what hands in the pants felony hands on the crotch
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  through the pants or the buttocks boom misdemeanor but it's a serious arrestable misdemeanor this
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:33.400]  is breaking news he's not just warning him now he's got the cops in there doing their job
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:39.400]  let me tell you police did their job in this country and defended the republic more than just
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:44.440]  revenue generating and the rest of it they would be loved again they'd have giant pot bellies again
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:48.200]  because everybody be running out giving them coffee and pie because they knew the local cop
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.800]  you know because the cop was in their neighborhood because you they went bowling and hunting with
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:58.120]  the cop and if the cop needed help he'd go bang on your door and say help me my grandfather many
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:05.480]  times here in austin they lived up in hide park close to here in austin close to the texas state
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:11.400]  mental institution it was just a few blocks away and the sirens would go off when one of the
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:17.080]  hardcore loons would get out poor people and routinely you know the cops would roll down and
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:22.520]  uh you know they'd see my grandfather in the front yard or they say hey bill will you help me
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:28.600]  um my grandmother told me this story about a couple times the cops would say be on the
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:33.480]  lookout for a rabid dog rabies was a problem back then and routinely you know the cops come
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:37.640]  knock on the door knock a few others there's a dog around here and it's clearly rabid shoot it
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:41.880]  my grandfather would go out and several times saw the dog before the cops did and would shoot it
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:50.680]  when they had the ut shooter at the tower the cops were pinned down citizens pulled up with
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:55.960]  their deer rifles and pinned the other guy down so two cops could get in what an austin police
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:01.400]  and a sheriff's deputy could i've interviewed the austin uh officer later became a texas ranger in
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:09.480]  studio he they went up that tower and killed him before he could kill more people nowadays they
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:13.960]  have swat teams out there staging for 10 hours and it'd be a big standoff the old days they didn't
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:19.400]  need bulletproof vest nothing they just had guts they just went up there and killed the guy now
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:25.080]  gone are the days where the cops driving by on their bullhorn hey bill get out here uh help
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.000]  us shoot this dog we don't know where it is but it's around here it's foaming at the mouth and
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:36.200]  just attack some kid or sirens going off and the cops going help us there's a there's a
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.600]  a loon on the loose see now in austin you try to run out with a gun when there's a rabbit dog
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:48.120]  and shoot it the put they're gonna call swat teams and probably kill you this is the domestication
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:54.920]  of our country all right i'm already digressing off into what police should do um the the issue
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:17:01.000]  here is we need to make investigate felony groping number one or number two i don't care
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.160]  was number one or number two you obviously want to make kaiser's five hundred dollar silver top to
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:11.240]  expose the the the silver manipulation but but this is important investigate felony groping
[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:17.720]  enough da's lineup and start prosecuting these people it doesn't matter the house of cards
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:23.560]  is fallen you realize that these people are not above the law they do not have immunity when
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:29.640]  they're outside of the law it's the law that gives you immunity a citizen has immunity just
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:36.200]  like a cop when you're in the right you have immunity this is all a made up legal precept
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:41.320]  that you've been fed kind of like bush saying i'm the president so i can order torture doesn't
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.480]  matter if it's illegal but then the people he orders to do it go to prison but he doesn't
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:51.720]  they're just getting away with it tyrants practice getting away with crime they shut
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.800]  the precedent to get away with it and they're coming in to try to shut down your local farms
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.280]  and ranches that that looks like it's going to pass they're coming in trying to censor the internet
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.320]  we've been talking about this for months but people are right we need to be on it now
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:09.880]  with that legislation they're coming in to give immunity to the banks to steal your house without
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:16.840]  the proper deed it's all happening but i can do something about what's happening at the airport
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.960]  you know this lame duck group's already been excoriated but they're most of them are leaving
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:25.800]  office so they're angry at the american people instead of repenting they're saying i'll give you
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:30.520]  tyranny so there's not a lot we can do these criminals are up there basically slitting the
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:33.960]  throat of the constitution seven ways to sunday right now because they think they're going to get
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.160]  away with it because they're a lame duck bunch of crooks i mean it's illegal to do what they're
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:43.400]  doing to give retroactive immunity to the big mortgage companies to steal people's houses
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:49.240]  without proper deeds without proper filings or without the paperwork being done properly and
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:58.680]  sworn in front of a notary but congress is just saying they can do it looks like they're going
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:03.160]  to try to pass that call them tell them don't do it you haven't covered it all day let's make

[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:14.440]  to the drudge report there are scores of news articles including one by town hall today that
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:19.160]  properly point out it's matt drudge in the last three weeks that drove this super viral
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:25.480]  he began posting our articles two and a half weeks ago we began pushing it three weeks ago
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:30.840]  about two and a half weeks ago he began posting our articles almost exclusively on it then the
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.720]  feeding friends he started from every angle and reporting and he's been probably posting 1015 articles
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:40.920]  a day or more the best coverage on this overall is right here on this radio show and at drudge
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:47.240]  report dot com and you know i haven't really lobbied drudge on any stories he picks up what he wants
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:53.800]  but i think this is big news i think this is important so regardless listeners please get
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:26:00.520]  this story out da now sending deputies to san francisco airport to investigate felony groping
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:05.320]  and the audio in the next 20 minutes because they're having to you know cut it out of the hour-long
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:12.200]  show um so it's specific to the interview it's easy to do after the show but during the show
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:17.560]  it's recording so it's kind of a hassle uh they're adding the uh the the audio then later the video
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:24.120]  once that's done compressing up there at the top so you can actually hear the da say yes the crimes
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.320]  there's evidence crimes are being committed right now and we're got our sheriff's deputies going over
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:34.680]  there to watch and look for it and that's their jurisdiction and it's a public place so those
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:43.240]  tsa federal goons can't stop them now the goons though are just following their orders that
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:48.440]  doesn't mean what they're doing is okay but it's the higher ups it's pistol uh it's chaired off
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:55.320]  before him it's it's it's big sis and apolitano that are really guilty here and they ask the tsa
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:59.240]  people are you comfortable sticking your hand down pants you comfortable x-ring people and if they
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:05.480]  say no they're fired so most of these tsa people just aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:10.760]  or they love authority and if some bureaucrat tells them you know they can barbecue children on the
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:15.080]  white house lawn they'll start going and barbecue and children a lot of people you just tell them
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:20.600]  something's okay they'll do it the stanford prison study showed that where over 90 of the students
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:26.200]  graduate school would believe they were killing people in experiments and would follow the orders
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:32.920]  because their professor told them well the authority the head of the psychology department said
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:37.480]  deliver a shot of electricity that'll kill the person they'd have the actor act like they were
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:43.880]  dying and they would do it they would commit what they believe were murders that's mind control
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:50.200]  so this is big that they know that there's evidence of a crime being committed and the police are
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:57.160]  coming now the tsl probably stop it for a little while till the cops leave but the point is the

[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:42.120]  on air he's not just now warning them now they know there's evidence of a crime being committed
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:47.400]  they got deputies and they're looking for it and it's felonies if they go inside the pants which
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:55.240]  they admit they're doing and he talked to the da in santa clara county just south of there
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:34:02.040]  where san jose is and confirmed they're looking at it and i was there three weeks ago and saw him
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:07.640]  committing felony saw him sticking hands and pants hands up in crotches uh so this is big

[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.760]  introduction gerald salente of the trends research institute i want to talk about the economy
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:32.360]  i want to talk about the lame duck congress trying to gut openly saying they want to shut
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:39.080]  down talk radio fox news openly saying they want to censor the internet openly passing the food
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.880]  safety bill out of committee and they say it's a done deal now in the larger package of bills
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:49.800]  they have the votes on reuters says it's probably going to pass now um it's all happening right
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:56.360]  now i mean it is bonkers but i believe for three weeks this tsa issue is a focal point
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:01.240]  to teach us that we can rebel and say no that we have dignity and now mainstream media is even
[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:06.200]  saying that it's the biggest story in the world right now going into week number three we did it
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:11.960]  together gerald salente what do you think of what's happening with the tsa well you're right it's
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:19.320]  it's a worldwide issue i just got back from france and uh and england and i can tell you that when
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:26.760]  you go take the channel from from england to france you don't get groped they won't harass
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:33.240]  you like they do here and it's become an international issue because a lot of my european
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:40.120]  colleagues and friends don't want to come to the united states because they don't feel like being
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:47.960]  harassed as we all are all being subjected to so at a time when our business and tourism
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:56.600]  industry is starting to regain some strength the tsa and the brains in washington are making sure
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:03.480]  that they're going to nip it in the bud if you will because a lot of people don't want the bud felt
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:12.280]  and i for one you know i'm a heterosexual guy and i like women and i don't want any guy playing
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:19.880]  with me so i'm one of those people that opt out rather than because i'm concerned about the over
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:29.000]  radiation and i think it's only some some knit with bureaucrat from the tsa or some uh you know
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:36.920]  washington wanker could have come up with this scheme to have guys feel up other guys i mean
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:43.720]  who and then you're supposed to take it oh oh that's okay yeah let's some guy in your staff over
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:50.440]  there alex start playing around with your jewels to see if you're hiding anything under them i mean
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:57.800]  who made this up well look look i mean uh if my dad you know gets in my space which never really
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:02.280]  happened but you know by the time you're 16 dad gets in your space then you have that classic
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:08.520]  confrontation with dad i don't like family getting in my space i don't like my neighbor getting in my
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:13.160]  space i mean i'm not saying i'm a tough guy but quite a few times in high school and college some
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:18.200]  bully get in my face and i'd go ahead and break their nose i mean this isn't in your space this is
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:23.880]  hands down your pants now have you seen them confirm that you know i was sitting next to a
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:31.240]  woman i i just came back from las vegas this week and she was 80 something years old and she's a
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:41.240]  diabetic they saw needles in her package they gave this woman a pat down and they humiliated her
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:47.320]  first they wanted to do it in some part in public and then they took it to the private room but they
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:55.000]  made her leave her shoes way back near the machine over there i mean this is what's going on you've
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:02.120]  got a bunch of losers over here that couldn't get a job at at mcdonald's because they're probably too
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:09.160]  stupid to flip a burger and now they have feeling people up i mean who made up this stupid thing
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:15.080]  and as we wrote in our last trend alert and we knew it back when it happened that guy what's his
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:21.720]  name jerk off jerked off the guy from tsa that used to be the homeland no i mean i mean his name
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:28.920]  is michael jerk off yes yes and and what he did is he went around after the underwear bomber back
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:37.160]  on christmas day uh it was going to ignite himself he then made the media rounds everywhere
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:43.320]  that slimy little we never pointed out that he heads up the company and gets the money
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:50.440]  that's right he's now a consultant the jerk off group and he and he one of his clients
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:57.720]  his rapist scan the people that make this yes rapist scan yes yes and and so this is never
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:04.680]  mentioned by the main street media who sucks up bows down and kisses up to these clowns
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:10.760]  so the whole thing is a scam but now it's falling in now the big orlando airport saying
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:14.280]  they're not going to do it because it's not a law they just invited the thugs in
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.720]  now we had the da on other da's are moving and now they're dispatching
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:23.560]  sheriff's deputies there to look for the crime and they're going to charge them with felonies
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:30.920]  this is breaking news yeah so listen so any guy that goes to the airport that doesn't want to be
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:37.560]  felt up by another guy say listen i want a woman to check me out i mean who's to say who made up
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:43.480]  the lord of the guy has to stick his hand in my pants if somebody's gonna fill me up you know i
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:49.800]  want a woman and if she's not even pretty i'll close my eyes and maybe i could have a happy ending
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:55.080]  who knows all right that's enough family show a little out of control but we have to talk about
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:02.600]  this because the government i mean i had a radio talk show host on uh he goes by uh oh doctor and
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:08.920]  i had him on and it made international news uh tuesday it was the biggest story in the world
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:13.160]  according to alexa because drudge report top link the big giant link i mean i've never seen such
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:18.520]  traffic our servers were just groaning and i mean drudge is king i mean i've been linked new york
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:23.720]  times nothing i've been all over cnn websites nothing i've been linked you know top of google
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:30.760]  nothing or a little something compared to drudge that nothing can compare and uh that was important
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:36.600]  news because we showed what happened to him and local newscast where they now it's always more
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:42.360]  more more gerald they stick the hand in the front of the pants in the pants and actually squeeze
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:47.720]  the the man or the woman's privates to make sure it's real and then they stick it in behind you in
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.800]  the crack i hate to get into this folks was what the government's doing we have to talk about it
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:57.480]  i mean this is an act of submission it's an act of domination breaking our will and i guarantee
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:01.960]  you people didn't say no here gerald next it's going to be cavity searches what's going to happen
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:07.960]  with some lunatic you know muslim extremists that the government jacks up on drugs and protects
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:12.600]  like the underwear bomber and and gets them on the plane with a hand grenade inside of them now
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:18.200]  we're going to have to have proctology exams at the airport well you know you know the reason why this
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:24.280]  is uh bringing such outrage and by the way congratulations on all the media that you're
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:30.280]  getting on this and i saw you on drudge of course as well the the reason there's so much outrage
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:37.960]  is that the people are directly being affected by it they could feel it literally and that's why
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:45.080]  there's no outrage going on against these wars that are slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:52.920]  and draining our treasuries are trillions because they did away with the draft so the people aren't
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:42:01.160]  affected by it when you're affected by it and you feel it then you revolt and that's what's
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:08.680]  going on now and that's why this is such a critical issue well gerald gerald i person knows that the
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:16.200]  tsa and washington has gone over the line gerald just to be clear and i'm not tooting your horn
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:21.640]  or my horn just you need credit for this but i'm not bragging that this is the biggest story
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:27.560]  i'm excited because this is the biggest story and it's not lindsay lohan or oj simpson robbing
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:34.840]  a hotel room this is a news about a rebellion about a waking up about the light switch going on
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:41.160]  and you said four or five months ago you said that by december the depression would be evident
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.600]  you said that there would be more of a rebellion and that people would accelerate their awakening
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:51.400]  you didn't know the trigger you just saw it in the cards and some have said now that we're into
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:56.040]  middle of november i get emails they go where's the total depression where's the total collapse
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.400]  well again if you specifically look at what you said you said the depression and the implosion
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:06.920]  would become evident look at the dollar look at gold look at them having to legalize taking
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:14.600]  houses without having a deed we are in an implosion i mean we're already here so so i believe you're
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:20.120]  99.9 right and we're going to see now in the next month exactly what happens but we're seeing
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.960]  the accelerated anger manifest we're seeing the media go from not saying double depth to going
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:32.280]  yeah this is kind of a depression uh so they're trying to push false reality that everything's
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:37.800]  great and only some people are buying it what's your statement on that look what's going on
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:46.600]  overseas look what's going on over in ireland spain portugal greece greece there's a there's a
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:56.920]  depression going on there's a currency crisis going on the the the bank debt alone in ireland is worth
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:05.560]  50 percent of ireland's gdp just the bank debt there's no getting out of it and people are jumping
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:11.640]  out of the euro and into the dollar out of the dollar into the euro yeah how about jumping out
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:18.200]  of the titanic and into the lucetania and that's why gold prices are going through the roof that's
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:24.920]  why silver prices are going up anybody that believes that the government what the government is
[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:31.640]  telling them hey they should believe the tsa as well no this thing is collapsing what do they
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:38.200]  need to get hit over the head no you're absolutely right i mean i made a video two three months ago
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:45.960]  where i said you know world worships lebron james while economy collapses and and i and i see
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:51.160]  comments in the in the half million views most the people agree it's like you know 95 percent agree
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:56.280]  less than five percent disagree in the in the thumbs up thumbs down you can go check it but
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:00.760]  or at least last time i looked at the point is some are going this guy said we'd have a collapse
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:07.480]  where is it i mean don't people understand that it's just rotting like a fish it takes a week or two
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:12.840]  to do it you know it's rotting the maggots are coming out of it in front of us and they're
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:17.800]  they're some of them are still in denial but as you said the good news is more and more people
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:24.120]  aren't in denial yes you know i was on fox a couple of weeks ago right before election day
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:29.400]  and they asked me what would the elections bring about what change and i said well the change would
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:37.480]  be basically the same as if the gambinos took over for the bananas one crime family after another
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:43.240]  and you can see the makeup of the house and the senate and it's a crime family the republicans
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:49.160]  and the democrats and then they had this guy on there as i was talking about the problems in the
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:55.800]  economy this little this little whimper krat what's his name combs remember how did he in combs
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:02.520]  well the combs that's left and he goes well you know i had this guy on my show before and he's
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:10.920]  nothing but an alarmist oh yeah i'm an alarmist listen everybody out there follow obama follow
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:20.840]  bush follow your leader follow barna follow pelosi follow flag follow mcconnell and follow
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:29.880]  him over the cliff because if you think that they got the answers i have news for you you're a loser
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:37.320]  you're a loser if you follow Bernanke if you believe greenspan if i had a track record
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:44.600]  as bad as Bernanke's i would have been left out of business 30 years ago and here's what Bernanke
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:53.800]  said in 2005 he said there won't be any real estate crisis home prices have never fell in
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:47:00.680]  this country nationwide and then he said right in the midst of the subprime problem as it began
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:09.800]  in 2007 oh no it's not a big deal and it won't spread and then in 2007 as the recession has
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:16.280]  just begun he's telling people there won't be a recession and then that criminal bush is back
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:24.280]  in business did you see him out there hawking his book you know he said they were blindsided by
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:33.800]  the great economic crisis oh blindsided is he either ignorant or is he lying because they kept
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:41.560]  telling us the fundamentals of the economy is sound you want to follow these clowns then follow
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:49.880]  john stewart and go to his uh i hope you were there at his rally for sanity could you imagine
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:57.080]  donald duck and mickey mouse leading a rally for sanity and this is the guy that americans think
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:03.400]  and turn out he secretly met with he secretly met with geithner and his job is to pacify
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:09.960]  at that rally he said sit down don't be angry everything's good it was like maria entoinette
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:16.360]  saying let him eat cake you know why you know his brother is yeah he's the head of the new york
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:24.440]  stock exchange as a co over the stock exchange you get it harvard princeton yell bullets bombs and

[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:38.040]  and i agree with you i mean just six months ago they bailed out europe it's happening again it's
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:42.280]  a black hole mathematically i've had all the top economists on there's no way to pay it back
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:48.280]  they had a bizarre meeting at jekyll island a week ago and uh the former head of the fed
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:54.280]  you know now a rat leaving the sinking ship talked about criminality and banks and and so
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:57.960]  greenspan is trying to tell you about criminals he's the guy that helped get rid of the glass
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:03.240]  stigal act these guys know exactly what they're doing and they're scared they want to get away
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:08.280]  with it that's why they've set up this police state as a rearguard action to get away with their
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:15.000]  crimes but i don't see it happening uh jerald and the world is in a depression your prediction is
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.920]  right i mean we are in a depression and and the collapse is becoming more and more evident well

[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:32.600]  a lot worse because they're devaluing the dollar as you know you can't keep printing digital money
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:38.120]  out of thin air backed by nothing and worth nothing that's not worth the paper it's not printed on
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:45.560]  number one so that we know that there's a currency war you're hearing it from montega from brazil
