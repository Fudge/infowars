[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.770]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.351]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:12.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:17.072]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:30.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:31.657]  Okay, folks, we're live.
[00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:32.757]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:44.064]  I'm going to try to control myself and get to most if not all of this important news that I have in front of me today.
[00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:57.227]  And to try to be calm and not get too excited so that I can engage in some higher brain function here and actually break down some of the subtle nuances of what we face in this society.
[00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:10.311]  It is Tuesday, the 18th day of January, 2011, and we've got Dr. Andrew Wakefield joining us in studio in the last hour.
[00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:12.693]  He's an Austinite.
[00:01:12.693 --> 00:01:22.781]  Of course, the media has been demonizing him for years, A, claiming he's the only person to ever make a link between vaccines and brain damage.
[00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.943]  They have a cover name for it, autism.
[00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.002]  The whole basket of disorders and problems.
[00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:35.785]  And they keep hoaxing and claiming that he's been discredited and proven to be a fraud.
[00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:40.188]  When you read the fine print, they admit, well, we can't replicate his study.
[00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:42.830]  Or, well, he used his own patience.
[00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.052]  A lot of people use their own patience in studies.
[00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:55.118]  It's very similar to the hoax we saw a few weeks ago, claiming that the shooter in Tucson was a conservative.
[00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.872]  And that free speech was to blame, or that this radio show or my films were to blame.
[00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.712]  Just another hoax.
[00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:06.393]  And they do this constantly.
[00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:10.274]  They just make declarative statements.
[00:02:10.274 --> 00:02:16.996]  And this is a big deal, because when you look at even the British government this year,
[00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:30.536]  Now, last year, 2010, after the flu season of 09-10, they came out and said a tenfold increase in seizures in children that have taken the flu shot.
[00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:34.858]  That was London Telegraph, BBC, you name it.
[00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:45.101]  And a massive increase in narcolepsy, a massive increase in people getting different disorders, seizure disorders, directly connected to the vaccine.
[00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:46.742]  Well, what is Dr. Wakefield saying?
[00:02:48.305 --> 00:03:06.724]  Dr. Wakefield is saying in his studies it showed that it's causing some type of autoimmune response in the brain, which is what Dr. Russell Blaylock, brain surgeon, has said here, and countless others from their own research and other research that's been done by prestigious organizations.
[00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:09.327]  So what they'll do is they will cherry pick
[00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:29.732]  One doctor to single them out and claim it's all discredited so they can just say, hey, doesn't matter if it was 1 in 25,000 people in 1980 getting autism, and now it was 168 a few years ago, now they're saying it's 1 in 87.
[00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:36.855]  They're saying it could be 1 in 50 if the trend continues, then if it continues on, it's exponential, hyperbolic, it'll be 1 in 10.
[00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:42.889]  And then they spin it and say, oh, this is over-diagnosis.
[00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.911]  This is children making it up.
[00:03:46.911 --> 00:04:02.537]  And certainly, there are psychologists and psychiatrists and neurologists and people who will just take a kid that's got some quirks and call it autism, when really, they're just eccentric.
[00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:04.058]  Or have something like Asperger's.
[00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:15.587]  Which is, again, just a scientific name for a certain type of, you know, individual who kind of focuses in on things myopically.
[00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:17.309]  And they're putting labels on everything.
[00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.750]  Some of it's got some truth to it.
[00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.271]  A lot of it doesn't have truth to it.
[00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:24.113]  But the issue is, let's say there's some over-reporting.
[00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.915]  That doesn't give you from 1 in 25,000 to
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:45.386]  1 in 168 or 1 out of 2,000 to what we see today.
[00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:53.591]  And you go to the park, you go to public places, there are kids who are so autistic they're not even in this reality all over the place.
[00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:55.532]  They're not faking that.
[00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:55.853]  Okay?
[00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:56.413]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.400]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.801]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:18.182]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.182 --> 00:05:23.063]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:25.204]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:31.768]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:34.070]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.391]  Call us.
[00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:48.085]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:55.870]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:10.620]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.005]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:19.047]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.047 --> 00:06:21.369]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:27.634]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.634 --> 00:06:30.996]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:36.501]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:36.761 --> 00:06:38.402]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:39.702]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:39.702 --> 00:06:42.383]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:46.605]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:51.227]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:53.828]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:06:53.828 --> 00:06:57.689]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:58.690]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.573]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:04.694]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:09.258]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:15.203]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:07:15.203 --> 00:07:17.365]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:20.047]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:26.891]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:29.092]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:07:29.092 --> 00:07:34.436]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:07:34.436 --> 00:07:39.719]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:45.082]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:46.183]  This will freeze the cost
[00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:49.445]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:50.886]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:17.245]  Another broadcast, another transmission.
[00:08:17.245 --> 00:08:22.669]  It is Tuesday, the 18th day of January 2011.
[00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.272]  The founder of the Eagle Forum.
[00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:36.429]  Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly will be joining us for the last 30 minutes of the next hour today.
[00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:43.660]  I saw a Fox News article yesterday about how, you know, the Tea Partiers are being taught their place by the mainline Republicans.
[00:08:45.228 --> 00:09:04.245]  And Cheney is saluting Obama for learning the ways of Bush and it's reportedly going to be business as usual and the Democrats and Republicans coming together to fleece the American people with a value-added tax on top of the income tax and all the carbon taxes and the rest of it.
[00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:08.728]  More and more it looks like the Republicans might try half-heartedly to repeal
[00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:18.614]  Government takeover of healthcare, they'll lie about it and say it's communist and socialist, which would be bad when really it's fascist written by the insurance companies.
[00:09:18.614 --> 00:09:26.718]  If Republicans actually told the truth, like Ron Paul does, and said this was written by the insurance companies, corporate fascism, the left would shut up.
[00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:41.074]  And the right would have an epiphany and realize that megacorporations are the ones creating and financing the big government to give their oligopolies and monopolies and combines power to consolidate vertically.
[00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:49.793]  But the Republicans are saying, yeah, we're going to try to repeal the communist health care in the House.
[00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:55.058]  And I get to hear the neocon talk show every day saying Obama's a Marxist and he's a communist.
[00:09:55.058 --> 00:10:00.082]  Not in the sense that these conservatives are claiming.
[00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:03.285]  They don't want to take your property and distribute it to the poor.
[00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:05.366]  They want to take your property and give it to themselves.
[00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:25.157]  They want you to be a feudal serf, and they've got an army of domesticated welfare people who they now recruit to be TSA and police officers and spies, that's where they're getting their recruits, and military people who are trained as attack dogs to sick the middle class.
[00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:30.899]  Sick gun owners, sick someone with a cowboy hat on, sick crackers as
[00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:36.518]  As Chris Matthews would say, crackers are bad, white people are inherently evil.
[00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:45.186]  I mean, it's all a system where the police are trained, blacks must all be criminals, get them.
[00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.367]  White crackers are evil, get them.
[00:10:47.367 --> 00:11:01.432]  You know, just everybody's evil, but you're loving bankers up on the mountain, way up above us in the heights, lovingly making the grass grow, making the sun shine each and every single day.
[00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:06.554]  So Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who they're trying to demonize and discredit,
[00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:28.152]  He is an academic gastrointestinal doctor and he did amazing research that's been proven to be correct over and over again dealing with autism and autoimmune response and these antibodies in the intestines of the autistic children that he tested
[00:11:31.138 --> 00:11:35.581]  We've had so many other medical doctors on to back up what he, a medical doctor, is saying as well.
[00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:41.946]  They're doing this big hoax right now to try to discredit him, claiming he's been discredited with no proof.
[00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:45.768]  British researcher Wakefield defends link between vaccines and autism.
[00:11:45.768 --> 00:11:50.712]  British researcher holds true to his study despite claims of falsified data.
[00:11:52.352 --> 00:11:54.713]  Remember Gary Webb?
[00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:58.595]  He went to the hearings of Ricky Ross and others.
[00:11:58.595 --> 00:12:01.637]  It came out that the CIA was shipping in the narcotics.
[00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:08.340]  Later the government had to admit that in the 1997 CIA hearings in Congress with the CIA Inspector General.
[00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:14.518]  There's just countless cases of aircraft crashing run by the U.S.
[00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:17.060]  government filled with heroin and cocaine.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:26.947]  Now in the year 2010-2011, they admit on Fox News that our troops give the fertilizer to the Taliban to grow the opium and record levels are pouring out.
[00:12:26.947 --> 00:12:30.009]  But they gave the Pulitzer Prize to Gary Webb.
[00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:31.430]  They gave him the Pulitzer Prize.
[00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.491]  Then they ran this hoax.
[00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:33.591]  Shane.
[00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:54.602]  They
[00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:24.856]  He told Sully Castillo that, former DEA agent, he told others that, and then the usual suspects went on air and said, oh, it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head, and Sully Castillo and Ricky Ross, they're lying.
[00:13:24.856 --> 00:13:25.636]  He didn't say that.
[00:13:25.636 --> 00:13:28.097]  He lived in a one-story house.
[00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:34.919]  Spinning the fact that he'd moved because of the break-ins to another town from the two-story to the one-story.
[00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:45.497]  See, they always play little semantical games counting on you not paying attention.
[00:13:45.497 --> 00:13:51.360]  They always play these little games, you know, with things.
[00:13:52.512 --> 00:13:56.234]  So, ignore the forest of evidence.
[00:13:56.234 --> 00:14:02.998]  They'll go and show you one fallen over tree, that you never even talked about, and discuss, oh look at it, it's fallen over.
[00:14:02.998 --> 00:14:04.718]  Is this little area really a forest?
[00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:08.881]  It's kind of a small, hundred square foot meadow here.
[00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.682]  He's lying, we're not in a forest.
[00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:15.944]  We're in a meadow, and you're like, but we're in a forest here, and this is a tiny meadow within the forest.
[00:14:15.944 --> 00:14:20.587]  See, they play little semantical diversion games, distraction games.
[00:14:21.047 --> 00:14:24.810]  with people and it works like a charm.
[00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:33.476]  And so I can't tell you how many neocons and people have sent me emails over the year of comments going, oh, Gary Webb, that was discredited.
[00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:35.417]  None of it was discredited.
[00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:38.520]  None of it.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.603]  What did Popular Mechanics do?
[00:14:42.603 --> 00:14:49.688]  They came out and did their debunking and said there was only one interception of a jet aircraft in the year
[00:14:51.715 --> 00:14:56.757]  Preceding 9-11-2001, September 11th.
[00:14:56.757 --> 00:15:08.543]  And I was going through their book on debunking, and it was just all disinfo, but on that one point, I had been called into a talk show that the head of Popper Mechanics was on, James Maggs, because he will not come on this show or any other show and debate.
[00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:15.026]  He has to have it, you know, be a one-sided, his side only, because he can't debate.
[00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:20.829]  And I said, here's the Reuters article, here's the date, where the spokesman for NORAD, the Air Force Major,
[00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:24.768]  Four months before 9-11 gave a press conference.
[00:15:24.768 --> 00:15:49.223]  Here's another article, gave the headline, where he, eight months before 9-11, gave a speech and bragged about the 156 times that they'd intercepted aircraft in the year before, including Payne Stewart, and you say it only happened one time, that it was Payne Stewart, and that the Air Force rarely intercepts, and that the fact that the jets were launched late and told to fly at almost stalling speed,
[00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:57.675]  The point is they just put out a book saying that there had been one interception in the year before when there had been over 150.
[00:15:57.675 --> 00:16:10.604]  And they just state these things like they're facts, like we're supposed to just accept it and receive it, and they're counting on us doing that.
[00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:12.405]  Or a lot of times they'll just ridicule.
[00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:17.388]  They'll say, oh, I, um,
[00:16:22.702 --> 00:16:26.223]  I think it's kooky to think that fluoride is bad for you.
[00:16:26.223 --> 00:16:36.727]  You know, it's in comedies, it's in movies, it's in dramas where the crazy bad neighbor who's evil or a child abuser or a terrorist is into things being in the water.
[00:16:37.506 --> 00:16:54.398]  I mean, I can't tell you how many TV show plots I've seen, clips of on YouTube, where they're looking for the mastermind who wants to launch the bio attack in New York, and they find out it's a crazy professor who's concerned about chemtrails and fluoride in the water, and so he's a crazy man who wants to blow up children.
[00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:56.549]  And it doesn't even make sense.
[00:16:56.549 --> 00:17:04.417]  It's just the message is if you are warning people about poisons in the water and food, you want to blow up children.
[00:17:04.417 --> 00:17:10.463]  It's just it's just nonsensical, mindless propaganda at a bestial level.
[00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:12.445]  But I am digressing.
[00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:14.467]  I'm going to come back and get into the news.
[00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:15.287]  I just thought I would
[00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.331]  Talk about Dr. Andrew Wakefield is going to be in studio with us today.
[00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.772]  Look forward to that.
[00:17:22.772 --> 00:17:29.814]  I've interviewed him several times over the years over the phone, but now he's going to be in studio with us today.
[00:17:29.814 --> 00:17:32.915]  And I know he's been doing national TV rounds.
[00:17:32.915 --> 00:17:34.516]  He just kicked off yesterday.
[00:17:34.516 --> 00:17:36.597]  What was he on yesterday?
[00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.197]  Good Morning America.
[00:17:38.197 --> 00:17:39.918]  But this won't be sound bites.
[00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:46.300]  He'll be able to really break down this hoax.
[00:17:47.756 --> 00:17:58.179]  I mean, they've been saying this about him for years, and they say, he's discredited, he launched a hoax, and you read the article, well, there's a few questions about some of the ways he conducted the test.
[00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:00.320]  They don't even really say what.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.321]  They just say, he's discredited.
[00:18:02.321 --> 00:18:08.242]  Oh, Gary Webb, Pulitzer Prize winner, he's discredited.
[00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:12.684]  If memory serves, though, they didn't take his Pulitzer Prize.
[00:18:12.684 --> 00:18:14.965]  But, you know, here we are, 12, 14 years,
[00:18:17.415 --> 00:18:27.203]  After his Pulitzer Prize, and the big firestorm that caused, and all the other investigative reporters, you know, publishing their reports, they sure got him, didn't they?
[00:18:27.203 --> 00:18:34.028]  They said he was discredited and they shot him twice in the head with a shotgun.
[00:18:34.028 --> 00:18:42.555]  Man, I mean, I hope they don't blow up my car in my front yard and the police are so corrupt that they tell everybody, oh, his car just caught on fire like that woman in D.C.
[00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.698]  a week ago, ahead of the big energy merger.
[00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:56.216]  Or Benazir Bhutto, the machine gunner on national TV, and it's all over the foreign press, her being shot, but our news says she fell and hit her head.
[00:18:56.216 --> 00:19:00.937]  That's what they think of us here in this country.
[00:19:00.937 --> 00:19:10.439]  And I think of all the other hoaxes they run, where they murder people and
[00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:22.215]  Remember all the Clinton people who would get shot repeatedly and they'd be found with their arms and legs and some cases heads cut off in trash dumps in one case?
[00:19:22.215 --> 00:19:28.398]  And the Arkansas medical examiner, Fannie Malick, would rule it a suicide.
[00:19:28.398 --> 00:19:37.783]  And this is all part of just setting the precedent that they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, right out in the open and nothing is done to them.
[00:19:39.818 --> 00:19:46.944]  Okay, coming up, Nassar's Hanson says he imposed Chinese totalitarianism on America.
[00:19:46.944 --> 00:19:48.926]  We've got the Stuxnet virus attack.
[00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:52.309]  Russia warns of Iranian Chernobyl.
[00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:57.354]  We've got this David Rockefeller video by a great InfoWars listener.
[00:19:57.354 --> 00:19:58.074]  They're in Chile.
[00:19:58.074 --> 00:19:59.155]  We want to salute them.
[00:19:59.155 --> 00:19:59.736]  That's coming up.
[00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:04.431]  New year, new way to smoke, and it's Totally Wicked!
[00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:09.618]  Introducing Totally Wicked e-liquid electronic cigarettes, the highest quality e-cigarettes in the world.
[00:20:09.618 --> 00:20:18.290]  With Totally Wicked e-liquid cigarettes, there's no flame, no secondhand smoke, no carbon monoxide, no tar, no unsightly brown teeth or fingers, and no lingering smell.
[00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.493]  Totally Wicked e-liquid cigarettes have a battery charge that lasts up to eight hours.
[00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:28.697]  Plus, with the Totally Wicked Tornado model, the average pack-a-day smoker is likely to save over a thousand dollars a year.
[00:20:28.697 --> 00:20:31.158]  The Totally Wicked Tornado provides a storm of vapor.

[00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.166]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:03.010]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.032]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:05.933]  debt crises.
[00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:06.974]  You heard me right.
[00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.456]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[00:21:09.456 --> 00:21:13.119]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:19.985]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:21.746]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:21.746 --> 00:21:28.930]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:36.775]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:40.477]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.780]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.963]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:47.045]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[00:21:47.045 --> 00:21:47.326]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.074 --> 00:22:02.436]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:04.757]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:07.979]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:13.083]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:17.286]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.606 --> 00:22:19.928]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:19.928 --> 00:22:22.829]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:25.731]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:25.731 --> 00:22:33.336]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:39.071]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:41.912]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:41.912 --> 00:22:45.594]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:46.674]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:46.674 --> 00:22:48.015]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.015 --> 00:22:49.515]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:59.815 --> 00:23:02.097]  Not all protein supplements are created equal.
[00:23:02.097 --> 00:23:11.086]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:23.798]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life, that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:25.418]  What are the benefits?
[00:23:25.418 --> 00:23:38.441]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:39.381]  Who's it for?
[00:23:39.381 --> 00:23:48.423]  Busy people, hard-working executives, students, teachers, active seniors, people recovering from illness, office workers, construction workers, and high-performance athletes.
[00:23:48.883 --> 00:23:52.306]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:54.429]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:08.649]  Let me do this.
[00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:11.090]  In this short segment, I'm just going to read headlines.
[00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:30.778]  Coming up the next, I'm going to dive into them, get into this incredible confrontation in Chile by a YouTube blogger with David Rockefeller coming in from the airport with the big media magnate who owns the biggest share, from what I read, of South American media, Mr. Eastman.
[00:24:30.778 --> 00:24:34.940]  And it's David Rockefeller in a wheelchair, the grand overlord of the New World Order,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.842]  Uh, who does start to, he is looking like he's getting a bit senile.
[00:24:38.842 --> 00:24:43.724]  Uh, laughing at the guy while he screams at him, we're not your slaves.
[00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:46.505]  We know you want to carry out eugenics and population reduction.
[00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:49.286]  Uh, we know that you're into all of this tyranny.
[00:24:49.286 --> 00:24:50.647]  Get out of Chile.
[00:24:50.647 --> 00:24:51.467]  You will fail.
[00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:54.009]  You will fail in English and Spanish.
[00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:54.409]  Beautiful.
[00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:03.453]  And then I was heartened to see when I went to his YouTube channel that he's got translated into Spanish a whole bunch of my films and my show.
[00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:08.435]  A lot of folks do that in Chinese, Spanish, German, Japanese, Russian.
[00:25:08.435 --> 00:25:17.438]  I salute all of you and we are all brothers and sisters together across the world for liberty and freedom against the global corporate board.
[00:25:17.998 --> 00:25:18.618]  I don't think so.
[00:25:42.794 --> 00:25:56.687]  The next most powerful would have to be We Are Change Chicago, who absolutely dominated and owned, to use an internet parlance or nomenclature, owned Al Gore a few years ago.
[00:25:57.714 --> 00:26:01.156]  Of course, that's had over a million views on YouTube alone.
[00:26:01.156 --> 00:26:05.658]  Okay, I said I'd get to the news, and I started already getting into that video that's coming up.
[00:26:05.658 --> 00:26:14.703]  And then a really creepy PBS trailer for Frontline getting into something we told you about 10 years ago, but at least now they admit it.
[00:26:14.703 --> 00:26:18.405]  How the face scanning cameras tie into the license plate readers.
[00:26:18.405 --> 00:26:22.007]  They've gone up nationwide, and they're now introducing this to the slaves.
[00:26:22.007 --> 00:26:24.009]  Remember, more than
[00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:41.722]  Fourteen years after I exposed, because it was public, the Telecommunications Act, dealing with spy networks, spy grids, how they were listening to all our phones, emails, faxes, with AI keyword systems, with no warrants, frontline
[00:26:42.725 --> 00:26:46.786]  A few years ago had a big special and it was, it was breaking.
[00:26:46.786 --> 00:26:48.427]  It was groundbreaking.
[00:26:48.427 --> 00:26:52.108]  It was, oh my goodness, gracious gumdrops.
[00:26:52.108 --> 00:26:53.949]  Bush is so evil.
[00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:58.570]  Obama comes in, slams the pedal all the way down to the floor.
[00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:05.112]  And the left goes, rendition, secret torture, torturing people's kids in front of their parents, expanded wars.
[00:27:05.112 --> 00:27:07.473]  We love it.
[00:27:07.473 --> 00:27:10.234]  It's like Ron Silver reportedly when Clinton was getting sworn in in 93.
[00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.432]  I was, by Hillary, going, look at those planes, look at that military.
[00:27:16.432 --> 00:27:18.593]  What are they doing flying over here?
[00:27:18.593 --> 00:27:21.654]  And she's like, relax, we run things now.
[00:27:21.654 --> 00:27:23.395]  Those are our planes.
[00:27:23.395 --> 00:27:24.995]  And Ron Silver went, ugh.
[00:27:24.995 --> 00:27:26.256]  That was actually in the newspapers.
[00:27:26.256 --> 00:27:28.777]  He was, you know, the press saw it and wrote it down.
[00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:30.818]  He was, what are they flying jets over?
[00:27:30.818 --> 00:27:32.539]  That's the enemy, ha, U.S.
[00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:33.779]  military.
[00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:35.860]  Just so anti-American, anti-military.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.341]  And Hillary's like, don't worry, Ron.
[00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:39.341]  We've taken over.
[00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:40.282]  Those are ours now.
[00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:43.542]  I digress.
[00:27:43.542 --> 00:27:46.745]  Here is Dick Cheney from The Hill today.
[00:27:46.745 --> 00:27:54.032]  Cheney, Obama has learned that Bush policies were right.
[00:27:54.032 --> 00:28:04.181]  President Obama has learned from experience that some of the Bush administration's decision on terrorism issues were necessary, according to former Vice President Dick Cheney.
[00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:05.082]  I had a Freudian slip.
[00:28:05.082 --> 00:28:06.043]  He was the president.
[00:28:08.757 --> 00:28:11.400]  So we're going to be getting into some of that.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:18.287]  If anybody had any doubt that WikiLeaks is a CIA front, Julian Assange may be a useful idiot.
[00:28:18.287 --> 00:28:21.330]  In fact, I believe he is.
[00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.471]  But if there was ever any doubt...
[00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:27.569]  This new Tunisian stuff targeting Tunisia and the WikiLeaks.
[00:28:27.569 --> 00:28:32.652]  Now they're going to release 2,000 prominent rich people who've got Swiss bank accounts.
[00:28:32.652 --> 00:28:35.074]  And you better believe George Soros isn't going to be on the list.
[00:28:35.074 --> 00:28:40.458]  He's heavily involved financing WikiLeaks through his right-hand man who basically runs it.
[00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:45.261]  And they're now going to burn some, you know, low-level billionaires and millionaires.
[00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:48.944]  And that's all part of the OECD global movement to gut
[00:28:52.639 --> 00:29:02.287]  The Swiss bank accounts of the lower level nouveau riche and because that's an official UN policy and he always follows UN State Department policy.
[00:29:02.287 --> 00:29:06.290]  So ex-banker says he's giving WikiLeaks files on the rich.
[00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:10.293]  Remember almost a year ago our inside sources said it would be banking by the end of it.
[00:29:10.293 --> 00:29:17.879]  See they can't have NSA or NATO or InfoPoll 9 stuff they've recorded and all the data and all the know your customer.
[00:29:17.879 --> 00:29:21.361]  The government's got live access to all your bank accounts in live time that's now admitted.
[00:29:22.262 --> 00:29:24.169]  They can't just release it to burn their enemies.
[00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:26.739]  It has to be leaked by the traitor!
[00:29:27.777 --> 00:29:31.159]  Assange, or for some, the hero Assange.
[00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:38.122]  And then they juxtapose it in their psychological warfare model to then use Assange to also crack down on free speech on the internet.
[00:29:38.122 --> 00:29:44.246]  So then you're forced to support Assange in what he's doing, even though it's the CIA.
[00:29:44.246 --> 00:29:48.468]  Because within their master template, if you don't support him, then they have a victory against free speech.
[00:29:48.468 --> 00:29:50.729]  See the mastermind control?
[00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:52.150]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.651]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.637 --> 00:30:01.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:05.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.921]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:13.722]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.722 --> 00:30:20.103]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.103 --> 00:30:22.324]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.884 --> 00:30:23.184]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.184 --> 00:30:23.705]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:24.365]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:25.466]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.466 --> 00:30:27.887]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:49.062]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:31:52.706 --> 00:31:53.527]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:04.401]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:05.321]  Number one.
[00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:08.744]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.744 --> 00:32:09.604]  Number two.
[00:32:09.604 --> 00:32:14.507]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.507 --> 00:32:15.248]  It's true.
[00:32:15.248 --> 00:32:20.111]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.111 --> 00:32:20.931]  Number three.
[00:32:20.931 --> 00:32:24.534]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.534 --> 00:32:28.216]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.436 --> 00:32:29.216]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:31.977]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.977 --> 00:32:35.659]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.659 --> 00:32:36.459]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:40.601]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.601 --> 00:32:45.663]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:49.824]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.824 --> 00:32:51.625]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:56.207]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:57.708 --> 00:33:24.783]  Well, I won't back down No, I won't back down You can stand me up at the gates of hell But I won't back down
[00:33:26.246 --> 00:33:30.489]  Gonna stand my ground.
[00:33:30.489 --> 00:33:34.611]  Won't be turned around.
[00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:38.994]  And I'll keep this world from tracking me down.
[00:33:38.994 --> 00:33:42.056]  Gonna stand my ground.
[00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:46.018]  And I won't back down.
[00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:47.879]  There's no easy way out, folks.
[00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:52.462]  Hey, baby.
[00:33:52.462 --> 00:33:54.363]  There ain't no easy way out.
[00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:07.362]  And I won't.
[00:34:07.362 --> 00:34:08.242]  Okay.
[00:34:08.242 --> 00:34:09.802]  Let me just do this.
[00:34:09.802 --> 00:34:10.862]  And I've never succeeded.
[00:34:10.862 --> 00:34:16.103]  I always say I'm going to read every headline to get an idea of what I'm seeing every day and then go back into it.
[00:34:16.103 --> 00:34:17.003]  But I'm going to do it right now.
[00:34:17.003 --> 00:34:20.004]  I'm going to start back over where I was.
[00:34:20.004 --> 00:34:20.524]  Cheney.
[00:34:20.524 --> 00:34:23.405]  Obama has learned that Bush policies were right.
[00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:25.045]  The Hill.
[00:34:25.045 --> 00:34:25.765]  AP.
[00:34:25.765 --> 00:34:29.006]  Ex-banker says he's giving WikiLeaks files on the rich.
[00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:38.719]  Swiss lawmakers angry at alleged US spying program.
[00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:45.064]  Julian Assange vows to reveal tax details of 2,000 wealthy people.
[00:34:45.064 --> 00:34:47.845]  Yeah, outsiders.
[00:34:47.845 --> 00:34:49.607]  Continuing.
[00:34:49.607 --> 00:34:54.830]  NASA Hanson imposed Chinese totalitarianism on America.
[00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.551]  With the actual quotes.
[00:34:56.551 --> 00:34:58.593]  PresentPlanet.com, Kurt Nimmo.
[00:34:58.593 --> 00:35:00.354]  Here's the Washington Times, same story.
[00:35:02.873 --> 00:35:06.394]  China-style dictatorship of climatologists.
[00:35:06.394 --> 00:35:10.235]  NASA's Hanson prefers rule by decree to fight global warming.
[00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:13.696]  That is the new official talking point by literally thousands of these academics.
[00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:16.977]  These people are authoritarians.
[00:35:16.977 --> 00:35:17.877]  Continuing.
[00:35:17.877 --> 00:35:26.119]  Bill Gates wants to register all babies on planet for vaccines so that forced vaccination can be carried out.
[00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:30.121]  To save them, of course.
[00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:31.181]  Continuing here.
[00:35:35.373 --> 00:35:45.260]  With the news, Sudan next to succumb to Bernanke's inflationary experiment as country threatens revolution over surging food prices.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:50.184]  Fox News, traveling man's gun arrest appealed to Supreme Court.
[00:35:50.184 --> 00:35:57.589]  They admit in this article that his gun was completely legal, but that the police still took it and still arrested him.
[00:35:57.589 --> 00:36:04.194]  And that ties into some other news I have here where they're just arresting people who neighbors see with guns.
[00:36:06.053 --> 00:36:21.162]  And it's always the same, a deer rifle, a shotgun, a handgun, repair people in your house, the police come, you go to jail, they hyperventilate in press conferences, shilling a thousand rounds of ammo, the police going, look, it's Dave, look at the ammo!
[00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:31.329]  And you've got these pop-head zombies out there that go, guns on a slave's hand, and then they go to jail with no crime committed!
[00:36:33.055 --> 00:36:36.137]  I mean, that's what I'm talking about here, okay?
[00:36:36.137 --> 00:36:39.419]  I said I'd just read the headlines.
[00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:40.960]  Look at these financial headlines.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.062]  States warn of $2 trillion pension shortfall.
[00:36:45.062 --> 00:36:47.383]  CNBC.
[00:36:47.383 --> 00:36:53.287]  Without aid, Detroit school district may close half of its schools.
[00:36:53.287 --> 00:36:58.490]  That's the entire city Detroit public school system.
[00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.311]  Detroit News.
[00:37:00.311 --> 00:37:02.052]  China is lending
[00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:06.140]  And it hits new heights.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:13.041]  Again, China's lending hits new heights as they buy up the planet.
[00:37:13.041 --> 00:37:13.542]  Here's another one.
[00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:15.282]  A strategy to straddle the planet.
[00:37:15.282 --> 00:37:17.203]  Financial Times of London.
[00:37:17.203 --> 00:37:18.263]  Oil prices over 100.
[00:37:18.263 --> 00:37:20.323]  Not unrealistic.
[00:37:20.323 --> 00:37:22.304]  Iran.
[00:37:22.304 --> 00:37:25.325]  Obama wants to shed rules that hurt job growth.
[00:37:26.104 --> 00:37:30.267]  That's kind of like they wanted to build a border fence that they never intended to build.
[00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:31.528]  Just all talk.
[00:37:31.528 --> 00:37:35.070]  Yeah, his carbon taxes will really get the economy going.
[00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:42.115]  Missiles off target in major Taiwan drill.
[00:37:42.115 --> 00:37:43.416]  Is the Fed broke?
[00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:44.757]  Economic Policy Journal.
[00:37:47.059 --> 00:38:00.309]  The Fed is only the receivership arm of the OECD, the Organization of Economic and Cooperative Development, and it itself is just a bankruptcy receivership arm.
[00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:06.094]  It bankrupts the nation while transferring the assets through the membrane to the global shareholders.
[00:38:08.945 --> 00:38:10.627]  So, no, we're broke, not the Fed.
[00:38:10.627 --> 00:38:15.371]  They've carried out the fraud successfully until we bring them to justice.
[00:38:15.371 --> 00:38:17.873]  Debt bondage, the economic treason of the banks.
[00:38:17.873 --> 00:38:18.554]  Bob Chapman.
[00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:23.750]  And it just continues from there.
[00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.452]  Here's some other important headlines.
[00:38:26.452 --> 00:38:35.857]  Hu Jintao set for lavish White House reception on state visit as he openly crows that the end of the dollar is nigh.
[00:38:35.857 --> 00:38:39.719]  The media lavishes and praises the authoritarianism.
[00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:45.873]  Continuing Stuxnet virus attack.
[00:38:45.873 --> 00:38:54.059]  Russia warns of Iranian Chernobyl and says that the country may have a Chernobyl-style disaster.
[00:38:54.059 --> 00:39:06.088]  Russian nuclear officials have warned of another Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster at Iran's controversial Bashir reactor because of the damage caused by the Stuxnet virus, according to the latest Western intelligence reports.
[00:39:07.383 --> 00:39:10.064]  Then we have of course another report dovetailing with that.
[00:39:10.064 --> 00:39:11.665]  And guess who issued the study?
[00:39:11.665 --> 00:39:14.266]  And when they issue a study and directives,
[00:39:26.491 --> 00:39:42.937]  When they call for homeland security to be set up in every Western nation, when they call for federalization of schools, when they call for forced inoculations, when they call for global gun banning and gun control, when they call for higher taxes or a sales tax, you hear your politicians start jumping up and down.
[00:39:42.937 --> 00:39:50.359]  When they call for an NAU-SPP merger, North American Union, you start hearing the globalists push it.
[00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:54.401]  Who in this London Telegraph article tells us of the dangerous Stuxnet?
[00:39:56.254 --> 00:39:58.936]  Well thank goodness!
[00:39:58.936 --> 00:40:02.178]  It's the OECD!
[00:40:02.178 --> 00:40:04.279]  Who no one ever wants to discuss.
[00:40:04.279 --> 00:40:14.266]  The UN is just a little ceremonial debating society that's like one room in a giant palace of the OECD.
[00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:20.871]  A succession of multiple cyber attacks could become full-scale global shock.
[00:40:22.176 --> 00:40:26.459]  You know the Pentagon's setting up the grid to do this, and actually in their own war plans, they admit it.
[00:40:26.459 --> 00:40:29.641]  They war game taking the web down to know how to protect it.
[00:40:29.641 --> 00:40:31.362]  Oh, of course.
[00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:46.931]  They have to take it down before they re-initiate it under New Internet 2, with Internet ID, Internet taxes, and everyone will have to have a subdomain name on 100 corporations, 50 universities, and government websites.
[00:40:47.631 --> 00:40:54.575]  There'll be a spectrum of subdomains on Internet2, and you will sign up with the licensure agreement with all of your rights.
[00:40:54.575 --> 00:41:03.461]  I mean, I knew this eight years ago because it was all spelled out by the globalists in Internet2 symposiums, and I'm the type of guy that'll sit around reading hundreds of pages of it, so it's all being prepared.
[00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:07.165]  But they're only doing it because of Stuxnet!
[00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:13.753]  The OECD that takes over the third world countries that took Europe into receivership at the end of World War II.
[00:41:13.753 --> 00:41:17.317]  The Ex-Im Bank, the IMF, the World Bank are just subsidiaries of it.
[00:41:17.317 --> 00:41:18.619]  The Federal Reserve is a subsidiary.
[00:41:20.157 --> 00:41:29.085]  A succession of multi-cyber attacks could become a full-scale global shock on par with a pandemic and the collapse of the world financial system.
[00:41:29.085 --> 00:41:36.291]  Oh, you're going to lose your bank account and your pension because of the internet and the cyber attackers.
[00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:43.818]  Can you imagine every pensioner, every person with their bank account screwed up, demanding that the government do something?
[00:41:43.818 --> 00:41:45.659]  You know, when you find out about data loss,
[00:41:46.561 --> 00:41:50.459]  Over 80% of it, this is all admitted, is big banks.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:42:13.529]  And the guy running the credit card machine there at the gas station, getting the numbers, and then he emails it or faxes it to his cousin in Pakistan, or India, or China, or Eastern Europe, all the famous places where they do it, Russia, Nigeria, and then they run scams with your credit cards.
[00:42:13.529 --> 00:42:14.189]  That's most of it.
[00:42:14.189 --> 00:42:19.171]  But notice, the media is always, it's the internet, it's the internet, it's the internet, it's the internet doing it.
[00:42:20.367 --> 00:42:20.567]  Thank you.
[00:42:42.506 --> 00:42:48.528]  Microsoft, its new versions, have Internet ID built in.
[00:42:48.528 --> 00:42:49.668]  And you can pull that up.
[00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:50.689]  And how is it gonna be?
[00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:53.410]  Keyboards with a thumbprint.
[00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.551]  And for web transactions, a digital photo to authenticate.
[00:42:57.551 --> 00:42:59.332]  That'll fix all the problems.
[00:42:59.332 --> 00:43:01.552]  It'll also track everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:43:01.552 --> 00:43:07.774]  And Bill Gates is calling for all children of the world to be enrolled in this global biometric system.
[00:43:07.774 --> 00:43:09.335]  And don't think you're just gonna wear a mask.
[00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:13.915]  When you go to the body scanner, they get your 360 body scan.
[00:43:13.915 --> 00:43:23.621]  So now they have passive cameras that shoot radio waves like sonar through your clothes and scan your body at even hundreds of yards away.
[00:43:23.621 --> 00:43:25.402]  They admit in Wired Magazine.
[00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:28.644]  The intel I've got is they've got satellites that do it now.
[00:43:28.644 --> 00:43:35.789]  Not just off your heat resonance, not biometric from a face scan, a heat resonance from your shoulders and the top of your head.
[00:43:39.994 --> 00:43:42.395]  But also off of your walk.
[00:43:42.395 --> 00:43:48.839]  They have a biometric calculation between the shoulders, the elbows, the knees, the feet, and the movement of the head.
[00:43:48.839 --> 00:43:56.563]  And off of that triangulation calculation, they have a 100% biometric scan off of your walk from satellite.
[00:43:56.563 --> 00:43:57.364]  That's confirmed.
[00:43:58.308 --> 00:44:00.630]  But you notice the Germans just got caught three weeks ago.
[00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:06.153]  Oh, I'm afraid they didn't launch all those new satellites to track global warming.
[00:44:06.153 --> 00:44:08.075]  It was a government, U.S.
[00:44:08.075 --> 00:44:09.936]  government, NATO deal.
[00:44:09.936 --> 00:44:16.941]  They are image infrared biometric scanners to identify personnel on the ground.
[00:44:18.843 --> 00:44:22.284]  So, I said I'd read through some of the headlines, that's quite a few of them, but here it is.
[00:44:22.284 --> 00:44:25.485]  Cyber attacks could cause global catastrophe.
[00:44:25.485 --> 00:44:43.991]  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said, contingency plans to recover systems should be put in place and cybersecurity policy should encompass the needs of all citizens and not just central government facilities.
[00:44:43.991 --> 00:44:46.952]  Why, that sounds like they want everybody to be safe.
[00:44:46.952 --> 00:44:47.753]  Well, when you read
[00:44:48.905 --> 00:45:04.096]  The Cybersecurity Act, which is a mirror image of this, just like the Food Safety Act says, you know, in the Farm and Food Safety Act, it says Codex Alimentarius UN Implementation of Treaty.
[00:45:05.097 --> 00:45:25.531]  Well, when you read what the OECD and the UN is calling for, it's exactly what is in the Admitted Cybersecurity Act, where it says IT companies that serve 100 or more customers must get government certification and have government hardware placed in their chain to monitor for security threats.
[00:45:28.447 --> 00:45:29.509]  And what did this just say?
[00:45:29.509 --> 00:45:39.945]  Oh, the government has got to protect you and you've got to upload all your personal data and protect it in a government cloud computing access system.
[00:45:42.649 --> 00:45:55.920]  See, everything now is gonna be terminals that tie into this big server CDN system where you've just got your own little tablet and you won't even be able to buy a tower at the stores.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.361]  You can try to special order one.
[00:45:57.361 --> 00:46:09.171]  You can try to keep servers in your business, in your office, but the web is now being engineered, this is all admitted, where your stuff won't even be able to access in the near future the new systems they're rolling out.
[00:46:10.933 --> 00:46:13.354]  And they say, if you don't want to go along with the changes, that's fine.
[00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:19.657]  You can live in some type of digital ghetto, is the term they use.
[00:46:19.657 --> 00:46:29.202]  Remember that program that they produced in England for children, showing them the future, where you only get meat on your birthday, everything you do is tracked, you have a travel allotment, everything is surveilled.
[00:46:29.202 --> 00:46:30.283]  This is what's being taught now.
[00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:33.550]  Total authoritarianism.
[00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:42.915]  All these government officials from Al Gore right down to Hanson, the head of the Goddard Space Center, saying, we want authoritarianism.
[00:46:42.915 --> 00:46:44.416]  We're going to have one child.
[00:46:44.416 --> 00:46:45.816]  This is it.
[00:46:45.816 --> 00:46:48.177]  We're doing it for your own good.
[00:46:48.177 --> 00:46:50.679]  And don't look for the Republicans to fire him.
[00:46:50.679 --> 00:46:51.839]  No, no, no, no.
[00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:53.820]  They're now getting their power back.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.662]  And so they are going to enjoy the spoils.
[00:46:57.807 --> 00:46:59.587]  Now, there are some good people in there.
[00:46:59.587 --> 00:47:03.748]  The numbers of patriots are growing, but don't think overnight this is all going to be reversed.
[00:47:03.748 --> 00:47:06.649]  We've got to stay angry, stay focused.
[00:47:06.649 --> 00:47:14.091]  Again, that encompass the needs of all citizens, not just central government facilities, the report said.
[00:47:14.091 --> 00:47:24.193]  What should concern policymakers are combinations of events, two different cyber events occurring at the same time, or a cyber event taking place during some other form of disaster or attack.
[00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:29.568]  In that eventuality, the perfect storm conditions could exist.
[00:47:29.568 --> 00:47:35.233]  And so they go on to call for the Global Cyber Security Command, interfaced with NATO and the major governments.
[00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:41.920]  They'll keep us safe from the Stuxnet, launched by the US and Israel publicly.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.722]  We told you that in September, now here it is admitted.
[00:47:44.722 --> 00:47:48.406]  Stuxnet, another conspiracy theory, turns out to be true.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:48:00.303]  And Paul Watson goes through all the different blogs that attacked us and others and all the big newspapers that said it was preposterous that Israel and the U.S.
[00:48:00.303 --> 00:48:03.623]  had launched the Stuxnet.
[00:48:03.623 --> 00:48:08.825]  But we can see the motive, we can see the history, and we can also see the chutzpah
[00:48:09.833 --> 00:48:18.063]  And the bravado and the arrogance out of the US and Israel when they would refuse to deny they were involved in September.
[00:48:18.063 --> 00:48:24.831]  Doesn't take a Goddard rocket scientist to know that Chinese-style tyranny is not a good idea.
[00:48:25.231 --> 00:48:31.514]  And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know when you see all those signs, and they love to antagonize Iran.
[00:48:31.514 --> 00:48:32.554]  It's part of the policy.
[00:48:32.554 --> 00:48:47.121]  I remember Bush, four years ago, had the White House put a press release out about how they were funding four freedom fighter groups to attack Iran, and three of the four groups were top al Qaeda, including, at the time, the number two in al Qaeda, commanding attacks inside Iran.
[00:48:47.961 --> 00:48:59.691]  And then our media had the nerve to say Iran was running Al-Qaeda, when Al-Qaeda is the opposite of the Shiite-run state, and they hate each other even more than they hate the West.
[00:48:59.691 --> 00:49:02.894]  But again, that's from actually knowing who the players are.
[00:49:02.894 --> 00:49:10.641]  I know who the basic players are in Islam, just like you know who the players are in McDonald's Cowboys.
[00:49:11.957 --> 00:49:17.722]  But see, they know you don't know about that, some of you new listeners out there, so they just lie to you.
[00:49:17.722 --> 00:49:19.544]  Oh, Iran, they're running Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:19.544 --> 00:49:36.020]  I mean, they come out and tacitly admit they launched the attack, and three and a half months later, this is early September, so I guess September, October, November, December, yeah, we're talking almost four months later, oh, the New York Times comes out and admits the entire thing.
[00:49:40.748 --> 00:49:50.389]  Schwarzenegger gearing up to try to repeal the 22nd Amendment so he can be president says, I was addicted to being the governor, he told the Austrian newspaper.
[00:49:50.389 --> 00:49:50.790]  Crone.
[00:49:52.745 --> 00:49:55.186]  Gotta love how he always does everything for Austria first.
[00:49:55.186 --> 00:49:57.067]  Always gives him the first interviews, everything.
[00:49:57.067 --> 00:49:58.427]  Good, go back to Austria.
[00:49:58.427 --> 00:50:01.928]  It's a beautiful country, nice people, a lot of culture.
[00:50:01.928 --> 00:50:03.049]  Get out of my country.
[00:50:03.049 --> 00:50:09.291]  I'm not over in Austria, running around talking about how I want to be a dictator and working with Ken Lay, robbing people.
[00:50:09.291 --> 00:50:10.652]  Oh yeah, he was heavily involved in all that.
[00:50:10.652 --> 00:50:13.192]  And he just talks about how, I've lost 200 million!
[00:50:15.174 --> 00:50:16.838]  70 million on movie losses.
[00:50:16.838 --> 00:50:17.940]  I've looked at Schwarzenegger as well.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.303]  That's gone way up.
[00:50:19.303 --> 00:50:23.512]  You don't think he wasn't in there because he was heavily involved in business deals, including Enron?
[00:50:23.512 --> 00:50:24.153]  What a joke.
[00:50:26.664 --> 00:50:27.284]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:50:27.284 --> 00:50:30.047]  Anybody's taking as much steroids as you, pal.
[00:50:30.047 --> 00:50:37.272]  You better hope they get that life extension technology perfected real fast, because you look like you're about to keel over and fall over.
[00:50:37.272 --> 00:50:47.040]  You know how much makeup they put on you and how they prop you up with that arrogant, authoritarian smile on your gun-grabbing, open-border-loving, New World Order face.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.003]  But I'll say to you, Auslander Reich, get out of my country!
[00:50:51.003 --> 00:50:53.245]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:53.245 --> 00:50:54.206]  Stay with us.
[00:50:54.206 --> 00:50:55.607]  I'm going to get into really key news.
[00:50:56.087 --> 00:50:58.961]  Straight ahead on somebody in Chile, a real patriot.
[00:51:01.297 --> 00:51:05.958]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:14.839]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey Water Filtration Systems.

[00:51:59.102 --> 00:52:03.067]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.067 --> 00:52:05.390]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.594]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.594 --> 00:52:13.701]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:17.906]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.206 --> 00:52:20.667]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.667 --> 00:52:23.428]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.428 --> 00:52:26.350]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:33.953]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.286 --> 00:52:39.670]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.531]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:46.214]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.214 --> 00:52:47.294]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.294 --> 00:52:48.635]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.635 --> 00:52:50.116]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.111]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:06.697]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:06.697 --> 00:53:11.722]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:16.748]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.288 --> 00:53:22.512]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.512 --> 00:53:29.618]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.618 --> 00:53:30.739]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:37.104]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.424 --> 00:53:40.608]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.608 --> 00:53:42.830]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:43.711]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:43.971]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:43.971 --> 00:53:47.415]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.415 --> 00:53:49.177]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:10.506 --> 00:54:14.830]  Yeah, they don't want shackles on them in Chile.
[00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.713]  They want to be free.
[00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:21.097]  Again, I had some pride yesterday.
[00:54:21.097 --> 00:54:28.444]  Pride in the strength and the courage and the focus and the spirit that you can hear in this voice.
[00:54:29.534 --> 00:54:34.497]  And we've sent a communique via the fella's YouTube channel.
[00:54:34.497 --> 00:54:39.400]  We have the video linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.302]  When we linked to it, it had about 200 viewers yesterday.
[00:54:42.302 --> 00:54:44.083]  Now it's had close to 100,000.
[00:54:44.083 --> 00:54:48.725]  I would guess this video will end up getting several million views.
[00:54:48.725 --> 00:54:50.627]  It's Rockefeller-owned.
[00:54:50.627 --> 00:54:52.548]  Chileans tell him he will fail.
[00:54:53.248 --> 00:55:12.788]  That's what they're saying in Spanish to him, but they're also speaking in English, and I was very proud of the fact that when I went to this YouTube channel of the man who confronted them, and he's there on the YouTube channel saying, yes, I'm the guy who uploaded the video, I'm the guy that confronted him, David Rockefeller, and also Mr. Eastman, one of the richest men in South America, and
[00:55:16.644 --> 00:55:24.287]  Australian elitist Edward McClure, who served as president of the League of Nations.
[00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:25.807]  It just goes on and on here.
[00:55:25.807 --> 00:55:32.189]  You can read the whole breakdown at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:32.189 --> 00:55:39.172]  Rockefeller-owned Chileans tell him he will fail, together with his good old friend Edward Eastman.
[00:55:39.172 --> 00:55:42.113]  Mr. Rockefeller takes a quick vacation.
[00:55:43.539 --> 00:55:45.701]  Almost every year in the south of Chile.
[00:55:45.701 --> 00:55:52.667]  Both are well known for working with the CIA during the 73 coup against their president down there and they killed hundreds of thousands.
[00:55:53.795 --> 00:55:55.276]  And of course Kissinger brags about that.
[00:55:55.276 --> 00:56:04.362]  He's horned on war crimes in Spain for it and manipulating public opinion through a newspaper called El Mercurio.
[00:56:04.362 --> 00:56:15.749]  Edwards is also known for being a descendant of Chilean elitist Edward McClure, who served as the president of the League of Nations from 22 to 23 and also ran the same newspaper.
[00:56:15.749 --> 00:56:20.552]  So here is a super high-powered, one of the most wealthy media magnates in South America,
[00:56:21.332 --> 00:56:28.986]  Super high-powered mafia, Mr. Easton, helping set up with David Rockefeller's grandfather, the first Moe to the UN.
[00:56:30.945 --> 00:56:31.285]  I think?
[00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:57.080]  But it's also a global movement against global tyranny.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.941]  It takes a global movement to fight their global tyranny, but it's independent.
[00:57:00.941 --> 00:57:06.103]  But it's a manifesto of liberty as we all basically think along the same lines.
[00:57:06.103 --> 00:57:08.164]  And it's that idea that's bulletproof.
[00:57:08.164 --> 00:57:11.725]  Here is the powerful audio and video of the confrontation.
[00:57:11.725 --> 00:57:12.785]  Rockefellers, come back.
[00:57:12.785 --> 00:57:15.246]  We don't want your new world order, you know?
[00:57:15.246 --> 00:57:16.447]  You know?
[00:57:16.447 --> 00:57:17.087]  Leave Chile right now.
[00:57:17.087 --> 00:57:17.547]  Leave Chile.
[00:57:18.826 --> 00:57:22.789]  You are not... You're killing a lot of people!
[00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:24.811]  You're killing a lot of people!
[00:57:24.811 --> 00:57:25.431]  Leave here!
[00:57:25.431 --> 00:57:26.652]  Leave Chile right now!
[00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:27.733]  Leave Chile!
[00:57:27.733 --> 00:57:28.954]  Leave Chile!
[00:57:28.954 --> 00:57:30.855]  We don't want your war government!
[00:57:30.855 --> 00:57:32.757]  Leave Chile right now!
[00:57:32.757 --> 00:57:33.718]  Leave Chile, okay?
[00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:35.399]  Leave Chile!
[00:57:35.399 --> 00:57:36.359]  Your family!
[00:57:36.359 --> 00:57:39.922]  Your family is the most disgusting in the world, you know?
[00:57:39.922 --> 00:57:40.542]  Leave here!
[00:57:40.542 --> 00:57:41.142]  Leave!
[00:57:41.142 --> 00:57:41.943]  Leave!
[00:57:41.943 --> 00:57:43.904]  You also, you're a traitor to Chile!
[00:57:43.904 --> 00:57:46.606]  Mr. Agustin Edward, you're a traitor to Chile, okay?
[00:57:46.606 --> 00:57:47.947]  You're a traitor to Chile!
[00:57:47.947 --> 00:57:49.828]  What you're doing right now, okay?
[00:57:49.828 --> 00:57:50.789]  Okay?
[00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:51.729]  Okay?
[00:57:51.729 --> 00:57:52.510]  You know everything.
[00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.931]  You know everything.
[00:57:53.931 --> 00:57:55.752]  You're participating with him.
[00:57:55.752 --> 00:57:57.613]  You're participating with him in this.
[00:57:57.613 --> 00:57:59.454]  Your world government will fail, okay?
[00:57:59.454 --> 00:58:00.275]  It will fail!
[00:58:01.147 --> 00:58:03.211]  Your world government will fail!
[00:58:03.211 --> 00:58:04.593]  Will fail!
[00:58:04.593 --> 00:58:05.815]  Will fail!
[00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:06.597]  You know it!
[00:58:06.597 --> 00:58:07.899]  Live TV right now!
[00:58:07.899 --> 00:58:09.041]  We don't want you here!
[00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:12.186]  We don't want your disgusting thing here!
[00:58:12.186 --> 00:58:12.907]  Live TV now!
[00:58:15.606 --> 00:58:16.347]  You gotta love it.
[00:58:16.347 --> 00:58:19.769]  We don't want you here, you disgusting creature.
[00:58:19.769 --> 00:58:27.075]  And by the way, Rockefeller admittedly ran the takeover of Chile and death squads that conservatively killed tens of thousands.
[00:58:27.075 --> 00:58:29.496]  Hundreds of thousands were put in prison or disappeared.
[00:58:29.496 --> 00:58:37.002]  So here's a guy in a country that's still isn't too free talking to a literal Hitler visiting his country who's committed a holocaust.
[00:58:37.002 --> 00:58:38.923]  That's real courage!
[00:58:40.535 --> 00:58:45.157]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:58:45.157 --> 00:58:46.677]  Search no more.
[00:58:46.677 --> 00:58:50.479]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.479 --> 00:58:54.300]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:58.581]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:58:58.581 --> 00:59:03.463]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:59:03.463 --> 00:59:08.385]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:59:09.225 --> 00:59:28.560]  Not worried about them moving south Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow I'm looking for America Land of the free and the home of the brave Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone
[00:59:44.972 --> 00:59:53.457]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:55.859]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:58.641]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.024]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:11.624]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.624 --> 01:00:13.525]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.525 --> 01:00:17.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:21.408]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.564 --> 01:00:38.567]  Coming up in about 30 minutes we've got conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, head of the Eagle Forum, joining us to talk about is it going to be meet the new boss same as the old boss with these Republicans going into Congress.
[01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:40.227]  What do we do about the globalist agenda?
[01:00:40.227 --> 01:00:45.708]  I'm going to ask her about globalist control, the conservative movement in this country.
[01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:46.909]  How far does it go back?
[01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.829]  Does it go back to Barry Goldwater or before?
[01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:55.902]  We're gonna have an important talk with her coming up in 30 minutes, look forward to that.
[01:00:55.902 --> 01:01:04.724]  And then in studio, we're gonna have Dr. Wakefield, who's been on all the big morning shows, Good Morning America, Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[01:01:04.724 --> 01:01:10.366]  They're trying to run this hoax that his research on autism and the vaccine link is a hoax.
[01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:14.807]  If you just joined us, I could watch that Rockefeller confrontation over and over again.
[01:01:16.024 --> 01:01:21.809]  You see the vampiric leer of Nosferatu Hare Rockefeller.
[01:01:21.809 --> 01:01:31.678]  If you have to point at one man who's been a more tireless agent of mordor, of evil, it has to be David Rockefeller.
[01:01:31.678 --> 01:01:32.119]  I mean, he's
[01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:50.206]  CFR, Trilateral Commission, UN programs, biological diversity assessments, carbon taxes, the entire China we see today, this giant murdering monster with sports stadium executions and total control and one-child policies.
[01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:58.051]  It was David Rockefeller who went there, set the deal up, writes about it in his memoirs, praises Mao Zedong.
[01:01:58.051 --> 01:02:03.195]  Just as the head of Goddard Space Center, James Hansen,
[01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.366]  Says we need a Chinese authoritarianism.
[01:02:08.366 --> 01:02:10.248]  He says totalitarianism is good.
[01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:11.749]  And what do we hear from Dr. Pianka?
[01:02:11.749 --> 01:02:14.172]  Biology department.
[01:02:14.172 --> 01:02:15.133]  At least he was the head years ago.
[01:02:15.133 --> 01:02:16.755]  I don't know what he is now.
[01:02:16.755 --> 01:02:18.336]  What do we have with Peter Singer?
[01:02:18.336 --> 01:02:19.498]  What do we have with Ted Turner?
[01:02:19.498 --> 01:02:20.819]  What do we have with Jacques Cousteau?
[01:02:20.819 --> 01:02:21.940]  What do we have with Prince Philip?
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.982]  What do we have with Prince...
[01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:27.184]  Charles, what do we have?
[01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:39.117]  Every day or two, Watson's got a new article where some top IPCC head at the UN says we need authoritarianism, get rid of freedom, carbon tax everyone, one-child policies.
[01:02:41.778 --> 01:02:57.054]  And this, uh, Hanson goes on to say, we'll have no economy, in Watson's article, quoting him, we'll have no economy until we embrace the Chinese model of totalitarianism and carbon taxes, and that tariffs should be levied globally against the U.S.
[01:02:57.054 --> 01:02:58.475]  if we don't go along with it.
[01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:01.899]  Meanwhile, China, who he says is the model, doesn't have these carbon taxes.
[01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:15.332]  I mean, he knows they're imploding our economy, and now they're gonna dance around on the ashes of our economy, blaming it because we didn't accept carbon taxes?
[01:03:15.332 --> 01:03:19.196]  Well, California has, and look how fast they're going down the toilet bowl.
[01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:22.420]  How fast they're circling the drain.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.121]  I mean, these guys
[01:03:24.548 --> 01:03:26.569]  They relish authoritarian oppression.
[01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.910]  They relish forced abortion.
[01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:30.710]  They endorse it.
[01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:47.377]  And it's their little enjoyment, their little power trip over you when they go to the mall, and they always write about how they detest their fellow Americans, or when they go walk down the street, or they go to Times Square, and they just survey the public, and they write about this, how disgusting we are, how filthy we are.
[01:03:47.717 --> 01:03:49.418]  But they've got that little power trip.
[01:03:49.418 --> 01:03:53.441]  They're not stopping us from what we're putting the Teflon in the pans.
[01:03:53.441 --> 01:03:56.843]  That if your parrot is sitting 10 feet from it, it'll drop dead.
[01:03:56.843 --> 01:03:58.144]  It's so deadly.
[01:03:58.144 --> 01:04:02.787]  They're not going to stop us from that fluoride in that water when we're also putting it in the foods now.
[01:04:02.787 --> 01:04:05.228]  They're not going to stop us from the vaccines.
[01:04:05.228 --> 01:04:05.649]  Oh, God.
[01:04:06.189 --> 01:04:08.330]  Bill Gates, oh, we've given him so much power.
[01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.552]  He's patenting all these mosquitos that will forcibly deliver it.
[01:04:11.552 --> 01:04:12.873]  Oh, we're going to sterilize them.
[01:04:12.873 --> 01:04:14.314]  We're going to take their power to breed.
[01:04:14.314 --> 01:04:17.516]  Oh, we've got this instinct to want to dominate and control you.
[01:04:17.516 --> 01:04:19.357]  And, oh, we're control freaks.
[01:04:19.357 --> 01:04:23.119]  Oh, the religion of control freakdom.
[01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:25.340]  They love looking at you with hate.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.321]  And I've seen globalists.
[01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.061]  I've read their writings.
[01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:27.802]  I've studied them.
[01:04:27.802 --> 01:04:32.785]  When they see a family, a good-looking family with healthy, happy kids, they just recoil with hate.
[01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:34.506]  And they've always just got, like, black teeth.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.883]  Even if they're young, they always look like David Rockefeller, or this handsome guy.
[01:04:38.883 --> 01:04:43.466]  They're always like, like Emperor Palpatine.
[01:04:43.466 --> 01:04:47.949]  We'll be seeing the degenerative effects on your children soon enough.
[01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:50.211]  I control everything, you fools.
[01:04:50.211 --> 01:04:53.913]  You don't even know we're poisoning your water.
[01:04:53.913 --> 01:04:55.294]  They'll never wake up.
[01:04:55.294 --> 01:04:59.978]  I mean, it's just... Why do we let this scum perch on us and vomit on us?
[01:05:00.911 --> 01:05:04.494]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:05:04.494 --> 01:05:05.615]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:05:05.615 --> 01:05:10.179]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:05:10.179 --> 01:05:16.125]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:18.286]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:05:18.286 --> 01:05:20.969]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:27.813]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:27.813 --> 01:05:30.015]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:05:30.015 --> 01:05:35.358]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:05:35.358 --> 01:05:40.642]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:05:40.642 --> 01:05:46.005]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:05:46.005 --> 01:05:47.346]  This will freeze the cost of your
[01:05:47.346 --> 01:05:48.127]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:48.127 --> 01:05:51.829]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:53.550]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:10.942 --> 01:06:16.303]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.303 --> 01:06:19.344]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.344 --> 01:06:21.664]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.664 --> 01:06:27.926]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:27.926 --> 01:06:31.307]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.307 --> 01:06:36.788]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.068 --> 01:06:38.710]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:40.011]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.011 --> 01:06:42.693]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.693 --> 01:06:46.917]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:46.917 --> 01:06:51.541]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:08:01.097 --> 01:08:06.662]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.062 --> 01:08:19.213]  During the break, I was watching Fox News.
[01:08:19.213 --> 01:08:21.218]  They had on the screen, U.S.
[01:08:21.218 --> 01:08:22.941]  owes more than one trillion to China.
[01:08:24.156 --> 01:08:29.457]  And then it was Obama with hat in hand at the table being bossed around by the Chinese.
[01:08:29.457 --> 01:08:32.618]  The globalists have worked so hard to get us into debt.
[01:08:32.618 --> 01:08:35.759]  They've worked so hard to overextend us as an empire.
[01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:45.821]  While the Rupert Murdoch media overseas demonizes us, domestically it leads the charge of patriotism, leading us into the trap, leading us into the setup.
[01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:51.462]  Then the controlled left here at home demonizes America instead of demonizing the globalists that have engineered this.
[01:08:52.362 --> 01:09:02.245]  And the vast majority, over 90% of this debt, is not owed because of Social Security or because of even the military budget.
[01:09:02.245 --> 01:09:12.909]  It is owed in derivatives because we've signed on to pay off the 1.5 global quadrillion derivatives.
[01:09:12.909 --> 01:09:14.930]  1,500 trillion, and that was a year ago.
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:17.551]  That's an average of what a group of economists said here on air.
[01:09:18.916 --> 01:09:33.000]  Again, the Washington Post a few months ago said 600 plus trill, which would be a little more than one-third of what Tarpley says 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trill.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.181]  But many other mainline economists say it's over a trill, 1,000 trill.
[01:09:38.181 --> 01:09:41.462]  It's hard to even get my mind around these numbers.
[01:09:41.462 --> 01:09:43.463]  And some economists say it's over 200 trillion.
[01:09:45.559 --> 01:09:49.341]  See, I can't even say this properly.
[01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:52.423]  Many economists say it's $1,500 trillion.
[01:09:52.423 --> 01:09:56.425]  The Washington Post says it's around $650 trillion.
[01:09:56.425 --> 01:10:00.427]  Webster Tarpley says it's $1,500 trillion.
[01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:09.171]  But whether it's $650 trillion or $1,500 trillion or $2,000 trillion, we don't owe it.
[01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.592]  They talk about our national debt being $14.5 trillion.
[01:10:15.353 --> 01:10:20.618]  The national debt is $14.5 trillion.
[01:10:20.618 --> 01:10:26.804]  Bloomberg reported over a year ago, it was in January of last year, $28 trillion.
[01:10:26.804 --> 01:10:28.466]  In late 2009, they reported $23.7 trillion.
[01:10:28.466 --> 01:10:30.368]  You can just say $23.7 trillion, Bloomberg.
[01:10:30.368 --> 01:10:31.349]  It'll come up for you.
[01:10:39.209 --> 01:10:42.150]  Then an additional five plus trill was spent.
[01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.731]  And then they stopped giving the numbers.
[01:10:43.731 --> 01:10:45.371]  And they won't tell Congress or anybody else.
[01:10:45.371 --> 01:11:04.859]  So, we owe $14 trillion and change on the Social Security and all the rest of this, but we're signed on in derivatives to over $1,000 trillion?
[01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:07.640]  And they endlessly talk about the $14 plus trillion.
[01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:13.906]  14.2, 14.5, 14.6, depending on how you slice it.
[01:11:13.906 --> 01:11:19.727]  Why aren't we having a discussion about the 1.5 quadrillion?
[01:11:19.727 --> 01:11:22.208]  1,500 trillion?
[01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:24.489]  Or 600 trillion, however you want to slice it.
[01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:29.210]  Let's just say it's only 640-something trillion like the Washington Post said.
[01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:32.051]  Okay, it's only 600 trillion.
[01:11:32.051 --> 01:11:35.272]  Almost all of that is not government debt.
[01:11:37.245 --> 01:11:38.706]  It's globalist debt.
[01:11:38.706 --> 01:11:42.948]  It's made-up derivatives they sold.
[01:11:42.948 --> 01:11:47.270]  They sold it to individuals and corporations and governments.
[01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:50.752]  And it came out in Iceland, it came out in Greece, it's coming out in Ireland.
[01:11:50.752 --> 01:11:59.176]  In the news, they'll admit, oh, almost all of this debt is owed by the central banks and the private banks themselves, but Ireland's going to pay it off for them for stability.
[01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.811]  Iceland is going to pay it off for stability.
[01:12:02.811 --> 01:12:07.653]  Greece is going to pay it off and sell their 600 plus islands for stability.
[01:12:07.653 --> 01:12:17.437]  And then you read, oh, this billionaire pension fund raider, he's getting this Greek island as payment from the Greek government.
[01:12:17.437 --> 01:12:26.601]  This guy, you know, sells fraud and then they go, okay, here's our island, thanks for the fraud.
[01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:28.622]  And then now the president
[01:12:30.319 --> 01:12:39.105]  Who likes to bow to the Saudi King and likes to bow to the Queen of England and likes to... He's never found a royal he doesn't want to bow to because he knows who the real power is.
[01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:44.549]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the British, the Dutch Royals, the Saudi Royals.
[01:12:44.549 --> 01:12:48.792]  The Imperial House of Japan still owns most of the country.
[01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:54.296]  You notice when our government went and took them over and took that... I mean, they immediately went in and made a deal with the royals and then pulled out.
[01:12:56.513 --> 01:13:00.554]  Because the Queenie over there doesn't want to set the precedent of Royals ever falling.
[01:13:00.554 --> 01:13:09.458]  That's why a lot of times Royals would kill their own families, but they would never kill their cousins across the English Channel or vice versa, or in Austria.
[01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:13.359]  They would never kill their cousins in Russia because that's dangerous.
[01:13:13.359 --> 01:13:17.180]  You start letting Royals die, you exile them.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.002]  You don't allow Royal blood to be spilt.
[01:13:22.383 --> 01:13:28.106]  You know, Napoleon declared himself a royal emperor, and you notice they exiled him twice.
[01:13:28.106 --> 01:13:30.927]  You don't kill royalty.
[01:13:30.927 --> 01:13:35.770]  Never!
[01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:40.192]  And they believe it's their divine right to do this to us, because we sit here and take it.
[01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:58.636]  We sit here and we take it and so now they're teaching us and they've dispatched the Federal Reserve, thousands of representatives, to colleges and high schools to go and speak to your children or to speak to your young adults who you paid us into college to be brainwashed about how great the Federal Reserve is and there's all these PSAs.
[01:13:58.636 --> 01:14:00.256]  Don't be against the Federal Reserve!
[01:14:00.256 --> 01:14:04.077]  You may be with the Tucson shooter.
[01:14:04.077 --> 01:14:06.197]  Oh, don't be against the Federal Reserve!
[01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:08.798]  You may be in a MIAC Homeland Security report.
[01:14:09.881 --> 01:14:12.404]  Oh, let's send the FBI to your house to ask.
[01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:14.526]  You've been riding against the Federal Reserve.
[01:14:14.526 --> 01:14:16.027]  Are you planning on something?
[01:14:16.027 --> 01:14:31.302]  And the Federal Reserve's federal security guards in Kansas City would come a half mile down the road and appear to my guys videotaping it from a hilltop and with hands on the side of their firearms.
[01:14:31.302 --> 01:14:32.484]  This made the Kansas City star.
[01:14:34.204 --> 01:14:34.384]  I don't
[01:14:50.043 --> 01:14:52.146]  Aaron started arguing with him, but I've seen the video.
[01:14:52.146 --> 01:14:52.566]  You've seen it.
[01:14:52.566 --> 01:14:53.588]  We've posted it.
[01:14:53.588 --> 01:14:55.310]  Just let everybody see the tyranny.
[01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:59.155]  See, it's all, oh, you represent foreign bankers raping us?
[01:14:59.155 --> 01:15:07.806]  Oh, you say here in the Chinese dictatorship of America, where we're owned by the communist Chinese as the number one owners, number two, the private Federal Reserve that set up China?
[01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:11.279]  Oh, you're killing millions of your people?
[01:15:11.279 --> 01:15:13.000]  You're sterilizing women?
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.241]  Unlimited cash!
[01:15:14.241 --> 01:15:15.582]  Oh, we love you!
[01:15:15.582 --> 01:15:18.784]  And just all over the news every day, China!
[01:15:18.784 --> 01:15:19.544]  China!
[01:15:19.544 --> 01:15:21.385]  They know how to deal with protesters!
[01:15:21.385 --> 01:15:22.986]  They know how to deal with political dissidents!
[01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:27.049]  They chop out their organs and sell it to computer company executives!
[01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:32.845]  You don't hear about China and authoritarianism anymore.
[01:15:32.845 --> 01:15:35.147]  You don't hear about China being a threat anymore.
[01:15:35.147 --> 01:15:40.131]  All you see is them having our stealth fighters and our missiles.
[01:15:40.131 --> 01:15:42.152]  Because America is done.
[01:15:42.152 --> 01:15:44.094]  They're removing the wealth from here.
[01:15:44.094 --> 01:15:45.355]  They set this up.
[01:15:45.355 --> 01:15:46.456]  They designed it.
[01:15:46.456 --> 01:15:51.199]  They've got the police trained to hate libertarians and conservatives and gun owners.
[01:15:51.199 --> 01:15:58.385]  And they're leaving us with an ocean of dumbed-down control freaks looking for power, and they can't even get jobs at McDonald's.
[01:15:58.985 --> 01:16:10.879]  So they've been battle-hardened overseas in torture, death, murder, and all of it, and they're coming to have their blood feast upon us.
[01:16:10.879 --> 01:16:15.223]  They're coming to have their way with us.
[01:16:15.223 --> 01:16:17.206]  We are between a rock and a hard place.
[01:16:20.086 --> 01:16:25.270]  I mean, just where they're openly on the news, Chris Matthews, they're breaking our will right now, they're trying.
[01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.752]  White people are crackers in trash.
[01:16:27.752 --> 01:16:34.196]  Trying to invoke whites to become racial and have everybody else see themselves as racial so we all fight with each other.
[01:16:34.196 --> 01:16:37.319]  The elite are so desperate, they're going, pull out the cracker card!
[01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:46.515]  They've already said N-word, N-word, N-word, and anybody who doesn't like big government or wants to keep their guns hates black people and is burning crosses secretly.
[01:16:46.515 --> 01:16:51.778]  If that doesn't work, try to sick minorities on what's left of Western culture.
[01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:54.519]  Tell them crackers are bad.
[01:16:54.519 --> 01:16:56.901]  Tell them it's good to go after cracker.
[01:16:56.901 --> 01:17:07.607]  I mean, all of this is scripted to get us fighting with each other right at this point where we all come into this global government collapse that's been engineered
[01:17:12.537 --> 01:17:21.481]  And we have a nation of arrested development males who act like between 5 and 10 year olds.
[01:17:21.481 --> 01:17:26.483]  It is seen to be manly to only like sports and acting tough and not getting involved.
[01:17:28.582 --> 01:17:33.366]  The women are, on average, completely worldly tarts.
[01:17:33.366 --> 01:17:41.592]  They traded their feminine power and their motherhood and their honor to dress like prostitutes and behave like them.
[01:17:41.592 --> 01:17:44.434]  And now the country is falling.
[01:17:44.434 --> 01:17:45.574]  All by design.
[01:17:45.574 --> 01:17:47.336]  They had to make a squeak before they did it.
[01:17:47.336 --> 01:17:48.577]  And now they've got the U.S.
[01:17:48.577 --> 01:17:54.521]  just sliding around in the mud before the communist Chinese bloodthirsty butchers of all history.
[01:17:56.513 --> 01:18:23.081]  The absolute world record killers in our country just groveling in the mud, being taught that we were bad, and thank goodness the Communist Chinese are here to sell us, and thank goodness the Federal Reserve is here, and thank goodness NATO is here, and thank goodness the 10 FEMA regions are here, and thank goodness there's telescreens going up everywhere where the government gives us announcements telling us how they make the grass grow, and how they make the birds sing.
[01:18:23.081 --> 01:18:24.321]  Thank goodness for them!
[01:18:26.866 --> 01:18:41.530]  Unless we recognize the type of hardcore authoritarian tyranny we're going into, and the leaders everywhere praising authoritarian tyranny, and making it fashionable for the left that it's some type of environmental, you know, cult they're a part of.
[01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:52.453]  On the right, an anti-terror cult, as the Club of Rome said, they'll have a right-wing attack on freedom and the anti-terror movement, and then they'll have a left-wing attack on freedom via the environmental fascism.
[01:18:54.056 --> 01:18:55.640]  They're now doing it.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.308]  We're gonna go to break and come back and get into some more news and then we've got
[01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:03.991]  Head, the founder of the Eagle Forum, Phyllis Schlafly, joining us.
[01:19:03.991 --> 01:19:13.314]  We're going to get into what's happening with China, more on Stuxnet, more on these calls for authoritarian tyranny, more on the economy, the pension funds going belly-up.
[01:19:13.314 --> 01:19:16.135]  Don't worry, the bankers are getting rid of our AAA rating.
[01:19:16.135 --> 01:19:28.019]  They'll have higher-priced loans for us, like Nigeria, who borrowed a billion bucks and has paid over 50 billion on that one loan and still owes 50-plus bill.
[01:19:30.188 --> 01:19:32.152]  Oh, losing that credit rating.
[01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:34.517]  In fact, the Chinese have already downgraded our credit rating.
[01:19:35.581 --> 01:19:46.408]  Oh, the communist Chinese, who just 50 years ago couldn't even feed themselves, now running everything because the globalists sold us on the cheap Chinese slave goods.
[01:19:46.408 --> 01:19:48.930]  They sold us on globalism and naphtha and gatt.
[01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:51.932]  And like idiots, the public took the bait.
[01:19:51.932 --> 01:19:58.857]  And now, like a little fish, we're in the net going in the boat, and the New World Order fat cats are going, mmm, I like fish!
[01:19:58.857 --> 01:20:00.098]  Ha ha, yeah!
[01:20:01.078 --> 01:20:05.159]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.159 --> 01:20:09.660]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:15.821]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.821 --> 01:20:18.262]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.262 --> 01:20:24.223]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.343 --> 01:20:27.768]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.768 --> 01:20:29.630]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.813]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.813 --> 01:20:36.699]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.699 --> 01:20:37.520]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.566]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:41.806 --> 01:20:49.832]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:49.832 --> 01:20:50.572]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:50.572 --> 01:20:51.393]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:00.379 --> 01:21:02.661]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:02.661 --> 01:21:03.181]  January 18th, 2011.
[01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:04.242]  Gold opened this morning at $1368.70.
[01:21:04.242 --> 01:21:07.784]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1404.23, $702.12 for a half ounce, or $351.06 for a quarter ounce.
[01:21:07.784 --> 01:21:08.625]  That's $1404.23, $702.12, and $351.06.
[01:21:20.091 --> 01:21:23.933]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[01:21:23.933 --> 01:21:25.074]  debt crises.
[01:21:25.074 --> 01:21:27.255]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[01:21:27.255 --> 01:21:29.676]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:34.999]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[01:21:34.999 --> 01:21:36.020]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:41.983]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:21:41.983 --> 01:21:47.826]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[01:21:48.126 --> 01:21:48.807]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.807 --> 01:21:49.587]  I'll send it free.
[01:21:49.587 --> 01:21:50.228]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.228 --> 01:21:51.289]  Ask for the CBO document.
[01:21:51.289 --> 01:21:51.529]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:05.653]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:05.653 --> 01:22:08.896]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:08.896 --> 01:22:13.700]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:20.085]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:20.085 --> 01:22:22.327]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:22:22.867 --> 01:22:23.167]  Tim Geithner?
[01:22:23.167 --> 01:22:23.427]  Bernanke?
[01:22:23.427 --> 01:22:23.887]  They're arsonists!
[01:22:23.887 --> 01:22:24.628]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:24.628 --> 01:22:26.068]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.775 --> 01:22:46.159]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:22:46.159 --> 01:22:49.042]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:22:49.042 --> 01:22:58.170]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:22:59.838 --> 01:23:02.760]  Do you have more than 4 hot flash episodes a day?
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.162]  Do you ever wake up at night soaked in sweat?
[01:23:05.162 --> 01:23:10.307]  Do you experience mood swings, heightened emotions, or sometimes feel on the verge of tears?
[01:23:10.307 --> 01:23:12.628]  Have you gained more than 5 pounds?
[01:23:12.628 --> 01:23:15.651]  Have you lost the energy level you had before menopause?
[01:23:15.651 --> 01:23:18.453]  Do you have low libido or no interest at all?
[01:23:18.453 --> 01:23:26.620]  If you said yes to any of these questions, you may be suffering with severe menopause symptoms and you qualify to receive a free month's supply of Ambarin.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.482]  Ambren is the incredibly effective, all-natural solution for menopause relief.

[01:23:53.012 --> 01:23:53.414]  That's 1-800-318-8232 1-800-318-8232
[01:24:19.505 --> 01:24:24.732]  Okay, I wanted to get to this video now.
[01:24:24.732 --> 01:24:28.437]  And it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:28.437 --> 01:24:36.488]  It's the advertisement, the trailer for a Frontline piece that asks, are we safer?
[01:24:37.745 --> 01:24:56.299]  tracking baltimore's motorist are we safer and the trailer again is up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com hot i wanna play this and then come back and give you as paul harvey would say the rest of the story or as paul harvey god bless his soul uh... would say uh... let's let
[01:24:56.559 --> 01:25:17.317]  This will be old news for you but it's new news for the lemmings as they're told about face scanning cameras and the license plate readers and it hooked up to government systems because it's not just key government installations it's a nationwide grid even on dirt roads the middle of nowhere hooked in scanning your license plates but I have the LA Times where
[01:25:18.278 --> 01:25:21.961]  In California, over a million government license plates are exempt.
[01:25:21.961 --> 01:25:24.002]  I'm going to have Watson do an article on this tomorrow.
[01:25:24.002 --> 01:25:29.365]  So government's exempt, and DynCorp and Halliburton can be caught running giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:25:29.365 --> 01:25:32.127]  They can bring in hundreds of billions in narcotics.
[01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.629]  I was reading the Bloomberg yesterday, where just one U.S.
[01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:38.551]  bank had $300-plus billion in drug money.
[01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:39.692]  I mean, it's $500 billion a year.
[01:25:42.987 --> 01:25:47.012]  And you really think some guys in a cave in Afghanistan are running it?
[01:25:47.012 --> 01:25:49.554]  Or your local crack house is running that?
[01:25:49.554 --> 01:25:51.957]  No, it's admitted, it's the government and the big banks.
[01:25:51.957 --> 01:25:56.042]  And so, these scanners are to make sure they can carry out their crimes.
[01:25:57.515 --> 01:26:01.980]  Or if somebody saw the government snatching your kid because a Saudi Arabian wants them or something.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.423]  That's one of the big buyers of them.
[01:26:04.423 --> 01:26:07.346]  Well, they'll be able to tell, uh-oh, this guy saw it.
[01:26:07.346 --> 01:26:09.328]  Just go ahead and send a hit team to that neighbor's house.
[01:26:09.328 --> 01:26:11.470]  He saw us with our snatch team.
[01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:14.674]  So these are so they can carry out robbing and murder and evil against us.
[01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:19.919]  The equivalent of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao rolled into one now has this Pentagon.
[01:26:19.919 --> 01:26:24.123]  Oh, and then they lie and say in this piece that this was developed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:26:24.123 --> 01:26:28.848]  MIT bragged years ago, over a decade ago, this was all tested in the U.S.
[01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:38.257]  15 years ago from Indiana to Texas on the highways, deployed, and then used in Afghanistan and Iraq, and is now being augmented here.
[01:26:39.838 --> 01:26:40.378]  And they admit it.
[01:26:40.378 --> 01:26:42.940]  I mean, this is a military grit against us, okay?
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.500]  Military doesn't belong to us.
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.742]  It's there to ship in cocaine and heroin and ship out little kids.
[01:26:47.742 --> 01:27:00.889]  Here's the clip.
[01:27:00.889 --> 01:27:04.851]  In Maryland, they've even started taking pictures of license plates.
[01:27:06.701 --> 01:27:08.122]  What are we doing here?
[01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.063]  The system we're using has two cameras.
[01:27:10.063 --> 01:27:15.706]  It's constantly taking pictures, observing the tags, allowing the system to record them, and check them against the database.
[01:27:15.706 --> 01:27:23.410]  Suspended or revoked registration.
[01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:25.831]  This technology, used by U.S.
[01:27:25.831 --> 01:27:30.954]  military forces on the streets of Baghdad, has migrated to the streets of Baltimore.
[01:27:32.332 --> 01:27:39.997]  With a license plate reader system, if we're going to get that information, we can then go into the system and see where else this car has been.
[01:27:39.997 --> 01:27:54.446]  The software with the system, when it sees what it thinks is a license plate, it will read it using OCR, optical character recognition, and make a cross-check against a database.
[01:27:54.446 --> 01:28:01.170]  Surveillance cameras at vital institutions are also photographing license plates and adding them to the database.
[01:28:02.915 --> 01:28:10.003]  Maybe nobody called it in when they were at Fort Detrick or Aberdeen Proving Ground or at Bowling Air Force Base.
[01:28:10.003 --> 01:28:14.228]  But the license plate readers will tell us they were there and when they were there and when they passed through.
[01:28:14.228 --> 01:28:16.070]  That's a pattern.
[01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:19.013]  That's something we'd want to know about.
[01:28:19.013 --> 01:28:22.016]  And they've gone one step further.
[01:28:22.016 --> 01:28:23.318]  Smile.
[01:28:23.318 --> 01:28:24.299]  Cameras are everywhere.
[01:28:26.394 --> 01:28:29.276]  We are very big on CCTV.
[01:28:29.276 --> 01:28:45.928]  We believe that it is a force multiplier, that it is an effective way, not only to provide greater security in open spaces, but to get the narcotics in, and it's Times Square, but also it's a much more effective way to guard approaches to tunnels, bridges, and other sorts of static targets.
[01:28:45.928 --> 01:28:48.130]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:48.130 --> 01:28:51.412]  One of three new stories next time on Frontline.
[01:28:51.412 --> 01:28:53.514]  Watch online or on air beginning January 18th.
[01:28:53.514 --> 01:28:53.594]  Okay!
[01:28:55.939 --> 01:28:58.340]  So I guess that starts today.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:07.363]  Now, in all these shows in the last decade where they show you, oh, Florida town, everyone that goes in has their plates run by the cameras.
[01:29:07.363 --> 01:29:17.466]  Or, oh, in a British town, everybody that comes in, you notice that they drive around and they're seeing stolen cars, you name it, and they're not stopping them.
[01:29:17.466 --> 01:29:20.087]  In fact, when your car gets stolen, you can't even get the police to respond.
[01:29:22.283 --> 01:29:24.965]  These things are to control the people.
[01:29:24.965 --> 01:29:27.227]  And they all hook into the threat fusion centers.
[01:29:27.227 --> 01:29:29.789]  And it's to learn your associations.
[01:29:29.789 --> 01:29:39.057]  See, the Stasi would put a radioactive isotope on the floors of apartments to track people by their footprints to learn who was meeting and what was going on.
[01:29:39.057 --> 01:29:47.505]  Now they just track you over your iPhone, your Android, they track you by satellite, they track you by your license plate.
[01:29:47.505 --> 01:29:48.866]  And there are total criminals that are doing it.
[01:29:50.905 --> 01:29:54.815]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.815 --> 01:29:57.502]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.643 --> 01:30:05.206]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.206 --> 01:30:06.106]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.106 --> 01:30:09.529]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:10.389]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.389 --> 01:30:15.292]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:16.033]  It's true.
[01:30:16.033 --> 01:30:20.896]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.896 --> 01:30:21.736]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.736 --> 01:30:25.319]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:29.021]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:30.021]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.021 --> 01:30:32.782]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.782 --> 01:30:36.463]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.463 --> 01:30:37.243]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.243 --> 01:30:41.384]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.384 --> 01:30:46.446]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.446 --> 01:30:50.627]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.627 --> 01:30:52.408]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.408 --> 01:30:57.009]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:01.772 --> 01:31:05.794]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:09.056]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.056 --> 01:31:14.219]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:20.242]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:22.464]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:23.004 --> 01:31:23.284]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.284 --> 01:31:23.464]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.464 --> 01:31:23.844]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:23.844 --> 01:31:24.545]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.506]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.914 --> 01:31:46.295]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:31:46.295 --> 01:31:49.196]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.196 --> 01:31:58.299]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:02.199 --> 01:32:06.160]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:15.021]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:15.021 --> 01:32:19.642]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.642 --> 01:32:30.464]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:31.084 --> 01:32:40.607]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.607 --> 01:32:46.029]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:46.029 --> 01:32:53.532]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.532 --> 01:32:56.273]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:11.801 --> 01:33:15.443]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:33:15.443 --> 01:33:18.384]  Run on for a long time.
[01:33:18.384 --> 01:33:21.225]  Run on for a long time.
[01:33:21.225 --> 01:33:23.286]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:33:23.286 --> 01:33:30.410]  We had Phyllis Schlafly set up for the show and we just got her on the phone during another interview so they got their time zones mixed up.
[01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:32.151]  She's gonna be joining us here in about 15 minutes.
[01:33:33.431 --> 01:33:40.195]  And Dr. Wakefield, we can just get him on about 10 after coming up in the next segment of the next hour because I want some time with her.
[01:33:40.195 --> 01:33:52.501]  To go over this Fox headline from yesterday, Tea Party faces challenges as GOP gains stronger control.
[01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:58.885]  And it just goes into how the big mainline GOP is going right back to their regular globalist arrogance.
[01:33:58.885 --> 01:34:00.766]  What do you expect?
[01:34:01.783 --> 01:34:10.009]  So we'll talk to the founder and head of the Eagle Forum coming up if that pans out, but I've had her on over the years a few times.
[01:34:10.009 --> 01:34:17.635]  If this doesn't pan out today, we'll just set her up for a full hour in the near future.
[01:34:17.635 --> 01:34:21.798]  I want to continue with what I was just saying and going over.
[01:34:21.798 --> 01:34:24.000]  You know, if that sounds hardcore to you,
[01:34:27.056 --> 01:34:31.599]  Where I'm talking about our government, our military, bringing in narcotics.
[01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:33.320]  It's in plain view.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.440]  They were caught in Vietnam.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.422]  They've been caught over and over again in the 1980s and 90s.
[01:34:37.422 --> 01:34:40.044]  There's been congressional hearings on it.
[01:34:40.044 --> 01:34:47.808]  This isn't low-level military men and women who are compartmentalized, and most of them doing important jobs.
[01:34:47.808 --> 01:34:51.911]  It's that at the top, and under the national security umbrella,
[01:34:54.648 --> 01:35:04.051]  NATO is on record, Interpol is on record, the Pentagon, every major branch, the high-level brass, in just total evil.
[01:35:04.051 --> 01:35:15.175]  And when you're in the business of killing people and breaking things, and when in the military, going back thousands of years, you might sacrifice 500 horsemen to lead out the main enemy force.
[01:35:15.175 --> 01:35:19.517]  And you give the order to the horsemen, the cavalry, men you even know, to go off and die.
[01:35:20.686 --> 01:35:25.807]  And so that attitude of human life being cheap or even worthless just permeates.
[01:35:25.807 --> 01:35:37.691]  So if Dyncor and Halliburton can make money first on stupid teenage girls, they trick and pick up and fly out of Central Asia, out of Eastern and Central Europe.
[01:35:38.888 --> 01:35:41.230]  Why not move on to little kids?
[01:35:41.230 --> 01:35:59.524]  And you can pull up Chicago Tribune, you can pull up BBC, UN Sex Trafficking, Dyncor, Halliburton Caught Human Trafficking, and you'll read, just as a footnote, oh, and of the million-plus children trafficked out of Europe every year, the UN estimates,
[01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.830]  It's the U.N.
[01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:04.012]  itself and these big contractors that are doing it.
[01:36:04.012 --> 01:36:07.215]  I mean, this is a big, big business.
[01:36:07.215 --> 01:36:08.676]  And it's just, that's the way it is.
[01:36:08.676 --> 01:36:09.857]  We're the good guys.
[01:36:09.857 --> 01:36:14.242]  Our president wears an American flag lapel.
[01:36:14.242 --> 01:36:21.649]  And see, these are the issues that the big mainline conservatives won't touch, the liberals won't touch.
[01:36:27.568 --> 01:36:29.228]  And I for one am just sick of it.
[01:36:29.228 --> 01:36:34.470]  Nobody is safe with these people running our society.
[01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:35.370]  No one's safe.
[01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:38.971]  Not your pension funds, not your health, not our future.
[01:36:38.971 --> 01:36:42.392]  I mean, these people have hated America from the beginning.
[01:36:42.392 --> 01:36:48.634]  They have done everything they can to tear down our culture, to dumb us down, to destroy our families, to turn us against each other.
[01:36:48.634 --> 01:36:55.616]  The global social engineers have bragged how they hated the Christian ethic, how they hated the family, how they wanted to get rid of it.
[01:36:57.196 --> 01:37:02.280]  And they didn't do it because they were offering something trendy and fun and enlightening and empowering.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.363]  They did it because they wanted you to be isolated and weak.
[01:37:06.363 --> 01:37:07.984]  Even if you're an atheist.
[01:37:07.984 --> 01:37:20.134]  And the point is, it was the Christian Protestant pilgrim work ethic that wasn't perfect, but compared to every other culture in the world, produced unlimited technology, unlimited wealth.
[01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:21.835]  And now it's all gone.
[01:37:21.835 --> 01:37:22.675]  We don't have it anymore.
[01:37:23.513 --> 01:37:32.817]  We are a bunch of dumbed down sloths, myself included, who've got to rediscover the spirit of liberty that empowered this country and made it so great.
[01:37:32.817 --> 01:37:40.199]  Not just because liberty is wonderful, but because tyranny is so horrible.
[01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:42.480]  This is a hot tyranny we're going into.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.262]  There's been a cold war against our freedoms for a long time, but now you can see it.
[01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:51.844]  The war drums aren't over the hill, they're now right amongst us.
[01:37:53.697 --> 01:38:00.341]  And this tyranny is unfolding around all of us each and every single day.
[01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:16.050]  I wanted to take a few minutes out before we get Phyllis Schlafly on to encourage listeners to realize that just because you've known about this for 30 years or 20 years or five years,
[01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:20.770]  Doesn't mean your friends and family do.
[01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:22.491]  But now they know something's wrong.
[01:38:22.491 --> 01:38:24.012]  They're awakening.
[01:38:24.012 --> 01:38:28.215]  Now is the time to reach out to people with films like The Obama Deception on DVD.
[01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:31.771]  Get it at Infowars.com.
[01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:32.831]  Make copies of it.
[01:38:32.831 --> 01:38:34.712]  Air it on your local AXS TV.
[01:38:34.712 --> 01:38:35.832]  Don't screw around.
[01:38:35.832 --> 01:38:37.113]  Jump through the hoops.
[01:38:37.113 --> 01:38:39.454]  Find other producers that have already got shows.
[01:38:39.454 --> 01:38:40.434]  Get them to air it.
[01:38:40.434 --> 01:38:41.635]  Do whatever it takes.
[01:38:41.635 --> 01:38:42.495]  Don't screw around.
[01:38:42.495 --> 01:38:43.816]  Get the job done.
[01:38:43.816 --> 01:38:48.057]  Even little towns, you'll reach hundreds and hundreds of people every time it airs.
[01:38:48.057 --> 01:38:50.478]  Big cities, hundreds of thousands.
[01:38:50.478 --> 01:38:52.239]  Because people are surfing the cable channels.
[01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:54.180]  They'll stop on something like the Obama deception.
[01:38:55.745 --> 01:38:56.946]  A lot of folks are taking action.
[01:38:56.946 --> 01:38:59.647]  We're getting reports of big TV stations all over the country.
[01:38:59.647 --> 01:39:01.649]  People are buying time.
[01:39:01.649 --> 01:39:03.270]  They're not waiting for orders from headquarters.
[01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.551]  They're going to the sound of the guns.
[01:39:04.551 --> 01:39:05.891]  They're airing Endgame.
[01:39:05.891 --> 01:39:07.552]  They're airing Invisible Empire.
[01:39:07.552 --> 01:39:09.694]  They're airing What in the World Do They Spring?
[01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:11.635]  It's not one of my films, but I hear it's airing.
[01:39:11.635 --> 01:39:12.976]  They're airing The Obama Deception.
[01:39:12.976 --> 01:39:15.177]  They're airing Fall of the Republic.
[01:39:15.177 --> 01:39:17.379]  It's having an effect.
[01:39:17.379 --> 01:39:18.079]  And keep doing it.
[01:39:18.079 --> 01:39:18.920]  Get Endgame.
[01:39:19.724 --> 01:39:21.245]  Get Invisible Empire.
[01:39:21.245 --> 01:39:23.207]  Get What In The World Are They Spraying With The Chemtrails.
[01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:24.768]  Get The Obama Deception.
[01:39:24.768 --> 01:39:28.010]  We've got a deal still running where you can get five of my films.
[01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:29.191]  Five.
[01:39:29.191 --> 01:39:30.832]  Not one, not two, not three, not four.
[01:39:30.832 --> 01:39:31.713]  Five for $24.95.
[01:39:31.713 --> 01:39:35.275]  That's less than $5 a piece.
[01:39:35.275 --> 01:39:35.676]  Get them.
[01:39:35.676 --> 01:39:36.696]  Get them out to everybody.
[01:39:36.696 --> 01:39:41.560]  And that little amount of profit we make allows this operation to be funded.
[01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:51.152]  You're also always welcome to go to the online video bookstore shopping cart and there's a donation button if that's the way you want to give right there to fund this operation.
[01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:58.317]  Also all of our great sponsors but the t-shirts, the books, the films, those are super effective because you're not just
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:27.233]  Funding this operation, if you give us a donation, you are actually, which helps get the websites and the films and the work out, you know that when you get a DVD and make 100 copies or even just 10 copies or 1,000, whatever the case is, and you hand them out to people, you know you're having an effect and you're participating in it out there, growing your liberty muscles, growing your activism muscles, engaging with more people, and not just getting yourself more limber like a boxer,
[01:40:27.893 --> 01:40:28.233]  I don't
[01:40:47.284 --> 01:40:57.327]  Going and talking to a girl and asking her out to a movie, because the girls were so pretty and their hair and their eyes and their lipstick that I was like an animal when I was a teenager.
[01:40:57.327 --> 01:41:14.452]  I wasn't, but I mean, I didn't really have a lot of emotional hangups when it came to being nervous, but I still did when I was trying to sell somebody something or when I was just calling up about to come in for a job interview at a gas station.
[01:41:17.092 --> 01:41:20.295]  And I see adults now, and you see those signs of concern.
[01:41:20.295 --> 01:41:24.598]  You see adults when they have to call somebody in business, they're nervous before they do it.
[01:41:24.598 --> 01:41:27.961]  I've done it so much, it's like automated.
[01:41:27.961 --> 01:41:31.304]  It's not even confidence, it's just that I've done it so much.
[01:41:31.304 --> 01:41:37.629]  In fact, it's almost like an overconfidence where I'm like halfway asleep sometimes on air.
[01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:41.493]  I'm excited I'm on air, but I'm not excited where I'm nervous
[01:41:42.546 --> 01:41:45.668]  And so I'm not even as focused as I should be is what I'm saying.
[01:41:45.668 --> 01:41:48.830]  I mean, I'm almost too far on the other extreme.
[01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:53.353]  My point is get out there, talk to people, get accustomed to it, get things done.
[01:41:53.353 --> 01:41:54.494]  Don't be timid.
[01:41:54.494 --> 01:42:05.521]  You're engaged in an emergency operation to awaken people and to cause a splash and a stir peacefully to get the word out at city council, at county commissioner's meetings.
[01:42:06.201 --> 01:42:08.862]  Most of those are aired on local TV or on cable.
[01:42:08.862 --> 01:42:10.523]  You can go speak to them there.
[01:42:10.523 --> 01:42:25.668]  You can read for three minutes about fluoride, read for three minutes about the wars, talk for three minutes about the threat fusion centers, the federalization, talk for three minutes about the face scanning cameras, talk for three minutes about my films or other films or websites.
[01:42:26.848 --> 01:42:31.111]  All of you should go get your own YouTube channels and start politically speaking.
[01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:36.034]  Show one of the first time your audio is not that good and the video is blurry and you stumble around.
[01:42:37.557 --> 01:42:41.358]  My first year at AXS TV in 1995, I was doing it by myself.
[01:42:41.358 --> 01:42:53.741]  I didn't have anybody in the studio to help me, so I just did it in the control room with a camera and I'd turn a light on and I'd all be up there, you know, with a fisheye look, ranting about the New World Order.
[01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:55.281]  But I had to warn people.
[01:42:55.281 --> 01:42:59.542]  They had bills in the legislature to try to take our guns.
[01:42:59.542 --> 01:43:02.183]  They had bills in the legislature to take our farmland.
[01:43:04.468 --> 01:43:07.250]  The feds and the UN were doing things that had to be resisted.
[01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:08.170]  I had to get on air.
[01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:10.492]  I had to warn people.
[01:43:10.492 --> 01:43:14.634]  I didn't intend for any of this to happen.
[01:43:14.634 --> 01:43:16.935]  I just knew I had to resist them.
[01:43:16.935 --> 01:43:18.376]  And look at the success I've had.
[01:43:18.376 --> 01:43:19.037]  Am I perfect?
[01:43:19.037 --> 01:43:20.017]  Do I have all the answers?
[01:43:20.017 --> 01:43:21.078]  No!
[01:43:21.078 --> 01:43:22.639]  But I'm real.
[01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:26.061]  And that's what matters.
[01:43:26.061 --> 01:43:26.361]  And again,
[01:43:32.349 --> 01:43:34.330]  We've got to get involved in this fight.
[01:43:34.330 --> 01:43:40.553]  We've got to use the best, most truthful, most accurate, most well-done tools we've got in the Infowar.
[01:43:40.553 --> 01:43:44.975]  And that's films like Invisible Empire that I produced, directed by Jason Vermas.
[01:43:44.975 --> 01:43:47.856]  The seminal endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:43:47.856 --> 01:43:50.698]  Films we carry, like What in the World Are They Spraying?
[01:43:50.698 --> 01:43:52.098]  Films like Terror Storm.
[01:43:52.098 --> 01:43:53.979]  They're all available at Infowars.com.
[01:43:53.979 --> 01:43:56.060]  You can also go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.621]  A literal arsenal.
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.261]  In the Infowar.
[01:44:00.261 --> 01:44:02.283]  Thousands of different interviews.
[01:44:02.283 --> 01:44:06.006]  Tens of thousands of total shows.
[01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:09.849]  Now almost four years of video archives of the show.
[01:44:09.849 --> 01:44:11.771]  Seven years of audio archives.
[01:44:11.771 --> 01:44:12.632]  All of my films.
[01:44:12.632 --> 01:44:13.973]  Expanded extras.
[01:44:13.973 --> 01:44:16.355]  All these big exclusive interviews.
[01:44:16.355 --> 01:44:19.417]  Uploading multiple ones a week.
[01:44:19.417 --> 01:44:20.298]  Joel Skousen.
[01:44:21.966 --> 01:44:42.463]  Chuck Baldwin this week, Russell Means, I mean, Et Wounded Knee, shot, beautiful high death, powerful, vaccine issues, tyranny, every issue you can imagine, all of it covered in detail.
[01:44:42.463 --> 01:44:46.666]  And you can go in there and burn it to disk, download it, share it with people, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:46.666 --> 01:44:47.306]  We've got another
[01:44:48.063 --> 01:44:50.905]  Now, continuing here with the news, this needs to be stood up against.
[01:45:12.802 --> 01:45:19.883]  NASA's Hanson imposed Chinese totalitarianism on America.
[01:45:19.883 --> 01:45:22.284]  Totalitarian thugs love China.
[01:45:22.284 --> 01:45:25.805]  They love its authoritarian government and absolute political power.
[01:45:25.805 --> 01:45:29.666]  One such thug is climatologist James Henson.
[01:45:29.666 --> 01:45:32.806]  This is a Curt Nemo article at presentplanet.com.
[01:45:32.806 --> 01:45:40.948]  Henson thinks America needs to adopt Chinese authoritarianism in order to force climate change down the throats of the American people.
[01:45:41.448 --> 01:45:46.969]  And then he has the quotes about how great China is and how we need to go with their system and how they've got it all straight.
[01:45:46.969 --> 01:46:00.472]  Just like David Rockefeller wrote those editorials for the New York Times saying how great Mao Zedong was, after it was all over the news that he was a mass murderer and even the Chinese government had decried it, he came out and defended it.
[01:46:00.472 --> 01:46:07.454]  He goes on to say that China and Europe need to impose carbon tariffs on us if we don't accept it.
[01:46:11.261 --> 01:46:15.484]  And he goes on to praise it.
[01:46:15.484 --> 01:46:16.625]  And then we have quotes here.
[01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:23.450]  In China, thought reform or thought control is considered the goal.
[01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:28.154]  It is psychological and spiritual submissiveness, often achieved through violence.
[01:46:28.154 --> 01:46:30.656]  It is the envy of totalitarian thugs around the world.
[01:46:36.405 --> 01:46:48.112]  And it goes on here that James Hansen should be promptly removed from his position at the head of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
[01:46:52.623 --> 01:46:58.706]  Okay, now joining us, and I really appreciate her coming on, and I hope she'll join us again in the future.
[01:46:58.706 --> 01:47:03.849]  She's only got about 20 minutes with us, is Phyllis Chaffley, national leader of the conservative movement.
[01:47:03.849 --> 01:47:07.731]  Since the publication of her first best-selling book in 1964, A Choice, Not an Echo.
[01:47:09.332 --> 01:47:10.392]  Thank you, I'm happy to talk to you.
[01:47:38.476 --> 01:47:44.519]  You know, out of the gates here, I don't know if you've heard of this, but the Washington Times and others are reporting on it.
[01:47:44.519 --> 01:47:54.365]  What do you think of the head of the Goddard Space Center, the NASA climatologist, praising Chinese authoritarianism and saying we need it here to force carbon taxes through?
[01:47:54.365 --> 01:47:59.228]  These people are really uncloaking the fact that they're really just authoritarians.
[01:47:59.228 --> 01:48:04.231]  Yes, I think after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990,
[01:48:05.422 --> 01:48:10.263]  A lot of the hardcore leftists and communists moved into the environmental movement.
[01:48:10.263 --> 01:48:12.404]  And they want government to take over.
[01:48:12.404 --> 01:48:14.744]  These are earth worshippers.
[01:48:14.744 --> 01:48:16.985]  Their god is the earth.
[01:48:16.985 --> 01:48:19.046]  And they want to control us.
[01:48:19.046 --> 01:48:27.148]  They want to tell us some... Well, you know, Obama himself said, you can't keep the thermostat in your house set at 72 anymore.
[01:48:27.148 --> 01:48:27.988]  Well, I know other than...
[01:48:29.106 --> 01:48:32.809]  We've built a wonderful, prosperous, high standard of living.
[01:48:32.809 --> 01:48:38.994]  And if we want our houses set at 72, we're entitled to have our houses set at 72.
[01:48:38.994 --> 01:48:50.002]  And so the environmentalists, what they're doing to the light bulbs, they're taking away our light bulbs and trying to make us use these kooky bulbs that are made in China.
[01:48:50.002 --> 01:48:55.326]  Yeah, they're setting the key precedence that we are controlled by a central commissarian.
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:03.106]  Yes, and they are developing the idea that the laws could be made by the regulators instead of by the lawmaker.
[01:49:03.106 --> 01:49:07.050]  And that's a very awesome, unconstitutional approach.
[01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:10.874]  And this is particularly true in the environmental field.
[01:49:10.874 --> 01:49:11.914]  Well, look at Texas.
[01:49:11.914 --> 01:49:21.964]  They couldn't pass the carbon taxes that China and others are exempt from in Congress, so now the EPA is literally seizing the regulating of the Texas power plants.
[01:49:22.916 --> 01:49:23.977]  Uh, that's correct.
[01:49:23.977 --> 01:49:33.601]  And in fact, the Obama administration is pretty upfront about saying that they want to do by regulation what they can't do in Congress.
[01:49:33.601 --> 01:49:40.784]  And bad as the Obamacare was, with its, what was it, 2,000 pages that we hope is going to get repealed,
[01:49:41.525 --> 01:50:02.297]  It's set up all kinds of regulatory agencies and regulatory authorities and they have these bars over everything who are not confirmed in the constitutional way and Obama's whole plan to fundamentally transform the United States is to have an authoritarian socialist style government.
[01:50:03.757 --> 01:50:10.958]  Why did Wall Street give him four times the money they gave McCain, according to the Wall Street Journal, if he's so communistic?
[01:50:10.958 --> 01:50:18.740]  I mean, is it what Carol Quigley wrote about, that some of the big mega-banks and people, they like to collectivize the general public's wealth?
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:28.142]  Well, I think that's part of it, but it's also, at the time they gave him all that money, the presumption was he was going to win.
[01:50:28.906 --> 01:50:33.489]  And they like to buy, what they do with their money is to buy access.
[01:50:33.489 --> 01:50:37.632]  And they wanted to have access to him when he was elected.
[01:50:37.632 --> 01:50:41.795]  So they wanted to keep him close to him because they saw him as the winner.
[01:50:41.795 --> 01:50:42.735]  I tend to agree with that.
[01:50:42.735 --> 01:50:49.440]  But now, since then, he has loaded his administration with the Clinton crew who got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.982]  Bill Shaftley, founder of the Eagle Forum, is our guest.
[01:50:52.982 --> 01:50:54.684]  We're going to come right back after this quick break.
[01:50:55.544 --> 01:51:00.985]  We've only got her for about 10 more minutes, but hopefully we can get her back up in the near future for a longer interview.
[01:51:00.985 --> 01:51:10.507]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:51:10.507 --> 01:51:11.808]  My name is Crystal.
[01:51:11.808 --> 01:51:14.748]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:51:14.748 --> 01:51:18.709]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:22.670]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:23.691]  What did Crystal do?
[01:51:23.691 --> 01:51:27.635]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:51:27.635 --> 01:51:34.063]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:51:34.063 --> 01:51:37.607]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:53:00.256 --> 01:53:01.557]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.557 --> 01:53:07.142]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.142 --> 01:53:12.167]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.167 --> 01:53:17.212]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:17.732 --> 01:53:22.955]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:53:44.065 --> 01:53:44.325]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:44.325 --> 01:53:47.866]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:47.866 --> 01:53:49.607]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:04.172 --> 01:54:10.884]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest and again the website is Eagle Forum if you want to check it out.
[01:54:13.456 --> 01:54:19.098]  We're going to have to get her back on sometime in the next few weeks for the full interview because we got wires crossed.
[01:54:19.098 --> 01:54:22.440]  We only got her for this segment and the next.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:34.164]  But Phyllis, again the website EagleForum.org, I see this Fox News headline, Tea Party Faces Challenges As GOP Gains Stronger Control.
[01:54:34.164 --> 01:54:38.226]  And the Fox News article basically says that it's going to be business as usual.
[01:54:39.281 --> 01:54:45.625]  With the Republican fat cats, you know, keeping the gravy train and big government and all of these things going.
[01:54:45.625 --> 01:54:57.973]  But then I look at Ron Paul winning the CPAC straw poll a year ago or so and getting a standing ovation when he said, in these wars, and that's, you know, the really powerful Republicans all together right there.
[01:54:57.973 --> 01:54:59.814]  You're inside the Republican Party.
[01:54:59.814 --> 01:55:03.177]  I mean, you're able to get a good look at it from different perspectives.
[01:55:03.177 --> 01:55:04.257]  What's really going on?
[01:55:04.257 --> 01:55:07.880]  Is there any hope from the Republicans or is it just going to turn into the same old thing?
[01:55:09.008 --> 01:55:19.535]  Well, I have hope for the Republicans, and they are going to try to absolutely repeal Obamacare in the House this week.
[01:55:19.535 --> 01:55:29.922]  And although it probably won't pass in the Senate, and Obama will veto it, nevertheless, it's an important statement.
[01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:33.824]  And I think they ought to then start to dismantle it after they do.
[01:55:33.824 --> 01:55:37.667]  There are a couple of lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of it.
[01:55:38.557 --> 01:55:48.385]  One judge has already held that the mandate on everybody is unconstitutional, and we think the second judge is going to do that shortly, in the next day or so.
[01:55:48.385 --> 01:55:53.308]  So I'm encouraged, and we welcome all the Tea Party people to join us.
[01:55:53.308 --> 01:55:57.812]  I think our goals are the same, and we need all the help we can get.
[01:55:59.773 --> 01:56:07.363]  Well, my only concern is, you know, the Eagle Forum has talked a lot about authoritarianism and tyranny and things.
[01:56:07.363 --> 01:56:15.594]  My only concern is, I've got a quote here out of the Hill newspaper with Cheney saying that, oh, Obama has learned from the Bush
[01:56:16.934 --> 01:56:18.435]  I mean, learn from Bush.
[01:56:18.435 --> 01:56:22.157]  I guess he has expanded the deficit and spending even more than Bush.
[01:56:22.157 --> 01:56:28.599]  I guess he did learn from him, or rendition, or torture, or secret police, or warrantless wiretapping.
[01:56:28.599 --> 01:56:34.862]  Where does the Eagle Forum stand on, you know, things like that that we decry when China does it?
[01:56:34.862 --> 01:56:42.345]  But I mean, where does the Eagle Forum stand, who I know does a lot of good work throughout the years, on the loss of liberty here and abroad?
[01:56:43.591 --> 01:56:48.333]  Well, when you talk about Obama going to moderate, I think you're trying to be funny.
[01:56:48.333 --> 01:56:50.754]  There's no way he's going to do that.
[01:56:50.754 --> 01:56:52.615]  He's a committed socialist.
[01:56:52.615 --> 01:57:08.862]  You should read the new book by Stanley Kurtz about how he became a committed socialist when he was at Columbia University, and he said he wanted to fundamentally transform the United States of America, and that he wants to redistribute the money, and that's not only from rich
[01:57:09.666 --> 01:57:13.707]  Taxpayers to poor in the United States, but it's also from the U.S.
[01:57:13.707 --> 01:57:15.428]  to the rest of the world.
[01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:27.252]  And I think we have to recognize that he's an enemy of everything that constitutionalists and conservatives and real Americans really believe in, and we have to fight it all the way.
[01:57:27.252 --> 01:57:29.792]  We need the Tea Party people to help us.
[01:57:29.792 --> 01:57:31.533]  I think they will.
[01:57:31.533 --> 01:57:37.755]  We need to keep pushing some backbone into the hands of the leaders, our leaders in Washington.
[01:57:38.498 --> 01:57:41.852]  And I hope they're going to fulfill their campaign promises.
[01:57:41.852 --> 01:57:42.977]  That's why we elected them.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:51.303]  Yeah, no, I mean, no doubt Obama wants to create socialism to control the population and domesticate us.
[01:57:51.303 --> 01:58:07.849]  My issue is, you look at Nixon going to China, and you look at Kissinger and all these other so-called conservatives, these Rockefeller Republicans, they've started basically the movements that now sees the Red Dragon owning the majority of our debt and telling us what to do.
[01:58:07.849 --> 01:58:12.271]  I mean, that's why I'm saying I don't have a lot of faith in the Republicans.
[01:58:13.243 --> 01:58:23.365]  Well, I think we got rid of the Rockefeller Republicans, and we've done a pretty good job of getting rid of the RINOs, which is just the new name for the Rockefeller Republicans.
[01:58:23.365 --> 01:58:25.765]  Republicans in name only.
[01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:36.727]  I think the conservatives are in the driver's seat in the Republican Party, and the question is, will they have the backbone to stand up against things?
[01:58:36.727 --> 01:58:40.108]  I've come to believe that... Stay right there, we've got to go to break.
[01:58:40.108 --> 01:58:40.448]  Back in 60.
[01:58:40.828 --> 01:58:45.771]  The GCN Radio Network, providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:58:45.771 --> 01:58:48.152]  GCN.
[01:58:48.152 --> 01:58:50.853]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[01:58:50.853 --> 01:58:52.014]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:52.014 --> 01:58:58.157]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.937 --> 01:58:59.117]  Yes.
[01:59:19.173 --> 01:59:21.855]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.855 --> 01:59:27.638]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.638 --> 01:59:29.279]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.279 --> 01:59:30.580]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.241]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.241 --> 01:59:37.464]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.464 --> 01:59:42.086]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:59:42.086 --> 01:59:44.688]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:59.037]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.543 --> 02:00:10.385]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.385 --> 02:00:11.966]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.966 --> 02:00:13.507]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.507 --> 02:00:17.709]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:21.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.919 --> 02:00:35.360]  Well, the founder and the head of the Eagle Forum, EagleForum.org, Phyllis Lafley, is our guest.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:42.521]  It's our final segment with her, but we're going to try to get her back on next Tuesday for the full 30-minute interview that we had planned.
[02:00:42.521 --> 02:00:47.322]  You know, when I talk about not having faith in the Republicans, I mean I want to keep their feet to the fire.
[02:00:47.322 --> 02:00:52.923]  We do see the media demonizing people like Rand Paul, throwing everything, every lie they can at him.
[02:00:52.923 --> 02:00:56.824]  And so that really is the, I guess, the seal that somebody is good,
[02:00:57.724 --> 02:01:01.446]  If the corporate media, the establishment media is going after him.
[02:01:01.446 --> 02:01:06.329]  I just see stuff like Cheney says Obama has learned that Bush policies were right.
[02:01:06.329 --> 02:01:09.531]  That's from the Hill newspaper.
[02:01:09.531 --> 02:01:14.954]  But Phyllis, what's your take on how we do keep the feet to the fire?
[02:01:14.954 --> 02:01:19.657]  I mean, I did see a good sign when they abolished the Global Warming Committee last week.
[02:01:19.657 --> 02:01:20.798]  I guess that was a good sign.
[02:01:22.103 --> 02:01:26.306]  Well, I think constituents have to keep contacting their congressman.
[02:01:26.306 --> 02:01:43.758]  At my website, EagleFarm.org, I've got a good system called CapWiz, where after we send out alerts, and if you get on our list, you can receive our alerts, or you can go on the website, and then it's a system where you can contact your congressman direct.
[02:01:43.758 --> 02:01:47.761]  Because all they really care about is their own constituents.
[02:01:48.949 --> 02:01:53.252]  And you have to override what the media are telling them.
[02:01:53.252 --> 02:01:59.958]  But I think Cheney doesn't have any influence in the Republican Party anymore.
[02:01:59.958 --> 02:02:06.503]  He used to have been, and I think we've got new leadership.
[02:02:06.503 --> 02:02:15.631]  If you look at what some people like Michelle Bachmann and Steve King and other of these young members of Congress are saying,
[02:02:16.332 --> 02:02:19.093]  We've got some real leadership coming up the line.
[02:02:19.093 --> 02:02:22.693]  What do you think of Ron Paul and Rand Paul?
[02:02:22.693 --> 02:02:27.234]  Well, I certainly supported and contributed to Rand Paul, and I'm glad he won.
[02:02:27.234 --> 02:02:33.855]  I've been a longtime friend of Ron Paul, and I think he has some very important things.
[02:02:33.855 --> 02:02:40.176]  It's amazing how he's increased his support for having an audit with the Federal Reserve.
[02:02:40.176 --> 02:02:42.917]  But I'm very much opposed to a third party.
[02:02:43.562 --> 02:02:53.230]  We lost about 10 very excellent candidates on November 2nd because of third-party votes that took just a small number of
[02:03:00.766 --> 02:03:07.750]  So you'd rather have Libertarians and Constitutionalists take over the Republican Party instead of trying to start their own third party?
[02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:12.972]  I can tell you right now, Ron Paul, I believe, is going to run for President, and I think he'll be the best candidate.
[02:03:12.972 --> 02:03:16.774]  I don't think he's going to be too old, because he's in great shape, and I hope you'll support him.
[02:03:16.774 --> 02:03:20.016]  But you know Rand Paul's the real deal, the way they went after him.
[02:03:20.016 --> 02:03:20.916]  Wasn't that disgusting?
[02:03:23.502 --> 02:03:26.064]  And I'm glad he won.
[02:03:26.064 --> 02:03:33.130]  And Ron Paul has a lot to contribute, and I hope he continues to run as a Republican.
[02:03:33.130 --> 02:03:36.413]  Well, I think the public was smart enough to figure out what they were doing.
[02:03:48.001 --> 02:03:49.801]  And I don't think it got anywhere.
[02:03:49.801 --> 02:03:57.643]  You know, the Democrats were trying to play it like Clinton played the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:03:57.643 --> 02:04:05.325]  And he thought that, which Clinton had nothing to do with, was what rehabilitated him with the American people.
[02:04:05.325 --> 02:04:16.068]  But, you know, it's now come out that with Obama's speech about the Arizona event, of course, he only speaks from a teleprompter.
[02:04:16.911 --> 02:04:22.479]  But they had inserted prompts for the audience to applaud.
[02:04:22.479 --> 02:04:25.624]  Now, that is so tacky.
[02:04:25.624 --> 02:04:27.547]  You can hardly believe it.
[02:04:27.547 --> 02:04:29.190]  It's just a fake.
[02:04:29.190 --> 02:04:31.273]  And I don't think people were taken in by it.
[02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:37.816]  Well, the founder and head of the Eagle Forum, what an iconic person.
[02:04:37.816 --> 02:04:45.742]  We appreciate Phyllis Schlafly joining us, and I look forward to getting you on sometime next week for at least 30 minutes.
[02:04:45.742 --> 02:04:46.823]  Phyllis, we'll talk to you again.
[02:04:46.823 --> 02:04:47.223]  Okay, Alex.
[02:04:47.223 --> 02:04:49.385]  We'll have fun next week.
[02:04:49.385 --> 02:04:49.605]  You bet.
[02:04:49.605 --> 02:04:51.807]  I'm going to say a word to you here during the break.
[02:04:51.807 --> 02:04:53.468]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:53.468 --> 02:04:53.889]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.184 --> 02:05:04.767]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:05:04.767 --> 02:05:06.068]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:05:06.068 --> 02:05:10.472]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:05:10.472 --> 02:05:16.418]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:05:16.418 --> 02:05:18.559]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.559 --> 02:05:21.242]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.582 --> 02:05:28.084]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:28.084 --> 02:05:30.285]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:05:30.285 --> 02:05:35.627]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:05:35.627 --> 02:05:40.909]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:05:40.909 --> 02:05:46.291]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:05:46.291 --> 02:05:47.992]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[02:05:48.092 --> 02:05:48.392]  We're good!
[02:06:00.407 --> 02:06:04.949]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.949 --> 02:06:05.870]  Number one.
[02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:09.292]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.292 --> 02:06:10.152]  Number two.
[02:06:10.152 --> 02:06:15.035]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.035 --> 02:06:15.775]  It's true.
[02:06:15.775 --> 02:06:20.658]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.658 --> 02:06:21.478]  Number three.
[02:06:21.478 --> 02:06:25.060]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.962 --> 02:06:29.762]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.762 --> 02:06:32.524]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.524 --> 02:06:36.206]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.206 --> 02:06:36.986]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.986 --> 02:06:41.148]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.148 --> 02:06:46.191]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:08:06.371 --> 02:08:08.652]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:14.657 --> 02:08:23.128]  Well, fresh off being on Good Morning America and programs like that is Dr. Andrew Wakefield here in studio for the balance of this hour.
[02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:25.511]  We're honored to have him.
[02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:30.518]  I wanted to hit a few stories that are up at GCNLive.com, also at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:30.518 --> 02:08:32.060]  TSA continues to deny
[02:08:33.021 --> 02:08:34.723]  ...that scanners store images.
[02:08:34.723 --> 02:08:38.386]  Jason Douglas has a report on this at InfoWars.com as well.
[02:08:38.386 --> 02:08:45.733]  But the problem here is they just denied a four-year request for the thousands of images they admit that they have.
[02:08:45.733 --> 02:08:49.897]  And they've had the courthouse in Miami, it turned out, 35,000 images.
[02:08:49.897 --> 02:08:51.458]  Folks, they're storing these.
[02:08:51.458 --> 02:08:55.382]  It's in the owner's manual of the systems that they're storing them.
[02:08:56.022 --> 02:08:59.483]  Okay, so they're liars when they say that they can't even store them.
[02:08:59.483 --> 02:09:03.405]  They say, these machines won't even store images, and we have the owner's manual.
[02:09:03.405 --> 02:09:05.526]  They're lying on that front.
[02:09:05.526 --> 02:09:17.451]  Also, at GCNLive.com, Stuxnet, it's now come out to be a so-called conspiracy theory.
[02:09:17.451 --> 02:09:20.272]  Well, now it's turned out to be true.
[02:09:22.523 --> 02:09:23.764]  Just amazing.
[02:09:23.764 --> 02:09:32.891]  So the Stuxnet worm that's been launched all over the world, Israel and the United States now admit that they created it but they're simultaneously using it.
[02:09:34.198 --> 02:09:40.642]  To take over internet freedom when our own governments launched it at Iran and it bounced back into the United States.
[02:09:40.642 --> 02:09:46.706]  Also at GCNlive.com, Nassus Hansen, it says in post, Chinese totalitarianism on the world.
[02:09:46.706 --> 02:09:51.849]  Actually has his quotes, saying how great authoritarianism is and here.
[02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:55.272]  In the United States and Wyoming.
[02:09:55.272 --> 02:09:56.413]  They're also doing it in Texas.
[02:09:56.413 --> 02:10:02.497]  No Refusal Blood Checkpoints Program continues to expand nationwide.
[02:10:02.497 --> 02:10:04.198]  And that's by Steve Watson.
[02:10:04.198 --> 02:10:06.900]  They're putting that in a DNA database.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:11.083]  Just like I was told 15 years ago by a nurse who was involved in a secret Pentagon program.
[02:10:11.083 --> 02:10:15.826]  She sent me the documents that all babies at birth were having their blood put in a secret DNA database.
[02:10:15.826 --> 02:10:19.689]  Even though I published the documents with phone numbers and names, the media laughed at me.
[02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:24.690]  And then last year, they come out with lawsuits that were won in Minnesota and Texas, and guess what?
[02:10:24.690 --> 02:10:32.152]  They've been taking blood from babies, all babies born in hospitals under a secret international mandate for 39 years.
[02:10:32.152 --> 02:10:40.594]  Australia, England, Germany, Canada, the United States, 39 years globally in a giant global DNA database.
[02:10:41.354 --> 02:10:41.894]  And the U.S.
[02:10:41.894 --> 02:10:43.255]  military keeps it here.
[02:10:43.255 --> 02:10:50.680]  And they also sell it to private firms for DNA tracking, trying to isolate different proteins and things.
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:11:04.528]  The reason this came out in lawsuits was people would go to have a genetic treatment that companies would offer and they'd say, oh, we've actually already patented, you know, 28 years ago in one case in San Francisco, your blood type and the proteins in your blood.
[02:11:04.528 --> 02:11:05.508]  And they said, well, how'd you do that?
[02:11:05.508 --> 02:11:06.289]  Well, we got your blood.
[02:11:07.009 --> 02:11:09.430]  I mean, that's how far advanced all of this is.
[02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:11.871]  We're not in Kansas anymore, as they say.
[02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:20.235]  Now, shifting gears for the next 50 minutes, or the last 50 minutes of the broadcast, here's the headline in ABC News yesterday.
[02:11:20.235 --> 02:11:25.658]  British researcher Wakefield defends link between vaccine and autism.
[02:11:25.658 --> 02:11:30.640]  British researcher holds true to his study despite claims of falsified data.
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.161]  Now, they keep running this hoax year after year against him.
[02:11:33.161 --> 02:11:34.242]  They pick one doctor,
[02:11:35.657 --> 02:11:49.522]  Despite the fact I've had all these other scientists, brain surgeons, epidemiologists on who cite and write books of just test after test with vaccines linked to Crohn's, vaccines linked to brain damage, autoimmune problems.
[02:11:49.522 --> 02:11:58.025]  British news, British government tells doctors don't give under fives H1N1 shot because of tenfold increase in seizures.
[02:11:58.025 --> 02:11:59.045]  That's London Telegraph.
[02:11:59.865 --> 02:12:01.906]  Now what did Wakefield say decades ago?
[02:12:01.906 --> 02:12:07.129]  He did the studies, did the tests, found these different antibodies in the gut.
[02:12:07.129 --> 02:12:10.391]  That's connected also to other autoimmune problems in the body.
[02:12:10.391 --> 02:12:12.892]  That's what all the research shows.
[02:12:12.892 --> 02:12:14.133]  He's a pioneer in it.
[02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:20.738]  And so they try to target him and claim, and I brought this synopsis up to him during the break as we were getting him in there.
[02:12:20.738 --> 02:12:21.659]  I said, is that accurate?
[02:12:21.659 --> 02:12:22.800]  He said, absolutely.
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.063]  Because see, I've been watching this over the years, and this is how they do it.
[02:12:26.063 --> 02:12:32.648]  They perpetrate these hoaxes, like saying, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Ron Paul, we made the guy kill the people.
[02:12:32.648 --> 02:12:36.372]  Turns out he was a schizophrenic out of his mind, dressed as a woman who hated George Bush.
[02:12:37.108 --> 02:12:37.408]  Yeah.
[02:12:53.664 --> 02:12:56.085]  Gastroenterologist, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[02:12:56.085 --> 02:12:57.866]  He received his medical degree from St.
[02:12:57.866 --> 02:13:00.927]  Mary's Hospital Medical School, part of the University of London in 81.
[02:13:00.927 --> 02:13:05.428]  One of the fourth generation of his family to have studied medicine at the teaching hospital.
[02:13:05.428 --> 02:13:12.851]  He qualified as a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 85 and 96 was awarded the Wellcome Trust Traveling Fellowship to study small intestinal
[02:13:13.491 --> 02:13:15.512]  Transplantation in Toronto, Canada.
[02:13:15.512 --> 02:13:20.175]  He has made a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists in 2001.
[02:13:20.175 --> 02:13:29.340]  He has published over 140 original scientific articles, book chapters, and invented scientific commentaries, or invited scientific commentaries.
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:41.227]  And it goes on, in the pursuit of possible links between childhood vaccines and intestinal inflammation, and neurologic injury in children, Dr. Wakefield lost his job in the Department of Medicine in London's Royal Free Hospital
[02:13:41.927 --> 02:13:59.114]  His country, his career and his medical license and the website is callous-disregard.com and of course he knows Jenny McCarthy and you know everybody else has been speaking out against this but here he is to be able to put it on the record for folks out there what's really going on with the real science is.
[02:13:59.114 --> 02:14:02.035]  Dr. Wakefield, thanks for joining us.
[02:14:02.035 --> 02:14:02.995]  Alex, thank you very much.
[02:14:02.995 --> 02:14:03.856]  Great pleasure to be here.
[02:14:03.856 --> 02:14:04.316]  Absolutely.
[02:14:04.316 --> 02:14:07.337]  Well tell us about your research, what you discovered and what they're trying to do to you right now.
[02:14:07.742 --> 02:14:17.468]  Well, first of all, for your readers and your enlightened viewers who already know, the allegations made against me by the British freelance journalist Brian Deer are completely false.
[02:14:17.468 --> 02:14:18.248]  They're completely false.
[02:14:18.248 --> 02:14:33.958]  Not because I say so, because the documents say so, and you've been kind enough to put my book out there in the past and recommended Callous Disregard, which meticulously takes every one of his allegations, dissects it, and offers a coherent answer that rejects, completely rejects, his position.
[02:14:34.338 --> 02:14:36.979]  Now, the allegations that he's made are over a year old.
[02:14:36.979 --> 02:14:38.800]  So why have they now been rehashed?
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:46.783]  Why have they now been put in front of the media again in a desperate attempt to stop valid scientific research into safety concerns about vaccines?
[02:14:46.783 --> 02:14:48.524]  Because that's what this is about.
[02:14:48.524 --> 02:14:54.146]  It's about taking the messenger and shooting him because it doesn't fit with their agenda.
[02:14:54.146 --> 02:14:59.529]  It compromises their policy, it compromises their bottom line, and they do not want to hear about it.
[02:15:00.129 --> 02:15:05.937]  As you rightly point out, there are a whole host of scientists around the world now who have reproduced these findings.
[02:15:05.937 --> 02:15:09.282]  Perhaps more importantly, Alex, the people who have spoken.
[02:15:09.282 --> 02:15:11.245]  Last year they did a survey at the University of Michigan.
[02:15:12.279 --> 02:15:15.321]  25% of people, parents, believe that vaccines cause autism.
[02:15:15.321 --> 02:15:24.267]  Now that's despite an extraordinarily intensive, expensive and elaborate campaign against me and against parents who believe there's a problem.
[02:15:24.267 --> 02:15:25.588]  A public relations campaign.
[02:15:25.588 --> 02:15:36.235]  This year, I've just been sent a document showing that there's a local poll in Ohio, a popular poll, showing it's now 61% of parents believe that vaccines cause autism.
[02:15:36.235 --> 02:15:41.779]  Now whatever the respective merits of those polls, what they tell us is that that public relations campaign has failed.
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:45.706]  It's failed because the problem is real.
[02:15:45.706 --> 02:15:53.981]  The parent's story is correct and it's up to scientists and physicians like me to investigate it to the best of our ability to determine what the truth is.
[02:15:54.534 --> 02:16:18.766]  Tell us how you started to investigate and what your findings are, but again, just looking at it, talking to parents who have autistic children, they talk about the baby was fine, 18 months old, running around, giggling, laughing, they get that third round of shots is generally when it's triggered, I guess that overload, they get a fever, suddenly they go into that
[02:16:19.526 --> 02:16:25.971]  Autistic stupor or that whole spectrum and then associated with it is all sorts of diarrhea and intestinal problems.
[02:16:25.971 --> 02:16:35.579]  And so, somebody who's a medical doctor who studies the intestines and the gut, why would you not go look at that and try to look at why those two things are correlated?
[02:16:35.579 --> 02:16:36.280]  Is that correct?
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.821]  Well, you've got it in a nutshell.
[02:16:37.821 --> 02:16:45.728]  I mean, what happened on May the 17th, 1995, is the first parent called me and said, Dr. Wakefield, my child was fine.
[02:16:46.499 --> 02:16:51.943]  They had their MMR vaccine, they regressed into autism, and they developed terrible gastrointestinal problems.
[02:16:51.943 --> 02:16:57.886]  And I know many, many parents, both here and abroad, who are in exactly that same position.
[02:16:57.886 --> 02:17:02.389]  And I said, wow, I know nothing about autism because at medical school it was 1 in 10,000 children.
[02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:03.230]  We didn't know anything about it.
[02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:04.111]  We weren't taught about it.
[02:17:04.111 --> 02:17:10.275]  In fact, I've seen numbers of 1 in 25,000 30 years ago versus 1 in 10,000.
[02:17:10.275 --> 02:17:11.776]  What's the accurate number?
[02:17:11.776 --> 02:17:13.137]  What was the old number for autism?
[02:17:13.137 --> 02:17:15.198]  And I know before it was, like, very rare.
[02:17:15.518 --> 02:17:19.721]  It was such a rarity, such an oddity, that no one had ways of monitoring it.
[02:17:19.721 --> 02:17:20.441]  No one knew.
[02:17:20.441 --> 02:17:25.164]  No one... It just was so rare that it was speculation, really, about the precise numbers.
[02:17:25.164 --> 02:17:32.449]  And now they say it's over-reporting, but when I go to a movie theater with my children, I remember going to movies when I was a child, there was no one autistic there.
[02:17:32.449 --> 02:17:34.851]  Now they might have several rows filled.
[02:17:34.851 --> 02:17:36.772]  I mean, now they have whole wings of public schools.
[02:17:36.772 --> 02:17:39.734]  Now I go to the park and there's autistic children just everywhere.
[02:17:39.734 --> 02:17:41.495]  I mean, it's like an epidemic.
[02:17:41.495 --> 02:17:43.617]  I mean, and these people aren't faking this.
[02:17:43.617 --> 02:17:45.138]  They're completely not in this world.
[02:17:45.858 --> 02:17:59.365]  No, and it's gone now from those numbers, those rare numbers, to over 1 in 100 in this country, 1 in 68 in the UK, and amongst certain populations, like the Somali population in Minneapolis, it's around 1 in 28 children.
[02:17:59.365 --> 02:18:01.146]  That is a staggering level of disease.
[02:18:01.146 --> 02:18:07.290]  I was on a plane coming back from New York last night, and the child sitting right behind me, who kicked my seat all the way,
[02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:09.991]  From New York to Austin, had autism.
[02:18:09.991 --> 02:18:10.791]  No, it's the same thing.
[02:18:10.791 --> 02:18:17.074]  I fly a lot, and almost every time, or I'm in a restaurant or a movie, you can look and see it's an autistic child.
[02:18:17.074 --> 02:18:21.055]  And you'll see they're good-looking parents, and you look at the child, they're handsome, they're pretty.
[02:18:21.055 --> 02:18:28.518]  I mean, you see them just with their humanity has been stolen from them, and they still got their humanity, but their potential, and it makes me so sick.
[02:18:28.518 --> 02:18:31.520]  And we're just supposed to think, oh, this is just happening.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.301]  I mean, you know, sure, everybody's starting to become autistic.
[02:18:34.301 --> 02:18:34.901]  Let's ignore it.
[02:18:34.901 --> 02:18:36.942]  So you start researching it, doctor.
[02:18:37.202 --> 02:18:39.063]  Yeah, what you do, medicine starts with the history.
[02:18:39.063 --> 02:18:41.204]  What does the parent tell you about what happened to their child?
[02:18:41.204 --> 02:18:42.585]  That's the beginning of everything.
[02:18:42.585 --> 02:18:45.147]  You examine the child, you investigate their symptoms properly.
[02:18:45.147 --> 02:18:52.150]  You don't say, your child's got autism, therefore they're bound to have a diarrhoea 12 times a day, put them in a corner, forget about them, move on with your life.
[02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:53.131]  You do not do that.
[02:18:53.131 --> 02:18:55.332]  That's not good medicine, it's not medicine at all.
[02:18:55.332 --> 02:19:03.297]  And so what we did at the Royal Free was take these children with clear sickness, clear illness, and investigate their symptoms appropriately.
[02:19:03.297 --> 02:19:04.878]  And what we found is that the parents were right.
[02:19:05.518 --> 02:19:15.302]  The children had an intestinal disease, and when we treated that disease, as you would treat Crohn's disease, Rostive Colitis, with anti-inflammatory medication, the children started to get better.
[02:19:15.302 --> 02:19:22.825]  They started to speak, they started to smile, they were out of pain, they would sleep at night, and that was the beginning of a fascinating journey, and a very important journey.
[02:19:23.585 --> 02:19:26.549]  Others now, around the world, have replicated our findings.
[02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:31.416]  And one of the things, I was on a show the other day, where they called me a liar.
[02:19:31.416 --> 02:19:36.322]  I think Anderson Cooper called me a liar for saying that the work had been repeated by others around the world.
[02:19:37.213 --> 02:19:38.053]  Well, it has.
[02:19:38.053 --> 02:19:45.356]  The work with identifying the bowel disease in these children, that's been replicated in Italy, Poland, Canada, the United States.
[02:19:45.356 --> 02:19:47.217]  Well, I mean, I read the international news.
[02:19:47.217 --> 02:19:50.819]  It's in prestigious papers constantly that they've replicated it.
[02:19:50.819 --> 02:19:52.540]  And then they just call you a liar.
[02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:53.160]  Stay there, doctor.
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:58.162]  I want to come back and get into some of those that have replicated it and how this PR campaign is backfiring on them.
[02:19:58.162 --> 02:19:58.782]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.782 --> 02:19:59.202]  Stay with us.
[02:20:03.254 --> 02:20:04.495]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.495 --> 02:20:06.997]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:06.997 --> 02:20:08.898]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:08.898 --> 02:20:16.124]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:16.124 --> 02:20:20.507]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:20.507 --> 02:20:30.836]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:31.516 --> 02:20:32.637]  Any circumstance.
[02:20:32.637 --> 02:20:39.861]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:39.861 --> 02:20:40.561]  But listen up.

[02:21:00.785 --> 02:21:02.867]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[02:21:02.867 --> 02:21:09.953]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[02:21:09.953 --> 02:21:13.136]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[02:21:13.136 --> 02:21:17.039]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[02:21:17.219 --> 02:21:21.983]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[02:21:21.983 --> 02:21:28.209]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[02:21:28.209 --> 02:21:29.931]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[02:21:29.931 --> 02:21:37.157]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power, physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.
[02:21:37.157 --> 02:21:39.339]  Call me, Roger Rao, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 178.
[02:21:43.223 --> 02:21:47.607]  Take action today when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[02:21:47.607 --> 02:21:48.868]  Ready for a change?
[02:21:48.868 --> 02:21:51.150]  Call Roger Raw at 1-800-686-2237 extension 178.
[02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:52.431]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237 extension 178.
[02:22:01.937 --> 02:22:05.961]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:05.961 --> 02:22:09.204]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:09.204 --> 02:22:14.008]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:14.008 --> 02:22:20.394]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.394 --> 02:22:22.637]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:22:23.177 --> 02:22:24.658]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:24.658 --> 02:22:25.938]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:25.938 --> 02:22:28.179]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:42.065 --> 02:22:49.347]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:49.347 --> 02:22:58.530]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:23:01.532 --> 02:23:05.994]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:23:05.994 --> 02:23:06.854]  Why Ali-C?
[02:23:06.854 --> 02:23:10.436]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[02:23:10.436 --> 02:23:18.099]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:23:18.479 --> 02:23:24.062]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:29.264]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[02:23:29.264 --> 02:23:32.966]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[02:23:32.966 --> 02:23:39.109]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:48.994]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ally C. For more information and to order Ally C, call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.

[02:24:07.296 --> 02:24:10.938]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield, chalice-disregard.com.
[02:24:10.938 --> 02:24:15.500]  Here's the book that tells the truth, and it's available on Amazon, you name it.
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:18.362]  We also sell it at infowars.com.
[02:24:18.362 --> 02:24:21.603]  Andrew J. Wakefield, forward by Jenny McCarthy.
[02:24:21.603 --> 02:24:22.364]  Very important.
[02:24:22.364 --> 02:24:26.526]  And the way they've demonized Jenny McCarthy, like, like, oh, she's just doing this for attention.
[02:24:26.526 --> 02:24:28.167]  No, she has an autistic child.
[02:24:28.167 --> 02:24:29.988]  Or you, how dare you?
[02:24:29.988 --> 02:24:32.369]  I mean, I mean, they talk to you like you are Satan.
[02:24:32.770 --> 02:24:37.830]  When you're on these shows, this is your chance uninterrupted to counter these people.
[02:24:39.056 --> 02:24:39.997]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:24:39.997 --> 02:24:41.579]  You know, the problem is real.
[02:24:41.579 --> 02:24:42.880]  It's not going to go away.
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:49.106]  And the important thing, Alex, what we can say is that there is a bowel disease in many, many of these children, the treatment of which makes them better.
[02:24:49.106 --> 02:24:55.793]  So thousands of children have benefited from our observations 15 years ago that were driven by parental insights.
[02:24:55.793 --> 02:24:58.656]  It's the parents that drew our attention to this.
[02:24:58.656 --> 02:25:00.037]  What did you find in their intestines?
[02:25:00.037 --> 02:25:01.538]  What's going on, as best you know?
[02:25:01.538 --> 02:25:02.419]  Why does it hit boys 4 to 1?
[02:25:03.223 --> 02:25:10.307]  Four to one, we don't know why boys, but this is in common with a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders that they seem to affect boys.
[02:25:10.307 --> 02:25:13.309]  Now, it's interesting that oestrogen protects the brain.
[02:25:13.309 --> 02:25:16.691]  So is it possible that girls have a brain that's protected from this?
[02:25:16.691 --> 02:25:20.554]  Girls seem to be less susceptible to infections in early life.
[02:25:20.554 --> 02:25:22.075]  Doctors have always done women are tougher.
[02:25:22.455 --> 02:25:23.757]  Absolutely.
[02:25:23.757 --> 02:25:27.182]  And they remain that way for the rest of their lives.
[02:25:27.182 --> 02:25:37.396]  So it may be that there are immunological reasons or developmental reasons or genetic reasons why girls are more robust in these circumstances and don't experience the same kind of problem.
[02:25:38.257 --> 02:25:45.100]  Nonetheless, what we see is a bowel disease that seems to affect anywhere from the top of the gut right the way down through the bottom.
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:50.482]  The children are in pain, there's no doubt they're in pain, but of course they've lost the ability to express that.
[02:25:50.482 --> 02:25:57.464]  They can't speak anymore, or they can't communicate in the way that they could, so they can't tell parents that they've got gastrointestinal problems.
[02:25:57.464 --> 02:26:01.126]  They can't tell them that they've got tummy pain because... What's the trigger in the MMR?
[02:26:02.096 --> 02:26:02.696]  Well, we don't know.
[02:26:02.696 --> 02:26:03.737]  And this is what we're looking at.
[02:26:03.737 --> 02:26:04.638]  Is it the MMR?
[02:26:04.638 --> 02:26:05.578]  We don't know.
[02:26:05.578 --> 02:26:07.860]  Do we think that the MMR is implicated?
[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:09.501]  Yes, I do.
[02:26:09.501 --> 02:26:10.662]  But I have no proof of that.
[02:26:10.662 --> 02:26:11.602]  That's my opinion.
[02:26:11.602 --> 02:26:13.824]  And my opinion isn't worth much compared...
[02:26:32.176 --> 02:26:32.676]  Any idea?
[02:26:32.676 --> 02:26:35.117]  Well, the problem here, Alex, is it's so complicated.
[02:26:35.117 --> 02:26:42.819]  It's not just a live viral vaccine that kids are getting, but at the same time, they're getting vaccines that have mercury in, like the influenza or the meningococcal vaccine.
[02:26:42.819 --> 02:26:46.680]  They're getting vaccines that have aluminum in at high concentrations.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:48.761]  What are these neurotoxic substances doing in there?
[02:26:49.301 --> 02:26:51.844]  What are these poisons to the immune system actually doing in there?
[02:26:51.844 --> 02:26:54.066]  They shouldn't be injected into the bodies of children.
[02:26:54.066 --> 02:27:00.132]  And the gut, of course, has the highest flora of natural bacteria, viruses.
[02:27:00.132 --> 02:27:01.794]  So is it causing some type of trigger?
[02:27:01.794 --> 02:27:02.515]  We don't know.
[02:27:02.515 --> 02:27:03.656]  Well, it could well be.
[02:27:03.656 --> 02:27:07.220]  So you've got all this combination of toxic substances being loaded into children.
[02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:09.782]  There could be any kind of synergistic interaction.
[02:27:09.782 --> 02:27:18.749]  If you went to the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and you said, I've got these three blood pressure drugs, I want to put them in the same capsule and give them to patients, they'd throw you out of the door.
[02:27:18.749 --> 02:27:19.090]  Why?
[02:27:19.090 --> 02:27:20.851]  Because all your patients would die.
[02:27:20.851 --> 02:27:25.255]  Because the interaction between those three blood pressure drugs would kill your patients.
[02:27:25.255 --> 02:27:27.557]  They would drop their blood pressure into their boots.
[02:27:27.557 --> 02:27:31.179]  And yet, when it comes to vaccines, they get past all of this kind of regulatory control.
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:38.242]  They can put three viruses, four viruses in, they give pentavalent, heptavalent vaccines, with all kinds of things in.
[02:27:38.242 --> 02:27:42.743]  And there is no proper regulation of safety standards for vaccines.
[02:27:42.743 --> 02:27:45.383]  Beyond that, the manufacturers are not liable.
[02:27:45.383 --> 02:27:47.504]  So, it's a great market.
[02:27:47.504 --> 02:27:50.745]  Why would you not get involved if there's no liability and only profit?
[02:27:50.745 --> 02:27:53.745]  And now, most of them are being made in China.
[02:27:53.745 --> 02:27:54.365]  Now, I didn't know that.
[02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:56.466]  I mean... Yeah, a lot of the vaccines are being made in China.
[02:27:57.506 --> 02:28:00.249]  So think about that with the record of the melamine and the rest of it.
[02:28:00.249 --> 02:28:05.594]  So you were telling me during the break about some of these shows, the way they're going after you and building these straw men up.
[02:28:05.594 --> 02:28:09.598]  Well, I think that what's obvious to me is that they're extremely angry.
[02:28:09.598 --> 02:28:13.241]  They're extremely angry because they've read this story from the journalists in the UK.
[02:28:13.241 --> 02:28:15.604]  They've bought into the idea that it must be true.
[02:28:16.144 --> 02:28:18.005]  They don't care that there's another side to this.
[02:28:18.005 --> 02:28:27.170]  They don't care that 89% of parents in this country put vaccine safety research as their number one medical research priority.
[02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.530]  89%!
[02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:30.812]  Again, the people have spoken, but they don't care about that.
[02:28:30.812 --> 02:28:33.354]  What they care about is pinning this on one person.
[02:28:34.301 --> 02:28:35.382]  To blame them for what has happened.
[02:28:54.409 --> 02:28:55.050]  I think this is real.
[02:28:55.050 --> 02:29:04.176]  You know, what they do is they isolate me and they show the rest of the medical profession, the scientific profession, if you get involved in this, that this is what's going to happen to you.
[02:29:04.176 --> 02:29:10.781]  Your career's going to be destroyed, you're going to lose your career, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your medical license, and you're going to lose your country.
[02:29:10.781 --> 02:29:13.403]  Well, for me, you know, if that happens, okay.
[02:29:13.403 --> 02:29:15.965]  But every time I see a kid with autism, I think, I don't have a problem.
[02:29:16.923 --> 02:29:18.586]  I think I've got a job to do and I'm going to do it.
[02:29:18.586 --> 02:29:21.552]  And I don't know whether vaccines cause autism or not, but I am going to try and find out.
[02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:25.159]  I'm going to do my very best to find out, because the issue is too important not to.
[02:29:26.221 --> 02:29:27.101]  Absolutely.
[02:29:27.101 --> 02:29:33.162]  And when we come back, you were telling me during the break how they had some family on who didn't take a vaccine.
[02:29:33.162 --> 02:29:34.542]  They were trying to blame you.
[02:29:34.542 --> 02:29:35.683]  You've been very moderate.
[02:29:35.683 --> 02:29:37.703]  It's why they hate you, because you come off as credible.
[02:29:37.703 --> 02:29:39.903]  You just said, I want to research this more.
[02:29:39.903 --> 02:29:42.704]  And so they go after you because you're so effective.
[02:29:42.704 --> 02:29:43.644]  And so we'll talk about that.
[02:29:43.644 --> 02:29:46.525]  We'll talk about how we can help children.
[02:29:46.525 --> 02:29:48.425]  What we have found is helping them.
[02:29:48.425 --> 02:29:50.885]  We'll be right back with our guest, Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[02:29:50.885 --> 02:29:51.365]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:51.365 --> 02:29:52.726]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.726 --> 02:29:54.226]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.251 --> 02:30:01.113]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.113 --> 02:30:04.153]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.
[02:30:04.153 --> 02:30:13.376]  Home Gain is now offering a special promo where you get up to $150 when you buy or sell a home with a Home Gain agent you find through their Find a REALTOR® program.

[02:31:00.723 --> 02:31:04.306]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:04.306 --> 02:31:05.607]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:05.607 --> 02:31:10.011]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.011 --> 02:31:15.957]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:15.957 --> 02:31:18.098]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.098 --> 02:31:20.781]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:21.121 --> 02:31:27.625]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:27.625 --> 02:31:29.826]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:29.826 --> 02:31:35.170]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:35.170 --> 02:31:40.453]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[02:32:00.006 --> 02:32:03.848]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[02:32:12.934 --> 02:32:18.778]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:32:18.778 --> 02:32:22.440]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:25.802]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:32:28.553 --> 02:32:34.079]  I'm looking for America.
[02:32:34.079 --> 02:32:35.721]  We're American and be proud.
[02:32:35.721 --> 02:32:37.884]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:32:37.884 --> 02:32:42.949]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:32:42.949 --> 02:32:46.633]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:32:54.514 --> 02:32:59.080]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:33:16.516 --> 02:33:27.844]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, Callous Disregard, Autism and Vaccines, The Truth Behind a Tragedy, Andrew J. Wakefield, co-authored by Jenny McCarthy, excellent book.
[02:33:27.844 --> 02:33:34.790]  Now, you can cover whatever you want in the 30 minutes we've got left, but I'd like you first to go through their lies, go through the things they've done.
[02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:40.154]  The first one I threw out to you was, I remember reading, it's incredible, Hoax Doctor Exposed, and I read,
[02:33:40.854 --> 02:33:44.336]  In studies, he paid people for blood samples.
[02:33:44.336 --> 02:33:53.420]  And I'll go, well, wait, every research study I've heard of, or almost all of them, people are paid to be part of the research study, but then you went further, it turned out you didn't even do that.
[02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:58.082]  So, I mean, it's just, but they're playing on people's ignorance to even try that.
[02:33:58.082 --> 02:34:02.484]  So let's talk, doctor, specifically about the type of fraud you're talking about here.
[02:34:02.970 --> 02:34:03.650]  Certainly, Alex.
[02:34:03.650 --> 02:34:15.578]  One of the allegations that's been made and has been repeated in the media is that the Lancet study of 1998, those 12 children who had autism and bowel disease, that somehow I paid them to take part in the study.
[02:34:15.578 --> 02:34:17.019]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:34:17.019 --> 02:34:22.843]  They were clinical patients seen at the Royal Free as part of the National Health Service and they were investigated according to their symptoms.
[02:34:22.843 --> 02:34:24.284]  I paid them nothing at all.
[02:34:24.884 --> 02:34:34.277]  The truth is that as a later study, looking at blood measurements in a research setting, I asked my children if they would be prepared to give me a blood sample.
[02:34:34.277 --> 02:34:35.619]  And they said yes.
[02:34:35.619 --> 02:34:38.523]  And their friends at a birthday party also agreed.
[02:34:38.523 --> 02:34:40.025]  It was done with fully informed
[02:34:40.626 --> 02:34:42.007]  Parental and child consent.
[02:34:42.007 --> 02:34:43.909]  Many of the parents were doctors.
[02:34:43.909 --> 02:34:51.275]  And so they allowed their children to have a blood sample taken, the kids were fine, and they got the equivalent of about seven and a half dollars for their trouble.
[02:34:51.275 --> 02:35:03.245]  And that has been blown up into some kind of bloodbath that was, or that I had paid these patients to come to the Royal Free to be part of some litigation in order to bring down the vaccine manufacturers.
[02:35:03.245 --> 02:35:05.868]  Nothing, nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:35:06.718 --> 02:35:23.096]  Another allegation, and this occurred yesterday on Good Morning America, is they put up a clip of a family who, apparently according to my research, did not give their children the Haemophilus Influenza B vaccine, the Hib vaccine.
[02:35:23.993 --> 02:35:27.635]  Now, I've never said a single word about the Hib vaccine.
[02:35:27.635 --> 02:35:29.996]  I've never mentioned the Hib vaccine.
[02:35:29.996 --> 02:35:33.058]  My work was related to the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine.
[02:35:33.058 --> 02:35:37.200]  And now they're blaming me because parents have not given their children the Hib vaccine?
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:42.663]  I mean, that is the most contrived piece of journalism I have seen in a long, long while.
[02:35:42.663 --> 02:35:43.783]  It's straw man.
[02:35:43.783 --> 02:35:46.525]  They don't attack Andrew J. Wakefield.
[02:35:46.525 --> 02:35:50.787]  They attack this made-up creature that they then tear apart for the world.
[02:35:51.158 --> 02:35:54.220]  Yes, it reminds me of that Disney film, you know, Beauty and the Beast.
[02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:55.901]  That scene, kill the beast, kill the beast.
[02:35:55.901 --> 02:35:57.242]  This is like Salem.
[02:35:57.242 --> 02:36:13.672]  The visceral response that they're trying to whip up in the public to try and crush this dissent, to try and stop valid vaccine safety research taking place, is completely out of proportion and is not doing any service to the American people or indeed the children of the world.
[02:36:13.712 --> 02:36:15.974]  Well, how much do Western vaccine makers make a year?
[02:36:15.974 --> 02:36:17.655]  I've seen numbers of eight, $10 billion.
[02:36:17.655 --> 02:36:24.781]  I mean, do you think they're going to let research doctors start actually showing the carnage that they've caused?
[02:36:24.781 --> 02:36:28.123]  Do you think they're going to let anyone get in the way of that business?
[02:36:28.123 --> 02:36:34.208]  I mean, look at the ads, probably half the ads on network TV or drug companies who have their vaccine divisions.
[02:36:34.208 --> 02:36:39.032]  And so it's a complete conflict of interest for all of these networks that are savaging you.
[02:36:39.032 --> 02:36:39.893]  They're on the payroll.
[02:36:40.293 --> 02:36:41.514]  Yeah, there is a big problem here.
[02:36:41.514 --> 02:36:45.216]  One is that they are allowed to advertise directly to the consumer.
[02:36:45.216 --> 02:36:54.861]  That doesn't occur in the UK, but giving the, you know, ask your doctor about this drug, getting it out there, they begin to own the broadcasting companies.
[02:36:54.861 --> 02:36:58.183]  They own the TV companies because they depend upon their advertising.
[02:36:58.283 --> 02:36:58.403]  They
[02:37:16.678 --> 02:37:16.839]  I don't
[02:37:35.772 --> 02:37:39.214]  Australia came out and said, yeah, we had deaths because of this H1N1.
[02:37:39.214 --> 02:37:42.576]  That's their own government having to admit it and suspending it.
[02:37:42.576 --> 02:37:43.777]  Poland's suspending it.
[02:37:43.777 --> 02:37:49.420]  They had deaths of the homeless, 30 plus, just in the test of a bird flu vaccine.
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:57.104]  I mean, something's going... And now the British Medical Journal, I had their head editor on, they found it was all a fraud in 09 pushing that shot.
[02:37:57.104 --> 02:38:01.527]  The Wolfgang Wudarg, who was the head of the EU Commission, doctor, he felt... So it seems like
[02:38:02.467 --> 02:38:06.588]  You are the sacrificial lamb because they're burning in flames right now.
[02:38:06.588 --> 02:38:10.890]  So again, if they can intimidate others by trying to smash you, they win.
[02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:12.750]  But it seems to be backfiring.
[02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:16.632]  But I mean, your comments on these flotillas of just news coming out.
[02:38:16.632 --> 02:38:17.672]  Oh, we we gave a
[02:38:18.112 --> 02:38:19.814]  Polio vaccine in Africa.
[02:38:19.814 --> 02:38:20.635]  Oh, in Asia.
[02:38:20.635 --> 02:38:21.796]  Oh, in Latin America.
[02:38:21.796 --> 02:38:22.677]  It was live.
[02:38:22.677 --> 02:38:23.978]  It killed people.
[02:38:23.978 --> 02:38:24.879]  Oh, the U.S.
[02:38:24.879 --> 02:38:27.442]  government secretly was shooting people up with syphilis.
[02:38:27.442 --> 02:38:29.424]  Oh, and I mean, you know, all this is coming out.
[02:38:29.424 --> 02:38:31.947]  So people are like, ooh, we don't trust you.
[02:38:31.947 --> 02:38:32.648]  And they say it.
[02:38:32.648 --> 02:38:33.849]  No, it's all lies.
[02:38:33.849 --> 02:38:36.112]  This guy, Dr. Wakefield, he made it up.
[02:38:36.112 --> 02:38:37.133]  It's his fault.
[02:38:37.133 --> 02:38:37.894]  He did it.
[02:38:37.894 --> 02:38:38.955]  But that isn't reality.
[02:38:39.577 --> 02:38:40.557]  No, it's not at all.
[02:38:40.557 --> 02:38:46.099]  And the problem is so serious and so prevalent that scientists cannot afford to roll over.
[02:38:46.099 --> 02:38:53.522]  Physicians cannot afford to roll over in the face of this kind of bullying tactic and not do the work in the interests of their patients.
[02:38:53.522 --> 02:38:55.723]  That would be absolutely unacceptable.
[02:38:55.723 --> 02:38:57.784]  And that is what I intend to continue doing.
[02:38:57.784 --> 02:38:58.864]  And I'm not going to go away.
[02:38:58.864 --> 02:39:00.245]  This work has to be done.
[02:39:00.825 --> 02:39:05.850]  And I think what we need is the medical profession, the scientific profession to stand up and be counted in this respect.
[02:39:05.850 --> 02:39:17.240]  And it's interesting, I was recently at a vaccine safety conference in Jamaica where experts from all over the world, France, Israel, the UK, the US, Canada came together to express their mutual concerns.
[02:39:18.021 --> 02:39:20.383]  About vaccine safety policy.
[02:39:20.383 --> 02:39:30.733]  The cost of the amount of money invested in vaccine promotion in this country compared with the amount of money spent on vaccine safety research is way out of proportion.
[02:39:30.733 --> 02:39:32.514]  Billions compared with a few million.
[02:39:32.514 --> 02:39:34.056]  And this is not my word.
[02:39:34.056 --> 02:39:38.400]  This is the word of the committee that recommends vaccination policy.
[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:41.163]  And they don't like doctors being doctors.
[02:39:41.163 --> 02:39:47.252]  They want to let the CEOs of the drug makers now engage in medical policy.
[02:39:47.252 --> 02:39:53.360]  That's what Obamacare does more and more, is it lets bureaucrats set policy and take power from the real experts, the doctors.
[02:39:54.361 --> 02:39:56.905]  So it's a vaccine safety first priority.
[02:39:56.905 --> 02:39:59.248]  Why would you not put safety first?
[02:39:59.248 --> 02:40:06.559]  If you're going to administer these vaccines to every child in the world, potentially, safety must be the priority.
[02:40:06.559 --> 02:40:09.263]  So, Ralph Nader was not anti-car.
[02:40:10.424 --> 02:40:11.465]  He was for safer cars.
[02:40:11.465 --> 02:40:12.926]  I'm not anti-vaccine.
[02:40:12.926 --> 02:40:14.688]  I am for safer vaccines.
[02:40:14.688 --> 02:40:16.509]  And that has got to be the priority.
[02:40:16.509 --> 02:40:21.453]  Not profit, not bottom line, not policy, but putting the health of children first.
[02:40:21.453 --> 02:40:24.996]  There are nearly 30 million children in this country alone.
[02:40:25.717 --> 02:40:31.401]  Who have a chronic immune or inflammatory disorder, which when you and I were young, didn't exist.
[02:40:31.401 --> 02:40:32.542]  Well, very, very rare.
[02:40:32.542 --> 02:40:41.248]  Dr. Blaylock, who you know is a prestigious retired brain surgeon, he's done research and he sources all the other research, you know, quoting it on air when he's joined us.
[02:40:41.248 --> 02:40:43.809]  But he says, just looking at the brain, it's clear
[02:40:44.810 --> 02:41:09.416]  That the adjuvants, the aluminum, the mercury, but the virus itself, or in other cases the bacteria itself, is causing, because it's not going through the skin or the mucous membrane the way it's absorbed, it's causing an autoimmune inflammation, and he's saying it's in the guts, it's in other parts of the body, but it's also in the brain, and that's why so often the kids will have a seizure driving home after the shots.
[02:41:09.416 --> 02:41:12.917]  I mean, we know that this is going on, and they just try to ignore it,
[02:41:13.377 --> 02:41:26.216]  But now that dam is breaking, I mean, what are you just, just, I mean, you know, I understand you're being watched like a hawk, so you don't like to speculate in any way, but clearly, what are the type of inflammations we're seeing that magically pop up after vaccination?
[02:41:26.803 --> 02:41:36.468]  Well, the sort of thing that we're seeing are asthma, eczema, hay fever, insulin-dependent diabetes, autism, neurodevelopmental disorders.
[02:41:36.468 --> 02:41:39.569]  Are these linked to vaccines?
[02:41:39.569 --> 02:41:40.349]  We're not sure.
[02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:42.190]  But is there evidence that they may be?
[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:43.011]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:41:43.011 --> 02:41:53.976]  There was one study, a very big study, 11,500 children out of the University of Manitoba, showing that if you just delayed the administration of the DPT vaccine, then you halve the risk of asthma.
[02:41:54.909 --> 02:41:56.150]  That's an extraordinary observation.
[02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:57.650]  You've just delayed it by two months.
[02:41:57.650 --> 02:41:58.771]  You don't have to get rid of the vaccine.
[02:41:58.771 --> 02:42:02.973]  Don't the Japanese, for like ten years, make them wait to two and a half to give shots?
[02:42:02.973 --> 02:42:07.034]  I don't know, but if that's what they do, then that's, I believe, a very wise policy.
[02:42:07.034 --> 02:42:10.316]  Well, continue with other studies, because I've interviewed, like, Dr. Eisenstein.
[02:42:10.316 --> 02:42:16.078]  He's reported there's hundreds of thousands of Amish in Illinois, and autism is unknown amongst them.
[02:42:16.078 --> 02:42:18.279]  I mean, is there any credibility to that in your research?
[02:42:18.279 --> 02:42:19.040]  Well, yes.
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:21.801]  The Amish do not vaccinate, except in rare circumstances.
[02:42:22.481 --> 02:42:24.964]  And they don't appear to have autism.
[02:42:24.964 --> 02:42:27.046]  Now, has anyone done a study on that?
[02:42:27.046 --> 02:42:28.007]  No.
[02:42:28.007 --> 02:42:29.068]  Does it need to be done?
[02:42:29.068 --> 02:42:30.229]  Absolutely it does.
[02:42:30.229 --> 02:42:36.996]  We need to do a study that compares the long-term health outcomes of fully vaccinated children with those who are not vaccinated.
[02:42:36.996 --> 02:42:38.358]  That study has to be done.
[02:42:38.358 --> 02:42:41.882]  Parents have every right to expect... The vaccine makers fight that.
[02:42:41.882 --> 02:42:43.644]  They have been fighting... Hmm, wonder why?
[02:42:44.364 --> 02:42:53.851]  But, you know, what's interesting is that they've said that all the science is in, there's no need to do any more, there is no link between, for example, thimerosal, the mercury preservative, and autism.
[02:42:53.851 --> 02:43:04.560]  Well, when this has been systematically analysed and all the papers that are relevant, that generate data, that present data, have been looked at, 74% of those papers say, yes, there is.
[02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:06.256]  A link.
[02:43:06.256 --> 02:43:06.956]  A positive link.
[02:43:06.956 --> 02:43:12.140]  So what people are being told and what is the truth is very, very different.
[02:43:12.140 --> 02:43:22.708]  And one more thing is that the vaccine courts in this country have been settling cases of vaccine-induced autism or autistic spectrum disorder since the early 90s.
[02:43:23.709 --> 02:43:30.091]  So you've got one branch of the government, the CDC, saying there's no problem at all, and then you've got the Department of Justice settling these cases.
[02:43:30.091 --> 02:43:34.972]  And I can give your readers and viewers, your listeners and viewers, some names to look up if they don't believe it.
[02:43:34.972 --> 02:43:38.253]  Hannah Poling, Bailey Banks, Misty Hyatt.
[02:43:38.253 --> 02:43:40.534]  And Mrs. Hyatt would be delighted to come on your program.
[02:43:40.534 --> 02:43:41.394]  I want to get her on!
[02:43:41.394 --> 02:43:48.356]  And she would talk about how her daughter was rendered autistic by an MMR vaccine and was awarded $5 million.
[02:43:48.356 --> 02:43:51.997]  Hannah Poling, just been given a lifetime award of $20 million.
[02:43:53.197 --> 02:43:55.978]  For vaccines causing autism.
[02:43:55.978 --> 02:44:03.221]  So I have friends who've had a happy 18-month-old running around talking, giggling, and then the kid's just gone.
[02:44:03.221 --> 02:44:07.142]  I mean, they might as well have been hit by a chemical weapon after that third round of shots.
[02:44:07.142 --> 02:44:08.543]  And it's almost everyone you talk to.
[02:44:08.543 --> 02:44:13.624]  I can be at a hotel on vacation, there's a family, you know, they're in the pool, the hot tub, they got three or four kids.
[02:44:13.624 --> 02:44:18.286]  One of them's autistic, sitting there, you know, nodding in the chair, you know, not having a good time.
[02:44:18.286 --> 02:44:19.787]  And I'll say, let me ask, when did your son
[02:44:21.407 --> 02:44:24.008]  Oh, 18 months, third round of shots.
[02:44:24.008 --> 02:44:27.128]  He had a convulsion on the way home in the car.
[02:44:27.128 --> 02:44:35.790]  And then, what I've read about is, sometimes when they bring him back to the hospital, then they try to take your kid, saying, oh, there's inflammation on the brain, you must have beaten them or something.
[02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:37.930]  I mean, that's even more incredible.
[02:44:37.930 --> 02:44:40.851]  It just makes my head spin.
[02:44:40.851 --> 02:44:47.212]  Well, Alex, this is a very important point you just brought up, because I am now dealing with cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
[02:44:48.493 --> 02:44:59.800]  Where the children have been damaged, ostensibly, by a vaccine exposure until proven otherwise, and yet the parents are being blamed for the damage to the children.
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:06.764]  And more than that, parents are treating their children and reversing their autism to a greater or lesser extent, getting them better.
[02:45:06.764 --> 02:45:12.148]  So they lose their autism diagnosis, and then they're being told that they made up the diagnosis of autism in the first place.
[02:45:12.995 --> 02:45:14.877]  They were diagnosed by professional doctors.
[02:45:14.877 --> 02:45:20.342]  The parents are being told that they made up the diagnosis, and that the children never had autism in the first place.
[02:45:20.342 --> 02:45:25.146]  And so, this is something, this is one of the grossest injustices I've ever witnessed in my life.
[02:45:25.146 --> 02:45:32.273]  Your child is initially damaged, and you have to suffer and grieve with that, and then suddenly you're blamed for causing it in the first place?
[02:45:32.273 --> 02:45:34.695]  It's absolutely staggering, and that kind of thing has got to stop.
[02:45:34.975 --> 02:45:43.743]  I know you can't diagnose people over the radio, but in individual cases, obviously we can't conclusively prove what's causing it.
[02:45:43.743 --> 02:45:50.729]  It's kind of like if somebody walked out on the road and got run over by a Mack truck and then you walk out and their body's smashed all over the side of the road.
[02:45:50.729 --> 02:45:53.251]  A car probably did this, but did we see it do it?
[02:45:53.251 --> 02:45:53.992]  No.
[02:45:53.992 --> 02:45:56.654]  And there's people out there saying, don't look at cars, don't, you know.
[02:45:57.615 --> 02:46:04.122]  So that's happening, but what do we know is reversing the intestinal problems?
[02:46:04.122 --> 02:46:06.444]  What is detoxing them?
[02:46:06.444 --> 02:46:09.187]  And what do those success stories point towards?
[02:46:09.187 --> 02:46:12.991]  Well, good medicine starts with the history, the examination, and the clinical findings.
[02:46:12.991 --> 02:46:21.219]  So, from my perspective, it was of gastrointestinal problems which were confirmed to be of an inflammatory nature when we took little biopsies from the intestine.
[02:46:21.679 --> 02:46:27.221]  Now, we know a lot about treating inflammation from the years of treating Crohn's disease and colitis.
[02:46:27.221 --> 02:46:31.563]  So, we had an opportunity here to intervene by treating these children with anti-inflammatories.
[02:46:31.563 --> 02:46:36.185]  So, the mild anti-inflammatory drugs that were used in Crohn's work very well.
[02:46:36.185 --> 02:46:40.747]  These are aspirin-like drugs, but ones which heal the intestine.
[02:46:40.747 --> 02:46:41.567]  The diet.
[02:46:41.567 --> 02:46:44.088]  The diet has been extremely valuable.
[02:46:44.088 --> 02:46:46.530]  This is a gluten, casein-free diet.
[02:46:46.530 --> 02:46:49.571]  If there was one thing that I would recommend that parents start with,
[02:46:50.271 --> 02:46:51.953]  It would be the Gluten Casein Free Diet.
[02:46:51.953 --> 02:46:57.239]  Now, people have said for years, oh, there's no evidence, there's no evidence, that's just parents making it up, or it's dangerous.
[02:46:57.239 --> 02:47:01.984]  Actually, now, there are randomized control clinical trials showing benefit.
[02:47:01.984 --> 02:47:05.247]  And if anyone wants to look that up, the name is Whiteley.
[02:47:05.247 --> 02:47:06.488]  Whiteley et al.
[02:47:06.488 --> 02:47:11.574]  Look up that paper and you will see a big study showing benefit from the diet.
[02:47:11.934 --> 02:47:18.496]  Take it to your doctor, show it to them, and use it as evidence-based medicine that the diet is certainly worth trying.
[02:47:18.496 --> 02:47:23.217]  So a gluten and casein-free diet, and the value of that is that it's in the parents' hands.
[02:47:23.217 --> 02:47:24.718]  It doesn't involve giving a drug.
[02:47:24.718 --> 02:47:27.259]  And hey, what's it gonna lose trying it?
[02:47:27.259 --> 02:47:28.679]  I mean, why not try it?
[02:47:29.025 --> 02:47:30.466]  Yes, I think that's absolutely right.
[02:47:30.466 --> 02:47:36.068]  It's something that the parents can be in control of, and it's something that we have seen produces dramatic benefit.
[02:47:36.068 --> 02:47:44.632]  It starts with better sleeping, better bowel function, better behaviour, and children can progress and make great strides through that kind of approach.
[02:47:45.902 --> 02:47:46.162]  I don't know.
[02:48:06.809 --> 02:48:19.253]  I've read not just some of your research, but other research pointing towards that they find different antibodies connected to the vaccine in the intestines with the people that have Crohn's and Crohn's-like problems.
[02:48:19.253 --> 02:48:24.294]  And now moving into irritable bowel that, you know, huge parts of the population, I mean, you're the expert on this.
[02:48:24.294 --> 02:48:25.835]  Tell us, tell us about that link.
[02:48:26.075 --> 02:48:34.878]  Well, Crohn's is how I really got into this autism bowel link, because we had for years been looking at the possibility that Crohn's may be linked to the vaccines.
[02:48:34.878 --> 02:48:36.818]  Now, that remains a question.
[02:48:36.818 --> 02:48:37.879]  It's out there.
[02:48:37.879 --> 02:48:40.159]  The work has been, some has been for, some has been against.
[02:48:40.159 --> 02:48:41.520]  But Crohn's is proliferating.
[02:48:41.943 --> 02:48:43.303]  Crohn's is epidemic.
[02:48:43.303 --> 02:48:50.685]  Just like autism is epidemic now, the Crohn's epidemic started probably in the 1920s, 30s, 40s.
[02:48:50.685 --> 02:48:55.386]  It suddenly started escalating, but it wasn't heard of in children until the mid-60s.
[02:48:55.386 --> 02:48:57.806]  In the mid-60s, it appeared in children.
[02:48:57.806 --> 02:49:00.547]  I remember one of the first cases.
[02:49:00.547 --> 02:49:07.248]  In fact, a chap who's become a very good friend of mine, when he was 16, he developed Crohn's, and people used to come from all over the north of England to see him.
[02:49:07.728 --> 02:49:09.190]  Because it was so unusual.
[02:49:09.190 --> 02:49:12.553]  Now we see Crohn's in children as young as 1 and 2 and 3.
[02:49:12.553 --> 02:49:13.534]  Now that is extraordinary.
[02:49:13.534 --> 02:49:15.557]  So what has happened?
[02:49:15.557 --> 02:49:20.041]  Like all of these other inflammatory and immune diseases, it's going through the roof.
[02:49:20.041 --> 02:49:20.802]  Why?
[02:49:20.802 --> 02:49:24.126]  We don't know the answer, but it certainly needs to be investigated.
[02:49:24.126 --> 02:49:28.671]  Something in the environment, something in the environment must be doing this, because it's not genetics.
[02:49:29.454 --> 02:49:41.163]  And if we have tens of thousands of anecdotal parents, kids having convulsions and basically being mildly to seriously, you know, brain damaged after they take shots, gee, you know, I mean, I mean, right there.
[02:49:41.163 --> 02:49:47.788]  And then you have all these other studies that I've had doctors on about, about not the guts, the brain separately talking about that.
[02:49:47.788 --> 02:49:48.709]  I mean, uh,
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:52.762]  I mean, do we have any idea what's causing this inflammation in the brain?
[02:49:52.762 --> 02:49:55.064]  Blaylock says it's the adjuvants.
[02:49:55.064 --> 02:49:59.026]  Yes, well, I think what my position is that there's some link between the bowel and the brain.
[02:49:59.026 --> 02:50:04.730]  What's happening in the bowel in many children is driving inflammation in the brain or changes within the brain.
[02:50:04.730 --> 02:50:13.337]  And that's entirely consistent with Dr. Blaylock's thinking that there is some kind of systemic inflammatory response that is driving a problem in the brain.
[02:50:13.337 --> 02:50:15.218]  Well, he says that's what Alzheimer's is.
[02:50:15.218 --> 02:50:17.660]  It's just that the brain is just inflamed chronically.
[02:50:18.447 --> 02:50:25.576]  And he says, you know, if people just get off MSG and all the other things that are doing it, before it's too late, they could be alright.
[02:50:25.576 --> 02:50:29.001]  Alcohol and other things inflame it, but once it gets to that certain point, it's over.
[02:50:29.502 --> 02:50:36.170]  Yes, it may be that you set up a sort of circular pathology, a circular disease that you can't get out of.
[02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:38.072]  Now, I don't think that that's true.
[02:50:38.072 --> 02:50:40.955]  I think that there are ways of interrupting it and getting people better.
[02:50:40.955 --> 02:50:43.678]  Oh no, he was saying that as long as it doesn't go too long.
[02:50:43.678 --> 02:50:46.962]  He just said at certain points, you know, there's so much brain damage from it.
[02:50:46.962 --> 02:50:49.665]  But he's the brain guy, you're the stomach guy, and I'm the...
[02:50:50.646 --> 02:50:51.667]  Country bumpkin.
[02:50:51.667 --> 02:50:54.369]  Doc, we're going to come right back on the other side and get more into this.
[02:50:54.369 --> 02:50:56.490]  This is such powerful information.
[02:50:56.490 --> 02:51:01.054]  And if you've got time, I want to get, because we had you on five minutes late, I want to go five minutes into the next hour.
[02:51:01.505 --> 02:51:05.606]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.606 --> 02:51:10.107]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.107 --> 02:51:16.268]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.268 --> 02:51:18.689]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.689 --> 02:51:24.670]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:28.195]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.195 --> 02:51:30.077]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.077 --> 02:51:32.260]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:37.146]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.146 --> 02:51:37.947]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:37.947 --> 02:51:41.993]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.233 --> 02:51:46.618]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.

[02:52:02.156 --> 02:52:06.180]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:09.424]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.424 --> 02:52:14.209]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.209 --> 02:52:20.616]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.616 --> 02:52:22.859]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.379 --> 02:52:23.699]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:23.699 --> 02:52:23.939]  Bernanke?
[02:52:23.939 --> 02:52:24.379]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:24.379 --> 02:52:25.180]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:26.600]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.307 --> 02:52:46.669]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:52:46.669 --> 02:52:49.570]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.570 --> 02:52:58.694]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:53:00.575 --> 02:53:03.477]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:53:03.477 --> 02:53:09.602]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:53:09.602 --> 02:53:10.362]  Don't laugh!
[02:53:10.362 --> 02:53:13.325]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:53:30.117 --> 02:53:31.358]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:31.358 --> 02:53:35.921]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:35.921 --> 02:53:41.725]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:41.725 --> 02:53:45.367]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:45.367 --> 02:53:48.089]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.089 --> 02:53:53.152]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:53.152 --> 02:53:53.393]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.393 --> 02:53:54.794]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:03.079 --> 02:54:10.004]  We're going a little bit into overdrive today with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[02:54:10.004 --> 02:54:13.186]  The book, of course, is Callous Disregard.
[02:54:13.186 --> 02:54:19.130]  It's available on the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com and better bookstores everywhere.
[02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:22.752]  And what are some of the websites we should tell folks to visit?
[02:54:25.194 --> 02:54:29.316]  Because written here on my deal it says cowlish-disregard.com.
[02:54:29.316 --> 02:54:30.436]  Is that the best place to go?
[02:54:30.436 --> 02:54:34.418]  That's one place where the book is for sale and there's sort of some backstory.
[02:54:34.418 --> 02:54:45.482]  Vaccinesafetyfirst.com has just gone up where journalists can go and get brief soundbite information plus links to the various papers that we're talking about.
[02:54:45.482 --> 02:54:46.583]  So that's a good place to go.
[02:54:46.583 --> 02:54:48.564]  The National Vaccine Information Center website
[02:54:49.344 --> 02:55:02.060]  Vaccinesafetyfirst.com and then they can go there and when they see Good Morning America saying there's no other studies and that he's a lie, you can see all the big studies and all the concern and all the news about it at vaccinesafetyfirst.com.
[02:55:02.060 --> 02:55:02.741]  Correct.
[02:55:02.741 --> 02:55:06.065]  Alright, we've got about four minutes left here and then five minutes the next segment.
[02:55:06.065 --> 02:55:08.528]  You've got the floor for other key points you want to cover, Doctor.
[02:55:09.056 --> 02:55:12.458]  Well, I think one of the key things, Alex, is why do they have to go after me in the first place?
[02:55:12.458 --> 02:55:17.460]  Why do they have to try and stop the vaccine safety research that was taking place at the Royal Free Hospital in London?
[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:31.587]  And what I discovered from a whistleblower, a senior government health official, in 1997, is that when England introduced the MMR vaccine at the end of the 1980s, they introduced a vaccine which was knowingly unsafe.
[02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:36.349]  In the same month that it was licensed in the UK, it was withdrawn in Canada for safety reasons.
[02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:37.710]  It was causing meningitis.
[02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:43.514]  He was brought across from Canada to advise the UK government on whether they should introduce this vaccine or not.
[02:55:43.514 --> 02:55:44.575]  He said no.
[02:55:44.575 --> 02:55:47.017]  They went ahead and introduced it.
[02:55:47.017 --> 02:55:48.078]  It was cheaper.
[02:55:48.078 --> 02:55:51.741]  It was made by SmithKline Beecham, the local company.
[02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:52.682]  Were those the reasons?
[02:55:52.682 --> 02:55:53.483]  I don't know.
[02:55:53.483 --> 02:55:55.885]  But he advised them not to introduce it and they did.
[02:55:56.565 --> 02:56:06.153]  And what happened was that four years later it had to be withdrawn overnight because just as in England, just as in Canada, just as in Japan and Australia, it was causing meningitis.
[02:56:06.153 --> 02:56:07.514]  Children were damaged.
[02:56:07.514 --> 02:56:14.580]  And children were damaged at 100 times the rate that was predicted by their surveillance methods, which were inadequate.
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:18.701]  Now why was that vaccine ever allowed onto the market?
[02:56:18.701 --> 02:56:22.742]  What did happen, and this will ring bells with you, is it changed its name.
[02:56:22.742 --> 02:56:25.522]  That's the only thing that changed from Canada to the UK.
[02:56:25.522 --> 02:56:28.103]  It went from Trivirix to Pluzerix.
[02:56:28.103 --> 02:56:30.463]  So why would you change the name of a product?
[02:56:30.463 --> 02:56:32.884]  Same vaccine, different name.
[02:56:32.884 --> 02:56:35.484]  It had to be withdrawn because it was causing damage.
[02:56:35.484 --> 02:56:39.065]  And he told me he knew that many, many children were injured by that vaccine.
[02:56:39.065 --> 02:56:40.545]  Will they ever be compensated?
[02:56:40.545 --> 02:56:40.745]  No.
[02:56:40.745 --> 02:56:42.206]  Will they ever be acknowledged?
[02:56:42.206 --> 02:56:42.326]  No.
[02:56:43.306 --> 02:56:44.088]  How did it come about?
[02:56:44.088 --> 02:56:49.260]  Because the vaccine manufacturer themselves expressed concern, according to him, about introducing the vaccine.
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:51.124]  They didn't want to do it because they were having problems in Canada.
[02:56:51.124 --> 02:56:51.946]  They had a liability.
[02:56:53.106 --> 02:56:55.348]  So the government gave them an indemnity.
[02:56:55.348 --> 02:56:56.129]  That's what it appears.
[02:56:56.129 --> 02:57:00.252]  The government gave them an indemnity, underwrit, underwrote their liability.
[02:57:00.252 --> 02:57:02.974]  Well we have that here with the Vaccine Damage Fund in the US.
[02:57:02.974 --> 02:57:07.658]  But there was no, as far as I can gather, there was no ministerial approval for this in the UK.
[02:57:07.658 --> 02:57:18.948]  What about the 2000 meeting that ABC News even covered in 2002, where you have the CDC meeting and then the head of it's going, I'd never give a vaccine to my granddaughter, this has damaged millions, we gotta
[02:57:19.068 --> 02:57:27.230]  Yeah, that was an extraordinary situation where they took data which showed there was a clear increased risk and they cut those data down, they changed them after the fact.
[02:57:40.074 --> 02:57:41.515]  To produce no risk at all.
[02:57:41.515 --> 02:57:55.304]  Now, if I had done that, if I had designed a study, got a result I didn't want, and then after the fact, I chopped it and changed it and moved it around until I got no effect or got an effect, then I would be vilified just as I've been vilified now.
[02:57:55.304 --> 02:57:59.187]  But because a government agency does it, then it's perfectly acceptable.
[02:57:59.187 --> 02:58:02.209]  Well, your study's been replicated in spades.
[02:58:02.209 --> 02:58:03.230]  That's why they're coming after you.
[02:58:03.598 --> 02:58:04.058]  That's correct.
[02:58:04.058 --> 02:58:08.622]  The bowel disease that we discovered originally has been confirmed by other people.
[02:58:08.622 --> 02:58:10.624]  Is there a link between the vaccine and the disease?
[02:58:10.624 --> 02:58:11.725]  That work is going on.
[02:58:11.725 --> 02:58:12.606]  It needs to be done.
[02:58:12.606 --> 02:58:14.287]  It's not going to stop.
[02:58:14.287 --> 02:58:22.454]  And the kind of study, like the vaccinated-unvaccinated study, those are the sorts of things that need to be done to establish whether or not there is a causal association
[02:58:22.554 --> 02:58:23.655]  Well, I mean, I'll say this.
[02:58:23.655 --> 02:58:24.575]  I've got children.
[02:58:24.575 --> 02:58:27.377]  I know there's science in vaccine technology.
[02:58:27.377 --> 02:58:30.720]  And I would like to have vaccines that I can trust.
[02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:35.883]  But, I mean, the fact they have liability protection in this stream of carnage, you can't trust them.
[02:58:35.883 --> 02:58:37.565]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[02:58:37.565 --> 02:58:39.006]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:58:39.006 --> 02:58:41.587]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:41.587 --> 02:58:42.888]  On air.
[02:58:42.888 --> 02:58:44.429]  Online.
[02:58:44.429 --> 02:58:46.951]  And on demand.
[02:58:46.951 --> 02:58:50.254]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.138 --> 02:58:55.681]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.681 --> 02:58:56.601]  Number 1.
[02:58:56.601 --> 02:59:00.024]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.024 --> 02:59:00.884]  Number 2.
[02:59:00.884 --> 02:59:05.787]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.787 --> 02:59:06.528]  It's true.
[02:59:06.528 --> 02:59:11.391]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.391 --> 02:59:12.211]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.211 --> 02:59:15.814]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.814 --> 02:59:19.496]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.716 --> 02:59:20.496]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.496 --> 02:59:23.257]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.257 --> 02:59:26.938]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.938 --> 02:59:27.738]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.738 --> 02:59:31.879]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.879 --> 02:59:36.941]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.941 --> 02:59:41.102]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.102 --> 02:59:42.903]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:59:47.824 --> 02:59:48.084]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.084 --> 02:59:53.568]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.568 --> 02:59:55.610]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.610 --> 02:59:58.832]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:10.185 --> 03:00:12.647]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest.
[03:00:12.647 --> 03:00:13.688]  We're almost out of time.
[03:00:13.688 --> 03:00:17.952]  Five more minutes left with him and we're going into retransmission.
[03:00:17.952 --> 03:00:25.939]  Trying to quantify what these autoimmune responses are and all these countless other studies in other parts of the body, the pancreas, the liver, the brain.
[03:00:26.659 --> 03:00:26.880]  I don't
[03:00:42.591 --> 03:00:43.031]  Break that down.
[03:00:43.031 --> 03:00:47.855]  Well, the brain, the intestine is really the first point of exposure to many, many toxins.
[03:00:47.855 --> 03:00:50.977]  Bacteria, alcohol, any number of toxins.
[03:00:50.977 --> 03:00:52.238]  It's got to be working properly.
[03:00:52.238 --> 03:00:54.219]  It's also the biggest immune organ in the body.
[03:00:54.219 --> 03:00:57.781]  It's also got more neurons, more nerve cells in it than the brain.
[03:00:57.781 --> 03:01:00.943]  So, it's a crucial interface between us and the environment.
[03:01:00.943 --> 03:01:03.865]  Now, people say, I don't understand this gut-brain link.
[03:01:03.865 --> 03:01:04.606]  Tell me how it works.
[03:01:04.606 --> 03:01:06.467]  Well, alcohol is a very good example.
[03:01:06.467 --> 03:01:07.768]  Alcohol is a neurotoxin.
[03:01:07.768 --> 03:01:08.669]  It poisons the brain.
[03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:10.691]  We take it through the gut.
[03:01:10.691 --> 03:01:14.334]  It has to get through the intestine, through the bloodstream, to the brain.
[03:01:14.334 --> 03:01:19.420]  So there's a very good example of how a gut-brain neurotoxicity can operate.
[03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:23.924]  And people then start to understand how that might take place, how that might be working.
[03:01:25.326 --> 03:01:29.929]  So, there is nothing conceptually difficult about what we're talking about.
[03:01:29.929 --> 03:01:31.370]  Does it happen in other diseases?
[03:01:31.370 --> 03:01:31.730]  Yes.
[03:01:31.730 --> 03:01:41.557]  Patients with celiac disease and allergic sensitivity to wheat, they have a number of neurological problems including dementia and seizures, but it all starts in the intestine.
[03:01:41.557 --> 03:01:46.681]  So, that is a very, very fruitful area, not only to approach the mechanism of this disease,
[03:01:47.341 --> 03:01:50.483]  But also help treat children to get them better.
[03:01:50.483 --> 03:01:54.446]  So that has been my approach and will continue to be my approach to this.
[03:01:54.446 --> 03:02:00.390]  So something toxic is being triggered in the gut and it's, it's, it's causes...
[03:02:01.567 --> 03:02:04.169]  Neurologically, do we know what's going on in the brain?
[03:02:04.169 --> 03:02:08.551]  I mean, they can deny it's a vaccine, but what's happening to their brains?
[03:02:08.551 --> 03:02:09.752]  We still don't know.
[03:02:09.752 --> 03:02:10.412]  We still don't know.
[03:02:10.412 --> 03:02:11.873]  We know that function's being altered.
[03:02:11.873 --> 03:02:15.375]  We know that growth of the brain and development of the brain are being altered.
[03:02:15.375 --> 03:02:16.556]  How is that happening?
[03:02:16.556 --> 03:02:17.576]  We don't know.
[03:02:17.576 --> 03:02:25.381]  And there are many people who've got some very, very good ideas about things called excitotoxins causing inflammation and damage to the brain.
[03:02:25.381 --> 03:02:27.402]  But at this stage, we're still looking.
[03:02:27.722 --> 03:02:33.965]  Yeah, that's what Blaylock goes over and all the other doctors he sources on this inflammation.
[03:02:33.965 --> 03:02:37.227]  And wow, well, we've got about two minutes left.
[03:02:37.227 --> 03:02:40.048]  Any other tidbits that are important for parents and people out there?
[03:02:40.048 --> 03:02:44.051]  Well, my final message is really to, one, to parents, and that is read.
[03:02:44.051 --> 03:02:45.491]  Please go and read.
[03:02:45.491 --> 03:02:47.532]  There are two sides to this debate.
[03:02:47.532 --> 03:02:48.893]  Read both sides of the debate.
[03:02:48.893 --> 03:02:50.334]  Go to the CDC's website.
[03:02:50.834 --> 03:02:54.838]  Go to the National Vaccine Information Center and other people's websites.
[03:02:54.838 --> 03:02:55.759]  Get the information.
[03:02:55.759 --> 03:03:01.624]  Find yourself a sympathetic doctor and talk them through your concerns about the vaccines.
[03:03:01.624 --> 03:03:03.186]  Ask to see the product inserts.
[03:03:03.186 --> 03:03:09.532]  Read the product inserts to see if there is, for example, the mercury-preservative thimerosal in there.
[03:03:09.532 --> 03:03:11.554]  Because they lied for years and said that they'd taken it out.
[03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:14.571]  Well, they advised that it was taken out.
[03:03:14.571 --> 03:03:18.593]  There was no order saying, this is a neurotoxin, it should not be in there, take it out.
[03:03:18.593 --> 03:03:24.235]  But at the same time that they took it out, or advised that it should be taken out, they put it back in the influenza vaccine.
[03:03:24.235 --> 03:03:25.656]  That four times will it have been?
[03:03:25.656 --> 03:03:26.236]  That's right.
[03:03:26.236 --> 03:03:31.038]  Pregnant mothers and young children getting the influenza vaccine containing mercury.
[03:03:31.038 --> 03:03:33.999]  So you're taking it out on the one hand and putting it back in the other.
[03:03:33.999 --> 03:03:35.420]  That makes no sense.
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:56.213]  And then they say, well you get the same amount in a sandwich, a tuna sandwich, but talking to endocrinologists, people that, toxicologists, they explain, this is injected directly into the blood, not going through the stomach that's designed to filter some of that out, and it's not like mercury in fish that's biologically bound, is the way it's explained to me.
[03:03:56.213 --> 03:04:01.557]  So it's much different, especially when it's connected to the pathogen, which then supercharges it.
[03:04:01.897 --> 03:04:02.457]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[03:04:02.457 --> 03:04:08.422]  If people are saying that, and they are saying that, that it's no worse than having a tuna sandwich, that is grossly misleading.
[03:04:08.422 --> 03:04:14.587]  And that's only either being said through ignorance about mercury metabolism, or it's deliberately deceptive.
[03:04:14.587 --> 03:04:15.748]  And that's most unfortunate.
[03:04:15.748 --> 03:04:16.789]  So my final message
[03:04:17.489 --> 03:04:18.910]  ...is for the authorities.
[03:04:18.910 --> 03:04:24.832]  Because what you are doing is compromising public confidence in vaccine safety policy across the board.
[03:04:24.832 --> 03:04:36.478]  And unless you address parental issues, unless you address their concerns, and it's 89% of American parents that we're talking about, then you are going to attract vaccine uptake across the board, and there are going to be problems.
[03:04:36.478 --> 03:04:40.960]  And at the end of the day, it will be you, that is the authorities, who are responsible for them.
[03:04:41.625 --> 03:04:43.066]  Dr. Wakefield, powerful interview.
[03:04:43.066 --> 03:04:44.347]  Look forward to having you back soon.
[03:04:44.347 --> 03:04:46.648]  Hopefully you can get Jenny McCarthy on the show.
[03:04:46.648 --> 03:04:51.091]  I've heard she's a listener with some of her friends, but that's yet to be seen.
[03:04:51.091 --> 03:04:53.513]  Wow, they're trying to crucify it, but I believe they're failing.
[03:04:53.513 --> 03:04:56.695]  They're trying to scare other researchers away from this info.
[03:04:56.695 --> 03:04:57.996]  We appreciate your courage, Doctor.
[03:04:57.996 --> 03:04:58.716]  Great having you.
[03:04:58.716 --> 03:05:00.757]  Thank you very much.
[03:05:00.757 --> 03:05:01.378]  Great job, crew.
