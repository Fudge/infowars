[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.340 --> 00:24.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.760]  Well, Barack Obama's spending his valentine's day away from a shallow.
[00:29.760 --> 00:37.760]  I'm sure the pile of cocaine, a carton of cigarettes, Hillary, I'm sure is going to be spending it with her girlfriends.
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.760]  And hey, that's what Valentine's Day is for, huh?
[00:40.760 --> 00:41.760]  All right, let's get serious.
[00:41.760 --> 00:48.760]  CBS News says there's record cold weather all over the northern hemisphere because of global warming.
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.760]  Winter storm has killed at least 12 people across the south.
[00:52.760 --> 00:55.760]  A storm wipes out a power for thousands.
[00:55.760 --> 00:59.760]  CBS, again, blames global warming for bad weather.
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.760]  Of course, the Arctic was supposed to be melted this year.
[01:01.760 --> 01:05.760]  Remember that Al Gore said that back in 2007 and nine.
[01:05.760 --> 01:07.760]  Keep laughing, he said.
[01:07.760 --> 01:10.760]  And it's going to be melted, completely melted.
[01:10.760 --> 01:13.760]  Of course, it's record thickness in the last 50 years.
[01:13.760 --> 01:15.760]  So canceled airline scrap record number of flights.
[01:15.760 --> 01:17.760]  That's just some of what we're going to be covering.
[01:17.760 --> 01:23.760]  Don't worry, the TSA is not showing up to keep you safe from imaginary threat stage by criminal elements of the government.
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.760]  Snowstorm keeps TSA agents home, causes security line chaos at Newark Airport.
[01:30.760 --> 01:33.760]  So that is all in the news.
[01:33.760 --> 01:37.760]  Meanwhile, I'm sure they'll blame this on global warming too.
[01:37.760 --> 01:45.760]  Mass evacuation of 20,000 in Indonesia as Jamba volcano erupts.
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.760]  And I've actually seen the fake environmentalists like it's voodoo or something.
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.760]  They claim that we're having volcanic activity because of global warming,
[01:54.760 --> 01:57.760]  which is supposedly from carbon dioxide.
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.760]  And they say mother earth is mad at us.
[01:59.760 --> 02:05.760]  I think if there's a mother earth, it's mad about the GMO and the nuclear power plants leaking all over the place.
[02:05.760 --> 02:07.760]  Not about carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[02:07.760 --> 02:08.760]  I mean, I'm just sorry.
[02:08.760 --> 02:10.760]  They want to tax part of the carbon cycle.
[02:10.760 --> 02:11.760]  That's why they picked that.
[02:11.760 --> 02:14.760]  Mark Moreno, who heads up the climate depot.
[02:14.760 --> 02:20.760]  The foremost group clearing house exposing the fraud that is manmade global warming.
[02:20.760 --> 02:24.760]  And while we should be concerned about it, how it's a societal takeover excuse,
[02:24.760 --> 02:31.760]  he's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour for 30 minutes.
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.760]  And then we saw a music video a few weeks ago.
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.760]  We said, man, that looks like our show or something.
[02:38.760 --> 02:41.760]  That must be a really tuned in smart folks.
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.760]  Of course, I like corn, listen to corn, listen to Metallica, mega death, you name it.
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.760]  I mean, I like good, hard music.
[02:48.760 --> 02:51.760]  And I know they had some messages of Liberty in the past.
[02:51.760 --> 02:54.760]  So we sent them an email and said, hey, are you listeners of the show?
[02:54.760 --> 02:56.760]  We'd like to come on and sure enough they are.
[02:56.760 --> 02:57.760]  So they're going to talk about their music video.
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.760]  Jonathan Davis, lead singer, corn is going to come on for about 25, 30 minutes at the start of the third hour.
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.760]  Today, always good to reach out to more folks out there in the entertainment industry.
[03:06.760 --> 03:10.760]  We're putting out great music videos, really exposing the whole system.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.760]  And believe me, they try to keep them on a short leash.
[03:12.760 --> 03:15.760]  It takes Billy Corrigan, a lot of courage to come on this show.
[03:15.760 --> 03:18.760]  It takes Dave Mustaine, a lot of courage to come on this show.
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.760]  People like Jimmy Vaughan have come on over the years.
[03:21.760 --> 03:26.760]  You know, the media paints him up as a bad boy.
[03:26.760 --> 03:28.760]  And that's all he would do is call him.
[03:28.760 --> 03:30.760]  He keeps saying for years, he'll come on.
[03:30.760 --> 03:33.760]  Everybody demonized him so much, but he's really a nice guy overall.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.760]  And it's a turd quite a bit in my views.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.760]  Kind of the Americana story.
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.760]  I need to get Jesse James in here someday as well.
[03:39.760 --> 03:42.760]  Because he's not scared to talk about guns and liberty and freedom.
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.760]  There's so many people who know what's going on who will not come on the show like Bruce Willis.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.760]  And again, I'm not calling out Bruce Willis.
[03:51.760 --> 03:54.760]  It's not his job to come out and say his view on the New World Order,
[03:54.760 --> 03:57.760]  though he told Vanity Fair that he's woken up at the New World Order
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.760]  and that the left and right are controlled
[03:59.760 --> 04:02.760]  and that the same people that killed Kennedy are running the country today.
[04:02.760 --> 04:03.760]  It's just that it's frustrating.
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.760]  Imagine if Bruce Willis is a smart guy, has a lot of political pull,
[04:08.760 --> 04:10.760]  never really been political, people listen to him.
[04:10.760 --> 04:13.760]  Good looking guy. Imagine if he came out.
[04:13.760 --> 04:18.760]  People like Rick Linklater have come out on the show, many, many others.
[04:18.760 --> 04:22.760]  I guess Mike Judge has come on the show and criticized the corrupt system
[04:22.760 --> 04:24.760]  and kind of the mafia of the Democrats.
[04:24.760 --> 04:26.760]  And he said, I was never a Democrat or a Republican.
[04:26.760 --> 04:29.760]  I'm liberal on some issues, conservative on others.
[04:29.760 --> 04:33.760]  He said, the bullying of the Democrats and the IRS stuff and the way they act.
[04:33.760 --> 04:38.760]  I mean, it's just, and Michael Moore with his bodyguards and then saying,
[04:38.760 --> 04:39.760]  I can't own a gun.
[04:39.760 --> 04:41.760]  He said it really turned him against him.
[04:41.760 --> 04:43.760]  And I think that's what's going on here, but that's a side issue.
[04:43.760 --> 04:46.760]  I just always admire the courage.
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.760]  Even if it's the lead singer of ministry coming on the show who's a listener.
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.760]  And the point is that they've got courage because believe me, the system comes after you.
[04:55.760 --> 04:57.760]  But what happens when everybody starts going public?
[04:57.760 --> 04:59.760]  Ha-ha.
[04:59.760 --> 05:04.760]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[05:04.760 --> 05:07.760]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.760]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease.
[05:12.760 --> 05:14.760]  It all comes down to one thing.
[05:14.760 --> 05:16.760]  We are what we eat.
[05:16.760 --> 05:20.760]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[05:20.760 --> 05:25.760]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[05:25.760 --> 05:27.760]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.760]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[05:30.760 --> 05:34.760]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[05:59.760 --> 06:02.760]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[06:02.760 --> 06:07.760]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[06:07.760 --> 06:10.760]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment,
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.760]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[06:12.760 --> 06:15.760]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[06:15.760 --> 06:20.760]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[06:20.760 --> 06:24.760]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[06:24.760 --> 06:30.760]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[06:30.760 --> 06:33.760]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[06:33.760 --> 06:38.760]  and that's why I stock MyPatriot with high-quality, storable foods from MyPatriot Supply.
[06:38.760 --> 06:40.760]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com.
[06:40.760 --> 06:50.760]  Or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[06:50.760 --> 06:53.760]  That's 866-229-0927.
[06:53.760 --> 06:56.760]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[06:56.760 --> 06:59.760]  Buy Patriot Supply.com slash Alex.
[06:59.760 --> 07:03.760]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[07:03.760 --> 07:05.760]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[07:05.760 --> 07:10.760]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our testosterone
[07:10.760 --> 07:13.760]  and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[07:13.760 --> 07:17.760]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others,
[07:17.760 --> 07:24.760]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super-male vitality formula
[07:24.760 --> 07:30.760]  sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[07:30.760 --> 07:35.760]  Super-male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[07:35.760 --> 07:38.760]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[07:38.760 --> 07:44.760]  Super-male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[07:44.760 --> 07:51.760]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super-male vitality at InfoWarsLife.com
[07:51.760 --> 07:53.760]  to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[08:00.760 --> 08:26.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:26.760 --> 08:31.760]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[08:31.760 --> 08:35.760]  That's right, we are waging war on corruption.
[08:35.760 --> 08:44.760]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[08:44.760 --> 08:48.760]  We're live, my friends, broadcasting World Wide.
[08:48.760 --> 08:51.760]  Then we return Sundays and I'll be hosting this Sunday.
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.760]  It was David Knight last Sunday, did a great job.
[08:53.760 --> 09:03.760]  I'll be hosting 4 to 6 p.m. Central with the Sunday transmission.
[09:03.760 --> 09:12.760]  I want to wish all of you a great Valentine's Day today.
[09:12.760 --> 09:15.760]  They're going to break the chains.
[09:15.760 --> 09:22.760]  You can't stop them.
[09:22.760 --> 09:26.760]  Balls to the walls, folks.
[09:26.760 --> 09:27.760]  You know what that means?
[09:27.760 --> 09:30.760]  It means in an airplane, the old days, like in a B-17,
[09:30.760 --> 09:34.760]  when they rammed the throttle all the way forward, all the way to the wall.
[09:34.760 --> 09:38.760]  This particular song is about knocking down the Berlin Wall.
[09:38.760 --> 09:40.760]  Take the balls to the walls.
[09:40.760 --> 09:42.760]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, again, it is Friday.
[09:42.760 --> 09:43.760]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[09:43.760 --> 09:45.760]  I was not here yesterday.
[09:45.760 --> 09:47.760]  I thought I went out and shot a bunch of guns up close
[09:47.760 --> 09:49.760]  and might have breathed in some of the gunpowder.
[09:49.760 --> 09:51.760]  That's why I had a sore throat.
[09:51.760 --> 09:53.760]  Turns out I had a fever the last few days
[09:53.760 --> 09:57.760]  and finally decided to check it and did have about 101.
[09:57.760 --> 09:59.760]  And so I didn't come into work yesterday.
[09:59.760 --> 10:01.760]  In the old days, I would come in with a fever,
[10:01.760 --> 10:05.760]  but I just did not want to sound like a toad on air.
[10:05.760 --> 10:06.760]  But I'm here today.
[10:06.760 --> 10:08.760]  My fever broke last night.
[10:08.760 --> 10:11.760]  And I did a little bit of light exercise this morning.
[10:11.760 --> 10:17.760]  And so I am here today trying not to have a giant coughing fit
[10:17.760 --> 10:21.760]  because I feel like I have fire ants in my lungs right now.
[10:21.760 --> 10:23.760]  But I am here.
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.760]  I'm very thankful that you have tuned in
[10:26.760 --> 10:32.760]  for this Friday Valentine's Day, February 14, 2014.
[10:32.760 --> 10:33.760]  Goodness gracious.
[10:33.760 --> 10:34.760]  Saints alive.
[10:34.760 --> 10:36.760]  It is hard to keep saying 2014,
[10:36.760 --> 10:39.760]  even though we're already halfway in.
[10:39.760 --> 10:41.760]  It's a short month, 28 days, February.
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.760]  We are already halfway in, ladies and gentlemen,
[10:46.760 --> 10:48.760]  to the second month of 2014.
[10:48.760 --> 10:52.760]  Absolutely incredible.
[10:52.760 --> 10:54.760]  We do have the lead singer of Corn,
[10:54.760 --> 10:57.760]  who's got some Jonathan Davies,
[10:57.760 --> 11:00.760]  who is a critic of the New World Order,
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.760]  the One World Government,
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.760]  and our Lord and Savior, as Jamie Foxx calls him, Barack Obama.
[11:07.760 --> 11:10.760]  So he's going to commit massive heresy and sacrilege
[11:10.760 --> 11:12.760]  speaking out against the dear leader
[11:12.760 --> 11:14.760]  that doesn't mean he then supports the Republicans.
[11:14.760 --> 11:16.760]  It just means he doesn't support Obama.
[11:16.760 --> 11:18.760]  It's kind of like go to a used car dealership,
[11:18.760 --> 11:19.760]  and you have two cars for sale,
[11:19.760 --> 11:21.760]  and you decide you don't want either one.
[11:21.760 --> 11:22.760]  We're going to be talking about that with him
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.760]  for about 30 minutes at the start of the third hour.
[11:24.760 --> 11:27.760]  And then Mark Moreno will be joining us
[11:27.760 --> 11:30.760]  to talk about the record cold and the record
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.760]  at Northern and Southern ice caps
[11:33.760 --> 11:35.760]  and what's happening with the sun.
[11:35.760 --> 11:37.760]  And the fact that CBS News and others
[11:37.760 --> 11:40.760]  are saying all of this is happening,
[11:40.760 --> 11:42.760]  all of this is unfolding,
[11:42.760 --> 11:45.760]  all of this is going on because of global warming.
[11:45.760 --> 11:47.760]  If you just pay Al Gore and Obama
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.760]  and literally the Rothschilds and Rockefellers
[11:50.760 --> 11:52.760]  and George Soros,
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.760]  money to the Chicago and New York
[11:54.760 --> 11:57.760]  and London climate exchanges,
[11:57.760 --> 11:58.760]  everything would be okay.
[11:58.760 --> 12:01.760]  And here's the Hill newspaper right now.
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.760]  Headline, Obama to pitch $1 million climate change
[12:05.760 --> 12:09.760]  resilience fund in California.
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.760]  The fund would be needed to be approved by Congress
[12:11.760 --> 12:14.760]  and intended to help communities deal with negative weather.
[12:14.760 --> 12:16.760]  That's the result of climate change.
[12:16.760 --> 12:19.760]  They're going to pay people when you have normal,
[12:19.760 --> 12:22.760]  weather fluctuations, drought, floods, you name it.
[12:22.760 --> 12:24.760]  The only thing that's normal is that you do have fluctuations.
[12:24.760 --> 12:26.760]  The only thing normal is climate change.
[12:26.760 --> 12:29.760]  Well, they'll pay you to sign on and agree to it
[12:29.760 --> 12:32.760]  like an indulgence or I guess like faith based initiatives.
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.760]  President Obama will pitch the new billion dollar climate
[12:34.760 --> 12:38.760]  resilience fund during a visit Friday to California.
[12:38.760 --> 12:40.760]  Obama is touting the fund during a trip to California.
[12:40.760 --> 12:43.760]  Which has been devastated by drought
[12:43.760 --> 12:46.760]  that is threatening the Central Valley's agricultural production.
[12:46.760 --> 12:50.760]  Why'd you shut down all the northern lake locks
[12:50.760 --> 12:52.760]  claiming it's for some sucker fish?
[12:52.760 --> 12:56.760]  It's not even indigenous.
[12:56.760 --> 12:58.760]  Five years ago, they shut the water off in Klamath
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.760]  and other areas and a bunch of other lakes.
[13:00.760 --> 13:03.760]  They're just brimming with water right now.
[13:03.760 --> 13:07.760]  Don't worry, the feds are here to save you.
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.760]  All collectivist systems work so well.
[13:11.760 --> 13:14.760]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[13:14.760 --> 13:16.760]  But again, it's record cold.
[13:16.760 --> 13:17.760]  Just look at DrPort.com.
[13:17.760 --> 13:21.760]  FAA grounds flower delivery drone.
[13:21.760 --> 13:24.760]  Keeping us safe from that.
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.760]  Just a gimmick drone that flies a few thousand yards.
[13:28.760 --> 13:31.760]  Mid-Atlantic storm, ninth biggest ever recorded.
[13:31.760 --> 13:35.760]  Snow in 49 states, great lakes, ice breakers exhausted.
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.760]  Thousands without power.
[13:38.760 --> 13:40.760]  Residents cooked food in fireplaces.
[13:40.760 --> 13:42.760]  We're going to ban those under gentlemen one.
[13:42.760 --> 13:45.760]  100 car pileups on PA Turnpike.
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.760]  Philly snowfall shatters 130 year old record.
[13:49.760 --> 13:52.760]  Pregnant woman killed by snow plow in Brooklyn.
[13:52.760 --> 13:54.760]  Body found covered in snow in DC's tree.
[13:54.760 --> 13:55.760]  Yeah, a bunch of deaths.
[13:55.760 --> 13:58.760]  Blizzard to Lash Eastern New England Saturday.
[13:58.760 --> 14:00.760]  And then he got Obama slush fund.
[14:00.760 --> 14:03.760]  But don't worry, nightmare flights canceled nationwide
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.760]  in different states from coast to coast.
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.760]  And the TSA, you know, doctors and nurses will walk
[14:08.760 --> 14:10.760]  six, seven miles to get to their patients.
[14:10.760 --> 14:13.760]  But the TSA, they won't even take a taxi.
[14:13.760 --> 14:16.760]  No, they're just going to stay home.
[14:16.760 --> 14:19.760]  They are just going to stay home.
[14:19.760 --> 14:23.760]  And a major magazine is asking is the snapping turtle.
[14:23.760 --> 14:26.760]  National Journal asks, is the snapping turtle too old to run?
[14:26.760 --> 14:28.760]  No, I don't think Hillary Clinton is too old to run.
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.760]  I think she's too evil to run, too openly corrupt to run.
[14:31.760 --> 14:34.760]  And I can't believe Kurt Nemo wrote an article last night
[14:34.760 --> 14:36.760]  for info wars.com.
[14:36.760 --> 14:38.760]  Maybe you guys will print me that out of the archive.
[14:38.760 --> 14:39.760]  I was gone yesterday.
[14:39.760 --> 14:41.760]  There was a lot of big stories I saw and which almost ended
[14:41.760 --> 14:43.760]  up calling into the show.
[14:43.760 --> 14:45.760]  You print me everything in the archive, the news archive,
[14:45.760 --> 14:48.760]  you know, the top story archive, all the interesting stories.
[14:48.760 --> 14:49.760]  Thanks.
[14:49.760 --> 14:50.760]  So I want to go over some of those.
[14:50.760 --> 14:53.760]  I just remember there's a bunch of them I want to get to.
[14:53.760 --> 14:58.760]  But no, no, no, she's too evil to be president.
[14:58.760 --> 15:01.760]  But, but I understand under the gimmick of a woman,
[15:01.760 --> 15:04.760]  you'd want a Sarah Palin.
[15:04.760 --> 15:08.760]  Or you'd want, you know, some 40, 50 year old woman to run
[15:08.760 --> 15:11.760]  because, you know, the gimmick was that Obama was young
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.760]  and well-spoken and I guess some people said good looking.
[15:15.760 --> 15:18.760]  I think he looks like a space alien, quite frankly.
[15:18.760 --> 15:20.760]  I don't think he's good looking.
[15:20.760 --> 15:23.760]  And that would mean for a black guy, a white guy, anybody.
[15:23.760 --> 15:25.760]  I mean, Jakari Jackson is a good looking guy,
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.760]  whether you call him black or white.
[15:27.760 --> 15:30.760]  You know, somebody around the office like Weldon Henson is a good looking guy.
[15:30.760 --> 15:32.760]  It doesn't matter if he's black or white.
[15:32.760 --> 15:35.760]  I mean, Hillary Clinton is ugly, period.
[15:35.760 --> 15:37.760]  Ugly inside, ugly outside.
[15:37.760 --> 15:39.760]  Look at the photo on Drudge.
[15:39.760 --> 15:41.760]  I mean, that's why I call her a snapping turtle, man.
[15:41.760 --> 15:47.760]  She looks like an old, mean, diseased, infested snapping turtle.
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.760]  And right next to her, Michelle Obama looks like a narcissistic crocodile
[15:52.760 --> 15:57.760]  slash vampire slash snapping turtle slash man.
[15:57.760 --> 15:59.760]  You know, if you want to start a conspiracy theory,
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.760]  it's well reported that Obama, you know, is pitching and batting for,
[16:04.760 --> 16:06.760]  he's working for both teams, basically.
[16:06.760 --> 16:09.760]  And, you know, I'm not judging him, you know.
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.760]  My whole issue is that, you know, maybe the secret word is
[16:13.760 --> 16:16.760]  is that Michelle Obama is really a man.
[16:16.760 --> 16:19.760]  Anybody, I'm sure they're all going to pick that up in magazines.
[16:19.760 --> 16:24.760]  It's a joke and if all the Democratic Party operations can't take a joke,
[16:24.760 --> 16:26.760]  good, that's the whole point.
[16:26.760 --> 16:27.760]  You have no power.
[16:27.760 --> 16:28.760]  You can do nothing to me.
[16:28.760 --> 16:30.760]  Attack me.
[16:30.760 --> 16:32.760]  I'm sure you'll take the bait.
[16:32.760 --> 16:35.760]  I'm talking about your Lord and Savior, Hillary,
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.760]  saying she looks like an ugly snapping turtle.
[16:38.760 --> 16:41.760]  And you're the one saying, come out of the closet about everything.
[16:41.760 --> 16:46.760]  So Hillary and Michelle Obama both have arranged marriages
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.760]  for basically kids that are used as beards for Obama
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.760]  and the Clintons and the rest of them.
[16:53.760 --> 16:56.760]  And I don't even mean a gay beard, you know, like somebody has a wife
[16:56.760 --> 16:59.760]  or a husband so, you know, they can go out in their profession
[16:59.760 --> 17:01.760]  and look manly or look feminine.
[17:01.760 --> 17:04.760]  I'm saying a beard for the fact that you use your kids politically
[17:04.760 --> 17:08.760]  like Obama has dogs as a beard.
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.760]  And I was not a fan of George W. Bush or everybody do this,
[17:11.760 --> 17:13.760]  but their dogs are not beards.
[17:13.760 --> 17:16.760]  They're kissing them. They're carrying them on and off the airplane.
[17:16.760 --> 17:18.760]  I know spoiled dogs when I see them.
[17:18.760 --> 17:20.760]  You look at Obama's dogs.
[17:20.760 --> 17:22.760]  No one even knows where they're at or what's going on.
[17:22.760 --> 17:24.760]  Remember the day after Clinton was out of office,
[17:24.760 --> 17:27.760]  his dog died mysteriously at like H6.
[17:27.760 --> 17:30.760]  It's like, you know, get rid of the prop.
[17:30.760 --> 17:32.760]  They're totally fake.
[17:32.760 --> 17:34.760]  They're totally plastic is my point.
[17:34.760 --> 17:39.760]  And it's all a facade up there.
[17:39.760 --> 17:43.760]  I think it's discriminatory though at Homeland Security
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.760]  and in government that women who are head over sexual can't get jobs.
[17:47.760 --> 17:51.760]  I mean, I really think it's weird that the heads of Homeland Security
[17:51.760 --> 17:55.760]  and the heads of the Justice Department and, you know, the news anchors, everybody else.
[17:55.760 --> 18:00.760]  Why is it if you're not gay, you can't get a job?
[18:00.760 --> 18:02.760]  Basically in the modern power structure.
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.760]  I mean, I'm just laying the truths out here.
[18:04.760 --> 18:06.760]  They're so obsessed with it and want to push it out there.
[18:06.760 --> 18:08.760]  I'm sick of it. I'll just, I'll just bring it all out.
[18:08.760 --> 18:13.760]  I mean, I personally have heard just about enough of all of it and it makes me disgusting.
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.760]  Makes me absolutely want to throw up how fake these people.
[18:18.760 --> 18:20.760]  Nancy Pelosi has come out on Valentine's Day and said,
[18:20.760 --> 18:22.760]  why would anybody want to get married?
[18:22.760 --> 18:26.760]  Yeah, just have a couple kids and we'll get that video for later.
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.760]  Have a couple kids and then just give them over to the state.
[18:30.760 --> 18:33.760]  What a witch like woman.
[18:33.760 --> 18:37.760]  Nancy, another stamping turtle Pelosi.
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.760]  She's courting the singles demographics this Valentine's Day.
[18:42.760 --> 18:44.760]  Yeah, pitching that it's not popular to have kids.
[18:44.760 --> 18:49.760]  Let me tell you something, women and men, women don't want to have kids till they're 35
[18:49.760 --> 18:52.760]  and they want to do one thing after that and that's have kids.
[18:52.760 --> 18:56.760]  And then by the time they're 40 and haven't had kids, they go crazy and they got to have kids.
[18:56.760 --> 19:02.760]  So keep, keep, keep thinking you're on the winning team because you're running around,
[19:02.760 --> 19:09.760]  never having kids, women, you only get sexier after you've had kids and you only get smarter.
[19:09.760 --> 19:11.760]  And I'm not trying to push people having kids.
[19:11.760 --> 19:12.760]  That's your decision.
[19:12.760 --> 19:14.760]  But why do we have all this anti-child stuff?
[19:14.760 --> 19:18.760]  It's because the globalists have plenty of third world populations.
[19:18.760 --> 19:22.760]  They're ready to bring in to replace you and that's what's really going on here.
[19:22.760 --> 19:23.760]  All right, that's enough for me.
[19:23.760 --> 19:26.760]  I am a little bit dingy as they say.
[19:26.760 --> 19:31.760]  Just getting over my fever last night, but I am coming back strong.
[19:31.760 --> 19:32.760]  Coming back strong.

[19:46.760 --> 19:49.760]  And just stacks of NSA news.
[19:49.760 --> 19:52.760]  Second amendment news.
[19:52.760 --> 19:56.760]  Oh, by the way, the government's now laid the groundwork publicly to take your 401k and IRA.
[19:56.760 --> 19:59.760]  Well, that was coming light years back.
[19:59.760 --> 20:01.760]  My husband's the gun guy.
[20:01.760 --> 20:03.760]  I've just never felt comfortable with them.

[24:26.760 --> 24:36.760]  I've seen trouble all my days.
[24:36.760 --> 24:38.760]  I just want to get this out there right now,
[24:38.760 --> 24:41.760]  that I really want to tell everybody out there who loves liberty,
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.760]  and loves justice, and loves freedom,

[24:53.760 --> 24:56.760]  And as sappy as that is, that's why I said it,

[25:12.760 --> 25:14.760]  Wow, where to start?
[25:14.760 --> 25:16.760]  Where to begin?
[25:16.760 --> 25:18.760]  I mentioned this article,
[25:18.760 --> 25:21.760]  government lays groundwork to confiscate your 401k and IRA.
[25:21.760 --> 25:23.760]  This is happening.
[25:23.760 --> 25:25.760]  That's in a Reuters article,
[25:25.760 --> 25:27.760]  that's up on InfoWars.com.
[25:27.760 --> 25:29.760]  Pretty big deal.
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.760]  Pretty big deal to have quotes like that right out of Reuters.
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.760]  And we've just got so much more.
[25:34.760 --> 25:36.760]  I've got to get to all this.
[25:36.760 --> 25:39.760]  But first off, I thought I'd just play you more ridiculous lies
[25:39.760 --> 25:41.760]  from Obama, the king of lies.
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.760]  Really, he makes Bill Clinton look truthful.
[25:44.760 --> 25:47.760]  You almost could call Obama the father of lies,
[25:47.760 --> 25:50.760]  but we know he's only the son of lies.
[25:50.760 --> 25:53.760]  Think about Pelosi coming out and saying,
[25:53.760 --> 25:55.760]  I don't get married.
[25:55.760 --> 25:57.760]  Just like attacking everything.
[25:57.760 --> 26:00.760]  I was in the coffee room during the break, getting some coffee.
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.760]  And Biden was on C-Span.
[26:05.760 --> 26:07.760]  He was saying, look,
[26:07.760 --> 26:10.760]  it doesn't matter our education scores are dropping.
[26:10.760 --> 26:13.760]  Our children question the status quo.
[26:13.760 --> 26:17.760]  And we're going to bring down the old system to build the new.
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.760]  And everybody in the audience of Democrats knew what he was talking about.
[26:21.760 --> 26:25.760]  He says, you've got to bring down the old system to build a new one.
[26:25.760 --> 26:28.760]  I mean, I literally clowered and piven quote.
[26:28.760 --> 26:31.760]  That's why I told him, hey, we got a DVR on there.
[26:31.760 --> 26:32.760]  Back that up.
[26:32.760 --> 26:35.760]  Record C-Span to the C-Span TV.
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.760]  There's a couple of them in there, but I want that clip.
[26:39.760 --> 26:41.760]  Super creepy.
[26:41.760 --> 26:43.760]  That's newsworthy, by the way.
[26:43.760 --> 26:46.760]  If you take the clip about, you know, our test scores,
[26:46.760 --> 26:47.760]  we criticize those.
[26:47.760 --> 26:50.760]  Well, at least our kids question the status quo.
[26:50.760 --> 26:56.760]  And people think the holy grail is, you know, culture and what's been in the past.
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.760]  Well, I'm not saying we should not innovate, but this is an innovation.
[27:00.760 --> 27:02.760]  This is going back to enslavement.
[27:02.760 --> 27:04.760]  And they know it, you know, oh, don't be married.
[27:04.760 --> 27:06.760]  Don't have kids.
[27:06.760 --> 27:09.760]  Live in a tiny apartment so you can pay us more tax money.
[27:09.760 --> 27:10.760]  Don't have a car.
[27:10.760 --> 27:12.760]  Don't have air conditioning.
[27:12.760 --> 27:15.760]  If you live in Africa, lower your expectations because we want everything
[27:15.760 --> 27:18.760]  for ourselves to politically control you.
[27:18.760 --> 27:21.760]  I mean, that's their stated goal.
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.760]  And they're selling it like it's sexy on a high ground.
[27:24.760 --> 27:25.760]  Come on.
[27:25.760 --> 27:27.760]  How courageous they are to do this.
[27:27.760 --> 27:30.760]  I was in there for like three minutes during the break with my mouth hanging open.
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.760]  Just looking at Biden.
[27:32.760 --> 27:34.760]  But I'm now digressing.
[27:34.760 --> 27:35.760]  Here's candidate Obama.
[27:35.760 --> 27:38.760]  This is an article up on info wars.com right now.
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.760]  I will reverse biggest problem of executive views of power.
[27:42.760 --> 27:48.760]  He said no signing statements, five days to read the bills, no lobbyist.
[27:48.760 --> 27:56.760]  He just, I don't know, executive power grab five times Bush.
[27:56.760 --> 27:58.760]  I mean, it's amazing.
[27:58.760 --> 28:01.760]  Everything he said he'd do, he did the opposite.
[28:01.760 --> 28:04.760]  But people who are still Democrats are bought into it.
[28:04.760 --> 28:05.760]  It's like he's their guy.
[28:05.760 --> 28:07.760]  So you're trying to put down their guy.
[28:07.760 --> 28:09.760]  Let's go to that clip of El Presidente.
[28:09.760 --> 28:12.760]  I taught constitutional law for 10 years.
[28:12.760 --> 28:15.760]  I take the Constitution very seriously.
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.760]  The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to do with George Bush
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.760]  trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.760]  and not go through Congress at all.
[28:25.760 --> 28:31.760]  And that's what I intend to reverse what I'm president of the United States of America.
[28:31.760 --> 28:33.760]  Well, there you go.
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.760]  Now, you know, who would you want to kill somebody with a knife?
[28:38.760 --> 28:40.760]  You had to hire somebody to do it.
[28:40.760 --> 28:45.760]  You'd hire a thoracic surgeon, maybe.
[28:45.760 --> 28:47.760]  And that's basically what they do with Obama.
[28:47.760 --> 28:49.760]  He's a constitutional lawyer.
[28:49.760 --> 28:55.760]  So he knows how to slit the throat of the carotid arteries and the jugulars
[28:55.760 --> 28:57.760]  better than anybody.
[28:57.760 --> 29:00.760]  And he does know exactly what he's doing.
[29:00.760 --> 29:05.760]  And now has put his whole agenda into hyper warp drive.
[29:05.760 --> 29:09.760]  It's a short segment, but when we come back, I've got a long segment.
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.760]  I'm going to get into government-laced groundwork to confiscate your 401k, read those quotes.
[29:14.760 --> 29:18.760]  Also, report government success in immigration court drops.
[29:18.760 --> 29:24.760]  Well, you know, more than half of the illegals that go to immigration court are being let go.
[29:24.760 --> 29:27.760]  And then Obama does blanket amnesty of most people anyway.
[29:27.760 --> 29:29.760]  So it's just, it's all by executive power.
[29:29.760 --> 29:31.760]  That's in AP.
[29:31.760 --> 29:33.760]  And we're going to get more into the super winter storm.
[29:33.760 --> 29:35.760]  A little warming.
[29:35.760 --> 29:37.760]  Monopolizing the internet.
[29:37.760 --> 29:39.760]  Comcast gobbles up.
[29:39.760 --> 29:41.760]  Time Warner.
[29:41.760 --> 29:45.760]  We're also going to get into 44 die from swine flu in Egypt.
[29:45.760 --> 29:47.760]  A bunch on the NSA.
[29:47.760 --> 29:49.760]  And just a bunch of other really important news.
[29:49.760 --> 29:51.760]  We're on the march.
[29:51.760 --> 29:53.760]  The empire's on the run.
[29:53.760 --> 29:59.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.760 --> 30:04.760]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[30:04.760 --> 30:10.760]  and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[30:10.760 --> 30:12.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[30:12.760 --> 30:13.760]  Fluoride.
[30:13.760 --> 30:15.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[30:15.760 --> 30:18.760]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[30:18.760 --> 30:21.760]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[30:21.760 --> 30:24.760]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[30:24.760 --> 30:30.760]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase
[30:30.760 --> 30:33.760]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[30:33.760 --> 30:35.760]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[30:35.760 --> 30:42.760]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[30:42.760 --> 30:47.760]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[30:47.760 --> 30:52.760]  Infowars Life Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[31:59.760 --> 32:01.760]  The facts are in. The studies are legion.
[32:01.760 --> 32:05.760]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[32:05.760 --> 32:09.760]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[32:09.760 --> 32:13.760]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[32:13.760 --> 32:18.760]  It's simple. Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[32:18.760 --> 32:22.760]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet,
[32:22.760 --> 32:24.760]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[32:24.760 --> 32:30.760]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLine fluoride shield formulation,

[32:38.760 --> 32:40.760]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[32:40.760 --> 32:45.760]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[32:57.760 --> 32:59.760]  That's infowarslife.com.
[32:59.760 --> 33:08.760]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[33:08.760 --> 33:34.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:34.760 --> 33:38.760]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[34:04.760 --> 34:16.760]  Talk about Pavlovian.
[34:16.760 --> 34:18.760]  What is Pavlovian conditioning?
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.760]  It's just basic animal psychology.
[34:22.760 --> 34:24.760]  It's very effective on humans as well.
[34:24.760 --> 34:29.760]  You ding a bell for a few weeks, couple times a day before you feed dogs,
[34:29.760 --> 34:39.760]  and then you can start ringing the bell and the dogs will begin to salivate without even the smell of meat.
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.760]  And that's what the system has basically done.
[34:43.760 --> 34:47.760]  And a good example of Pavlovian conditioning is having the police come in and drills
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.760]  and teach the kids to put their hands up and to go get on the school buses if they're terrorists
[34:52.760 --> 34:55.760]  or to have you go through the TSA and be groped and ask questions.
[34:55.760 --> 35:04.760]  You are Pavlovian-ly being conditioned to be integrated into a prison state into a system of oppression.
[35:04.760 --> 35:06.760]  That's a Pavlovian example.
[35:06.760 --> 35:14.760]  The crew gave me, for my birthday, this coffee cup that is basically,
[35:14.760 --> 35:17.760]  it looks like a handgun going into a coffee cup.
[35:17.760 --> 35:22.760]  And I noticed this morning I got some coffee in it because it was one of the clean coffee cups.
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.760]  And every time I raised it to take a drink for the first time in my life,
[35:26.760 --> 35:32.760]  taking a drink of coffee was very unnerving and very unpleasing.
[35:32.760 --> 35:40.760]  That's because, A, I would never take a handgun unless I was going to pull a trigger to get my finger anywhere near the trigger.
[35:40.760 --> 35:46.760]  But I would take a coffee cup and put my hand around the handle, and the handle is a trigger.
[35:46.760 --> 35:48.760]  So very unnerving.
[35:48.760 --> 35:51.760]  In fact, physically makes me sick to drink this.
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.760]  And I'm glad you guys bought it for me because it's a nice gift and I like it.
[35:57.760 --> 36:05.760]  As a way to illustrate Pavlovian conditioning, but I'm not claiming I'm some gun master, a gun safety king,
[36:05.760 --> 36:12.760]  but growing up shooting so much since age four and shooting 410 shotguns since I was age four,
[36:12.760 --> 36:19.760]  and then shooting high caliber rifles about the time I was six,
[36:19.760 --> 36:22.760]  and being able to shoot bullseye at 300 or 400 yards at the time I was about nine.
[36:22.760 --> 36:25.760]  Like, I'm not as good a shot now as I was when I was like nine years old.
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.760]  The senses are just so crisp and so on.
[36:29.760 --> 36:32.760]  And I love shooting so much when I was younger. It was just so magic.
[36:32.760 --> 36:35.760]  I still like it, but nothing like when I was a kid.
[36:35.760 --> 36:44.760]  And I just have such gun safety and gun awareness, sight awareness of don't aim a gun in anybody's direction.
[36:44.760 --> 36:47.760]  Don't put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to pull the trigger.
[36:47.760 --> 36:53.760]  Certainly don't get a gun up in front of your face.
[36:53.760 --> 37:00.760]  And I took a photo of my judge pointing his M4, but I stuck the cell phone out to get a shot like down the barrel and clicked it that way.
[37:00.760 --> 37:05.760]  And of course the gun was, he just shot 30 rounds and it was empty and we checked it before we did it too.
[37:05.760 --> 37:09.760]  But the point was even doing that, it was only for cinematic purposes.
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.760]  And I probably should have had the remote control on it or something just to be technical.
[37:13.760 --> 37:15.760]  Don't get in front of the barrel of a gun.
[37:15.760 --> 37:25.760]  But I'm telling you, it is, it is bizarre to like put this gun up to my mouth.
[37:25.760 --> 37:31.760]  Probably name that the video on Prison Planet TV.
[37:31.760 --> 37:34.760]  A gun to the mouth.
[37:34.760 --> 37:40.760]  And by the way, all this tyranny, people are deep down scared of what's going on.
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.760]  They have a feeling of unsettling concern.
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.760]  They know the system's corrupt. They know it's predatory.
[37:47.760 --> 37:54.760]  But that's subconscious. The subconscious mind is much more powerful.
[37:54.760 --> 37:58.760]  The conscious mind just knows that there is anxiety.
[37:58.760 --> 38:02.760]  The government says, yes, that anxiety is al-Qaeda.
[38:02.760 --> 38:08.760]  Even though you have a better chance of dying from a deer jumping out in front of your car being stung by a wasp or honeybee separately.
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.760]  Wasp kill more people every year than terrorism in the U.S.
[38:12.760 --> 38:15.760]  Honeybees kill more per capita. This is each group.
[38:15.760 --> 38:21.760]  Yellowjackets kill more people each year by themselves than terrorism.
[38:21.760 --> 38:29.760]  But our entire way of life is being changed by the political class completely transparently to dominate and control in the name of it.
[38:29.760 --> 38:32.760]  Total social conditioning.
[38:32.760 --> 38:43.760]  And now they admit homeland security is for the American people and their new enemy is gun-owning, returning veterans, libertarians, conservatives.
[38:43.760 --> 38:46.760]  Who they have the military openly training for war with.
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.760]  And that should be a huge wake-up call to everyone out there.
[38:51.760 --> 39:04.760]  When Bush was doing some light persecution of Democrats banning free speech, putting into free speech zones of the RNC and things, I went and decried it.
[39:04.760 --> 39:06.760]  I went and almost got arrested.
[39:06.760 --> 39:08.760]  I remember some of my crew arrested.
[39:08.760 --> 39:15.760]  They arrested some of my guys when I was in a separate area than them.
[39:15.760 --> 39:17.760]  And I knew we'd get arrested. I figured.
[39:17.760 --> 39:20.760]  So that's why I say, you know, I basically got us arrested going down there.
[39:20.760 --> 39:21.760]  Rob do got arrested.
[39:21.760 --> 39:23.760]  I've been arrested before.
[39:23.760 --> 39:29.760]  Actually, I forgot I was arrested that time in New York, but I wasn't arrested as part of the RNC deal.
[39:29.760 --> 39:30.760]  That was days before.
[39:30.760 --> 39:32.760]  See, I forget it all blurs together.
[39:32.760 --> 39:35.760]  I've been arrested quite a few times demonstrating.
[39:35.760 --> 39:40.760]  I was protesting media propaganda when I got arrested in New York.
[39:40.760 --> 39:43.760]  And our Aldo Rivera was doing an outdoor deal.
[39:43.760 --> 39:45.760]  And notice where Aldo Rivera doesn't dislike me now.
[39:45.760 --> 39:48.760]  He says he admires me on and off air before and I've been on his show.
[39:48.760 --> 39:51.760]  He's been on this one all because I did go bullhorn him.
[39:51.760 --> 39:54.760]  All because I did go get arrested.
[39:54.760 --> 39:56.760]  You're like, wouldn't he hate me?
[39:56.760 --> 39:58.760]  He was flipping me off at the time.
[39:58.760 --> 40:01.760]  And well, as people are saying, they were going to kick his ass.
[40:01.760 --> 40:03.760]  It wasn't me saying that.
[40:03.760 --> 40:07.760]  So like any red-blooded guy, he said, oh, really, I'll climb out of this thing after the thing.
[40:07.760 --> 40:08.760]  If you think you're going to do that.
[40:08.760 --> 40:10.760]  And I looked up for Aldo Rivera.
[40:10.760 --> 40:13.760]  He does have a history being a scrapper in New York.
[40:13.760 --> 40:16.760]  Arrested for that and other things as a political activist.
[40:16.760 --> 40:20.760]  But the whole point is, is that's the animating contest of liberty.
[40:20.760 --> 40:22.760]  That's what life is all about.
[40:22.760 --> 40:32.760]  And I've digressed off into Bush and how I protested him some and got arrested for violating free speech.
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.760]  And then Obama does it.
[40:34.760 --> 40:43.760]  And I have articles, mainstream articles where Democrats go, hey, forget, you know, going after the IRS for targeting the Tea Party and pro-life and Christians.
[40:43.760 --> 40:46.760]  We want you to go after a more get rid of them.
[40:46.760 --> 40:48.760]  They should be illegal.
[40:48.760 --> 40:54.760]  Just like the governor of New York said, if you're a pro-life or a gun owner, get out of the state, quote, you're not welcome here.
[40:54.760 --> 40:55.760]  You're not what New York is.
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.760]  We define how is that liberal?
[40:59.760 --> 41:01.760]  Liberalism is about real tolerance.
[41:01.760 --> 41:03.760]  Liberalism is about living let live.
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.760]  Liberalism is about giving you as much of your money and the right to live your life as you see fit.
[41:08.760 --> 41:10.760]  I'm for drug decriminalization.
[41:10.760 --> 41:12.760]  I'm for national sovereignty.
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.760]  I'm for low taxes.
[41:16.760 --> 41:18.760]  I'm for having a small government.
[41:18.760 --> 41:21.760]  I'm for having local control.
[41:21.760 --> 41:23.760]  I'm for having labeling on products.
[41:23.760 --> 41:24.760]  You know what you're eating.
[41:24.760 --> 41:25.760]  Is that liberal or conservative?
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.760]  No, that's liberal.
[41:27.760 --> 41:31.760]  But not in the liberal context of the modern liberal.
[41:31.760 --> 41:48.760]  These are nothing but moral high ground people in a confidence game that are corporate con artist technicians whose opposition is a bunch of corrupt blue blood country club idiot Republicans who are owned by the same special interests that are busy destroying our entire future and our civilization.
[41:48.760 --> 41:54.760]  Also, they can be king of the hill.
[41:54.760 --> 41:58.760]  King of a pile of horsemen are.
[41:58.760 --> 42:03.760]  I'd rather be a third of the way down the hill or at the bottom of the hill in a wondrous free market.
[42:03.760 --> 42:14.760]  Quasi utopia of adventurism and trailblazing and celebrating femininity celebrating masculinity.
[42:14.760 --> 42:18.760]  But celebrating all forms of art and culture the entire spectrum of it.
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.760]  That's real liberalism is celebrating humanity.
[42:22.760 --> 42:24.760]  Not saying it's all screwed up.
[42:24.760 --> 42:26.760]  The government has to tell it what to do.
[42:26.760 --> 42:30.760]  And then the government people are the worst of the worst of the worst.
[42:30.760 --> 42:39.760]  Kleptocratic narcissistic power tripping scum.
[42:39.760 --> 42:41.760]  I think Mark Moreno is on a 1230 right.
[42:41.760 --> 42:44.760]  Yeah, so we'll open the phones up so I can go up at the end of the hour into the next hour.
[42:44.760 --> 42:48.760]  I've already thrown a lot of news items, but I want to get your take on all of it.
[42:48.760 --> 43:00.760]  We're going to do first time callers again today. The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-8259-9231.
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.760]  And I'm not trying to sound like Bill Clinton today.
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.760]  My I've got a little bit of a lung infection small one.
[43:09.760 --> 43:18.760]  I think down in the bronchi where the windpipe splits off and you know how it is.
[43:18.760 --> 43:22.760]  It scratches and itches and you want to cough, but then that distracts the whole show.
[43:22.760 --> 43:25.760]  It's like a Lay's potato chip.
[43:25.760 --> 43:27.760]  Once you eat one, you can't stop.
[43:27.760 --> 43:30.760]  So why start coughing?
[43:30.760 --> 43:33.760]  But I could do a really good Bill Clinton today with my voice this shot.
[43:33.760 --> 43:39.760]  I was absolutely listening here. I have never lied to anybody in my life.
[43:39.760 --> 43:44.760]  The reason I keep bringing Bill Clinton back up, regular listeners know we hardly ever talk about Bill Clinton.
[43:44.760 --> 43:54.760]  But I feel like I'm 22 years old again on talk radio and Bill Clinton is in office and I'm marveling in all the crimes and how he got away with them.
[43:54.760 --> 44:03.760]  And then like a demonic jack in the box or a new moon that pops up every cycle, we're now faced with the fourth administration.
[44:03.760 --> 44:11.760]  No, no, no, the fifth administration because you had Hillary and Bill, the co-presidency one and two.
[44:11.760 --> 44:18.760]  Now you've had two presidencies of obozo, almost two, you know, one and a half.
[44:18.760 --> 44:20.760]  So that's three and a half.
[44:20.760 --> 44:27.760]  Now you've had two presidencies that they get Hillary in. That's five Clinton cycles.
[44:27.760 --> 44:32.760]  I mean, this is really becoming like some North Korean ascension ritual or something.
[44:32.760 --> 44:34.760]  And so I'm just seeing Hillary everywhere in the news.
[44:34.760 --> 44:38.760]  And then every time I see her, all the crimes pop up in my head.
[44:38.760 --> 44:44.760]  There's Kurt Nemo's article, Hillary Clinton's unethical dishonest behavior should be fair game during presidential race.
[44:44.760 --> 44:47.760]  Republicans need to begin work now on taking your down.
[44:47.760 --> 44:59.760]  You have Ammo for the job. Yeah, but as long as you step and fetch and go along with these crooks, they won't set you up when they get back in power with the IRS or their hit teams or whatever.
[44:59.760 --> 45:02.760]  I'm on their enemies list. I know that it's come out in the news.
[45:02.760 --> 45:10.760]  And we're all on their enemies list. You don't get anywhere going along with these people, but the Republican leadership again are paid for by the very same special interest in many cases.
[45:10.760 --> 45:12.760]  And so they won't go after her.
[45:12.760 --> 45:21.760]  They will let them sit there and persecute anybody who is right of Stalin using their political paradigm.
[45:21.760 --> 45:30.760]  I mean, all I once did I have you shut down all the power plants and shut down all the factories we've got left and totally got the country so we can live under your hellish rule.
[45:30.760 --> 45:38.760]  I mean, you people really want misery and evil. You're a plague.
[45:38.760 --> 45:47.760]  I think I kind of think about the Democrats is like I think about, I don't know, maybe glaucoma or something.
[45:47.760 --> 45:55.760]  It's not even a hatred. It's like a disease you're scared of and went out of your life and family that has glaucoma, you know, basically gone.
[45:55.760 --> 45:59.760]  I'm pretty much blind from it.
[45:59.760 --> 46:02.760]  And that's what it's like. They're spiritually blind. They're like a disease.
[46:02.760 --> 46:10.760]  It's like, oh, Katie bar the door. May that day not come. And it's just like it just keeps coming and coming and coming.
[46:10.760 --> 46:22.760]  I mean, I'm looking at a photo of Michelle Obama right now. She is so flamingly evil and hateful and demonic looking.
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.760]  I mean, she just looks like an evil vampire in a movie.
[46:26.760 --> 46:33.760]  You hear how beautiful she is every day and walk to the grocery store. She's in all the women's mags and I'm just so sick of it.
[46:33.760 --> 46:37.760]  You put snakes on her head, man. It's Medusa.
[46:37.760 --> 46:41.760]  And I don't just go off of how she looks. It's just like, that's what I'm telling you.
[46:41.760 --> 46:45.760]  It's like Joe Salante says politics is a showbiz for ugly people.
[46:45.760 --> 46:55.760]  And that's what it is. It's these ugly, culturally ugly people, spiritually ugly people, politically ugly people who I know are crooks who want to bankrupt the country
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.760]  and their own words to take over society. And I can't get them out of my lives.
[47:00.760 --> 47:04.760]  You know, I can tune into what I want to tune into. Most of the time I can go watch movies I want to watch.
[47:04.760 --> 47:09.760]  I can read what I want to read, but I've got to cover politics. So I'm so I remain somewhat free.
[47:09.760 --> 47:19.760]  So I'm forced in this contest to know about these people.
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.760]  Unbelievable. All right. You know, I'm ranting and there's news to cover and I apologize.
[47:23.760 --> 47:34.760]  I've been digressing here today. Let's just start where I said I would start government lays groundwork and confiscate your 401k and your IRA.
[47:34.760 --> 47:41.760]  This is happening is the quote. That's from Max Slavo up on info wars.com.
[47:41.760 --> 47:48.760]  He does a great job boiling down a zero hedge article out of a Reuters story.
[47:48.760 --> 47:54.760]  And it says as noted by zero hedge, there's no longer turning exclusively to central bankers.
[47:54.760 --> 48:02.760]  So we print money as needed because last year's bank bail in forced the confiscation of funds from an average depositors.
[48:02.760 --> 48:11.760]  A 40% I should add working as well in Cyprus as the regulators and bankers have determined that they'll use a similar method to fund the future endeavors.
[48:11.760 --> 48:15.760]  And they go on and I've been telling you this forever because they've done this in every other third world country.
[48:15.760 --> 48:22.760]  And the globalists when they leaked the documents in 2002 and Joe Stiglitz when public had economists with the World Bank.
[48:22.760 --> 48:31.760]  That there's a plan to do this to the Western world to then make us politically bankrupt and financially bankrupt for good.
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.760]  And now they're moving with the bank regulations, everything for that and the conditioning.
[48:36.760 --> 48:48.760]  And we as a society need to say no to them actually taking money out of your 401k or out of your IRA or out of your bank account.
[48:48.760 --> 48:53.760]  And as I always told you to quote stabilize the system and keep it safe.
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.760]  And they take it and then they take 20, 30% up front and they go but we stabilized it.
[48:58.760 --> 49:01.760]  And then they'll run the market back up and don't go back up a little bit.
[49:01.760 --> 49:08.760]  And so now the president said then over the next decade, this has been done in every third world country, they take everything.
[49:08.760 --> 49:11.760]  You're just happy to be getting something.
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.760]  And the reason I do exactly what they would do is they've done this hundreds of times.
[49:16.760 --> 49:22.760]  Sometimes four, five, six times the last hundred years per third world country they control.
[49:22.760 --> 49:25.760]  So this will happen if we don't say no.
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.760]  That's what the armored vehicles, the machine guns, the helicopters, the data mining are.
[49:30.760 --> 49:34.760]  That if you try to get in the way of this, they're going to arrest you and say you're a terrorist.
[49:34.760 --> 49:37.760]  I mean, come on police and military everybody.
[49:37.760 --> 49:40.760]  We all know who the real terrorists are.
[49:40.760 --> 49:44.760]  Okay, we know who openly says they want a bankrupt is to make us controlled by them.
[49:44.760 --> 49:52.760]  If you're in the system and you serve this, it's like helping the Soviets take over Poland or the Ukraine or the Czech Republic.
[49:52.760 --> 49:57.760]  I mean, you're really, you're really on the bad guy team.
[49:57.760 --> 50:00.760]  There's a lot of propaganda out there saying you're good guys.
[50:00.760 --> 50:04.760]  There's a lot of missions you do that are good missions, but it didn't matter.
[50:04.760 --> 50:06.760]  You still are working for bad people.
[50:06.760 --> 50:10.760]  And look, I'm not about everybody for the bureaucracy, you name it.
[50:10.760 --> 50:15.760]  When I pay the fake taxes to the IRS, knowing they're a mafia that could literally break my legs,
[50:15.760 --> 50:18.760]  because I want to be able to choose my battles and keep getting the word out.
[50:18.760 --> 50:20.760]  I know I'm contributing to our destruction as well.
[50:20.760 --> 50:22.760]  I'm not judging you police that stand the corrupt system.
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.760]  Why, frankly, I hope good cops stay in and can put up with it so there can be some good people on there down the road.
[50:27.760 --> 50:29.760]  But I mean, it's just, let's just all admit it.
[50:29.760 --> 50:31.760]  We're all contributing to our own destruction.
[50:31.760 --> 50:32.760]  Listen to this.
[50:32.760 --> 50:33.760]  This is our Reuters.
[50:33.760 --> 50:43.760]  In a nutshell, Reuters reports the savings of the European Union's 500 million citizens could be used to fund long-term investments to boost the economy
[50:43.760 --> 50:46.760]  and help plug the gaff left by banks since the financial crisis.
[50:46.760 --> 50:48.760]  See, the banks create it, they get your money.
[50:48.760 --> 50:55.760]  And it goes on, the solution is not just in Europe, but here, to mobilize more personal pension savings for long-term financing,
[50:55.760 --> 50:59.760]  the document said, from the EU, and the Federal Reserve, it concurs.
[50:59.760 --> 51:03.760]  You've been hearing about the amazing benefits of Heart and Body Extract for many years.

[54:30.760 --> 54:38.760]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:38.760 --> 54:40.760]  I was busy printing off this article.
[54:40.760 --> 54:44.760]  I almost didn't make it in the chair in time before the bumper ended.
[54:44.760 --> 54:51.760]  Expert Iran ships a dry run for later nuclear EMP attack to humiliate Obama.
[54:51.760 --> 55:03.760]  Again, I've been anti-Iran war folks, but Iran, after all these peace overtures, is really trying to stir stuff up with video showing Tel Aviv being attacked, U.S. aircraft carriers being attacked.
[55:03.760 --> 55:16.760]  They're the chairman joint chief saying that they have the power with sleeper teams to wreak havoc all over the West in non-conventional warfare and says the U.S. doesn't know that.
[55:16.760 --> 55:18.760]  I mean, give me a break.
[55:18.760 --> 55:26.760]  The U.S., the people running this country wrote the book on evil and double twisted quadruple crossing.
[55:26.760 --> 55:29.760]  That's why they put the moolas in power in 79.
[55:29.760 --> 55:30.760]  Look it up.
[55:30.760 --> 55:32.760]  It's been partially declassified.
[55:32.760 --> 55:38.760]  Criminal elements of Western governments kick the shaw out and put the moolas in there.
[55:38.760 --> 55:41.760]  And I'm not saying they run them.
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.760]  I'm saying they're making deals with them.
[55:44.760 --> 55:48.760]  I guarantee you that they've got to now play the part of the devil.
[55:48.760 --> 55:51.760]  And it's very sophisticated what's going on.
[55:51.760 --> 55:58.760]  Or they think with the peace overtures that the West is weak and are pushing it with megalomania, really asking for it.
[55:58.760 --> 56:01.760]  And more and more, I think that might be it, actually.
[56:01.760 --> 56:03.760]  That might be it.
[56:03.760 --> 56:08.760]  Like Hitler, you know, he's already losing against the West, so he turns into Russia with Operation Barbarossa.
[56:08.760 --> 56:11.760]  I mean, that Napoleon Bonaparte did the same thing.
[56:11.760 --> 56:17.760]  So maybe it is just the mania, because, you know, I look at the globalists, they're losing on many fronts right now.
[56:17.760 --> 56:21.760]  They've been winning so long they were ahead of us, but we're gaining quickly.
[56:21.760 --> 56:23.760]  Free humanity is.
[56:23.760 --> 56:26.760]  And I look at how they act all crazy and full of arrogance.
[56:26.760 --> 56:30.760]  The Iranians just may be out of their minds.
[56:30.760 --> 56:33.760]  So the Iranians continue to act like this.
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.760]  I'm going to wash my hands because I've really tried to stop war over there.
[56:38.760 --> 56:45.760]  I've tried to stop the attack on Syria, and it's come out in the London Telegraph that infowars.com is used by talking points by Assad.
[56:45.760 --> 56:48.760]  I'm not bragging, it's almost embarrassing, but the truth is the truth.
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.760]  We understand the politics, the level of that these governments are actually looking at what we say.
[56:53.760 --> 56:55.760]  I know the Iranians listen to me.
[56:55.760 --> 56:57.760]  They invite me on their state run TV every day.
[56:57.760 --> 57:00.760]  I say no, because I'm busy and, you know, just quite frankly, I just can't handle it.
[57:00.760 --> 57:04.760]  And now, you know what, I want to go and press TV.
[57:04.760 --> 57:05.760]  You want me to come on?
[57:05.760 --> 57:07.760]  I'll tell you what I think about this.
[57:07.760 --> 57:13.760]  Because I go and I look this stuff up, and this is not Israeli propaganda.
[57:13.760 --> 57:25.760]  I've seen Israeli propaganda when the last president of Iran would make statements like, you know, we need to wipe the Zionist regime off the political map,
[57:25.760 --> 57:28.760]  and they would translate it to, we need to blow Israel up.
[57:28.760 --> 57:30.760]  Didn't exactly say that.
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.760]  Trying to get war going.
[57:32.760 --> 57:39.760]  And it's not that I just like Israel, I just, I looked at the way the breaks are here, like in a pool game, this is not good for anybody.
[57:39.760 --> 57:41.760]  That's why our Joint Chiefs didn't want to war with Iran.
[57:41.760 --> 57:43.760]  It doesn't have good outcomes for anybody.
[57:43.760 --> 57:45.760]  It just goes from bad to worse.
[57:45.760 --> 57:54.760]  And then I look at their Supreme Commander saying they got sleeper cells and America's dumb, and they can look, the globalists pray you release sleeper cells.
[57:54.760 --> 58:00.760]  They're going to be able to take over the entire system and get rid of all our liberties and concentrate the economy in their criminal hands.
[58:00.760 --> 58:10.760]  If you people think America backed off because they're weak, and then you go start something, idiots, you are, you're idiots.
[58:10.760 --> 58:16.760]  You're either playing a double game with the New World Order, with this rhetoric, or you've gone megalomaniac.
[58:16.760 --> 58:19.760]  All I care about is stability in the future.
[58:19.760 --> 58:21.760]  And rule of law.
[58:21.760 --> 58:24.760]  I want to have grandkids, you morons.
[58:24.760 --> 58:30.760]  Let me tell you, Iran, since they got this peace deal, have been acting like absolute crazy people.
[58:30.760 --> 58:31.760]  Whatever.
[58:31.760 --> 58:33.760]  That's just very upsetting, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:33.760 --> 58:35.760]  Very upsetting.
[58:35.760 --> 58:40.760]  We'll be right back, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.

[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.760]  CBS Features Futurist
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:58.760]  Promotes Paranormal Phenomenon of Telepathy, Telekinesis, and Mind Reading as a Climate Expert.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.760]  Blaming record cold on global warming.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.760]  So he's going to be joining us and the lead singer of corn is going to be on as well.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.760]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls as promised.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.760]  Darren in Tejas, you're on the ear.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.760]  Hello Alex, how are you doing?
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.760]  I'm all right.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.760]  I'm calling about the Steve Sotlin campaign.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.760]  We've got to defeat Coran, Coran funded Obamacare.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:31.760]  He also voted this week along with the Trader Mitch McConnell to give unlimited spending to Obama for the next year through 2015.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760]  Raising the debt ceiling.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.760]  We have to defeat who?
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.760]  We need to defeat John Coran.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.760]  I was talking about Senator Coran, yes.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.760]  Yes, Senator Coran basically.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:49.760]  He needs to be defeated here in March 4th primary, Republican primary.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.760]  He has these ads going.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.760]  He goes, I have guns, you have guns.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760]  We like guns.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760]  Vote for me.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.760]  Now he's definitely a rhino.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.760]  Who would you like to see in there other than John Coran?
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760]  Steve Stockman.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.760]  Steve Stockman currently is a congressman from Texas.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:16.760]  I know, he's a great guy and he gets the full endorsement of a lot of groups I like like Gunners of America.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.760]  He has never voted to raise the debt ceiling.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.760]  By the way, they've now voted to make it basically unlimited until March 2015.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:33.760]  But you know, oh wait a minute, Obama says raising the debt doesn't raise the debt.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.760]  Now are you racist, sir?
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.760]  I guess I must be.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.760]  I'm not blasphemous, but that's what Jamie Foxx calls him.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.760]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.760]  Yeah, we got to get rid of John Coran and get rid of all the Republican neocons that are saying, be nice Tea Party.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.760]  Be nice libertarians while they try to raise record money with the Democrats to beat the Tea Party.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.760]  Let's go to Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.760]  You're on the air.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.760]  First time caller.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.760]  Welcome.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.760]  What are you doing, Alex?
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760]  Doing all right, brother.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:15.760]  What I'm concerned about, I was on the LaRouche PAC activist conference call last night.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:26.760]  Yesterday Congress passed 362 to two with some votes, you know, not being coming forward.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  But Walter Jones was one of the two.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:36.760]  I think there was another Republican from Kentucky that voted against this.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:52.760]  Now what this was was a resolution in support of the George Soros bunch of protesters that are attempting to attack the Ukraine.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  Exactly. And it's not like we're saying side with Russia, but the EU wants to suck Ukraine dry and move weapons in to start a fight with Russia.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760]  And that's immoral.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760]  And yes, I know they had that resolution in Congress.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.760]  That's disgusting.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:19.760]  This is a declaration of war essentially against Russia and the LaRouche people are working for the impeachment of Obama.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.760]  Now, when am I getting LaRouche or his wife on?
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.760]  They wanted to come.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.760]  They're on next week.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760]  Get them out.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.760]  Get them out for Pete's sake.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.760]  We are on the cusp of nuclear war.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.760]  I know.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.760]  I know.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760]  Okay.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.760]  And it could break out any number of spots.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.760]  Okay.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.760]  No, no, that's what's crazy.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760]  That's what's crazy.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.760]  Recap your thoughts about you because it is every mainline analyst says we're in more danger now in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.760]  This time it's not the Soviets who are the overall bad guys starting everything.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.760]  Our government run by a bunch of Wall Street crazy guys that'll make 400 to one bets like John Corzine did.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:25.760]  These guys are crazy.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.760]  We're going to be back with another video.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.760]  I'm going to talk about the best thing about the most powerful organic herbs.

[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.760]  I don't know the specific questions. Again, I don't know what happened.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.760]  Well, either you know or you don't know.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:44.760]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know when. I don't know. I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:53.760]  I did not know. I don't know what you are going to ask me. I didn't know. Technically, I don't know. I don't know.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:03.760]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:20.760]  But they are openly persecuting the Tea Party big time. Any conservative or libertarian group, pro-life groups, you name it, they're all being persecuted by the, I don't know, criminal justice department caught committing so many crimes openly, it makes my head spin.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:31.760]  So, back to your calls with Bill and Art and Terry and Lee and Mike and so many others, 800-259-9231, first time callers.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.760]  We're taking your calls here today, now into the second hour.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:46.760]  This is some of the news breaking up on InfoWars.com. Right now, US Army builds fake city in Virginia to practice military occupation.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:53.760]  Martial law training. Trainer at Acre Town would include sports stadium, school, underground subway.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:07.760]  Well, Paul asked that question. It's all over the news. The US Army admits their main threat is Tea Party insurgents, and he links to the West Point training manuals in the InfoWars.com article.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:20.760]  And of course, the National Guard training, DrudgeReport.com, carried it this week. It was all over the news. Training to quote, take on the Tea Party when they use bio weapons to attack because they're pro-second amendment supporters.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.760]  So, you're like, yeah, but that doesn't have any basis in reality. It's called the demonization campaign.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.760]  They had a political open persecution. They're already using the IRS and everything on people. I mean, we're in trouble.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:42.760]  A lot of folks are like, well, I better go voice an Obama flag. When they've gotten rid of their opposition, they're going to go after everybody, including their moron idiot supporters.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:49.760]  That's the way this works. They hate their moron supporters even more than they hate those of us that oppose them.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:58.760]  People better study history. Those of you who think you're on some winning team serving this. Amazing. I want to send reporters to cover that. That's interesting.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:13.760]  Oregon police give nightclubs, ID scanners to determine customers, identities and age. I love how I've seen this for 15 years or more where they'll card an old woman buying pipe tobacco for her husband or a six pack of beer at the drug store.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.760]  And I always go, oh, why are you doing that? Well, we have to swipe it. State police like it when we do that.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:30.760]  The Texas Department of TB. I said, what's it called? What's the alcohol department called? T ABC. Yeah. So it's like, well, we just better swipe everybody.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:38.760]  Because first it was if you look under 21, we card you then it's look under 30. We card you now it's like old man on a walker. We're going to card you.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.760]  And then now you go in to get stuff at the drugstore over the counter. Oh, we're going to swipe your card. Oh, it goes into database.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:53.760]  And then it's all shared under Obamacare all given to everybody. Why do we ever have privacy to begin with?
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:03.760]  By the way, Sean Parker is in the news. I met Sean Parker billionaire Sean Parker helps the war hates the world.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:19.760]  He helped create. I'm going to read that article. It just came up on Forbes. I got up on four words dot com. I'm going to see exactly what he's talking about. That is a guy jumping up and down running around wild.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.760]  I got to read this guys print that for me please. Thank you. So we're going to be talking about that.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:35.760]  But my point is, is that you go now to a bar anywhere. Oh, let me just swipe your card to get in here. That's to create metadata on everywhere you go.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:43.760]  It's not enough that they're tracking your cell phone in real time marking where you went. It's not enough they're watching over cameras and watching over your own home computer.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.760]  That's all admitted now. It's all completely illegal. Now they're just putting these systems in everywhere to politically dominated.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:13:01.760]  No, you know, they've got legislation introduced to have kill switches, which are already in the phones, by the way, but have the power to turn everybody's cell phone off in the city, a state you name it so they can't communicate all the
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:13.760]  technocracy takes over or while the elite get their money out of the banks. This is a totally one sided no checks and balance nightmare system that's being built right now.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:20.760]  So there's that story. Police blame bar owners for not knowing law after getting caught pushing them into surveillance program.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:31.760]  Police in, how do you say that? Multanoma County cliently suspended a new data mining program this week after local news people began questioning its legality.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:44.760]  Last several weeks, police have issued ID scanning devices to clubs and bars all throughout Portland's old town neighborhood. The scanners only captured customers personal data, including names and photos, but uploaded all the information to police database.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:55.760]  And when the cops got caught, they went, oh, it's an accident. It's just meant to check and make sure you're of age. That's total bull after receiving a three year alcohol abuse reduction grant.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:03.760]  They found out how much you're drinking and give it to the insurance companies. They're rewarded $60,000 to obtain the police run scanners for multiple drinking establishment.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:14.760]  And then of course they force everybody to do it. Despite Oregon law placing strict limits on storing and sharing information from ID scanners, specifically police were persistent in getting local bars to comply with the program.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.760]  Yeah, right. I love it. Gotta love it, man.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:27.760]  That's because the cops are compartmentalized too. A lot of the cops actually don't like this. So they're like trying to enforce that it not get all your data.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:35.760]  You're compartmentalized. They don't want you knowing all the data is being sent. Okay, the globalist want to just set the precedent for all this.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  Belgium socialists get ready to okay child euthanasia. Children will be required to tell psychologists they understand what euthanasia is.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.760]  Now, the states can be able to convince your five year old they want to die and then they'll kill you.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:54.760]  And they're going to make the culture ugly enough where you're going to want to die.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:04.760]  Monopolizing the Internet, Comcast gobbles uptime Warner. Imperium in Imperio will govern your Internet connection. There can be only one.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:13.760]  Competition is a sin, said the Robert Baron John E. Rockefeller is maximum a rule of conduct for large corporations for well over 100 years.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:22.760]  We'll soon govern how you receive your Internet signal and how much you pay for it. That's right. Many areas of the country you only have one Internet provider.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.760]  The old powerful Comcast who censored us many times.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:38.760]  Homeland Security to activate nationwide license plate data recognition database and are encouraging police and other citizen spies to take photos of license plates and feed them into Homeland Security's database.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:45.760]  They had this up 20 years ago. Folks are just letting slaves know about it now. That's up on info wars.com.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.760]  I'm going to stop right there and go to your phone calls. Finish your point, sir. You were bringing up the resolution last week by Congress.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:59.760]  That was the huge number. I forget the vote. Guys, pull up congressional resolution supporting Ukrainian demonstrators.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:11.760]  And again, my issue is the Soros groups running it to overthrow the country to move missiles in against Russia, which is an act of war, which is getting involved in somebody's politics.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.760]  And it's very, very dangerous. Go ahead and make your point.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:29.760]  Yeah, Alex. What this does is, you know, give them the opportunity or give that not Obama, the opportunity, you know, to use thermonuclear war.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:41.760]  When do Republicans and Democrats agree on anything? The NDAA. I mean, this is the kind of stuff where we have so called bipartisan cooperation.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:50.760]  We don't need that. Every time they do that, it's future destruction of a liberty or blowing up the world.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:17:01.760]  The other thing I want to comment on what you said about Iran, because take a look at the fact that in the United States, we have different factions.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:13.760]  Neocons have been beating the war drums for years on Iran. And I would assume the same thing goes on within the country of Iran.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:27.760]  We have ships off their shores. Why is that okay? But if they say they're going to bring a ship off of our shores, everybody gets excited about it.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:34.760]  You know, this may be just playing to their own domestic situation there in Iran.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:40.760]  Well, listen, listen, listen, listen, I have really tried to stop an attack on Iran and that's on record.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.760]  And I want to be clear, their chairman of their joint chiefs came out two weeks ago.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.760]  And I didn't just believe the Israeli papers. I went and looked it up on the Farsi on the Iranian.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:57.760]  And I saw it in English-speaking press TV and said, you know, they better not start something with us. We've got sleeper cells inside their country.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.760]  That's just inviting the globalists to stage stuff and then use that against Iran.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:08.760]  And Iran has been putting out promo videos, blowing up Israel, attacking the U.S. interests.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:19.760]  I'm saying the U.S., the globalists running the U.S. have been dealt a defeat overthrowing Iran's ally, Syria, who's doing nothing and really being positive and trying to have peace.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.760]  They're good guys compared to Iran. I don't support a lot of what the Mullahs do.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:30.760]  And so my issue is they should be de-escalating stuff now that the sanctions are being taken off.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:36.760]  Okay, why say they'll blow us up? Why put the videos out? Why say they'll attack the aircraft carriers?
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:45.760]  And all this rhetoric, when the West is going into a conciliatory motion?
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.760]  Well, you know, it's red meat for their population. The other thing that, you know-
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:57.760]  But I don't even agree with that because the most their population likes the U.S. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:08.760]  I think Netanyahu is as nuts as Obama. I think he wants destabilization throughout the entire Middle East. And we see it.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.760]  I don't think there's any question. I don't think there's any question that Netanyahu-
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.760]  To mop up all of these up, you know, these-
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.760]  No, I hear you. I got to go. I appreciate your call. But what I'm trying to say here is-
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:27.760]  I don't have any doubt that Netanyahu or his interest do want to destabilize the Middle East.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.760]  And I think that's a bad policy to try to destabilize people's here on top of them.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.760]  And that's actually the U.S. policy, vulcanization, breakup, destabilization. I don't like it.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.760]  That's what I'm saying. Iran's got the same kind of policy as Israel does. That's what I said last week about all this.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.760]  And I agree. They all will use it domestically to try to crack down and take liberties.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.760]  I mean, if the West attacks Iran, that'll keep the Moodles in another 20, 50 years.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.760]  Maybe a hundred. And I just don't like authoritarianism of any stripe.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:22.760]  And I just wish we could be friends with Iran. That's what I'm saying.

[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.760]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.760]  But not all silver is equal.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:14.760]  Supernatural silver is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.

[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:48.760]  I want to go back to your phone calls, but I've got some really amazing news that just came in that's going to tie in to Mark Moreno joining us in the next segment.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:55.760]  Here it is, one in four Americans unaware that Earth circles sun.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:04.760]  I bet money that Mark Dice could go out in LA and that three out of, I mean, and by the way, he doesn't edit that except for cutting out the spaces.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:13.760]  He really shows you, you know, that nine out of 10 say put gun owners in camps, kill them, put anyone who was in a communist in a camp, kill them.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.760]  This is the Democrats, the most mindless, dumbest people in America.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.760]  And I'm just sorry, it's true.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.760]  I bet in Austin, in a trendy area, two out of four won't know the Earth circles the sun.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:36.760]  But you need to ask it like, we have to sign a petition because the Earth, due to global warming, is causing problems to the sun orbiting us.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:43.760]  So we will just sign a petition to have a stop global warming because it's changing the sun's orbit of the Earth.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  And if you ask it like that, I bet three out of four.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:53.760]  If you said we need to sign a petition to regulate the sun orbiting the Earth for Obama, that's how the question would be asked.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.760]  I bet three out of four trendies.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.760]  If you did it in front of like Democratic Party headquarters, I'm not joking, would actually sign the thing.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.760]  If you said for Obama, we need to have taxes to help the sun orbit the Earth better, they will sign.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.760]  The key is for Obama.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:15.760]  For Obama, we're going to put all conservatives in slave labor camps, and we're going to kill them.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.760]  And people in English go, good.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.760]  You see, you want to kill them, they go, you don't have to tell me, buddy, I want to kill them.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  And they're like, nah, they go, hmm.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.760]  So these are good people.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760]  These are the liberals.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.760]  These are the open-minded people.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.760]  But it shows some hope that only one out of four doesn't know the Earth, orbits the sun.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.760]  I mean, I thought Copernicus, you know, had that figured out.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.760]  Let's talk to Art in Nebraska.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760]  You're on the air.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760]  Go ahead.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.760]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760]  I'm doing all right.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.760]  I know I want to utilize my time quickly here.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.760]  I just want to say that I've recently started waking up and I've been using most of my free time to try and get educated.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.760]  I just figured out, like a week ago, that 9-11 wasn't in that job.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.760]  It's like, oh my God, you know, that's not cool.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.760]  That kind of pisses me off.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.760]  Oh, no.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760]  We kind of got some bad people running things.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  Yeah.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.760]  I mean, so I'm just trying to get caught up on everything.
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.760]  And I'm the type of guy that is very vocal when I get going.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:18.760]  And on something like, for example, one of the questions I had for you is, do you have any talking tips or where do I start or begin?
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.760]  There's so many things to talk about, like when I get on talk radio.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.760]  I mean, what do I bring up?
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.760]  And then number two, what about me?
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.760]  I'm looking at all this stuff.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.760]  I watch your program.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  Everything is on the internet.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760]  I mean, am I being stupid?
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.760]  What do I need to do there?
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:38.760]  And I also wanted to comment that, yeah, the New World Order, they're scared of guns, all right, pointed at them.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.760]  That's the problem.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.760]  The two holy grills, the way I see it, is them taking our guns and our internet so they can take our money.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.760]  And our privacy so they can then gain the whole political system against us.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.760]  Well said, let me try to give you my answer to your first question.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760]  It's a big deal.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:28:02.760]  You can take any topic, national or local talk radios covering and cover the topic, give them your take on it, not lie to the screener.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:09.760]  And then add to it that, well, yeah, you know, Obama is becoming a dictator.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:17.760]  But the problem is the very same offshore special interest that are tax exempt on the Republicans as well.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.760]  So what do we do about monopoly capitalism getting rid of our real capitalist system?
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.760]  That's what you don't cover on conservative talk radio is the other side of it.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.760]  That's why we can't get Democrats to join us and get out of this paradigm is because they see the hypocrisy of the Republicans.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.760]  So the two hypocritical systems prop each other up because folks think that's the only choice.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.760]  And that's an example.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.760]  Or let's say they're talking about the city going bankrupt.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:46.760]  You call them saying, well, why did we double the cost to treat the water when, you know, they've done all this just so that we get bought out by foreign interests.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.760]  We need to get the floor right out of the water, blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  Any topic you can hijack.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:59.760]  Now, as for the Internet, I think it's good if you have the time and the energy to try to protect your identity from because there's hackers.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.760]  There's government people.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:01.760]  There's data miners.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:10.760]  Everybody should try to get basic, well known certified systems that protect your identity, protect your information that have good histories of trying to protect their data.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.760]  Big box stores, big banks, they're the worst government.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.760]  It's the worst sieve.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.760]  And then the worst things get they want more of our data and more proof of who we are, which only makes it worse.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.760]  So the answer is keep cash in the equation as well.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.760]  But at the same time, politically, I wouldn't be scared of them knowing who you are.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:38.760]  I would politically be very open because we need to show other people that liberty is popular, that freedom should be re legalized because good hides in plain sight.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.760]  Evil, you know, tries to hide in the dark.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:46.760]  So it's very important that we not be secret agent-esque about what we're doing, but that we be out on the open because we're the good guys.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.760]  We're the leaders.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.760]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.760]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.760]  We'll be right back with them sandwiched.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.760]  We're seeing global warming this winter.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:21.760]  And is it true that Obama hung the moon?
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.760]  I'm extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:41.760]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.760]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.760]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:36.760]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:41.760]  U.S. Army builds fake city in Virginia to practice military occupation.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:45.760]  That story is up on infoawards.com. It's the middle column of dredgerport.com as well.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:52.760]  Marshall Law Training, 300-acre town includes Sports Stadium School Underground Subway.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:01:01.760]  U.S. Army has built a 300-acre fake city complete with Sports Stadium School and Underground Subway in order to train for unspecified future combat scenarios.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:09.760]  The recently opened site is located in Virginia and was built at a cost of $96 million, taking just two years to complete.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:16.760]  Although the city was extensively built to prepare U.S. troops for occupation of cities abroad, some will undoubtedly fear the real intention will be closer to home.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:23.760]  Although the site includes a mosque, the town looks like an American sitting in every other way with the signs in English.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:34.760]  The fact that a telegraph reports the subway carriages even carry the same logo as the carriages in Washington, D.C. could suggest the site was built to both double as a foreign city and as a mock domestic town.
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:39.760]  Well, the whole military's training is their main mission domestic, so, and their enemy being a tea party, so.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:54.760]  According to Colonel John P. Tkosky, this is the place where we can create what we can come up with solutions for problems we don't know we have yet. This is where we'll look at solutions for the future, material solutions and non-material solutions,
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:02:02.760]  anything from how you're going to operate in a subterranean environment to how you dismount a Humvee to avoid IED strike.
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:14.760]  The increasing demonization of domestic political groups is extremist, has prompted numerous scenarios where commentators have suggested the U.S. Army and National Guard personnel can be needed to quell civil unrest.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:21.760]  This is a very, quote, fairly written article by Paul. I'm not criticizing our writer, but to the point of almost absconding with the truth.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:31.760]  This is all for domestic operations with a separate dual training operation internationally. The whole thing is geared up for us domestically, the bullets, the training, the manuals, the...
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:39.760]  And that's official National Guard announcements, quote, preparing to crush a tea party rebellion, and then the gun owners are going to attack and all this.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:55.760]  In a 2012 academic study about the future use of military as a peacekeeping force within the United States, written by a retired Army colonel, depicted a shocking scenario in which U.S. Army is used to restore order in a town that's been seized by a tea party insurrectionist,
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:09.760]  close, quote. The study dovetailed a leaked U.S. Army manual which revealed plans for military to carry out civil disturbance operations, including confiscating firearms, quelling riots, mass civil unrest, and, quote, how we would be reeducated.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:17.760]  This is on the Army's website, folks. I'm not making this up. They even used the Soviet term. So it's a good article. He gets into all the meat at the end, and I guess it's very journalistic.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:28.760]  He writes it as if it could be two different things, but we know what it is. So at a certain point, it's like this is modern journalistic thing where you don't say...
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:42.760]  It's like a red fire engine pulls up. You go, the fireman claimed it was a red Ford fire truck they were driving, and it said Ford on it, and it was red, and it had chrome all over it, and there was a Dalmatian sitting in the back.
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:55.760]  Then I watched it turn on its sirens and ride down the road and spray water on stuff. I mean, it's just Army times everything, 24-7. Yes, brigade homeland. Yeah, we're going to take your guns.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:03.760]  You know, in the confiscating guns in New Orleans for like two weeks, people didn't believe me when I was on air playing local newscast.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:13.760]  Now everybody knows that happened, but the issue is there's this denial right up front that has to stop. And I'm not criticizing Watson.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:24.760]  I don't have time to call up and give him pointers when I'm off air, not that I have all the answers. He gives me a lot of pointers as well. It's just that all of us, all of us, this is what is happening, myself included.
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  The tyranny is so naked now that we've almost got tyranny fatigue where we're just so used to it now that we're like, well, we guess it could be for some good uses.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:43.760]  Obviously, they need to know how to disbound a Humvee for IED attack or how to land a helicopter in an area where it doesn't have IEDs. You know, don't land where it's a good landing spot, that's the rule.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:58.760]  Land 100 yards away randomly. Land where it's hard to land. I mean, you don't do that in a mock city in English with Washington, D.C. sides. While you're training for domestic war and all your manuals, and then you say, oh no, it's not for domestic.
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:27.760]  Up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media, a removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.

[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:15.760]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:21.760]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:30.760]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use. You've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:35.760]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:41.760]  Strategic relocation third edition by Joel Scowson when disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:56.760]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event. Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios. Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our info war possible.

[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:06.760]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda. They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:15.760]  They are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:31.760]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.

[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:48.760]  Generals gathered in their masses. Just like witches at black masses. Evil minds that plot destruction. Sorcerer of death's construction.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:57.760]  Spiking my veins. Jonathan Davis is the lead singer of corn, one of the big rock bands out there.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:03.760]  We saw the video and thought it was really great. Listeners sent it to us and they said, man, it looks like they're awake to what's going on.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:19.760]  They're dealing with a paradigm shift and we contacted them and it turns out they are familiar with our work and we're happy to come on so we're going to get the lead singer on.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:34.760]  Let's play a little bit of the music video for radio listeners and TV viewers who are watching on prismplanet.tv. We'll play the whole thing once he joins us.
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:50.760]  The MSN secretly tracks telephone and data on the Internet. Our fourth program.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:25.760]  We put the whole thing later. Great music. Folks, this is extremely powerful and a big deal because this is a frontal assault on their main vehicle, Obama.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:36.760]  And that doesn't mean the Republican leadership is good either. John Boehner and all them are just as bad or worse. The issue is, is that Obama's been a very effective evil like Cynthia McKinney has said on the show.
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:46.760]  He's not a lesser of two evils. He's a more effective of evils. And because it makes it trendy to do all this evil.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:11:01.760]  And the video is just amazing how it exposes the just anti-human pro-evil garbage that's being sold as a wonderful thing. So that's coming up as soon as we get his, his and our Skype working together.
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:11.760]  That happens sometimes. Right now, let's go to Tray in Alabama and we'll go to Mike and Brenda and everybody else. Tray, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.760]  Hey, what's going on Alice?
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.760]  Worldwide broadcast. Good to have you on.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:28.760]  I wanted to talk about the bankers, the elite bankers that have basically thrown themselves off buildings the past, I think it was last week. You've had like five top ones the last two weeks and dozens of other mid-level ones.
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:31.760]  I think they're being killed, but what do you think?
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:49.760]  Personally, I don't know if it has to do with they know something that's coming that we don't or they found something out or it's like in 29, you know, or the stock market crash that happened before that, you know, people bankers were throwing themselves off buildings.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:12:02.760]  See, I could lose everything I've got and I would be happy. I don't understand people that commit suicide because they lose everything. I just don't get that. I mean, these guys aren't losing everything yet, though.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:13.760]  That was the mid-level folks in 29. And I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm trying to war game the sound here. It was the people that lost everything and were in debt who committed suicide over the embarrassment.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:19.760]  It wasn't the insiders who got even richer. I think they're getting rid of people that know where the bodies are buried.
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:30.760]  Yeah. Now, possibly could it have any connection to the global reset that everyone's talking about that could be coming up because nobody wants our dollar anymore, you know?
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:31.760]  I don't know.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:37.760]  Yeah, but if these guys have millions or billions of dollars, why don't they just tap out, get out, move to Switzerland like everybody else does?
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:41.760]  Right. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense for what you're saying.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:51.760]  Well, it's like Matt Drudge said two weeks ago in the corporatist media, the dinosaur media, literally on his last legs and, oh, look, he's implying you should leave as if we're in a tyranny.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:13:06.760]  Let them eat cake. And it just shows how out of touch they are. Anybody who studies basic history knows we're sitting on top of a powder keg with about 100 burning sparklers falling from the sky right now.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:12.760]  And I don't know when it's going to blow up or how it's going to blow up, but it's a question of not if but when. Anything else?
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:25.760]  Well, see, you got that thing that we got to keep our eyes on that Lindsey Graham said when the news came up missing, that's one thing that has me very worried when he, I think he came out too early.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:37.760]  That was going to be their little, you know, announcement point link before they do something about blowing up, you know, Charleston or New York, you know, you remember Lindsey Graham statement or do you remember that?
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:44.760]  Oh, yeah, I remember in CBS News at a press conference hours after we reported the missing nuclear weapons.
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:14:02.760]  Yeah. And see, I don't know, like the people say, you know, Iran has the ships out in our close to our waters or whatever. It would just be really convenient for American city to get new to draw us into Iran or to hell.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:13.760]  I mean, like 9 11, we could pretty much attack anybody out. We wanted to give us exactly, exactly. I mean, I don't think the head of the Iranian military is stupid enough to actually say.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:25.760]  The US doesn't know we have sleeper cells in North America, and they don't know how we're going to strike back against them and then send over some small destroyers as if that means anything.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:36.760]  I mean, just just begging the Empire to destroy them and take our liberties at the same time. And then some listeners think I'm like calling for war with Iran. No, I'm calling for Iran.
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:39.760]  What do you think Iran's up to?
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:51.760]  It doesn't make sense to me because we got nothing out of the deal. I mean, with them, it appears and it just, I don't know, I'm close. I'm puzzled.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:57.760]  Yeah, I'm very rarely puzzled. And I mean, I just, stuff's very serious. I appreciate it.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:10.760]  Right Bart and Tom Clancy and the Rolling Stone guy that we're working on, they were all working together on something. And now they're dead. You know, so.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:18.760]  Well, let me tell you, I'm blessed that I'm not pushing up Daisy. So I hear you. I appreciate your call. Let's go to Mike in Illinois. Thanks for holding you listening on WCKG.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:20.760]  I just heard people are calling from go ahead.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:26.760]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. Just found you on the radio dial about five, six weeks ago. I enjoy your show.
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:27.760]  Thank you.
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:34.760]  Unfortunately, I only get your first two hours. Hey, I don't want to change the subject, but I'm going to bring this up. I'm not sure if you're aware of this.
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:46.760]  I know you're aware of fluoride and aspartame and all that other garbage that they've got in our food and drink. Have you ever heard of a chelation or EDTA?
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  Are you familiar with that?
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:50.760]  Yes, there's a lot of different forms of chelation to get toxins out of your body.
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:57.760]  Okay, well, I was bringing it. The reason I'm bringing it up is I work at a fairly large defense contractor.
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:04.760]  And since Christmas, we've had about five or six of my coworkers have had heart attacks due to blocked arteries.
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.760]  And then, you know, the doctors tell them you got to get this bypass surgery or you're going to die.
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:18.760]  And chelation is so safe and it's so effective that there's a lot of countries where it's actually illegal for the doctors to do that bypass surgery.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:21.760]  So I'm not sure if your audience is aware of that, but I just...
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:26.760]  Sure. Well, I mean, they never tell you that you... Why do you think so many people are having heart trouble where you work?
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:34.760]  Well, yeah. Well, that's a rhetorical question. But, you know, I mean, it's over a couple thousand employees.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:43.760]  So statistically, it's probably not significant. And again, most of these guys are in their late 40s, early 50s, early 60s.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  So it's probably around the time that those kinds of problems are going to show up. But it just...
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:55.760]  It's a shame that more people are not aware of it as an alternative to these angioplasties or these bypass surgeries,
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:00.760]  which, you know, have anywhere from a five to a eight or nine percent morbidity rate.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:04.760]  And, you know, chelation is totally safe and it's relatively inexpensive.
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:09.760]  Yeah, they killed Neil Armstrong on one of those surgeries. I appreciate your call. Thank you so much.
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:15.760]  All right. Thank you. Brenda in New Mexico, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:25.760]  I want you to hear something that we got from the county that I left on my answering machine. Are you ready?
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:27.760]  Okay. Well, tell me about it.
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:34.760]  It's one that's asking for us to all get vaccines in our county, for us and our neighbors.
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:38.760]  We've never had this happen before. And one of them is a red alert that we all have to sign up for.
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:43.760]  Yeah, but you don't have to sign up for that. Government, though, is inducing you through contract fraud.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:48.760]  They even have folks under federal grants that come bang on your door and say, time to get your shots.
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:53.760]  And the big farm is actually being paid. It's a big corporate boondoggle.
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:56.760]  And all the statistics show these vaccines are deadly.
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  And again, I'm not saying the science of inoculation doesn't have some merits in history.
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.760]  The problem is you can't trust these big companies. They're putting other stuff in them.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:10.760]  And even a good vaccine ends up lowering your immunity, just like antibiotics do.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:19.760]  And by the way, the good news is after a little bit of pressure, Chick-fil-A is going to stop getting chicken that has antibiotics in it.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.760]  Now, would you like to hear this, though?
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  Yeah, yeah. In fact, you could scan it and send it to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:33.760]  I'm aware it's been going on, but you just said we're required to sign up for this red alert. Tell me about it.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:39.760]  Well, it's an audio. I've actually made a recording of it for you to hear.
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:41.760]  Oh, so it was sent to you over your phone?
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.760]  Yes, sir, and I saved it.
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:50.760]  Yeah, government, I told you, is sending you video, audio, first was text, fair-mongering you, and then literally turning your phone on at night.
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:52.760]  Yeah, go ahead and play the audio.
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.760]  Okay, just a second. Here we go.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:07.760]  No new messages. All message played back.
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:12.760]  Important message for all residents and businesses located in Torrance County.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:19.760]  We have licensed the Code Red Community Notification System to help disseminate important or critical information.

[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:09.760]  That number again is 384-1022. Thank you.
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:13.760]  No, just a second. I have one more for you.
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:17.760]  Sure, sure. And again, first it's missing ladies.
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:19.760]  All message.
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.760]  And then it's missing kids.
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:24.760]  Five, six, seven, eight. Just a second. Here's your number.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:27.760]  I understand. Then let's turn your neighbor in.
[02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:34.760]  This is the Torrance County 9-1-1 Dispatch Center with an important announcement from the New Mexico Department of Health.
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:44.760]  The New Mexico Department of Health in partnership with Torrance County government will be providing flu vaccinations on Friday, February 14th, from noon until 6 p.m.
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:48.760]  at the McLeod Medical Center located in New York, New Mexico.
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:52.760]  The Immunization Clinic is open to the public at no cost.
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:21:01.760]  For more information on the No Charge Flu Shot Clinic, please call the New York Public Health Office at 832-6782
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:07.760]  or the Torrance County Emergency Manager's Office to 464748.
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:09.760]  This is government pushing its services.
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:11.760]  Is this bizarre?
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:12.760]  No, ma'am.
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:14.760]  He would like to hear all that.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:18.760]  No, I would. Go ahead and turn your machine off now and let me just tell you what's happening.
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:20.760]  Okay, just a second.
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:22.760]  Okay.
[02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:38.760]  Yeah, ma'am. They tried this in the 80s. All the new radios in your car, you buy at the store, most of the cost is a chip at them that picks up shortwave or AM from government transmitters that orders it to turn on.
[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:43.760]  Some of them even have a capacitor so it can operate for a time without plug power.
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:45.760]  And then it gives you orders.
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:48.760]  Over your cell phone, you get Obama emails.
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:50.760]  My dad gets them every day. I get them every week.
[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:55.760]  The flashing signs that say we've got an Alzheimer's missing woman.
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:22:00.760]  It all sounds reasonable, but then it can be jacked in to be a political tool.
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:10.760]  You heard it saying, tell your neighbors, give us their data, and in the future it will be, you will arrive at this point or you will be arrested later.
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:17.760]  So this is government now getting into your life, taking over your phones, taking over your computers, data mining you.
[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:22.760]  And using your phone number and information to call up.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:25.760]  This is 911 with an emergency information for you.
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:30.760]  All to again, prepare you to interface with government to be bossed around.
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:32.760]  That's what the TSA is.
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:36.760]  Normal people who aren't criminals aren't supposed to have regular contact with bureaucrats.
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:40.760]  But you're being prepared to literally be bathed in these people.
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:45.760]  And the new work projects during the depression won't be building dams or park sites.
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:51.760]  It will be being part of the title tell squats and reporting on neighbors guns.
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:55.760]  And in all of this has already been done in other countries, in Europe and other places.
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:58.760]  And so this is a takeover plan.
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:04.760]  And it is absolutely authoritarian. They have Walmart's all over the country.
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:11.760]  Where you go up to a robot kiosk and it goes, Obamacare helps you now by healthcare.
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:15.760]  And then it told Jakari Jackson who's got 3% body fat that he was obese.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:20.760]  And it tells people who have low blood sugar that they're diabetic even though they have low blood sugar.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:23.760]  It's total quiet garbage.
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.760]  You go into one of these computers now, my grandmother did.
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:29.760]  And they said, have you had sugary snacks today?
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.760]  Yes.
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:35.760]  And then they said, well, then we can't give you the test for diabetes.
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.760]  Never had it though at 89 or whatever.
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:39.760]  This happened just last year.
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:44.760]  And so still they said, well, the computer says you're diabetic even though you ate sugary snacks
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:49.760]  and the blood test shows that you had a little bit of high blood sugar but it's not diabetes.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.760]  We're just going to go ahead and say you're diabetic, take this pill.
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:57.760]  And then she took the pill and passed out and basically almost died because it took her blood sugar down to nothing.
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:01.760]  And my dad called up the doctor because my dad's a physician and said, you're not supposed to do that.
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:04.760]  You're supposed to do a, I forget the name of the test where they slice up the red blood cells
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:08.760]  and go back over a month to get the real average of the blood sugar.
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:10.760]  They just said, well, we don't do that now.
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:11.760]  We follow Obamacare.
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.760]  So Obamacare, and so my dad took her back to another doctor.
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.760]  No, you don't even have high sugar.
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:19.760]  You're in really good great shape for 89 years old.
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:21.760]  You don't need any drugs.
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.760]  But this is America.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.760]  It's all run by robots.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:26.760]  It's all run by computers.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:30.760]  It's all run by centralized committees and all your data is public.
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:32.760]  And this is the beginning.
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:35.760]  I told everybody forever it's going to start with, you know, there's an old lady missing.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:36.760]  There's a child missing.
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:38.760]  And next is going to be reporting legal guns.
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:45.760]  Well, they now have the images flashing showing a revolver reporting legal guns all over the country, including Austin.
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:53.760]  And the carpet cleaner comes to your house and sees a colt 9-11-45 framed above your bed.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:55.760]  You are going to be SWAT team.
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:57.760]  Doesn't matter the guns completely legal.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.760]  When they get a call, they respond.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:02.760]  They take the guns and you don't get them back.
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:05.760]  And then they, though you'll give your guns back, go to psychological evaluation.
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:07.760]  Well, it's their psychological evaluator.
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:09.760]  And they go, are you mad about your gun being taken?
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:14.760]  Well, yeah, I have no criminal record and it was legal and they pushed my head in the ground.
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:15.760]  I'm upset.
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:20.760]  Well, that's an opposition to authority paranoia in the psychological manual.
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:24.760]  Your guns are all gone and now CPS is going to be there next week.
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:26.760]  They don't even tell you that they go, you can go now.
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:28.760]  Then CPS comes and takes your kids.
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:29.760]  No judge, no jury.
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.760]  You've done nothing.
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:31.760]  Your life's over.
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:32.760]  Hardcore.
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:33.760]  They rule.
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:34.760]  They control.
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:35.760]  Drink your fluoride.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:36.760]  Take your shots.
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:37.760]  Roll over and die.
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:39.760]  Give your kid a shot in the hospital.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:41.760]  Have them convulse right in front of you.
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:42.760]  Never talk again.
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:44.760]  You try to get in that doctor's face.
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:45.760]  Here come cops.
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:47.760]  The cops got brain damage kids.
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:48.760]  Nobody cares.
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:49.760]  We love death.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:50.760]  We're going to get it.
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:51.760]  High tech.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:52.760]  Hell released.
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:53.760]  You want it.
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:54.760]  You got it.
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:59.760]  And yes, those type of garbage alerts are the exact type of thing we're dealing with.
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.760]  Anything else, ma'am?
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:01.760]  That's it.
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:03.760]  I just wanted you to hear it.
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.760]  Thank you so much.
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.760]  I really appreciate you calling in.
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.760]  There goes Brenda.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:10.760]  Lee and Georgia.
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:11.760]  You're on the air.
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:12.760]  First time caller.
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:14.760]  Alex, how's it going, man?
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:18.760]  I'm a little bit out of the weather, but other than that, I'm doing good.
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:20.760]  Hey, I hear your brother.
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:21.760]  Hey, we appreciate you.
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:22.760]  We all appreciate you out here, man.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:25.760]  By the way, happy belated 40 or two.
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:26.760]  Thank you, brother.
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:27.760]  No problem, man.
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.760]  Hey, I've kind of a multifaceted topic here that deals with something that one of
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:37.760]  your callers earlier was talking about, about the mega bankers suicide.
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:40.760]  Yes, I want to hear what you have to say on that.
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:41.760]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:47.760]  How do you think that their debts play into the foreign exchange scandal that's happening
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:49.760]  right now?
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:51.760]  I'll elaborate on that.
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:54.760]  I'll give you my answer.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:27:02.760]  Well, I would just like to get your take on the speculation of how this is going to
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:07.760]  affect the Iraqis and our revaluation.
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.760]  I'm not ignoring you, sir.
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:13.760]  I was talking to somebody that were giving me some information.
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:14.760]  I'm going to call them right back during the break.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:15.760]  I don't usually take calls during a break.
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.760]  I heard your, I heard your question.
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:21.760]  I was going to have you talk some more and then go back to it.
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:23.760]  Look, I don't know why the bankers are dying.
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.760]  There are all sorts of scandals going on right now.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  There are all sorts of things unfolding right now and all sorts of corruption.
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:38.760]  But I believe these bankers are being murdered.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.760]  They're not committing suicide because they don't do that.
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:42.760]  They always run.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:44.760]  Why should they commit suicide?
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:49.760]  And it's always like Comptroller level for the Mafias that are behind the scenes, like
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.760]  something out of the Pelican brief.
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:55.760]  So it's still just speculation, so I don't like to get into it too much.
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:57.760]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:03.760]  Like I said, there's a lot of speculation, especially on the internet about how the
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  Iraqis and ours going to be evaluated.
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:13.760]  A lot of people think that's coming close to time for the denar to, you know, be traded
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:15.760]  as foreign exchange.
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.760]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:19.760]  A lot of people invested in DNR and I told them not to.
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:21.760]  And Iraq is in a mess.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.760]  The oil is denominated in dollars.
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.760]  And they've already inflated the Iraqi currency so much.
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:32.760]  And it's gone up and down that, you know, I don't think bankers are going to be
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:35.760]  killing themselves over the DNR, but I appreciate your call.
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:39.760]  They'd be getting killed over who was involved in derivatives and JPMorgan and
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  all these settlements that they're making right now for all the scams they've run.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:44.760]  Ralph in Texas.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:45.760]  Go ahead.
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:48.760]  You got about a minute and 10 seconds.
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:53.760]  I was just calling about your earlier guest about, I want to say that he's
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  completely wrong about Dr. Michio Kaku.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:02.760]  Dr. Michio Kaku is a really smart theoretical physicist and all those quacky
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:07.760]  things that he's saying about the telepathy and telekinesis.
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.760]  No, no, no, I get it.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:09.760]  No, I get it.
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:10.760]  I get it.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:13.760]  I know he's a serious guy with like string theory and a lot of other stuff he's
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:14.760]  been involved in.
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:17.760]  But but then he does go out in a lot of other theoretical areas that the
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:18.760]  Republicans, humanists are promoting.
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:23.760]  So, so I understand that the point is, is he's not a meteorologist and he's pushing
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:24.760]  global warming.
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:25.760]  I mean, do you agree with that?
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:26.760]  Right.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:27.760]  Right.
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:28.760]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:33.760]  And I just wanted to get to it, you know, just that I tell you what, after our guest
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:34.760]  leaves this rebel, get him on Skype.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  I want to bring you back to make your statement.
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:37.760]  I don't want to just cut you off there.
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:44.760]  I want to hear what your criticism is, but we'll be, we'll be right back on the
[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:45.760]  other side of the break.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:49.760]  I was actually calling one of the guys in the back to bring me some nasal spray.
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:53.760]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:30:00.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:06.760]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:11.760]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:13.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.760]  Fluoride.
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:19.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here in 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:22.760]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:27.760]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record.
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:33.760]  Reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:34.760]  in iodine.
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:36.760]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:42.760]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:47.760]  You'll find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:52.760]  InfowarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:30:54.760 --> 02:31:00.760]  That's InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:05.760]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:08.760]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:13.760]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:15.760]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:17.760]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:21.760]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:26.760]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:28.760]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:31.760]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:34.760]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:01.760]  The facts are in.
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:06.760]  The studies are legion, sodium fluoride, and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:10.760]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:14.760]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:19.760]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:22.760]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet,
[02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:25.760]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.760]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfowarsLife fluoride shield formulation
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:34.760]  using six of the best documented ingredients from around the world

[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:41.760]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:45.760]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:32.760]  Shooter Jenin is bringing us in.
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:37.760]  Monday, Jonathan Davis of Quorn.com is going to be all of this.
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:39.760]  I'm really interested in getting him on.
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:41.760]  I'm glad we contacted him a few weeks ago in there.
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:43.760]  We're ready to come on a short notice.
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:45.760]  Skype is just for whatever reason.
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:47.760]  It happens sometimes, even people we regularly interview.
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:50.760]  It just won't make the connection on two different computers.
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:55.760]  So we will get him on Monday if they're able to work out all those problems.
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:58.760]  Not we'll just get him on via phone, but Skype is more powerful.
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:02.760]  So we'll look forward to that coming up and play that music video on Monday.
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:05.760]  I'll be back this Sunday, of course, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:07.760]  I want to go back to the caller.
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:09.760]  Was that Ralph in Texas?
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:10.760]  I was just talking to him.
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:14.760]  I want to be able to finish this point about Michio Akaku that I was calling Michio Akaku.
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:17.760]  Just being silly folks, you got to have some fun with this.
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:24.760]  And then Roger in Canada and others, the toll free number to join us is 800-25-992-31.
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:30.760]  And then I'm going to get into a video that just went up on infowars.com
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:33.760]  that is excellent and comes from a comedy perspective.
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:37.760]  Some of it's a little bit racy from maybe a 10th grade perspective.
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:43.760]  But it's the folks that made American Dream that great animated 30-minute film.
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.760]  And it breaks it down, so we're going to be...
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:49.760]  In fact, you guys print me off that data sheet on it just so I have it.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  It's video, baby's got a gun, and I'm going to tweak that out at Real Alex Jones here in just a few minutes.
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  And I'm going to play that video that gives you statistics and facts.
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.760]  And it's all about getting people already that are very successful
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:08.760]  and have all these platinum records like corn and others to speak out against the tyranny.
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:13.760]  But it's about getting grassroots filmmakers to make their own films and counter the lies.
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:15.760]  That's what it's really all about.
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:22.760]  And I get that physicist Michio Kaku is a smart guy.
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:27.760]  The point is they couldn't get a regular meteorologist or even astrophysicist on.
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:34.760]  They got a guy on, I read his quotes, about how unusual warm is causing the freeze.
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:38.760]  They even put that in that Al Gore supported movie.
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  It was a fiction. The day after tomorrow, whatever it was, that Art Bell was involved in,
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:45.760]  and the whole world freezes because it's so warm.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.760]  Just give me a break, folks. The sun is the main driver.
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:55.760]  It's about taxes, and the whole carbon tax thing distracts from all the crises in our environment.
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:02.760]  The overfishing, the toxic waste dumping, the toxic pesticides that are being used,
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:06.760]  the chemical fertilizers that don't give you the nutrients you need.
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:09.760]  There's thousands of syrups. The honeybees die.
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:14.760]  But it all comes down to taxing carbon because we're a carbon-based economy.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:18.760]  And I'm not saying oil's great. They've suppressed all sorts of other technology
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:22.760]  by funding the fake green movement, windmills, and all this stuff.
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.760]  I'm sick of them acting like they're the progressives that want humanity to progress
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:35.760]  when they're the Agenda 21ers on record, on record,
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.760]  that say they want to shut down society for the general public as a tool of control.
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:43.760]  I know their internal documents. I know their political writings.
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:46.760]  I know who they are.
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:54.760]  Now, I don't know if Kaku is a bad guy individually,
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:58.760]  but I know that him saying this is global warming is a load of bull.
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:02.760]  So over 17 years, the earth's been cooling.
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:08.760]  Compared to the warming cycle we've had since the 50s.
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:11.760]  And folks, I've read the history books that were written hundreds of years ago.
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:13.760]  It wasn't about global warming. It wasn't about debating.
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:19.760]  It was about, you know, for a 10-year period, the major rivers in England all froze over.
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:22.760]  And then for 50 years, nothing froze over.
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:25.760]  There used to be grapes 1,000 years ago growing in Northern England.
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.760]  And you can't grow grapes there. There's cycles.
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.760]  There was the Hyberium Maxim 10,000 years ago,
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:35.760]  where Northern Europe was like the Bahamas or something.
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:40.760]  I mean, I'm just sick. I mean, it was like 15 degrees hotter or something on average.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:42.760]  It was insane.
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:46.760]  And paying money to the globalist is not going to fix things.
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:54.760]  So that's why we were calling him Kuku and stuff, because he's not Kuku.
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:56.760]  I think he knows what he's doing.
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:58.760]  Now, Ralph, I don't want to just...
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.760]  You tell me what you have an issue with. Go ahead.
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:08.760]  Yeah, I totally agree with you about getting a theoretical physicist to talk about climate.
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:10.760]  I think that's dumb.
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:17.760]  But, you know, the thing would like the Kuki things that he says about telekinesis and telepathy and things like that.
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:22.760]  He's talking about, like, what you say about the advancement in technology
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  and how we'll be able to have portable MRIs that already can take crude images.
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:31.760]  They already have that in the airports as a test 10 years ago.
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:34.760]  No, no, no. I hear you. Go ahead.
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:37.760]  Right. And they'll be able to make a mobile version of this,
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:44.760]  and that's how we'll be able to have a kind of telepathy that he's talking about it.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:50.760]  No, no, listen, listen. They've got studies showing magnetic lines that birds navigate off magnetics,
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:52.760]  and humans have those cells.
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.760]  It's really just science, and people don't under six cents, all of it.
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:59.760]  And so, I don't think that discredits him.
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:03.760]  I actually think he's a really smart guy, and that's why I actually get mad at him when he's saying it's global warming,
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  just because that's like a liberal sacrament.
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:10.760]  And I had some of the crews, like, hey, man, Michio Akaku is a pretty interesting guy.
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:12.760]  Why are you saying that? I was just going along with Moreno.
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.760]  Moreno's just mad at him because he's lying about global warming and not using science.
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:22.760]  And so, he was getting into some of his more theoretical stuff, but I hear you. Anything else?
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:25.760]  Yeah, I think he's just having on the show one more thing.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.760]  I don't know if anybody told you, but this last Austin City Limits,
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.760]  Matt Bellamy from the band Muse gave you a shout-out when he was doing the song Uprising,
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:38.760]  and I just thought it was, you know, the trendies had no idea what he was talking about,
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  but yeah, I turned them on when he gave you a shout-out.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:45.760]  When was this a year ago?
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.760]  It was last October.
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:50.760]  At what event?
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:53.760]  The ACL, Austin City Limits.
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:57.760]  Yeah, ACL. We should dig up his stuff online and find that.
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:02.760]  He's a great guy. On his website, we're like the only link he has on there to politics.
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:10.760]  And then, he'd go on the BBC everywhere and, like, wear InfoWars.com shirts and Terra Storm shirts.
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:13.760]  I don't even care. He's been on the show before.
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:15.760]  One time, I already was in town and gave him a call and he came on.
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:19.760]  It's not that big of a deal, except that I like his music, so I'd like to get him on.
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:22.760]  But hey, that's fine. We appreciate Matt Bellamy giving us a shout-out.
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:26.760]  All right, I'm going to go to this video. I'm going to come back with more of your calls.
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:35.760]  Again, this video is up on InfoWars.com, and it is titled Babies Got a Gun.
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:39.760]  And it's the first tile in the featured news area.
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  When you go up there to the site, if you want to share it with people,
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:49.760]  and it breaks down the reality of gun control, here it is.
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:41:13.760]  The pair of you would like to have the right to have a tank, and you don't agree with this.
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:23.760]  It makes me sick when I hear people say that kind of thing.
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:24.760]  Demand a plan.
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  I know the Second Amendment. What I haven't heard is one coherent reason
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:33.760]  why any civilian in America needs an AR-15 military-style assault weapon.
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:35.760]  Tell me why you need one.
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:36.760]  As a husband.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:37.760]  As a wife.
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:38.760]  As an American.
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:39.760]  As an American.
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:41.760]  As an American.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:47.760]  Over the past four years, fear of a black president has made gun sales shoot through the roof
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  and into the apartment upstairs.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:52.760]  Now, what are these white people so afraid about in the suburbs?
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:54.760]  For the children of Sandy Hook.
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.760]  On the NRA side is also the argument that we must be taking up arms
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:04.760]  in order to potentially fight a military battle against the U.S. government.
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.760]  So it's that argument, and maybe 10% of the population on their side of the argument.
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:09.760]  It's time.
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:10.760]  It's time.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:12.760]  It's time for our leaders to act.
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:15.760]  Demand a plan. Right now.
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:18.760]  You know, coming from Britain as I did,
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.760]  I found a lot of the gun laws in this country incomprehensible.
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:25.760]  Okay. Okay.
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:29.760]  My eyes are bleeding much in the Englishman and his merry band of shorter parents
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:32.760]  play Manchurian candidate with the hearts and minds of the American people.
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:35.760]  What if everything we just heard isn't true?
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:39.760]  What if it's a narrative not based on fact but on irrational fear
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:41.760]  and an overdose of elitist smug?
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:43.760]  As you can see, I'm just a baby.
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:45.760]  Granted, a badass baby.
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:49.760]  But even I know a lie repeated a thousand times is still a lie.
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:54.760]  A badass bloodline has been at war with the lying liars for a long time now.
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:58.760]  My Uncle Batty as the fourth took out the White House trash.
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:42:59.760]  Why not a crook?
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:04.760]  My grandfather, real badass, helped save Private Ryan and the Holy Grail from the Nazis.
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:10.760]  Going all the way back to badass he is the first to defeated the so-called God King.
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:14.760]  Badass babies have been cleaning up history's mess for a long time.
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:17.760]  And now it's my turn.
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:21.760]  Now the blank, blank box talks about guns like they're the six chamber apocalypse
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:23.760]  melted in Satan's workshop.
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:25.760]  But Satan don't use guns.
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:29.760]  He uses trickery, which is why so many believe that guns are the problem.
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:33.760]  We have more guns now than ever and crime has plummeted.
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:36.760]  Parmit des Mois de Repartez.
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:38.760]  French for, let me repeat for you.
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:42.760]  We have more guns, less rules and less crime.
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:44.760]  I know, I know.
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:48.760]  With all the dire headlines screamed by hysteria and his sisters in the press,
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:52.760]  you would think it's modern warfare out there.
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:55.760]  But actually, it's not.
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.760]  The reality is, you're safe internet at almost any time in the modern era
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:02.760]  from getting shot, stabbed, robbed or any other crime.
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:04.760]  Except hoodwinked.
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:05.760]  Hoodwinking is up.
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.760]  Regardless of how you feel, you are safer.
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:11.760]  Why is it that you're safer?
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:13.760]  But you don't feel safer.
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:17.760]  With all this airtime, the press, the politicians fill you with fear and anxiety.
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:20.760]  Which is all meant to show you why you need them.
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:24.760]  If you know you're not in as much danger, then you're not as afraid.
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:27.760]  And if you're not as afraid, you may decide to go play kickball with the kids
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:29.760]  while you queue up some burgers and dogs
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:32.760]  rather than watching CNN or Senator Worthless
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:35.760]  tell you why you should give them more time, money and power.
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:38.760]  As to mass shootings, or mass killings of any kind,
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:41.760]  they have always been extremely rare.
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:44.760]  You have the same chance of being killed in a mass shooting
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.760]  as you do being killed by lightning.
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:49.760]  You walk around scared of a lightning death strike all day.
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:52.760]  If your answer is yes, then I have three terrifying words.
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:53.760]  Bless.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:54.760]  Eating.
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:55.760]  Bacteria.
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:00.760]  You are two and a half times more likely to be eaten to death by a microscopic zombie bacteria
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:04.760]  than you are to get killed by a mass shooter or killed by lightning.
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:06.760]  And forget plane travel.
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:11.760]  You are twice as likely to die in a plane crash as you are by flesh-eating bacteria,
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:15.760]  which is already two and a half times more deadly than getting killed by a mass shooter.
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:18.760]  Five times, let's save on a plane.
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:24.760]  I wonder what the percentage is that I'll die in a fiery plane crash.
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:29.760]  And that's five times larger than my chance of getting killed by a mass shooter.
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:33.760]  And the hysteria over school safety.
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:36.760]  Schools are about the safest place on planet Earth.
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.760]  Again, flesh-eating bacteria, more deadly.
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:44.760]  Here's the most deadly part of you and your kids' day.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:46.760]  You're on your way to meet up with friends,
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:49.760]  but you can't seem to get anywhere quickly.
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:52.760]  You don't want your friends to be annoyed, so you text.
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:54.760]  You're on your way.
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:07.760]  Driving your kid to school is 47,000% more deadly than any risk they may have being at school.
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:11.760]  More rules don't hinder lightning nor do they hinder psychos.
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:16.760]  Gun regulations have had zero impact on mass shootings because psychos don't care about rules.
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.760]  It's wired as psychos.
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:22.760]  And the Joker used a gun, McVay used a fertilizer bomb.
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:27.760]  Andrew Kehoe blew up an elementary school in Bath Township, Michigan in 1927,
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:32.760]  killing 38 children and six adults with a fistful of dynamite.
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:36.760]  The point is, you can't regulate suicidal psychopaths.
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:39.760]  We have always had them, and we will continue to have them.
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:41.760]  Just like cockroaches.
[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:44.760]  I don't know about you, but the idea that I'm just going to sit here
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:51.760]  and bleed at the mercy of some punk till 911 decides to shove and rescue me eight very bad ass.
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:55.760]  A well armed populace keeps the armed and unarmed much safer.
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:58.760]  Not only is it proven by my tsunami of actual facts,
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:03.760]  but also clearly demonstrated by my lady in split screen.
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:05.760]  Now that's bad ass.
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:15.760]  Whether it's a violent gang, a domestic abuser, a rioting mob, or a psychopathic crazy.
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:24.760]  I like my chances much better with the most powerful handgun in the world, or the gun from Predator.
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:30.760]  Payback time.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.760]  Rather than depending on Big Brother to keep me safe,
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:39.760]  I am bad ass baby because reloading is stupid.
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:45.760]  But for the mockers who think government tyranny is off the table, I ask them,
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  isn't it the government holding the leash of that German shepherd
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:51.760]  and pulling the trigger on that fire hose?
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:54.760]  Is it not tyrannist to force people to go fight in a wall
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:57.760]  where you are sprayed with cancer causing Agent Orange
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  while you march from village to village setting the country on fire for no real reason?
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:06.760]  Is it tyrannist to torture, spy, and intimidate innocent people?
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:09.760]  That seems fairly tyrannist to me.
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:12.760]  Giving all the guns to the same people who do this to others
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:16.760]  and expecting that they won't do it to you doesn't sound very smart to me.
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:20.760]  And I'm just a baby.
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:23.760]  If we actually want to lower gun violence,
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:28.760]  we need to end the number one reason people get shot.
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:29.760]  The drug war.
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:34.760]  Forty-three men and six women had their heads, hands, and feet cut off.
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:37.760]  You have five people killed here, three people killed here.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  The heavily armed police now have to attend gang funerals to prevent revenge killings.
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:45.760]  The 12-year-old Fort Worth boy was just standing outside Saturday
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:48.760]  when gunmen sprayed his eastward home with bullets.
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:52.760]  The Portland Triplex was a base for white supremacist gang members.
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:55.760]  You gotta shoot at people, you gotta kill people.
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:59.760]  According to Jester, you name it and they can supply it.
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:02.760]  Crystal cocaine.
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:06.760]  If you ask what supports MS, it's drug trafficking.
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:10.760]  It has 10,000 foot soldiers in the U.S.
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:13.760]  We have 419 people.
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:15.760]  And they've taken all the guns in Mexico
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:17.760]  and they have the highest gun crown in the world.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:18.760]  Pills.
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:24.760]  If you're a radio listener, the video has all the statistics on screen.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:28.760]  And this year, and the cause, rival gangs creating anarchy.
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:31.760]  A six-year-old girl is killed in broad daylight.
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:33.760]  Another girl, seven years old.
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:35.760]  Here I am.
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:37.760]  Shop gifts.
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  Legalization of drugs is not about the drugs.
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  It is about the gangsterism and terrorism
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:46.760]  that is supported by the illegal marketplace in this country.
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:50.760]  Stay peaceful, stay prosperous, and stay free.
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:53.760]  Now what's the baby gonna do to get a drink around here?
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:55.760]  Man!
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:00.760]  All right, folks, there's the video.
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  It's got some more trailer on it.
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:08.760]  The full video is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:10.760]  And it's great to wake up young people.
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:13.760]  A little bit of silliness in there
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  because it's a baby explaining to you how simple this is.
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:17.760]  Showing FBI's own statistics.
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:19.760]  And people always counter that by saying,
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  well, the FBI, I mean, you believe the government, they've been getting those since the 20s.
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:25.760]  It's the most accurate statistics in the world
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:28.760]  because it's gathered locally and compiled nationally and checked locally.
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.760]  By the way, this hour was brought to you by MyPatriotsupply.com

[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:35.760]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:41.760]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:44.760]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:15.760]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:17.760]  Well, the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:20.760]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:24.760]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.

[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:33.760]  Oregon Trail Foods and 30DayFoodSupply.com

[02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:17.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:28.760]  I'm going to put in t-shirts off for 17 years.
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:32.760]  On the back it says politicians love disarmed peasants in full wars.com.
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:39.760]  I literally made it myself on a photoshop.
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:42.760]  That's why it looks so simple but it's actually iconic.
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.760]  There's that shirt. This should be the best seller ever.
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:49.760]  I pretty much designed it but one of our great graphic people come up with it.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:51.760]  The actual look.
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:54.760]  They got one that says infowars.com with a mole on lobby symbol.
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:58.760]  The one that just says mole on lobby with infowars.com on the back.
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:00.760]  I'm really proud of it.
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:03.760]  This version is in kind of a gold.
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:06.760]  We're going to come out with one in gray as well but it's on a black shirt.
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:10.760]  It's available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:15.760]  If you want to find all the made in America stuff go to madein1776.com.

[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:20.760]  We have the new made by U.S. veterans owned by Navy SEAL.
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:26.760]  The 50 caliber bullet that's had the powder taken out that's a bottle breacher.
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:29.760]  Great gift and that goes to support veterans.
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:32.760]  A lot of them, a lot of them actually combat veterans.
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:35.760]  A lot of them wounded and disabled, you name it.
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:38.760]  So it's a good Americana project.
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:40.760]  A lot of these by the way.
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.760]  We're not the only ones that sell these but they're custom and they say 1776 worldwide.
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:47.760]  That's available in madein1776.com.
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  There was a bunch of news I meant to get to that I haven't covered yet.
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:54.760]  But you know in the interest of going to your phone calls,
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:57.760]  I'll do a little bit of overdrive and regroup and cover some of those I haven't had.
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:00.760]  Let's go to Roger in Canada who's been holding patiently.
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:02.760]  Roger, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:04.760]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  I'm doing pretty good, buddy.
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:10.760]  Good. I love you and I love your honesty and vigor.
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:12.760]  And just a few points.
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:16.760]  Matthew Carco, I bought a few of his books.
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:19.760]  I've read them and I have a lot of respect for him.
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:22.760]  And I think you should have him on.
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:25.760]  We're going to reach out to him into a friendly interview.
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:31.760]  That would be great because I think for one thing he's a really accomplished mathematician
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:35.760]  and he's not a meteorologist but I'm sure he can work the data as good as anybody.
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:39.760]  I know, but do you think then global warming is real?
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:45.760]  Well, I'll tell you, I do and I'll tell you why.
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:51.760]  Because there's probably about five billion cars burning fuel in the world
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:55.760]  and you multiply that by the diameter of all these exhaust pipes
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:00.760]  and then all the electric motors and so on they're burning
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.760]  plus all life creates heat on this planet
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:06.760]  and we need it.
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:08.760]  That's not what I'm saying. We need it.
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:10.760]  Now, I am a little nervous.
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:12.760]  We need heat though, that is true.
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:22.760]  Now, the thing is, is there's a very delicate atmospheric, let's say balloon.
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.760]  I know, but they've done the equations. Volcanoes put out a lot more than humans ever could.
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:29.760]  On record, there's a mass ejection in Java right now.
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:32.760]  They're evacuating Indonesia. Here's the issue.
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:35.760]  There's a lot of chemtrailing with geoengineering, the weather modification.
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:38.760]  I'm not saying there's not strange weather here and there.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:42.760]  My issue is how does moving our factories from here to China
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  with their 10 times more dirty literally going to help the atmosphere with one atmosphere?
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:48.760]  Well, I agree with that.
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:52.760]  The chemtrailing though in the last few years here has been horrid.
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:57.760]  In the summertime, every time the sun tries to peek out and there's no clouds,
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:02.760]  they're spraying like crazy. Now, I wonder who's paying that bill, by the way.
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:04.760]  Now, the Department of Energy, we've got documents,
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:07.760]  spends five billion a year on their quote, geoengineering testing.
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:09.760]  I'm out of time for this segment, but I appreciate your call.
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:13.760]  We will get Michio Kaku on. Here it is in Reuters, British police question,
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:19.760]  CNN's Pierre Morgan over phone hacking and they call him a person of interest.
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  I mean, he ran the whole operation from what I know.
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:25.760]  Accused him of that on TV too. I said, when I've read in the British papers,
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:28.760]  he ran the whole operation. Stop acting like you're goody tissues.
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:33.760]  By the way, he has armed bodyguards behind a gated community in LA.
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:37.760]  What a coward. This guy has armed bodyguards.
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:41.760]  He's worth tens of millions of dollars, but you and I, we can't have guns.
[02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:46.760]  You jerk. You punk. You coward.
[02:58:46.760 --> 02:58:50.760]  I kicked your butt on air and you know it, red coat.
[02:58:50.760 --> 02:58:54.760]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:59.760]  While also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:04.760]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:08.760]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:13.760]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:19.760]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:59:19.760 --> 02:59:24.760]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:26.760]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:28.760]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:59:28.760 --> 02:59:33.760]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:38.760]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:41.760]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:50.760]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:59:51.760 --> 02:59:54.760]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.760 --> 03:00:23.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:30.760]  You know, one in four Americans thought that the sun orbited the earth in a new national survey,
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:35.760]  National Science Foundation, and a federal judge has confused the Declaration of Independence
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:38.760]  with a constitution in court ruling.
[03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:42.760]  She said, our constitution declares that all men are created equal, she wrote.
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:45.760]  You know, the judge may have gotten a word wrong,
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:52.760]  but for me and in reading a lot of high level federal rulings from even over 100 years ago,
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:56.760]  the Declaration of Independence is as important as the Constitution.
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:01.760]  It is the founding document and really is the proto-constitution.
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:07.760]  And is the spirit of the law to interpret the federal law that is the Constitution,
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.760]  the big federal law written in all caps, not all this made up bureaucracy.
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:24.760]  Federal judge confused it Thursday night in a court ruling which overturned Virginia's ban on same-sex marriages.
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:25.760]  Here's the issue.
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:31.760]  The ancient covenant of marriage is between a man and a woman.
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:34.760]  Civil unions and stuff, I mean, people, whatever, you can do whatever you want.
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:35.760]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:37.760]  It is an attack on the family.
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:44.760]  It is an attack from the way they're launching it on the institution of marriage and family law and how it's all set up.
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.760]  And that's screwed up as well.
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:49.760]  You don't need to, it's just out of control, folks.
[03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:52.760]  I mean, marriage, all of the world, every culture, they don't know why.
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:54.760]  They don't know how the culture is touched.
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  They go back thousands of years every culture.
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:57.760]  The woman wears white.
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:00.760]  The male tends to dress up all fancy.
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:03.760]  And the father of the woman brings her up.
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:04.760]  I mean, it's tribal, folks.
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:07.760]  This is as ancient as anything humans do.
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:11.760]  Keep your hands off of it, okay?
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:14.760]  I mean, it's that simple.
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:16.760]  It's an attack on an ancient ritual.
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:17.760]  It's our ritual.
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:20.760]  You can go have yours.
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:22.760]  That makes me really get a headache.
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:29.760]  But she did interpret it wrongly to try to say that they can have the same-sex marriages.
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:33.760]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call before I have a coughing fit.
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:36.760]  Terry and Canada, you're on the air.
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:39.760]  Come on down, Terry.
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:40.760]  All right.
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:42.760]  Terry, Terry's punched out.
[03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:46.760]  Let's talk to Dave in Colorado.
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:47.760]  Dave, you're at last call.
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  We have time for sorry, the others.
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:50.760]  Go ahead.
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:51.760]  Hi, Alex.
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:52.760]  Hello.
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:53.760]  Hello.
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:54.760]  I'm Mr. Red.
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:55.760]  I'm sorry.
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:56.760]  Go ahead.
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:07.760]  I just wanted to quickly respond to an earlier caller request for, you know, where should
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:17.760]  he start if you want to start researching the things that you've been talking about?
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:24.760]  And if you don't mind, I just wanted to say that real quickly, I'm a former professor
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:27.760]  of anthropology at the University of Maryland.
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:31.760]  I used to show Terra Storm to my students.
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:32.760]  Oh, wow.
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:41.760]  And also show David Ray Griffin, his University of Wisconsin speech.
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:42.760]  That's excellent.
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:43.760]  You had a lot of courage.
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:44.760]  You getting in trouble for that?
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:45.760]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:56.760]  Certainly, I used to have a band from Homeland Security escort me to and from my job site.
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:03:57.760]  Wow.
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:58.760]  Talk about harassment.
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  One day, one day, I got out of my car in the parking lot at the school and there was a
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:14.760]  litter, it looked like a model plane hovering over my head.
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:20.760]  By the way, about five years ago, the demonstration in DC, they said they saw fake dragonflies
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:22.760]  over them and they went, oh, you're crazy.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.760]  Three years later, they declassified.
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:30.760]  They were real drone dragonflies with video cameras and microphones spying on people.
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:31.760]  So, yeah.
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:33.760]  And look what you went through to tell the truth.
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:35.760]  I wish I had more time to talk to you.
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:37.760]  Closing comments.
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:38.760]  Okay.
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:43.760]  Here are a couple of things I'd like to recommend to get started.
[03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:46.760]  Political Policies by Martha Hagen.
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:49.760]  Editorial States by J. Cutch East Street.
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:52.760]  The Guatemalan military side.
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:55.760]  Hey, why don't you write an article for us even in a known deploying professor?
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:56.760]  Send it to us.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:57.760]  We'll publish it.
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:04:58.760]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:14.760]  Back Sunday, four to six.
