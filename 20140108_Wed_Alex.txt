[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:22.600]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.600 --> 00:27.500]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex today we have an
[00:27.500 --> 00:33.040]  exciting show we're going to be joined from the uk with paul joseph watson jacari jackson
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.400]  is going to be joining us from the west coast of america and we have our own leon macadoo
[00:37.400 --> 00:42.760]  will be on the streets of austin talking to some hunger strikers and if you're in austin
[00:42.760 --> 00:46.640]  you need to show up at twelve thirty that's when she's going to be there show up to show
[00:46.640 --> 00:52.800]  your support for this very important issue you know i'd never paid that much attention
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.320]  to floridation because i was always on well water we had filters because we had sediments
[00:57.320 --> 01:02.880]  but once we moved here to austin the taste is just incredibly bad but it's it's not
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.040]  just the taste it's what's in the in the water that's very harmful for you why should we
[01:08.040 --> 01:14.240]  be forced medicated with floridation why should we have to pay to have this toxic substance
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.240]  dumped in if you want to believe that it's safe and effective and it isn't there's a
[01:19.240 --> 01:24.240]  lot of evidence there's a lot of countries that have taken floridation to stop fordation
[01:24.240 --> 01:29.160]  if you want to believe though that it's safe and effective would you want to put safe and
[01:29.160 --> 01:34.600]  effective medication into the water is that an effective way to deliver dosages you're
[01:34.600 --> 01:39.960]  going to get all kinds of wild variation in the dosages even if it were safe and effective
[01:39.960 --> 01:46.280]  so a dosage for an adult male might be different than a dosage for a child certainly different
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.840]  than the dosage for a fetus and how do you control the dosage that anybody gets when
[01:50.840 --> 01:55.560]  you just dump it into the water this is a very important and vital issue it affects
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.960]  our health and it's something that people on the right really don't seem to be aware
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.560]  of it's really kind of people on the left that kind of follow the food issue a lot
[02:04.560 --> 02:08.840]  more closely than people on the right but you know when you ignore forced medication
[02:08.840 --> 02:14.840]  through floridation eventually they're going to force medicate you with vaccinations and
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.240]  if you still don't understand that eventually they're going to force all kinds of health
[02:19.240 --> 02:24.760]  care on you that you don't want don't need can't afford and call it something like the
[02:24.760 --> 02:29.360]  Affordable Health Care Act Obamacare you know when you don't pay attention to these things
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.360]  in principle what we're talking about here fundamentally is forced medication there's
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.760]  a lot of scientific argument that it's not safe and effective but the fundamental argument
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.280]  here is that it's forced medication and when you accept that premise you open yourself
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.160]  up for being forced to take all kinds of things now some of the articles we're going to be
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.800]  covering today with Paul Joseph Watson we're going to be talking about a an article that
[02:50.800 --> 02:56.680]  he has on Google X DARPA head wants you to swallow ID microchips see if they can force
[02:56.680 --> 03:02.360]  you to swallow fluoride they can force you to swallow microchips it's a fundamental
[03:02.360 --> 03:07.200]  principle you need to stand up for that so if you're in Austin today then at 1230 go
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.120]  to the demonstration that's in front of the State House State Capitol rather and Leanne
[03:12.120 --> 03:15.160]  McAdoo is going to be there we want to see a show of support that's one thing that you
[03:15.160 --> 03:20.760]  can do it really does matter when crowds show up they pay attention to masses of people
[03:20.760 --> 03:24.920]  so when you show up in mass for something they pay attention to it if you go and speak
[03:24.920 --> 03:29.960]  out against it at a city council meeting we saw this happen in Raleigh people showed up
[03:29.960 --> 03:35.800]  and they just left at the people who showed up these people actually got together on planet
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.960]  info wars and they agreed to tackle that issue first when they went to the city council in
[03:41.960 --> 03:47.600]  Raleigh North Carolina the city council just laughed at them and toasted them with a glass
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.640]  of fluoridated water so that's the kind of response that you can expect that's what we're
[03:51.640 --> 03:56.080]  seeing with these radiation readings that we see all up and down the west coast and Paul
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.320]  Joseph Watson is going to be talking about that too he's got an article up on info war
[03:59.320 --> 04:05.800]  today a 1400% radiation hotspot found on San Francisco beach now in this particular case
[04:05.800 --> 04:09.560]  they went through and they did a spectrum analysis they found that the substances in
[04:09.560 --> 04:13.640]  it were natural radiation but you know what it's still radiation you still need to be
[04:13.640 --> 04:18.840]  aware of what's there you still need to have a government or county officials that don't
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.920]  give you snide remarks like telling you that it's the disposable plastic utensils probably
[04:23.920 --> 04:28.300]  that's buried in the sand there's no evidence of that I can't believe that they said that
[04:28.300 --> 04:31.200]  with a straight face I'm sure they didn't say that with a straight face is probably
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.760]  the same sort of thing disease Raleigh officials toasting someone concerned about fluoridation
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.720]  with water but it's going to be an interesting show Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.280]  us to talk about his articles and we're going to be joined later in the show with jacari
[04:45.280 --> 05:01.120]  jackson and crew on the west coast of California so stay tuned we'll be right back Alex Jones

[07:11.680 --> 07:17.480]  is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal
[07:17.480 --> 07:23.280]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[07:23.280 --> 07:29.520]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point
[07:29.520 --> 07:35.240]  IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is

[08:22.320 --> 08:26.600]  I'm fully in for alex jones today now you may know that alex had a death in the family
[08:26.600 --> 08:31.240]  a close relative that meant a great deal to him and so our thoughts and prayers are with
[08:31.240 --> 08:36.960]  him please pray for him and his family you know as a christian we don't grieve as other
[08:36.960 --> 08:42.320]  people do we have a hope now a lot of atheists have pushed back on it and say you know you
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.480]  christians you you work pretty hard not to die well nobody wants to go through the process
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.600]  of dying and then of course even though we have a confident expectation of what's going
[08:51.600 --> 08:59.280]  to happen we still we still have to go through that and we still have the loss of pain of
[08:59.280 --> 09:07.280]  separation and so nobody nobody wants to see death but we have a hope that is a confident
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.320]  expectation we know that that because of not what we've done but because of what christ
[09:12.320 --> 09:17.640]  is done that we can expect that and the words change just like we see words changing in
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.760]  the constitution just like they've changed unreasonable to mean something that it never
[09:21.760 --> 09:27.400]  meant or they change the well regulated militia they they seize on words like that and they
[09:27.400 --> 09:33.960]  reinterpret those in light of what the word means 200 years later or 400 or 500 years later
[09:33.960 --> 09:38.720]  you know the word hope as it's put in the bible is really a confident expectation it
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.960]  isn't like well I would like for that to happen but I don't think that's really gonna happen
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.040]  so even though you know that it's still a difficult time and so we ask for your prayers
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.840]  for Alex and his family one of the things that's affecting people all over the country
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.680]  is this tremendous cold snap that we have it was just about a year ago that we went
[09:58.680 --> 10:04.040]  to the American meteorological society and they had their meeting here in Austin and
[10:04.040 --> 10:08.800]  one of the things that they proudly displayed at that they were really pushing it everywhere
[10:08.800 --> 10:14.000]  was the fact that temperatures in the United States were warmer for the for the year than
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.720]  they had been in previous years although globally temperatures had gone down and now that we
[10:21.720 --> 10:27.520]  see temperatures at a record low in many places in Chicago is actually colder than
[10:27.520 --> 10:32.600]  it was in the Antarctic the last couple of days and so even though we see that kind of
[10:32.600 --> 10:36.920]  record cold everywhere they're saying oh ignore that they cherry picked the data when they
[10:36.920 --> 10:43.160]  want to now what we see going on here with cooling it's not an event it's a trend it's
[10:43.160 --> 10:51.200]  a 17 year trend and this is happening at the same time that carbon dioxide is rapidly rising
[10:51.200 --> 10:57.440]  and a record rate increase in carbon dioxide so their models have failed the data doesn't
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.320]  support their conclusions instead of a hockey stick now they're trying to talk about a polar
[11:01.320 --> 11:06.320]  vortex and we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson when he joins us later in this hour
[11:06.320 --> 11:11.120]  we're also going to be joined by Jacarie Jackson on the west coast of California he's going
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.440]  to be taking some Geiger counter readings there and we're going to talk about what this really
[11:16.440 --> 11:22.080]  means if it's not necessarily harmful if it just comes from Fukushima you know we look
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.200]  at this and we say well there's evidence that there's a lot of things that are happening
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.800]  in the Pacific Ocean nobody is really investigating that unless they want to try to try it to climate
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.360]  change and global warming they're not really interested in finding out why we see massive
[11:36.360 --> 11:42.160]  die-offs of certain sea populations in the Pacific Ocean so he's going to be out there
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.880]  taking a look at it and we need to understand too that if we see massive increases of radiation
[11:46.880 --> 11:51.600]  it could be something like a McClellan Air Force base burying a lot of radium into the
[11:51.600 --> 11:57.040]  ground against the wishes of the local and state government so many times government
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.040]  has not only not interested in investigating the cause of these things which are health
[12:01.040 --> 12:06.640]  hazards whether the radiation is coming from Fukushima or if it's a concentration of natural
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.840]  radiation or whether it's toxic waste that's been buried by some corporation or by the
[12:10.840 --> 12:14.320]  government itself but we don't seem to get any help from that so they're going to be
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.000]  taking some readings on that to see if there is a trend if there is a radioactive debris
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.480]  that is apparently by this time starting to get to the west coast of California or what
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.880]  the real causes are of that but as we see this record cold one of the things that's
[12:28.880 --> 12:35.480]  happened in the U.S. was in Texas we see that Forbes reported that there were frigid temperatures
[12:35.480 --> 12:40.880]  threatening blackouts on the Texas power grid and we see that Bloomberg says that on the
[12:40.880 --> 12:47.240]  spot market Texas power went up to five thousand dollars for the first time amid frigid weather
[12:47.240 --> 12:54.280]  now they pointed out that the price of five thousand dollars per megawatt hour is a record
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.240]  they've never seen anything that high and to put that in perspective when you buy your
[12:58.240 --> 13:04.680]  electricity the average cost of electricity here in Texas is just over 11 cents per kilowatt
[13:04.680 --> 13:07.920]  hour so if you normalize that down from a megawatt hour what you're talking about is
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.680]  the power companies were having to buy power at five dollars per kilowatt hour and then
[13:13.680 --> 13:19.120]  sell it for 11 cents per kilowatt hour now why is that happening well one of the things
[13:19.120 --> 13:24.760]  from the Forbes article they said that the cold and other problems had knocked out about
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.120]  3,700 megawatts of electricity power generation but that's a really small percentage of the
[13:30.120 --> 13:38.040]  overall total because their shortfall was 55,000 megawatts not 3,700 not 3,000 or 4,000
[13:38.040 --> 13:46.080]  so they're about 51,000 megawatts short why is that happening because of the massive shutdown
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.040]  of power plants that's happening because of the EPA and because of Obama remember he
[13:51.040 --> 13:55.840]  said he's going to shut down coal-fired power plants he said you could build them but they're
[13:55.840 --> 13:59.360]  going to bankrupt you well what it's going to bankrupt is not just the power companies
[13:59.360 --> 14:05.440]  it's going to bankrupt us and he's not only attacking on the grid power he's also attacking
[14:05.440 --> 14:10.040]  off the grid power look at what the EPA is doing under Obama they're now going to assert
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.760]  that they have control over your fireplace and over your wood stove so they're even going
[14:14.760 --> 14:21.200]  to come after you when you try to heat your house with wood and the EPA is we've seen
[14:21.200 --> 14:25.480]  this happening a long time one of the first reports I did when I came here to Info Wars
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.400]  was about the EPA talking about fine particulate matter and if you look at their page pull
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.360]  that page up and let's take a look at their fine not that one there's one that's it's
[14:36.360 --> 14:43.320]  the one that's about fine particulate matter anyway they show a picture of the smokey mountains
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.320]  and they talk about how that's an example of fine particulate that's the FAQ page there
[14:48.320 --> 14:52.480]  they talk about how the smokey mountains are an example of fine particulate matter and
[14:52.480 --> 14:59.560]  smog well the smokey mountains were named the smokey mountains long before even the
[14:59.560 --> 15:05.440]  white man came to that area that's a natural phenomenon it is not a phenomenon of fine
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.760]  particulate matter but that's why they're trying to regulate your wood stoves what
[15:09.760 --> 15:15.640]  they're saying is that we've discovered now after all these years of burning fire that
[15:15.640 --> 15:21.320]  there is particulate matter in it and so we have to purge all particulate matter once
[15:21.320 --> 15:24.320]  you get on something like that like they get on lead you know they find something that's
[15:24.320 --> 15:30.880]  harmful in large concentrations and large dosages and then they gradually ramp this up until
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.920]  they think that they can make a world where lead doesn't exist or where fine particulate
[15:34.920 --> 15:39.440]  matter doesn't exist they take it all out of proportion to the risk you know one of the
[15:39.440 --> 15:45.120]  things that I found burns really well in the fireplace is government regulations I think
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.440]  it's what we need to do because I think they've been heating Washington by burning the constitution
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.160]  in massive quantities let's go now to that that thing there the the EPA FAQs that you
[15:55.160 --> 15:59.640]  just had up there a moment ago they have a couple of FAQs about when the you know what
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.760]  this really means to you when they kick in these regulations in 2015 and one of the things
[16:03.760 --> 16:10.160]  they say is well the local air pollution agency says that I can't sell my old wood stove to
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.760]  help pay for an EPA certified wood stove why is that they say well replacing an older stove
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.120]  with a cleaner burning stove will not only improve air quality if the old stove is reused
[16:20.120 --> 16:26.120]  somewhere else so they go well then how much is that going to cost and they say well it's
[16:26.120 --> 16:31.160]  probably going to cost you between 750 and 3500 dollars and they say well what can I
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.400]  do with my old non-certified stove when I want to get rid of it and they say well you
[16:35.400 --> 16:40.320]  can sell it for scrap you can sell it for scrap perfectly good wood stove or you can
[16:40.320 --> 16:45.480]  trade it in to a wood stove dealer really why would they give me a trade in on something
[16:45.480 --> 16:50.440]  that they can't legally sell okay they say people have been burning wood since the stone
[16:50.440 --> 16:55.480]  age so why is wood smoke a problem now and they say well we've discovered that there's
[16:55.480 --> 16:59.800]  microscopic particles in it they get into your eyes and your respiratory system and this
[16:59.800 --> 17:05.920]  is linked to premature death in people with these kind of chronic conditions this is something
[17:05.920 --> 17:12.240]  we've heard before Lisa Jackson went before congress and with prodding from a democratic
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.520]  congressman stated that particulate matter fine particulate matter would cause you to
[17:17.520 --> 17:21.800]  die and she went so far as to say that there were more people dying from that than from
[17:21.800 --> 17:27.000]  cancer she said it was the leading cause of death in America and the guy who is feeding
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.840]  her on there in the congressional testimony said I want you to say that again are you
[17:31.840 --> 17:36.520]  saying that more people are dying of that or cancer and she says yes that's true and
[17:36.520 --> 17:41.760]  then you know what she did after that they set up an experiment in North Carolina where
[17:41.760 --> 17:48.280]  they advertise for people who had respiratory or heart issues and they hooked them up to
[17:48.280 --> 17:54.760]  in a little room where they piped in diesel exhaust to them in quantities that were orders
[17:54.760 --> 17:59.560]  of magnitude higher than they would normally get out of anything so they could create an
[17:59.560 --> 18:04.840]  event and then use that to argue for tighter and tighter regulations that's the way these
[18:04.840 --> 18:11.120]  people work and this same Lisa Jackson who says on the one hand says this is something
[18:11.120 --> 18:17.760]  that is a leading cause of death and that she hooks up people and gives them diesel particulates
[18:17.760 --> 18:22.160]  in a concentration that is orders of magnitude higher than the current EPA regulations in
[18:22.160 --> 18:27.160]  order to have an event so they can talk about that this is the same woman who is now she's
[18:27.160 --> 18:32.760]  now moved from the EPA she's retired and she's now working at Apple computer on environmental
[18:32.760 --> 18:39.280]  issues she's been hired by new CEO Tim Cook who took Steve Jobs place you know because
[18:39.280 --> 18:45.160]  after Steve Jobs left the Apple computer got on board with the NSA and their prison program
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.160]  that didn't happen until Steve Jobs was out of there and so now it looks like Tim Cook
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.800]  is playing ball with this person from the EPA and she has some real ethical issues as
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.640]  well you know she used her private email to conduct official business she even used the
[18:57.640 --> 19:03.320]  name Richard Windsor they found out under FOIA request so she was doing this with lobbyists
[19:03.320 --> 19:09.840]  what we see is it's not just EPA it's not just it's not just Lisa Jackson it's not
[19:09.840 --> 19:14.200]  just Apple computer this is a kind of revolving door that we see going back and forth between
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.720]  corporations and the government all the time and it's the kind of lying that we see she
[19:18.720 --> 19:23.120]  knew that particular matter wasn't the leading cause of death she knew that that wasn't killing
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.240]  more people than cancer but she was trying to tell people that just like they're trying
[19:27.240 --> 19:32.040]  to push global warming they come up with something that suits their agenda and they push it to
[19:32.040 --> 19:37.040]  the nth degree because they need to create a panic and then offer what they've already
[19:37.040 --> 19:41.320]  determined that they want to do as a solution what's going on with global warming is they
[19:41.320 --> 19:47.360]  want to offer you something so that you go running to Al Gore and the other carbon billionaires
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.960]  and you pay something you pay privileges to them for every bit of energy that you use
[19:51.960 --> 19:56.120]  so they're going to create something like the Federal Reserve on a worldwide basis but based
[19:56.120 --> 19:57.120]  on energy use.
[19:57.120 --> 20:26.120]  Stay tuned we're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.

[21:00.520 --> 21:02.920]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[21:02.920 --> 21:07.400]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.080]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[21:12.080 --> 21:16.680]  recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[21:16.680 --> 21:18.880]  Yes, it's FAKE TV.
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.560]  This year about one in every 50 US homes will have a break in with burglars usually picking
[21:23.560 --> 21:27.560]  the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[21:27.560 --> 21:32.560]  FAKE TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.160]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[21:36.160 --> 21:40.800]  FAKE TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been
[21:40.800 --> 21:41.800]  ransacked.

[24:02.400 --> 24:22.240]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight filling in for Alex today.
[24:22.240 --> 24:27.280]  We're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson from the U.K. at the bottom of the hour.
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.480]  We're going to talk about his recent stories, one of them was posted on Drudge Report.
[24:32.480 --> 24:37.160]  Ex-Darpahead wants you to swallow ID chips, that's a pretty amazing story and some pretty
[24:37.160 --> 24:39.240]  interesting information that came out of that.
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.520]  Also the fact that the Ex-Darpahead is now a Google executive, that's pretty significant
[24:44.520 --> 24:49.800]  concern especially when you look at this in light of their purchases of so many robotics
[24:49.800 --> 24:56.160]  companies in the last year and especially one in particular, Boston Dynamics, which
[24:56.160 --> 25:02.200]  has been making one scary robot after the other for DARPA, but he's going to be joining
[25:02.200 --> 25:03.200]  us from the U.K.
[25:03.200 --> 25:06.520]  We're going to be joined by Jakari Jackson on the west coast of California, he's going
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.960]  to be out there looking with a Geiger counter and seeing what kind of anomalies we see
[25:10.960 --> 25:12.160]  in radiation there.
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.360]  The entire Info Wars crew has gone out there to investigate that, we've had several reports
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.800]  of high readings on Geiger counters and that's another article that we're going to be talking
[25:20.800 --> 25:25.960]  to Paul Joseph Watson about and then we're going to be joined at 12.30, Leanne McAdoo
[25:25.960 --> 25:29.360]  for those of you who are here in Austin is going to be at the state capitol, she's going
[25:29.360 --> 25:34.120]  to be talking to two activists who have been on a hunger strike there to try to stop fluoridation
[25:34.120 --> 25:35.200]  of the water.
[25:35.200 --> 25:38.600]  So that's something if you understand the issue, if you're passionate about the issue
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.160]  that's something to do show up there, but you can't always get the government to do
[25:43.160 --> 25:44.160]  what you want.
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.640]  You have to take action yourself to get things out, water filters, that sort of thing, another
[25:48.640 --> 25:54.480]  thing that you need to be aware of and this is a plug to pay for Jakari Jackson and others
[25:54.480 --> 26:01.280]  going out there, that's what we do is get my Patriot supply, this is the path to liberty
[26:01.280 --> 26:04.560]  begins with self-reliance.
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.560]  Patriot Pantry is delicious, nutritious, prepares in minutes, it's a top rated customer
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.960]  service, top quality products, incredibly reasonable prices and at a price you can afford
[26:13.960 --> 26:18.440]  and you'll find that at mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex.
[26:18.440 --> 26:22.040]  So go there today and take a look for that, it helps to support our operation, it helps
[26:22.040 --> 26:26.680]  to pay for all these reporters that we've got everywhere and of course we've got reporters
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.720]  not only on the road and outside the studio, but Anthony Gucciardi is going to be joining
[26:30.720 --> 26:36.000]  us at the bottom of the, at 1.30 our time, central time and he's going to be talking
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.040]  about issues with Fukushima and what you can do to take care of your health.
[26:41.040 --> 26:46.840]  It's a lot of things that we need to get the government involved, we need to get transparency
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.880]  from them, we need to get explanations from them, but you know fundamentally we have to
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.360]  go out and we have to look at this stuff ourselves, we have to educate ourselves and in many cases
[26:55.360 --> 26:59.440]  if we can't get the government to do what we want to because they've got their own agenda
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.440]  then we have to take responsibility ourselves and that means getting a backup food source
[27:04.440 --> 27:09.860]  from mypatriotsupply or it means taking care of your water with your own fluoride filter
[27:09.860 --> 27:15.600]  or maybe it means protecting yourself with survival shield or iodine of some, what we
[27:15.600 --> 27:21.200]  sell here, the nascent iodine at infowarstore.com is a great way to protect yourself from the
[27:21.200 --> 27:23.400]  radiation that people are seeing spiking everywhere.
[27:23.400 --> 27:27.560]  It doesn't have to be from Fukushima to be dangerous, so you need to be aware of what's
[27:27.560 --> 27:33.520]  in your environment, not just blissfully walk along, take precautions to save yourself from
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.280]  this kind of exposure.
[27:36.280 --> 27:41.200]  Now this is about a, we're about a week into the new year and I think one of the most interesting
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.160]  things that's happened in this last year, there's been a lot of interesting things
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.280]  happening, 2013 has been one heck of a year in terms of politics, in terms of the Second
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.080]  Amendment trying to take our rights to keep our own firearms away, the false flags that
[27:57.080 --> 28:03.040]  we saw directed at patriots and the Boston bombing, we've seen war turn back because
[28:03.040 --> 28:09.720]  people were aware of what's going on and we see also now some cracks in the war on drugs.
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.880]  Now this is something that means a great deal to me, not because I want to use marijuana,
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.600]  because I've seen the war on drugs being on the front line of destroying our constitutional
[28:20.600 --> 28:21.880]  rights.
[28:21.880 --> 28:27.240]  Long before the Patriot Act came into vogue, we had the war on drugs and they were using
[28:27.240 --> 28:29.720]  that to destroy our rights everywhere.
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.080]  And it's a shame to see a lot of people who still don't understand this, there was an
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.800]  article that came out from Pat Buchanan, is America going to pot?
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.280]  And he sees this simply as a sign of moral decline in America, but I think there's a
[28:44.280 --> 28:45.520]  lot more going on.
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.680]  I think people are waking up, I think that's a very healthy sign, I think there's a pushback
[28:50.680 --> 28:55.640]  from the voters against Washington in kind of a 10th amendment way, so they're asserting
[28:55.640 --> 29:00.400]  that they have some rights and power over their lives, so I think that's a very positive
[29:00.400 --> 29:01.400]  aspect.
[29:01.400 --> 29:04.220]  But he focuses on some other things, he said one of the certain results of legalization
[29:04.220 --> 29:08.160]  of marijuana is that there's going to be more potheds, more dropouts, more deaths on
[29:08.160 --> 29:10.120]  the highway.
[29:10.120 --> 29:14.840]  What about the deaths from the war on drugs, what about drug dealers shooting it out with
[29:14.840 --> 29:15.840]  each other on the streets?
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.120]  We haven't seen that since alcohol prohibition, we saw that during alcohol prohibition, they
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.680]  stopped shooting each other over alcohol, then they started shooting each other over
[29:23.680 --> 29:31.240]  pot and although we still have prohibition, marijuana was one of the largest factors
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.480]  of sending people to jail with mandatory minimums, it's a huge part of the war on drugs and
[29:36.480 --> 29:41.040]  if we can turn that back, if we can assert that we have control over our lives and we
[29:41.040 --> 29:43.520]  can shut down the federal government, that's a good thing.
[29:43.520 --> 29:50.240]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, stay tuned.
[29:50.240 --> 30:00.800]  Here on the March, The Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.800 --> 30:05.520]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[30:05.520 --> 30:08.600]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[30:08.600 --> 30:14.920]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease, it all comes down
[30:14.920 --> 30:16.120]  to one thing.
[30:16.120 --> 30:22.400]  We are what we eat, our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives,
[30:22.400 --> 30:28.160]  our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff, all of this has been engineered
[30:28.160 --> 30:33.640]  by design, we can turn the tide against the eugenicist, by giving ourselves the nutrients
[30:33.640 --> 30:35.400]  our body desperately needs.

[31:00.680 --> 31:05.640]  The facts are in, the studies are legion, sodium fluoride and other toxic members of
[31:05.640 --> 31:10.680]  the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[31:10.680 --> 31:14.480]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[31:14.480 --> 31:19.800]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[31:19.800 --> 31:24.040]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[31:24.040 --> 31:25.360]  to get it out of our bodies.
[31:25.360 --> 31:30.920]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars life fluoride shield formulation

[31:41.920 --> 31:46.200]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[32:05.160 --> 32:09.800]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[32:09.800 --> 32:13.840]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[32:13.840 --> 32:18.200]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown arabica beans.

[33:11.280 --> 33:17.240]  In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[33:17.240 --> 33:30.920]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex.
[33:30.920 --> 33:35.480]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis, heavily armored vehicles are rolling into
[33:35.480 --> 33:39.880]  town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through
[33:39.880 --> 33:40.880]  your neighborhood.
[33:40.880 --> 33:45.480]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis do not be alarmed.
[33:45.480 --> 33:49.360]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed, we will take all weapons.
[33:49.360 --> 33:51.760]  Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in.
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.200]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[33:56.200 --> 33:59.320]  Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[33:59.320 --> 34:03.880]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[34:03.880 --> 34:07.960]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.320]  Anastasia's late news 12 Jeff Farrell discovered that clergy would help the government with
[34:12.320 --> 34:15.440]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[34:15.440 --> 34:18.920]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[34:18.920 --> 34:22.440]  to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to
[34:22.440 --> 34:23.440]  whole communities.
[34:23.440 --> 34:29.800]  If you got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.720]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[34:34.720 --> 34:35.720]  Pediatrics.
[34:35.720 --> 34:40.920]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky but this is only a drill.
[34:40.920 --> 34:49.160]  Fully armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[34:49.160 --> 34:58.360]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[34:58.360 --> 35:03.080]  I am in my apartment, sir, I am inside.
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.880]  I have two words for you, Predator gloves, you will never see it coming.
[35:07.880 --> 35:16.240]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[35:16.240 --> 35:20.560]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[35:20.560 --> 35:23.880]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[35:23.880 --> 35:26.800]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[35:26.800 --> 35:29.360]  in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[35:29.360 --> 35:34.840]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you
[35:34.840 --> 35:41.840]  want a commentation.
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.520]  We are on the march, the Empire is on the run, live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's
[35:46.520 --> 35:47.520]  Alex Jones.
[35:47.520 --> 36:07.960]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[36:07.960 --> 36:22.400]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show, I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex today.
[36:22.400 --> 36:26.360]  I'm here in the studio and I'm going to be joined later today by Anthony Gutiarty but
[36:26.360 --> 36:31.160]  we've got crew all over the place, we've got Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the UK,
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.000]  we've got an InfoWars crew that's in the west coast on California coast and they're
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.120]  going to be joining us with a report out there on radiation.
[36:38.120 --> 36:42.840]  We also have Leanne McAdoo that's going to be headed down to the Austin capital, she's
[36:42.840 --> 36:47.240]  going to be talking to two activists there who are on a hunger strike to stop fluoridation
[36:47.240 --> 36:48.240]  of the water.
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.320]  But right now we want to talk to Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, he's got a couple of articles
[36:52.320 --> 36:57.120]  here and one of them just went up on Drudge Report, 1400% radiation hotspot found in the
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.120]  San Francisco beach and we also want to talk to him about an article that he had yesterday
[37:01.120 --> 37:07.920]  about an ex-Darpa head who now works for Google and wants you to swallow ID microchips so
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.840]  that your whole body becomes some kind of a biometric passcode or maybe they just want
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.800]  to track you, maybe that's what they're going to, who knows what kind of nefarious things
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.320]  they're going to use this for and that's the really scary thing.
[37:21.320 --> 37:28.200]  DARPA has become a very, very dark group of people, even Michael Aquino, the guy who is
[37:28.200 --> 37:34.960]  at the NSA and Satanist and a vowed open Satanist and he wrote Mind War and what he
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.440]  said of DARPA was that they were kind of the stereotypical dark mad scientist so this
[37:40.440 --> 37:47.400]  is a guy who's a Satanist and writing books on psychological warfare and he's calling
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.440]  the DARPA people mad scientist, Paul what do you think about that?
[37:51.440 --> 37:58.160]  Well, I mean I called it the apex of the big brother system but if you watch the video
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.640]  that I put up yesterday, the people who were talking about this and we can get into it
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.200]  later, they don't even entertain the privacy aspects of it, I mean the woman behind it,
[38:08.200 --> 38:13.720]  the ex-Darpa head who is now with Google, one of their chief executives, she didn't
[38:13.720 --> 38:19.400]  even entertain questions about privacy aspects, she just said basically shut up and swallow
[38:19.400 --> 38:22.520]  the pill, so they don't even care.
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.320]  Yeah, oh yeah, that was amazing, that was a quote from the article, the guy who was
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.760]  writing the event there said does Google know everything that I do and everywhere I go because
[38:31.760 --> 38:36.080]  let's face it you're with Google and she responded by laughing and said just swallow
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.520]  the pill, that said yeah, I think people need to swallow the pill that wakes them up.
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.440]  The red pill or the blue pill, yeah if you want to get into that first we can go into
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.440]  that.
[38:47.440 --> 38:49.520]  So let's talk about that.
[38:49.520 --> 38:55.240]  This was a conference point, it was actually back in June but it came to my attention because
[38:55.240 --> 39:03.000]  yesterday there was a new story out of Xtreme Tech about Motorola's new transferable electronic
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.280]  tattoo which is basically fuses to your skin and it will allow you to be interactive and
[39:09.280 --> 39:15.200]  act as an authentication device for your cell phone, you know, car door, any kind of thing
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.920]  you need access to to verify your identity, now they're going to have a wearable tattoo.
[39:20.920 --> 39:28.480]  But the interesting thing about it is that it also reads your mind, the thoughts in your
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.200]  head that are actually unvocalized, I didn't know this until yesterday but apparently before
[39:34.200 --> 39:39.080]  you actually speak the thoughts in your head, the brain sends a message down to your vocal
[39:39.080 --> 39:45.080]  cords to get the muscles ready to say those words and this device that they're talking
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.800]  about Motorola which of course is owned by Google will be able to read those impulses
[39:50.800 --> 39:52.960]  sent down by the brain.
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.960]  So it's basically a mind reading device that people are going to wear both to activate
[39:57.960 --> 40:03.520]  their cell phone and it said to detect stress and emotion.
[40:03.520 --> 40:06.400]  So now Big Brother cares about your feelings David.
[40:06.400 --> 40:09.440]  Yeah, you know that's the thing, there's two different aspects to your article, one of
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.200]  them is this biometric tracking, you know you saw the pill and they can track you everywhere
[40:14.200 --> 40:18.080]  and that doesn't offer anything to anybody says oh you won't have to use your car keys
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.160]  or your house keys or whatever and it's like look if anybody gets that pill they can get
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.280]  into your car, into your house, whatever that's not a security device and one of the things
[40:28.280 --> 40:33.440]  we have to be concerned about is that if everything is operating off of biometrics, if it's operating
[40:33.440 --> 40:38.600]  off of your fingerprint or it's operating off of your retina scan or if it's operating
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.040]  off of your body then what people might do if they really want what you've got is they
[40:43.040 --> 40:46.480]  might cut off your finger, they might gouge out your eye, they might kill you and drag
[40:46.480 --> 40:49.240]  your body around to get into wherever they want, I mean we've seen this over and over
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.200]  again in science fiction films so this really doesn't have any utility for individuals, it
[40:53.200 --> 41:00.800]  has a lot of utility for a government that wants to track you like their personal cattle.
[41:00.800 --> 41:06.560]  Well precisely and you know in that vein they can't sell it through convenience I don't
[41:06.560 --> 41:07.560]  think.
[41:07.560 --> 41:13.440]  This woman, the former DARPA head, she said that you would have to take 30 pills a day
[41:13.440 --> 41:18.160]  in order for this to work because they only work for apparently seven minutes at a time.
[41:18.160 --> 41:24.080]  I mean you know I take probably about 20 vitamin pills a day, I don't always remember to take
[41:24.080 --> 41:25.800]  them but it's always a hassle.
[41:25.800 --> 41:32.840]  Why on earth would I want to take 30 Google microchip ID pills just to be able to access
[41:32.840 --> 41:37.760]  my cell phone, it's not difficult to type in a four digit number.
[41:37.760 --> 41:43.000]  So they're going to sell it not through convenience but through you know trendy transhumanism
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.240]  which is what she said in the clip which I put up on YouTube, I made my own YouTube
[41:47.240 --> 41:54.560]  video about it and she basically said that this will appeal to 10 to 20 year olds who
[41:54.560 --> 42:01.480]  quote want to piss off their parents so they're going to market it as this kind of rebellion,
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.080]  this full rebellion against the system when it's the very same system that's pushing
[42:06.080 --> 42:07.080]  it.
[42:07.080 --> 42:11.640]  And it goes back to the whole you know the cry freedom ghetto that the people who didn't
[42:11.640 --> 42:15.320]  conform to the Plandopolis we're going to be put into.
[42:15.320 --> 42:20.760]  It's about you know those who refuse to adopt it won't be able to communicate with everybody
[42:20.760 --> 42:21.760]  else.
[42:21.760 --> 42:23.240]  They'll basically be ostracized.
[42:23.240 --> 42:24.240]  Exactly.
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.880]  I think one of the things that concerns me so much about this is Google's involvement
[42:27.880 --> 42:31.960]  in it because they're such a large company, they can buy companies just wholesale like
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.280]  Motorola or all these robotic companies, I think they got something like eight robotics
[42:36.280 --> 42:41.080]  companies last year and they bought the very best because of course they got Ray Kurzweil
[42:41.080 --> 42:46.760]  now as one of their top engineers there over in management and he's been someone who's
[42:46.760 --> 42:50.320]  been pushing this transhumanist agenda for quite some time.
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.800]  I'm very concerned about this because I think what's behind a lot of this NSA stuff is kind
[42:55.800 --> 42:58.840]  of closing the loop on manufactured consent.
[42:58.840 --> 43:05.600]  You know we have this massive, massive effort by the government to move public opinion in
[43:05.600 --> 43:06.600]  different ways.
[43:06.600 --> 43:11.000]  They need to be able to monitor to see if their propaganda is working.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.920]  Google is a perfect device for that.
[43:12.920 --> 43:18.760]  And of course they want to look at everybody's emails, everybody's private communications
[43:18.760 --> 43:23.760]  to see if their propaganda is working to see if people are following them or not.
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.040]  They've got bots that are getting on to Facebook and Twitter that are pushing for their particular
[43:29.040 --> 43:34.160]  agenda and they need to be able to measure that and so there's this real discomfort with
[43:34.160 --> 43:39.720]  me as far as Google goes and the directions that this company is moving and it's ties
[43:39.720 --> 43:45.200]  to DARPA and dark research that really doesn't produce anything that anybody wants other
[43:45.200 --> 43:47.720]  than a totalitarian police state.
[43:47.720 --> 43:54.080]  Well, there was actually an interview with Google Scott Huffman about a month ago in
[43:54.080 --> 44:01.200]  The Independent and he said that the short-term goal, he said I believe five to seven years
[44:01.200 --> 44:07.480]  was that they plan to have microphones hanging from everybody's ceiling and then after that
[44:07.480 --> 44:14.440]  chips directly implanted in their head to make Google searches easier and again it goes
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.000]  back to the question who is going to have a chip implanted in their head to perform a
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  Google search.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.400]  I mean it's on a common sense level it doesn't seem to appeal but then you have to realize
[44:24.400 --> 44:31.000]  that what Kurzweil has inspired is this whole transhumanist movement which has been framed
[44:31.000 --> 44:37.280]  as a rebellion against the system when in fact it's the ultimate in cultural conformism
[44:37.280 --> 44:39.160]  and apparently that's the way they're going to sell it.
[44:39.160 --> 44:47.320]  I mean the lady from DARPA with the ingestible chip was talking about if you have cool designs
[44:47.320 --> 44:52.080]  if you make the electronic tattoo look cool and trendy then the kids are going to want
[44:52.080 --> 44:55.520]  to adopt it and they're going to want to do it to piss off their parents.
[44:55.520 --> 45:03.520]  So it's about wearable, ingestible and implantable surveillance technologies as a form of rebellion
[45:03.520 --> 45:08.520]  that's how they're going to sell it when in actuality it's the ultimate in conformism
[45:08.520 --> 45:12.400]  it's exactly what Ray Kurzweil has predicted all along.
[45:12.400 --> 45:14.040]  Yeah exactly.
[45:14.040 --> 45:17.600]  I think Google really is the mechanism behind 1984.
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.920]  Now of course we had some documents that came out under Spiegel just before the new year
[45:21.920 --> 45:27.240]  that showed a couple of slides and there were internal NSA slides and people looked at that
[45:27.240 --> 45:31.080]  and really what the takeaway for most people who reported it because it came out just before
[45:31.080 --> 45:36.120]  the new year most people were not looking at the news but the few people who did cover
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.680]  that came away and said well yeah they own the iPhone they can look at everything that
[45:40.680 --> 45:44.320]  you're doing with the iPhone they never fail with a hack but when I looked at it the thing
[45:44.320 --> 45:49.760]  that stuck out about it to me was the fact that the NSA was bragging about the fact that
[45:49.760 --> 45:52.840]  they had achieved 1984 status.
[45:52.840 --> 45:59.400]  The slides were three of them the first one shows the 1984 slide from Apple that the slide
[45:59.400 --> 46:04.000]  shows the trailer that they used the commercial that they used to push the Mac in 1984 and
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.120]  they said who would have thought that Apple would be the ones bringing us big brother
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.920]  and they show Steve Jobs holding up an iPhone and then they say and that the zombies showing
[46:14.920 --> 46:19.200]  the public rushing out to get the iPhones that the zombies would be buying these tools.
[46:19.200 --> 46:23.760]  So they're gloating about the fact that they've established 1984 they're gloating about the
[46:23.760 --> 46:29.400]  fact that they have established an Orwellian society and that people are buying the instruments
[46:29.400 --> 46:34.760]  of their surveillance but really the core of this is Google because Google is the one
[46:34.760 --> 46:38.640]  that is trying to get inside of your mind Google is the one that's trying to read your
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.480]  thoughts that was the other part of this article that really stuck out to me was the fact that
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.160]  you sub vocalize what you're about to say and that they could pull that in to actually
[46:47.160 --> 46:50.160]  try to read your thoughts that's what Google wants to do they want to be everywhere in
[46:50.160 --> 46:54.240]  your apartment as you just pointed out and they even want to be inside of your mind very
[46:54.240 --> 46:59.920]  very dark there's actually a new technology that's come out I believe it's called mother
[46:59.920 --> 47:06.320]  I just saw the video today and it's a it's a Wi-Fi sensor that basically catalogs your
[47:06.320 --> 47:11.080]  entire life from what time you get up in the morning from the amount of calories you burn
[47:11.080 --> 47:15.720]  when you go running from the time you have your coffee the time you place calls to other
[47:15.720 --> 47:20.240]  people and that's that's where it's going they want a life log there are several different
[47:20.240 --> 47:25.760]  companies that are coming out with those kind of devices that log your every single waking
[47:25.760 --> 47:31.640]  activities even sleeping activity the quality of your sleep and so forth so it's you know
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.200]  it's the Google searches that the phone calls the telephone records are not enough they
[47:36.200 --> 47:41.440]  literally want to be the sky net system and it's it's being sold on the basis that the
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.760]  people will be made to love their own enslavement they won't have to you know tolerate big brother
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.960]  because they'll embrace it because it's so cool and trendy and convenient and that's
[47:51.960 --> 47:57.440]  the way it's going it's not going in the Winston Smith direction it's going in the direction
[47:57.440 --> 48:04.040]  of you know making big brother cool and trendy and just making it an app for your entire
[48:04.040 --> 48:09.880]  life and people don't care that all that information is being centralized and being catalogued
[48:09.880 --> 48:14.560]  that's right we see evidence of that in the story about car makers keeping data on drivers
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.360]  locations and I thought it was interesting that Al Franken came out and spoke against
[48:19.360 --> 48:24.480]  that he has a judiciary committee on privacy when we've seen in the past that he came out
[48:24.480 --> 48:28.960]  and defended the NSA so here's a guy who's got a judiciary committee on privacy and
[48:28.960 --> 48:33.680]  he says you know the the car companies are storing information about you they're not
[48:33.680 --> 48:37.800]  just helping you find your way around that's from our perspective that's what we see we
[48:37.800 --> 48:42.240]  look at it and it's like it's very convenient when you move into a new city like Austin
[48:42.240 --> 48:48.000]  here it's kind of a confusing freeway system a lot of one-way streets a lot of crossing
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.480]  overpasses and so it's very useful to have something that's going to help you find your
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.760]  way around if you're going somewhere that you don't normally go but they're storing
[48:56.760 --> 49:00.760]  all of this information and he's upset about that and he should be but he's not upset about
[49:00.760 --> 49:05.160]  the NSA and what we've seen over and over again is that when you give third party information
[49:05.160 --> 49:09.640]  to these companies to Google or to your internet service provider or to your phone's cell phone
[49:09.640 --> 49:14.520]  company they're keeping that information and they can turn that over and they do turn it
[49:14.520 --> 49:19.640]  over to law enforcement without a search warrant because of course they just go to them and
[49:19.640 --> 49:22.760]  ask them for the information and turn it over is the same as if they were to come to your
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.800]  house and you said sure come on in and search my house if you don't insist on your constitutional
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.080]  rights then they can do that to you and of course if they do it to a third party they
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.840]  can get all of that information.
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.600]  Again it comes back to how much will people accept you know David 10 years ago I swore
[49:41.600 --> 49:45.880]  that I'd never get a cell phone because I knew from 2001 it was basically a tracking
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.600]  device you know I've got three cell phones now I've got a satellite navigation in the
[49:51.600 --> 49:57.280]  car so how much will people tolerate how much people will reject when does convenience
[49:57.280 --> 50:01.160]  become some kind of owner a big brother that's the question.
[50:01.160 --> 50:05.000]  That's right yeah they offer it to you as a convenience service and then they gloat about
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.480]  the fact that you're a zombie because you buy this stuff and they think that that gives
[50:09.480 --> 50:14.880]  them the moral imperative to act like it's a Norwellian 1984 state.
[50:14.880 --> 50:19.360]  Let's talk about this other article it just went up on Drudge a 1400% radiation hotspot
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.920]  found on San Francisco beach tell us about that Paul.
[50:23.920 --> 50:27.800]  That was a follow up to the investigation you remember a couple of days ago we had the
[50:27.800 --> 50:34.760]  video of the guy with a gag account on a beach in San Francisco taking radiation measurements
[50:34.760 --> 50:40.760]  500% normal background levels well actually did a follow up and we can get into it after
[50:40.760 --> 50:41.760]  the break.
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.680]  Yeah yeah yeah we want to talk about that because we've got crew that are headed out
[50:44.680 --> 50:48.480]  to California and Jakari Jackson is going to be joining us at the top of the hour so

[54:10.440 --> 54:15.040]  and for alex i've got paul joseph watson joining us live from the uk we've been talking about
[54:15.040 --> 54:19.480]  his story that just was linked to on the drudge report fourteen hundred percent radiation
[54:19.480 --> 54:24.880]  hotspot found in san francisco beach now kit daniels just popped in and told me during
[54:24.880 --> 54:30.200]  the break that chicari jackson just called back with their first reading ten times normal
[54:30.200 --> 54:34.200]  when they went out to the beach ten times normal what would be background radiation
[54:34.200 --> 54:38.520]  is about thirty counts per minute they got about ten times that now this story that
[54:38.520 --> 54:44.280]  you've got here paul this is fourteen hundred percent that's about fourteen times the normal
[54:44.280 --> 54:48.440]  radiation that this guy found out there but he found that no trace that it was coming
[54:48.440 --> 54:56.720]  from fukushima is that right yeah this was a study by a guy who manufactures guy counters
[54:56.720 --> 55:01.600]  and he said that when he analyzed the actual sand that gave the reading of fourteen times
[55:01.600 --> 55:07.400]  normal background radiation he found that it contained radium and thorium thorium which
[55:07.400 --> 55:13.480]  are naturally occurring radioactive elements and that they didn't come from fukushima because
[55:13.480 --> 55:19.960]  the fissile material used in those reactors is cesium one three seven so they're speculating
[55:19.960 --> 55:26.800]  that it it may have come from a disused oil pipeline that's situated near that beach and
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.720]  they're doing more testing into it but fourteen times the normal safe level now they're saying
[55:32.720 --> 55:37.360]  that babies and young children shouldn't be allowed on that beach because it could pose
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.840]  a serious health threat and that's interesting because we get criticized some people say
[55:41.840 --> 55:45.160]  now you're bunch of amateurs the guy you're counter this is a guy who's an electrical
[55:45.160 --> 55:49.720]  engineer that manufactures guy you're counters and he thought it was so unusual that he took
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.440]  it back and he did a spectrum analysis on it to find out what it was now whether or
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.600]  not it was cesium one thirty seven or whether it was some naturally occurring radiation
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.360]  like radium and thorium is still a very high level you still should be concerned about
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.160]  it he was concerned about it well exactly you know there's been kind of a backlash hasn't
[56:08.160 --> 56:12.760]  there against these people going out with their geiger cancers what do they expect I mean
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.960]  the Japanese government has been caught lying over and over again along with tepco about
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.520]  the true scale of radiation releases you know back in september it emerged that the true
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.400]  radiation levels around fukushima were eighteen times what they've been saying because they
[56:27.400 --> 56:32.160]  didn't have the equipment that went up to a certain level that was required yes they've
[56:32.160 --> 56:38.840]  just passed a law which basically puts journalists in prison for ten years if they release or
[56:38.840 --> 56:46.280]  even seek quote sensitive information about fukushima so with that kind of distrust I
[56:46.280 --> 56:51.280]  mean what environment do they expect it to create of course people are going to be suspicious
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.280]  and of course people are going to go out and do their own research yeah you're talking
[56:55.280 --> 56:59.120]  about the controls that they put on journalists they've told the workers they you know we
[56:59.120 --> 57:03.440]  heard about the fukushima fifty that the people who kept going back in and back in exposing
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.600]  themselves very high level of radiation we're not allowed to know the names of those people
[57:07.600 --> 57:10.680]  they're not allowed to talk to people if in fact they're still alive we know that the
[57:10.680 --> 57:15.200]  guy who was running that operation and exposed to very high levels we know that he died of
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.400]  esophageal cancer but of course he took the company line and said it had to do with my
[57:20.400 --> 57:23.640]  smoking it didn't have anything to do with that of course you would expect him to say
[57:23.640 --> 57:30.560]  that in Japan because what people don't understand is the undying loyalty that Japanese people
[57:30.560 --> 57:35.040]  in a cultural way have to the company that they work for many times they introduce themselves
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.360]  first by saying the company that they work for and then their name that's that's the
[57:38.360 --> 57:44.480]  kind of environment that they work into and it kind of lends itself culturally to fascism
[57:44.480 --> 57:49.240]  as we see you know some cultures they tend towards a communist takeover somebody wants
[57:49.240 --> 57:53.320]  to take over and run the country from an authoritarian standpoint there that culture
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.840]  might be one culture might be more susceptible to communism as an excuse for that but in
[57:57.840 --> 58:02.640]  Japan it's about fascism and so you see the workers who are there who risked their lives
[58:02.640 --> 58:06.800]  who maybe have lost their lives not saying anything as well as the guy who was running
[58:06.800 --> 58:11.520]  it but we see that there were a lot of sailors American sailors who are there for just four
[58:11.520 --> 58:16.440]  days and they're coming down with all sorts of cancers and they're speaking out and we'll
[58:16.440 --> 58:20.040]  be talking about that after we come back and we're also going to be talking to jacari
[58:20.040 --> 58:25.480]  jackson live he's going to be giving us a report from the pacific ocean he's there on the california
[58:25.480 --> 58:30.240]  beach and his very first reading was ten times normal so that's going to be coming up right
[58:30.240 --> 58:46.600]  after the break stay tuned we'll be right back thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com

[58:55.320 --> 59:00.920]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down

[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:24.160]  Jones on the gcm radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome back
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.120]  to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex I've got Paul Joseph Watson on
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.160]  the line from the UK we're going to be talking to jacari Jackson in just a few minutes giving
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.160]  us a live report from the coast of california lianna macadoo is going to be joining us later
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.000]  in the show from Austin at a hunger strike being conducted by some activists trying to
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.120]  stop the fluoridation of water here in the UK and of course Anthony Gucci already is
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.080]  going to be joining us to talk about Fukushima and radiation also in the show but right
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.800]  now we've got Paul Joseph Watson on and we've been talking about the article that just went
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:02.080]  up on drudge report our article that you wrote Paul 1400% radiation hotspot found on a San
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.680]  Francisco beach we were just told by Kit Daniels that their first reading that the info wars
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:14.160]  crew took out there was 10 times normal now you also broke a story about 14 million dosages
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.760]  of potassium iodide being ordered by the government and they wanted in just 30 days
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.320]  that was kind of interesting finding yeah they're on it before the end of February that's right
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.080]  and people have questioned that because you know US public health authorities have been
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.080]  caught lying on a regular basis for decades and decades and you can go back to atomic
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:40.720]  soldiers you can go back to the EPA in the weeks after 9 11 saying that the asbestos
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.840]  laden air was safe to breathe which led to you know 20,000 people getting debilitating
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:53.320]  illnesses many dying that's why people don't trust the government in terms of public health
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.320]  crisis because they've been caught lying on many occasions well of course Anthony Gucci
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.360]  already called up the government representative from the government that was in charge of
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.600]  this purchasing order and ask him why they were doing that and the guy beat around the
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.160]  bush and ultimately hung up on Anthony wouldn't give him an answer he didn't seem too keen
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.600]  to talk about it first he said it they were just stockpiling it for some unknown reason
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.400]  then when Fukushima was brought into the occasion he he went kind of quiet so people have questioned
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.200]  that just like the question you know the government buying the ammunition ammunition and the bullets
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.320]  because they said we buy it in bulk to save money but in the case of the bullets they
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.160]  were buying hollow point rounds which cost a lot more than normal full metal jackets
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.880]  and they're not suitable for training purposes so again they pulled the same excuse with
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.320]  the potassium high-dates saying we're buying it in bulk to save money and people don't
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.960]  trust that because they've been caught lying on that before but with Fukushima again you
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.960]  know I'm not a scientist I read a lot of polarizing stuff on both sides of the equation some people
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.400]  say it's a dire threat to humanity then others mainly government spokespeople and officials
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.840]  say it's completely harmless I mean there was a story out of deep sea news which I think
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.440]  was one of the publications that attacked us that said well it's not even dangerous to
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.320]  swim off the coast of Fukushima well I like to see them you know go and send their kids
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.560]  into the waters off Fukushima to prove that point because you know thyroid cancers amongst
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.880]  Japanese children are astronomical now so the effects are already being felt there
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.720]  and that's why you want to get iodine that protects you thyroid cancer is one of the
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.360]  first most common ways that you're going to get cancer from exposure radiation because
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.360]  a thyroid is going to soak that up we got pushed back on from that that same article
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.760]  probably deep sea news because we reported observations that were made by the national
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.960]  academy of sciences and a paper there and they said well that's just one place this
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.960]  is real and you're taking that all out of context because that was all about global
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.920]  warming and it's like well first of all the the observation says it wasn't just that one
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.200]  station it was consistent with other readings that they'd gotten in the Pacific Ocean but
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.800]  then to say that well that was just one station we're talking about global warming well then
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.440]  if you're thinking about something that's global wouldn't you think that it would be
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.200]  seen all over the place not just in Pacific Ocean but in other oceans as well and this
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.560]  is a very unusual event and so you look at something that's an anomaly like that this
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.920]  was like a the highest amount of dead sea creatures that they had seen covering the
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.760]  ocean floor in 24 years of observation it had gone from a typical 1% to 98% they said
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.280]  well we have these these snows that that happened from plankton occasionally but yet they look
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.160]  at something that's really unusual like that and unless they can tie it into a government
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  grant for global warming they're not interested in investigating it and seeing what's there
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:51.280]  in a correlation to the location doesn't prove causality but when you see massive events
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.920]  like this canaries in a coal mine you really ought to ask yourself what's going on here
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.920]  whether it's Fukushima or something else you need to know we'll be right back
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:06.160]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.320]  a halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.440]  in a halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:24.760]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:31.240]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.400]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.480]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex we've got Paul Joseph Watson on the phone from
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:34.440]  the UK we've been talking about his article that's on the drug report right now 1400 percent
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.520]  increase in radiation found near some San Francisco beaches and we've got our info wars crew
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.800]  out there right now to take their own measurements and our first reports are that the first place
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:51.840]  they went to take readings they got a reading that was 10 times normal of background radiation
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.760]  which is about 30 counts per minute they they took a reading there we're going to be joined
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.200]  by Jacarie Jackson in just a few minutes with a live report from there but Paul talking
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.920]  about this particular case here that you've got with the article one of the things that
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.880]  really stuck out to me about it is that whether or not it's radiation from Fukushima or whether
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.080]  or not it's a concentration as they point out of radiate radium and thorium it's still
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.960]  dangerous if it's in a high concentration like that and we're just talking about how
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.120]  the government is not interested in investigating this when they went out and looked at the
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.600]  first reports of a 500% increase the local government officials said well it was probably
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.720]  just some red painted disposable eating utensils that that was the most ridiculous thing I've
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.720]  ever seen do you have any idea if he was being sarcastic or laughing about that what's the
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.360]  context of that I mean from my reading of it it appeared as if he was being serious
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.440]  but you know now they're saying the act the guy who designed the guide account is you
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:52.840]  know the big the big company owner is saying that this is dangerous to babies and young
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.480]  children so the local government initially dismissed it now they're saying it could be
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:03.240]  dangerous but a very important article for people to go and read is called the ocean
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:09.840]  is broken it came out of the Newcastle Herald and this was about a yachtsman named Ivan
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:15.840]  McFadden and basically he sailed from Japan all the way to San Francisco and you know
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.680]  this guy this is not coming out of info wars this is not from environmentalists it's not
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.840]  from government scientists it's from a guy who's seen it with his own eyes he was in
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:30.960]  the same area 10 years before I only had to throw his net in the sea to get a ton of fish
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.960]  he went back there sailed from Osaka to San Francisco and this is what he said this was
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:43.760]  after Fukushima he sailed in April last year he said after we left Japan it felt as if the
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:51.120]  ocean itself was dead we hardly saw any living things we saw one whale sort of rolling helplessly
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.200]  on the surface with what looked like a big tumor on its head it was pretty sickening
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.760]  quote I've done lots of miles on the ocean in my life and I'm used to seeing turtles
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:06.920]  dolphin sharks big flurries of feeding birds but this time for 3000 nautical miles there
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:13.680]  was nothing alive to be seen and he concludes by saying the ocean is broken basically said
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.080]  the only thing he saw was piles of debris from the soon army you know bits of cars bits
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:24.960]  of houses all the ocean life all the way from Japan to San Francisco was basically dead
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:31.160]  for 3000 nautical miles wow and that kind of correlates with what we saw in that report
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:38.120]  from some readings that were taken by the Monterey Maritime Institute there and was published
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.360]  in the National Academy of Sciences saying that at one particular station they saw an
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.880]  increase in dead sea creatures on the ocean floor from 1% to 98% coverage of the floor
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.160]  and they said that there were other stations that were giving them similar readings it
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.440]  was the highest readings that they had seen highest coverage of dead sea life that they
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:03.520]  had seen in 24 years of observation now they were saying it was global warming although
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.880]  global warming isn't happening it's not just that we're having a cold winter right now
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.880]  this is a 17 year trend we're not talking about one event of an extremely cold record-breaking
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:20.960]  winter in North America we're talking about 17 years of data that does not support global
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.040]  warming and yet if the observations that they have there everything has to be tied back
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.280]  to global warming because that's where they get their research grants that's where they
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.120]  get their funding and so they push back on that but nobody is really looking at why this
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.600]  is happening and they're not they're not looking at the plausibility that this is radioactive
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.200]  material that's been leaked out in massive quantities from Fukushima now going on coming
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.880]  up almost to three years in just a couple of months that this has been going on you
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.520]  would expect that to have some effect and that's apparently what this guy is observing
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:58.680]  as he goes across the Pacific Ocean well and part of the reason is that the fish eat plankton
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.840]  don't in all the studies from around Hawaii and other areas Canada as well have shown
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:11.320]  that the fish have got abnormally very high levels of cesium 137 which is from the reactors
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.480]  in Fukushima they did a study of the fish that Japan was selling to Canada and found
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:25.440]  that 90% and up of most of the fish had very high percentages of cesium 137 in their system
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.360]  and this was around about a year ago now so the fish are eating all that plankton which
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:36.520]  is is poisoned by this cesium 137 and then you know people who venture across the ocean
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.560]  say that there's nothing there it's all dead then you get reports which you just mentioned
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:48.160]  about you know in certain areas 98% of the sea life is dead you've got reports of starfish
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:55.560]  is melting sea lion cubs dying in unusual numbers even in Utah you've got bald eagles
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.640]  dying that some people are linking to Fukushima so there's a mass die off of sea life but
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:07.120]  again government says nothing to worry about move along nothing to see here just as they
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:13.960]  did after 9-11 with the EPA saying you know the air was safe to breathe it fits their
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.600]  agenda they've got an agenda that they want to push and they're not interested in looking
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.600]  at anything that falls outside of that agenda and they're not interested in looking at anything
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.200]  that affects the health of the public either well in their in their eyes they would say
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.040]  we don't want to cause panic but you know that's proven very dangerous in the past it's
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:37.920]  killed people I mean the EPA immediately after Fukushima turned off most of their radiation
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:45.560]  detectors they raised the safe level of radiation certain types of it by 100,000 times but you
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.080]  know it isn't just that they don't want to panic the public because they do want to panic
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.440]  the public when it suits their purposes you've got the EPA going before congressional testimony
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:00.640]  saying that particulate matter is the leading cause of death that it's higher than cancer
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.000]  even and then turning around a few months later and exposing people to levels that the
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:12.360]  EPA says are 70 to 80 times levels that the EPA said were safe levels so they will deliberately
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.000]  try to create a panic they'll try to create a panic with their testimony then they'll
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.080]  even expose people to dangerous levels of something in order to create further panic
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:27.040]  so there's a different agenda that's going on here well they choose which issues to create
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.960]  panic around only if there's an opportunity to centralize power and to make a ton of money
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.280]  then they're going to create panic around it I mean look at global warming look at terrorism
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.080]  if it's in their interest they will create the panic then if you've got a real threat
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:46.520]  they will say we don't want to create a panic let's downplay it and it's a genuine threat
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.120]  that's right that's right I think we've got Jacarie Jackson on the line do we have him
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.440]  guys to see he's there okay good let's go to Jacarie Jackson he's on the coast of California
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.400]  with Info Wars crew and they've been out there with a guy or counter taking some measurements
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.920]  what do you see Jacarie hey how you doing David there's a lot of radiation out here
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.520]  I'll say I'm a little bit concerned we're itself a little bit southwest of San Francisco
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.000]  south of Pillar Point Harbor on surfers beach that's what the locals referred to and you
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.360]  guys remember the viral video that's on info wars dot com a man came out here with his
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.960]  own professional grade Geiger counter we have one as well and we'll show you those readings
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.920]  here in a second but when the man came out here he saw radiation levels well in excess
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.840]  of what's considered to be normal out here a normal according to the Half Moon Bay review
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.320]  is around 30 CPM just in a little bit of time we've been here we've found things close to
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.640]  300 and that's just a small section of the beach we'll go down and show you more of that
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.020]  here in a little bit but this is nothing to scoff at you know people are saying various
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:48.960]  experts in the radiation fields they're saying that this isn't a cesium 137 it may be things
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.360]  such as radium and you know that very well could be the case but it's very much in excess
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.640]  of what's considered to be normal and also Steve Weiss he's a electrical engineer who's
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:02.040]  been making Geiger counters for nearly 40 years he came out here with his Geiger counter
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.160]  and found radiation levels in excess of 400 CPM keeping in mind that the normal according
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.160]  to the Half Moon Bay review is around 30 David.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.200]  So are you at the same beach that Steve Weiss went to he found the 1400% increase is it
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.440]  also the same beach that we that somebody else found this is the beach that the gentleman
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.960]  went to in the YouTube video I believe Steve Weiss he was around the same the around the
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.640]  same area yes okay all right yeah people should be concerned about that because you know what
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.640]  radiation is radiation we have just to say that it's a radium radium is still dangerous
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.440]  you know radon gas can increase the risk of lung cancer as well and we have had a report
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:45.000]  from Telly Blackwood that up in McClellan Air Force Base which they decommissioned just
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.760]  outside of Sacramento they had a huge amount of radium that they had used for illuminated
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:57.120]  dials in aircraft instruments and it was leftover material they had this massive mound of dirt
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.600]  and the local government there in Sacramento as well as the state government said you can't
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.800]  just leave that here it's going to leach into the ground it's going to get into groundwater
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.320]  and they were pushing back on that the Air Force didn't want to pay to move that and eventually
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.400]  they just buried it there while people were still talking about it.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.560]  Just a moment ago we were talking to one of the locals here and she was telling us about
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.880]  barrels that were dumped somewhere around this location and she's concerned that maybe
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.680]  that's the cause for the radiation now she's not you know so much willing to pull up stakes
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:26.360]  and move she wants an investigation to be done and that's why we're here you know surface
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.640]  beach but maybe we can pan around and give them a shot there are no surfers out here
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.600]  I think I saw one a little bit ago but now they're pretty much gone so even surface
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.200]  beaches and surfers at surface beach.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.560]  Well see that's just the thing I mean when people go out and they take these readings
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:46.280]  and they get really high readings the government's not really interested and just as we saw at
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.560]  McClellan Air Force Base sometimes it's the government themselves that's putting the radioactive
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.560]  material out there you know whether it's cesium 137 from Fukushima or whether it's radium from
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:00.840]  an Air Force Base where they were using it and paint still radiation is dangerous in
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.680]  large amounts it accumulates and that's why you can get radiated by the sun you won't
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:10.720]  be outside all day that's right but you know it's cumulative and when you see these kinds
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.840]  of increases first of all the government really ought to be concerned about it but if the
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.720]  government's not going to be concerned about it the people need to understand what's going
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.840]  on about it and ultimately just like fluoride where you have to take care of yourself you
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.320]  have to get a fluoride filter you also need to be aware of how to protect yourself from
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.440]  this with something like survival shield you know getting some a good source of clean pure
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.600]  iodine like that and that's really ultimately you're responsible for yourself you're responsible
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.400]  for educating yourself and you're responsible for taking the measurements to protect yourself
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.600]  and your family hang on Jakari we're going to get ready to go to a break we'll come back
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.260]  to you want to find out what's going on there and where you guys are going to be headed
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:53.760]  next because we've got the info wars crew out on the west coast of california and not
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.360]  just california i think they're going up a little bit higher as we'll talk to him about
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.920]  where they're going to go looking at this looking to see if there are effects coming
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.320]  from kashima hi folks alex jones here with some important information i want to tell
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.720]  you about matt redhog and his team of patriots over at my patriot supply several years ago
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.520]  matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.480]  was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.080]  a company run by patriots for patriots was born my patriot supply has never taken a loan
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.320]  or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over

[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:20.360]  uk as well as the info wars crew on the west coast in california and jacari we were just talking about
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.320]  what you were seeing there at the beach you've taken some readings that were about 10 times normal
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:31.720]  background radiation we had an expert a electrical engineer who manufactures geiger counters he got at
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:39.000]  that same beach about 1400 increase so it's not just you guys as amateurs you are amateurs out there
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.240]  but you know how to read a geiger counter and certainly the guy who makes them knows how to
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:49.160]  read them were you guys headed next well david will finish up here then we're going to start up the
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.480]  coast we have a few fish markets we're going to hit and we'll hit several beaches we hit one this
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.080]  morning and we'll show you all those reports we're going to go down to the sand and show you guys
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.640]  the readings that we got a little bit ago we'll put up a video straight to youtube of when we went
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.960]  down to the sands and keeping in mind that the normal here is supposedly 30 we got things around
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:11.160]  272 80 so we'll show you all that but for right now in the meantime we have the guys with the
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:15.720]  geiger counter so i want to take a step over here david and see what the guys got yeah let's take a
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:22.760]  look at that okay so we're here with the info wars crew and you can see the shot right here we have
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.920]  102 96 well above the uh the told 30 which is to be normal tell me your thoughts on this
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:36.600]  yeah we've seen readings as high as 120 here so it's not concerning me you know high as uh 100
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.200]  120 130 and like i said when we went down below the bluffs we were hitting around 270 so the info
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:46.360]  wars crew is here we're keeping an eye on this we're trying to get the word out to as many people
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.840]  and even ask people what they think it is you know some people say it's uh uh radioactive barrels
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.880]  or other types of waste that may have been dumped in the sea we just want to talk to the people
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.520]  inform the people and see what they think it is okay well thank you jacari we'll be looking back
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:03.480]  for your reports uh alex will be back tomorrow and he'll be talking to you and of course as
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.040]  you said your reports will be going up on our channel on our youtube channel as well as the
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.600]  outlet news channel on youtube well present planet dot tv that's right we'll have some reports tonight
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.120]  let's go back to uh paul watson in the uk you know paul this article that you had about 1400
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.680]  percent certainly it's something that we should be worried about whether or not it's from fukushima
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.400]  certainly the guy who's an expert who manufactures geiger counters he was worried enough about it to
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.560]  take it back and do a spectrum analysis he found that it didn't have cesium 137 which would be the
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:38.360]  fingerprint showing that it's from man-made radiation source but if there's a lot of toxic
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.880]  waste that's put out there just like a mcclellan air force base just buried their radium waste
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.960]  right there at the air force base over the concerns of the local authorities there over the state
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:54.920]  authorities who told them not to do it they just did it so the government as well as corporations
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.480]  can just plop out toxic waste like this and and there ought to be a concern about where that's
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.720]  coming from well yeah then they lecture us all day about global warming yeah but the the concern is
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:13.080]  we don't find out about a lot of this stuff until decades later in some cases and back in 2011 the
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:19.240]  new york academy of sciences came out with a report that said over the past of the previous 24 years
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.960]  there's one million people had died as a result of shinobal radiation of course the nuclear disaster
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:34.520]  in 1986 now studies have shown that fukushima has released 10 to 100 times the amount of radiation
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.560]  into the ocean compared compared to shinobal now shinobal was obviously a different kind of event
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:45.000]  most of the radioactivity was released into the air into the atmosphere but the fact that it took
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:52.200]  24 years to determine that it had been responsible for killing nearly a million people now we already
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:59.800]  see reports of japanese kids having thyroid cancers higher thyroid cancers as a result of fukushima
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:05.320]  it's going to take decades before we know for sure but you know this took 24 years to find
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:11.720]  out that figure of one million deaths attributable to shinobal so we don't find out about this stuff
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:17.160]  until decades later in many cases which is why we need to be concerned about it now that's right it
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.440]  really bothers me when i see some of these articles well nobody has died at fukushima it's like you
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.960]  don't know that because in most cases unless somebody gets a massive massive dose of radiation
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.920]  if they do like in a nuclear sub accident they can die in a matter of days but that's not usually the
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.960]  way people die usually what you see is an increased amount of birth defects just like we saw that
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:45.240]  uh calf that sea calf the whale calf that was a symes twin you see a lot of birth defects things like
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.120]  you were talking about the sailor who traveled across the ocean 3000 miles saw a whale with tumor
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:55.960]  on it but not much else that was alive out there so we see it as a gradual increase in the number
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.280]  of cancers that people get that's the way that it typically happens it's very dishonest of them to
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:07.000]  say well nobody has died of this yet well yeah and it works in slow motion doesn't it yes the same
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.960]  thing happens with everything if there's not an immediate drastic impact then people try and dismiss
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:18.520]  it and downplay it but it's a long-term concern and you know it's only been what three and a half years
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.480]  since fukushima happened so we're gonna we're gonna be getting more cancers we're already seeing it in
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:27.880]  the wildlife and we're beginning to see it with humans now i find it very interesting there was
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:33.000]  an article on drudge about how the vienna austria police went to a dumpster because they got high
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.120]  radiation readings turned out to just be some diapers that were contaminated with that radioactive
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.200]  iodine from a hospital but don't you think the government is looking for for that in the united
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:46.440]  states and maybe they're seeing high levels of radiation and they don't even care enough about us
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:52.520]  to investigate the source of that we're gonna be right back stay tuned we're on the march the empires
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:30:03.480]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.880]  lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist

[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:17.240]  why are the social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.120]  the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:27.640]  water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce

[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:21.560]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:32.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david nightfully in for alex i have on the line
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.720]  paul joseph watson from the uk and we're going to be going to leon macadoo here in austin there's
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.360]  a hunger strike that is going on to stop fluoridation of the water and we're going to have a live
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.880]  coverage of that in just a few minutes from leon at the state capital but paul i want to talk to
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.120]  we've been talking about the radiation on the beaches and of course we've been talking to jacari
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.080]  jackson crew out on the west coast of california taking their own measurements and going up and
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:02.120]  down the coast for the next week they're going to be filing reports here live with alex on the news
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:08.200]  as well as on the nightly news but i wanted to talk to you about this article on a prison planet
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:17.480]  about the difference from 1974 and 2014 time magazine was talking about a polar vortex
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:24.200]  back in 1974 except then it was global cooling and now it's all about global warming you want to
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:30.040]  talk about that what you take on that article well i mean isn't it amazing that global warming
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:35.880]  alarmists claim you can't site cold weather as an example of global cooling when they routinely
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:41.240]  site hot weather as evidence of global warming whenever summer comes around you know they'd
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:47.240]  like to have their cake and eat it but basically the bastion of all scientific knowledge according
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:55.160]  to them the united nations ipcc said in 2007 that human induced climate change would cause
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:02.920]  less frequent cold air outbreaks despite that they're now claiming in publications like the guardian
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:09.560]  and of course time magazine as you mentioned that it was because of a reduction in arctic sea ice
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:15.560]  that has caused this this record cooling spell now of course arctic sea ice has increased by
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:21.720]  9 000 cubic kilometers over the past year in fact after the previous summer it got even bigger
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:29.080]  um polar bears penguins glaciers they're all thriving they told us ice free arctic summers
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:35.080]  would be here by 2014 complete nonsense the arctic's growing but now they're saying that
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.440]  this massive cooling spell that you've been experiencing over there is caused by us it's
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:47.480]  all our fault it's global warming yet time magazine the same publication that now blames
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:54.200]  this polar vortex on man-made climate change back in a 1974 article and this is posted on
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:02.440]  prisonplanet.com blamed the same polar vortex on global cooling yeah yeah you know by every metric
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:07.320]  that they have their models have failed their predictions have failed everything that you can
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.880]  measure says that it isn't happening that it's exactly the opposite is happening from what
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:17.800]  they predicted i remember back in the first earth day in 1970 it was all about global cooling they
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.960]  were predicting a new ice age at that time and then they just completely threw that on the rubbish
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.880]  bin although we saved the articles obviously we've got the 1974 magazine that shows them
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:33.480]  using the same excuse that they're using today to try to explain this event but it's not just an
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:40.280]  event it's actually a long process this is a long trend a 17-year trend showing that their models
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:47.640]  don't work and they they swap cooling for warming every 40 years and it's because as the club of
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.800]  rome said in the 1990 document the first global revolution humanity has to be the common enemy
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.120]  no matter what the weather no matter what the climate they said quote in searching for a common
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:03.880]  enemy against whom we can unite we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:09.400]  water shortages famine and light would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:16.600]  intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself so again there's the elite like some
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.520]  invading alien species declaring the rest of humanity to be the enemy and that they will
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:29.880]  create the threat of global warming as the means of again centralizing power taxing us into oblivion
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.360]  and basically restricts impersonal freedom it was all about blaming us that's what it's all about
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.240]  that's right it was all about blaming people for what was going on and so even at times where
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:44.200]  they could show a trend of warming there was a lot of pushback and say you know what the sun
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:49.720]  actually has a lot more influence on the climate than what people are doing and certainly we can
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.920]  see that now from observation we can see that with a record rise in co2 we've had global cooling
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:02.520]  and that has been going on for the last 17 years and and they can't really dispute the facts they
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:08.120]  can only try to explain them away and spend them and as you point out it is a method for trying to
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:13.720]  establish some kind of a global regime some kind of global governance and it's also a way for them
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.920]  to set up I believe something like the Federal Reserve but on a global basis so instead of
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:25.480]  having us pay for every dollar that's printed paying interest they can on a global basis have us
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:30.520]  pay for every bit of energy that we use to people like Algor with their carbon credits
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:37.720]  it's all part of this blueprint which they seem to be using which is atlas shrugged as an
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.000]  instruction manual you know it's like Obama and the EPA shutting down the coal plants they're
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.160]  actively attacking free market capitalism and one of the main ways they do that is through
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:55.560]  this climate change hysteria so I mean with global warming I mean when you've got Princeton
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:00.680]  physicist Dr. Will Harper who says that these polar vortices have been around forever and that's
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:07.080]  always the argument the planet has cooled and warmed for eons it always has done whether humans
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.360]  have been around or not but they need to blame us we need to be the source of the blame for them
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:18.120]  to taxes control our personal lives into oblivion because it's all about collectivism it's all about
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.080]  centralizing power into their hands and they constantly need an excuse to do it it's like the
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:31.080]  the Saxo Bank CEO which is another article upon info wars.com said that you know politicians need
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.760]  to create an irrational world because they wouldn't exist there'd be no need for their services
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:43.240]  in a rational world so they need to create crises that produce this irrational world
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:49.320]  then they compose as the saviors they can centralize power into their hands and that's the way it
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:54.920]  works they need crises they need an irrational world in order to remain relevant and climate
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:00.760]  change hysteria is one of those tools in which they use to to remain relevant in the world in
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:06.360]  an irrational world. That's right and and what they're doing is again you talk about this being
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:12.760]  a bank guy warning about a collapse into a totalitarian society trying to create a justification
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:19.400]  for what they're doing certainly this carbon tax credit scheme that has a banksters written all
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.760]  over it i mean it is exactly like what they did with the federal reserve except just on a global
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:30.600]  basis but you'd mentioned earlier the guardian and they've been very active in pushing the global
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:36.120]  warming agenda i think it's really funny that at the beginning of of december they were talking about
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:41.240]  this expedition that was going to go to Antarctica and they were going to follow the footsteps of
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:44.840]  an explorer there from a hundred years earlier and they were going to take measurements and
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.320]  they were going to scare everybody about how much ice that we had lost and and remember that this is
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:56.360]  not the arctic this is the Antarctic this is the south pole this is where it is summer right now
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.120]  and they went down there and they not only got stuck but the rescue ship that went after them
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.680]  got stuck today they finally got free after quite some time but i i think that's just the height of
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:11.400]  irony right there and wasn't it an american ice breaking ship that then had to go and rescue the
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:16.840]  other ship that had been stuck so again and of course the the expedition was about researching
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:23.000]  global warming so again another mammoth waste of time and taxpayer money on a completely
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.480]  non-existent threat yeah just wasting millions and millions on it again and it's it's a complete
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.480]  false yep well thank you for joining us paul we've got leon macadoo at the state capital and we want
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.320]  to go there and see what's happening with the demonstration against fluoride thank you so
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.600]  much for joining us those articles uh 1400 increase in radiations covered by uh the dredge
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.840]  report and you can see that on info wars dot com leon are you there i am here i just want to reiterate
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:56.840]  we are not at the capital we are at austin city hall we're at the corner of caesar's
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:03.320]  where the corner of caesar chavez and la vaca uh at austin city hall the guys are on their 10th day
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.800]  of hunger strike we've got a few people that are already kind of lining up and the guys it
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.400]  did rain last night so they had to go up under i guess city of austin allowed them to sit on
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.320]  their property last night as they were getting rained on so they were able to move under some
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:23.800]  shelter we've got tony scott here in his dance pants i told him to bring him out to get people
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:30.280]  pumped up and he is full of energy not letting this cold weather and rain stop him from getting the
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:35.560]  word out there and that's important it's not only been some really really cold nights but it's also
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.200]  been raining and cold out there and and these guys have been sticking it out on a hunger strike
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:44.360]  i apologize for giving people the state capital it's actually the austin city hall it's at the
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.680]  corner of caesar chavez and la vaca street so i just want to let everyone know who is coming
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.920]  to support we've had a few people that have been driving around honking horns and stuff we did find
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:59.640]  out that you can actually get your parking validated they have parking here at city hall
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:05.320]  and you can get your your parking validated there with a city clerk so you can see 10 days of hunger
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:11.800]  strike wow and then we're we're up here back in the back i'll let you i gotta say the guys are a
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:19.160]  little discouraged today i mean i get i get supremely hangry if i miss one meal these guys are
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:27.320]  10 days in in the freezing cold rain and um you know they're just uh i'll let them tell it in their
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:33.080]  own words but it's a little slow you know it's it's a difficult thing getting getting something
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.320]  like getting people to be passionate about something like this and that's why all of our
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.280]  listeners all of our viewers need to come out show your support that you know you can get your
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.000]  parking validated just come out for an hour just let these guys know that you support what they're
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.760]  doing you're here for them well you know i've i've been to a lot of political events in my life
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:58.200]  and i can tell you that when it comes to political cause it's very rare for people to take time out
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:03.880]  of their day to go show up that's why a small increase can be very effective you don't need
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.960]  to have thousands of people i mean if you get thousands of people they definitely pay attention
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:12.040]  but if you get dozens of people they will pay attention because it's very hard for people to
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:17.160]  take time out of their normal day and go do something with these guys are really hardcore like you said
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:23.240]  it's day number 10 on their hunger strike and it's raining out there it has been raining this morning
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.400]  certainly so i imagine a lot of people who might have thought they might stop by there uh did not
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:32.040]  go because of the rain but these guys have been sticking it out through cold weather through rain
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:37.640]  through everything and doing a hunger strike to drive home a point right exactly and nicholas
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.800]  was actually saying that some of his friends were saying you know you're crazy for doing this the
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.440]  government doesn't care that you're on hunger strike what did you have to say to them the hunger
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:50.040]  strikes not about the government caring the hunger strike is about bringing awareness to something
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:54.520]  we feel very passionately about and it's about bringing that to you and making you feel that
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:59.960]  passion as well yeah exactly the government is not going to change they're not going to do anything
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:05.960]  that we want unless we demand and let them know that we care and this is a vital issue to us
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.680]  they're not going to do any change they've proven that that's why they've set up the system to make
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:15.560]  it so compartmentalized that you have to go through jump through all these hoops in order to get any
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:20.920]  change but you've actually learned of some new opportunities that can possibly help get this
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:25.560]  thing at least brought to the city council yeah there's something locally we can look at it's
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.280]  called home rule and it's basically a local referendum with 20 000 signatures we can get it
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.960]  on the ballot for this november's elections right and so that'll be a paper petition we've got the
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.240]  change.org petition that you guys can go check out online it's at change.org and then you would
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:46.600]  austin floride hunger strike we definitely want that one that's going to send an alert to everyone
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:52.280]  on city council all of our elected representatives as well but these guys are actually the next step
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:57.800]  i guess is to get an actual paper petition that people in austin we'll need you to sign it we'll
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:03.800]  need your voter id it's a legit petition it's not me going out and trying to convince everyone to
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:09.880]  ban water in town this is the real deal and we're going to need 20 000 signatures is not a lot but
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:14.200]  it's going to probably take a lot of a lot of grassroots efforts to make this happen but it's
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:21.000]  tangible this isn't like trying to impeach obama this is like taking poison out of the water this is
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.200]  this is doable it doesn't make sense and if people are presented with the facts i think people can
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.600]  really get behind this and it's been done before in other locations people have had referendums
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.720]  where they get it out because so many times the politicians want it there because there's a lot
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.800]  of money to be made by the corporations disposing of their industrial waste their fluoride industrial
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:48.840]  waste into our water supply you know even if people don't understand the health issues even if they
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.400]  think that it is safe and effective as i said earlier in the program i think a lot of people
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.240]  you can get them to stop and think about even if it were safe and effective would you really want
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.360]  to force medicate the population through just dumping this into the water supply i mean the
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.000]  amount that's appropriate for different people to have is going to vary quite a bit and of course
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.880]  if you just dump your medication into the water supply then people are going to get all kinds
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:17.160]  of different concentrations of it it's not an effective way to medicate the population but
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.840]  then it also brings into question whether or not that's a legitimate thing for a government to be
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:27.560]  doing should they be medicating the society against its will and forcing us to pay for that right
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:31.560]  and nicolas actually that's one of their their big things that they've raised on the petition
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.280]  is the fact that it is this forced medication which is something that they they can't do without
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:42.200]  our consent is that is that your main concern with the fluoride in the water um my main concern is
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.360]  children losing iq points over this i mean we have families and we have friends that we treat
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:51.320]  like family and this is not allowable i will not have my father go down with bone cancer i will
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:57.480]  not have him have broken hips i will not have my children be more less intelligent excuse me
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:03.560]  because of this practice that my government takes part in exactly and that's the big issue too is
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:09.000]  because it they say it's for the underprivileged to help them you know balance out the ratio there
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.640]  with with because they can't afford dental care but that's that's another big issue is that a lot
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:20.440]  of these people are are using tap water to fill up their baby bottles and there you have a baby
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:26.120]  whose body mass isn't the same as a grown adult so how do you know if that 0.7 parts per million
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:31.160]  is not going to be highly highly toxic to children and i know that there's already a
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.480]  court case going for children i mean it just one to chip away that they've got fluorosis
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.440]  but that's just an aesthetic thing like let's look at the the the issues that it's causing with
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:46.040]  with cancer patients who are highly susceptible to fluoride and and and like you said with taking
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:51.880]  on the bone density bone mass causing fractures there are much bigger things than just modeled
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.920]  teeth that this is this is a big issue that's right and you know a lot of people don't think about
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.040]  this because they haven't looked at the medical issues of it as i mentioned before i had well
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.480]  water so i didn't think too much about what was going into the city water but when i would go into
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.960]  town i would get the city water so you know anytime you're going to a restaurant in austin
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.760]  you're getting that fluoride even if you're filtering your water at home taking that into your
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.400]  own hands to try to protect your family you're still exposed to it in other places when you go
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:23.240]  into the city so it's something that we really ought to be concerned about it's something that
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.680]  we're paying a lot of money to get rid of the industrial waste of companies that would otherwise
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.400]  have to treat this as toxic waste instead they can dump it in the water they can charge the
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:39.560]  taxpayers they can force medicaid us for something that we know is not safe and it's not effective
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:44.440]  well leon thank you so much for this report and hopefully we can we're going to continue to follow
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:49.400]  this story and hopefully we can get people to stand maybe on a day when it's not raining we might be
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.400]  able to get a little bit higher turnout well i think there's more people on their way they're
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.280]  circling around honking now letting us know that they're going to come support uh piers here visiting
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:05.000]  from so cal and he ran into the guys last night i'm going to forego a few meals to show his support
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.280]  for what these guys are out here doing but what do you want to say anything you want to just want
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:15.480]  to tell people out in austin uh bring the pressure man like we've got to get this changed and if they
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.560]  don't do it we'll do it with this referendum and we'll get it done that's right 1776 worldwide thank
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.920]  you very much leon thanks for the report and of course it would help if you have the right
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.560]  address and i was giving out the wrong one earlier that's at the austin city hall the corner of
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:35.400]  cesar chavez and la vaca here in austin so show up and support these people i mean they have been
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.400]  they're hardcore they understand the issues and you know if you look at this if you investigate it
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:45.480]  if you read the harvard studies you understand what an important issue this is these people understand
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:49.800]  that that's why that for 10 days they've been on a hunger strike they've stayed out there in record
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:56.120]  cold weather as well as today in the rain so try to support them it really does make a difference
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:01.160]  when you show up and tell the government what you want to see happen we're going to be right back
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:06.920]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:12.280]  family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people so why are the
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:18.360]  social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:23.640]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.160]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info

[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:19.400]  story that's on the judge report about a 1400 increase in radiation observed at california
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.480]  beach we've sent our own info wars crew out to california and they call back with their first
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.880]  report told us it was a thousand percent increase over what you would normally expect to see in
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.760]  background radiation there on the beach and we've got alex jones calling in right now to
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:38.520]  give us his take on the fukushima emergency alex absolutely i am sitting here in my truck getting
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.800]  ready for my uh wonderful uncle general that's in about an hour from now i think everybody's
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.160]  prayers for him but i'll be back tonight back on the radio tomorrow and then listening
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:53.240]  to the free iphone app right here with my son in the truck uh rax is with me and you guys are just
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.440]  doing an amazing job and i wanted to say something about about what we're doing it's about resistance
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:06.360]  and it's about awakening and and we are the real media we are hyper professional and telling the
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:12.200]  truth it's standing up for what it's right and for getting the word out and that's what this is
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:17.960]  about worldwide we're turning the tide against florida in australia england europe the united states
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:24.120]  it's being removed from more cities than it's being put into we are winning and so that's what
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:31.240]  all of this is about is is taking over cyberspace for the majority of people to indicate the reason
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:36.120]  our reporters are in san francisco and are going to go all the way up to seattle that fly back down
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.280]  to southern california over the next week is to get our own readings with four professional
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.880]  uh one of them extremely high grade the others are a bit brave to cost seven hundred two thousand
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:56.360]  dollars we are there with four professional geiger counters and uh showing how the local news
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.600]  imagine this big story will not cover and by the way the normal background carry was saying
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:08.280]  30 that's the kashima it's been up to 30 it was previously according to science we've interviewed
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:19.640]  and uh 14 micro lamps they were getting stuff at 300 uh you know 250 or or higher so ladies and
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:26.360]  gentlemen it's a lot more than a thousand times it's a lot more than probably 1400 times and so
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:31.320]  we've got physicists that are advising us we're crashing the numbers that are professional
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:36.360]  awesome reporters are out there doing in the radiation to bring folks this information and
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.240]  if you're being in a few weeks it's not a big issue but when you're in that months or years
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:47.080]  even the local paper had to admit then it's an issue they are trying to cover up how serious
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:52.440]  this is and we need everybody to contact the dinosaur media and to make them cover this
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:57.240]  quite frankly i thought that when the news came out last week and this week and grudge picked it up
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:03.960]  uh that uh that was forced the dinosaur media to cover it but only rt only grudge report dot com
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:09.560]  only info wars dot com only prison planet dot com are covering the fact that this thing don't show
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:16.360]  right now that that that other physicists other professionals that are out there testing that
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:20.680]  are showing the same thing that now hundreds of other people are putting on youtube and the
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:27.240]  health department confirmed this week for the county of san francisco's based in yes it is five
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.680]  times we do confirm that by the low reading but it's no big deal and we don't know where it's
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:38.680]  coming from the point is the radiation is up and the radiation is going up all over the place
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:44.600]  something is going on i mean there's dumping toxic waste everywhere you name it just what you
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:49.720]  were saying earlier so this is a big deal then that we're out there covering this when the other
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:54.840]  citizen journalists who were more important than mainstream media mainstream media have shown
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:00.280]  themselves to be traitors they have shown themselves to be globalists we're more important we're
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:06.040]  better than them we're not just as good as them i mean i love it it took me years to realize this
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.840]  because we're we're humble we're you know we're oh we're just here you know we don't know what
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:15.960]  this means so you know we're not professionals now we are professionals because we love the food
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:22.360]  we're real much breakers real strong hats done to reporters out there finding out the truth and so
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:28.360]  are all our listeners you are the media america you are just as important as info wars you are just
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:32.440]  as important as drug reports you are just as important as world that daily you are just as
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.720]  important okay now now you're just as important as us you're way more important than the shell
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:47.800]  out traitor car this is gcm the genesis communications radio network
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:55.640]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:59:01.720]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:09.160]  and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:15.160]  of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives our water is filled with toxic poisons

[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:22.200]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in the studio and we've got alex
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.880]  jones on the phone and we were just talking about the crew that's out in california we sent them
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:37.240]  out there with the highest quality geiger counters that money can buy and it's not just us it's the
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:41.320]  guy who actually makes the geiger counters was concerned about the levels of radiation
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:47.480]  and that we found on the beach he found what he said was 1400 higher than what he expected to see
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:52.440]  that's a article that is up on info wars dot com and is a link on the drudge report right now but
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:58.440]  not only did a perfect did the guy who actually electrical engineer who actually makes geiger
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.520]  counters found this we've got our people out there with professional geiger counters and
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.840]  they've seen 10 times what they expected to see but as alex pointed out that's based on a new normal
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:15.080]  that they have set up a normal that is post fukushima they raised what they defined as being
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:19.720]  a normal background radiation alex you were just talking about that do you want to continue to tell
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:26.120]  us what you think about this fukushima issue i mean in closing you've got a bunch of nests coming
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.200]  up the van to the good yard it would break it's well coming out the bottom of the hour when i
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:35.720]  get on here i'm not bragging hey we're professional hey we're big i'm saying we need to understand
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:41.480]  the the hierarchy here the state-run media have shown themselves to be disreputable they're not
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:46.360]  covering this they're not covering anything they covered up the deadly uh world trade center dust
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:52.120]  and called me if it's there's there's for about eight years and blocked aid to the firefighters
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:59.080]  police and others so understand you have twitter state-run globalist collaborator media then you
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:05.720]  have a real new emerging media the info wars dot com front of work dot com are the cutting edge
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:10.600]  up but i'm trying to explain to our listeners you're the media too you're just as important
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:19.320]  as david night or as joseph ferrah or as a bat drudge or as a joseph curle or or any of the
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:27.080]  real media there's real media like amber lion i can name it uh leon macadam and then there's
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:32.200]  crater media so all of you it was citizen journalists that got this to break in the last
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:37.160]  week we picked it up forced one local paper to talk to the county health department who
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.880]  confirms yes the radiation's five times what it should they'll just make that the new normal
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:47.960]  and then when it's 10 times higher they'll make that the new normal that's the point the media
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:54.040]  isn't covering this they are absolutely derelict in their duty and in their common sense itself
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:00.840]  preservation and so that's why i called in because i don't i hear our own humble reporters
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.360]  but well rather with professional gather counters but we're not professional we are
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:09.400]  professional reporters sure we're not physicists we have physicists advising us and the health
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:13.960]  department is to turn the radiation tires but my point is the mainstream media they act like
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:19.960]  they are god they act like they're a red carpet when our reporters compared to them are literally
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:25.880]  a thousand feet tall to a picnic and so that's what i'm saying and our listeners are just as
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:31.000]  important as we are we are the future we are the media we need to start not being arrogant
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.120]  but being more confident about the fact that we're breaking massive worldwide news right now
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.920]  and we need to be confident in this game this football game of life to take it to the enemy
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.960]  and to win this game we are beginning to win the game we're beginning to wake people up good things
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.840]  are beginning to happen but we all gotta have confidence all gotta be aggressive all gotta
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:56.440]  focus on the facts of the truth and then stand up and be leaders people are looking for leadership
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:59.960]  and i'm telling you i wasn't looking to be a leader i don't want to be a leader but i don't
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:04.840]  want to be a slave and that's why i've become a leader out of the test city all of you are leaders
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:09.880]  and it's time for those of us who love liberty to get confident to get aggressive and do us a
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:16.440]  juggler of the globalist because the radiation is pretty good going up the toxic way gmo the
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:25.400]  water i'm not rolling over i'm not dead yet i'm not given to the new world order i'm standing
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.280]  up humanity's coming back it's over we're gonna expose them no matter what they're gonna do
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:34.680]  they're keeping the media from reporting this right now the media is being told to shut up
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:40.360]  we're gonna force it we're gonna blow their block a point of god bless you all all right that's
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:44.760]  alex jones calling in from the road we're going to have a report from jacari jackson and the info
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:51.160]  wars crew and as alex pointed out the local media is not concerned about these humongous increases
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:55.960]  in radiation on their own beach so we went all the way to california and we've got a report coming
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:00.360]  up right after the break with jacari jackson and we're gonna show you what the real radiation

[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:20.280]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encourage
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:26.520]  salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:32.600]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:39.160]  deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.000]  jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and we're going to be going in just a few minutes
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.400]  to jacari jackson who's with the info war crew on the west coast in california at the beach where
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:40.200]  they found high levels of radioactive readings there we ought to ask the local media why they
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:45.400]  aren't reporting this as alex was just saying we're going places where the local media fears to tread
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.120]  where they won't report on this how many puff pieces for the people in san francisco how many
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:56.520]  puff pieces have you seen on the local news but they're not interested when somebody finds a 500
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.360]  percent increase in radiation or when they see a 1400 increase in radiation what our crew is
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:07.160]  seeing out there right now is a thousand percent increase in radiation so you have the local official
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.480]  go out there said yeah that's right it is 500 percent it is probably just disposable eating
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:16.200]  utensils are you serious i mean if they were that radioactive do you think that they would
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:22.520]  allow them to be sold we just saw an article from vienna austria that the police there went to the
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:29.080]  has they called hazmat uh group on the dumpster because they saw high radioactive reading there
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.720]  and it turned out that it was just waste from the hospital they know what's out there they're
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:39.400]  just not telling us because they don't it doesn't fit their agenda they're saying that they don't
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:45.000]  want to panic us but they certainly will panic us over things that are not dangerous they'll take
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:51.880]  away our fireplaces our wood stoves over particulate matter when it's not really a threat they will
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.120]  do all kinds of things in the name of global warming they'll scare us try to scare us to death
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:01.560]  over global warming when there's no data showing that that's happening so we sent our crew out
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:07.240]  there to see what the readings actually are because it's the national media is not reporting on this
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:12.120]  the local media is not reporting on this the government doesn't care so we want you to see
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:16.120]  what's going on we see that there's stuff out there that is lowering iq that they're putting
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.880]  into the water like fluoride and there are things that can raise your iq like iodine nascent iodine
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:28.360]  can raise the iq of kids who take that especially the younger children it has a positive influence
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:33.480]  on their iq just like fluoride has a negative influence on that there are things that you can
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:39.320]  do that will help your family as you try to then move the government to do the right thing to get
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:44.760]  them to stop putting fluoride in the water to get the government to report and try to find the sources
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:49.160]  of this radiation they're not even interested in looking at it whether or not it's from Fukushima
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:53.720]  it's still concerns people it still should concern people it's still a danger to people
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:58.760]  when you see these kind of increases in radiation so right now we're going to join jacari jackson
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:03.800]  in california jacari what are you guys seeing now where are you right now well we've come down from
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:07.480]  the bus where we were earlier so now we're going to get down low to the ground with these gager
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:11.080]  counters you have to get down low to the ground so we're going to drop a little bit and you can also
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:20.840]  see camera the radiation also so and remember you're taking a reading yeah it's breaking up a
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:27.640]  little bit sorry we're breaking up yeah yes we have a reading of 148 they're saying what's normal
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:34.840]  for this area is about 30 so we have higher level right now once again we have to keep low to the
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:42.440]  ground to get an accurate reading we have about 170 174 172 there we go got a split screen for the
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.760]  people who aren't watching this we've got one camera on the geiger counter the other one is showing
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:51.400]  where jacari is in relationship to the ground they're walking along taking readings yes we have
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:12:03.560]  176 180 so it looks like they're increasing here 188 200 we hit 200 let's move up here 214
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:11.480]  210 now he's walking as he's taking these measurements so this is not something that is
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:17.800]  one particular isolated spot that maybe we get a high reading on it's escalated across the beach
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:21.800]  is what you're seeing here is jacari is walking across the beach yes and we're we're having a
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:28.040]  various readings here 200 plus 220 and remember local media saying 30 is what's normal so about
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:34.680]  212 right now so very high readings whatever it is whether it's a cco 137 or if it's other
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:40.200]  things like radium it's high it's in excess of what should actually be out here david well and
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.200]  you know jacaris we were just saying it doesn't have to be from Fukushima to be harmful i mean
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:49.400]  radiation high levels of radiation whether it's from a natural source like radon or whether it
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:55.720]  is something like radium we saw that at mclellan air force base the air force there decided over
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:00.600]  the objections of the local government as well as the state government of california they decided
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:06.680]  to go ahead and bury a massive amount of radium contaminated soil into the ground where it's going
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:10.920]  to leach into the water supply and of course this stuff is cumulative that's one of the reasons why
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:15.720]  we tell people to protect themselves with iodine because one of the first places that that's going
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:21.000]  to have an effect is in your thyroid your thyroid is going to soak that up thyroid cancer is one of
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:27.400]  the things that really spikes after radiation exposure so when you take potassium iodide in
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:32.840]  an emergency what it does is it fills up your thyroid to try to keep your thyroid from taking
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:39.720]  in the more radioactive elements and so you can do that for an emergency with potassium iodide but
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.880]  that's not really a supplement that's not really a good form of iodine for you wouldn't want to take
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.760]  that on a daily basis but if you get something that is a pure source of iodine like nascent iodine
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.960]  survival shield that's something you can take to help your family to help children with iq points
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.680]  it's something that is a positive influence it's a supplement that we no longer have in what we
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:02.840]  normally eat and what are you saying right now you're saying 242 that's really high now we're going to
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.920]  turn around and go towards the water now okay so Dave we're heading here towards the water we're
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:14.520]  seeing 200 plus pretty much the whole time we've been down here 210 right now once again trying
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:19.160]  to get low to the ground to get some accurate readings here so we got 182
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.960]  so just for people to know this this isn't just in one area we're moving across the beach
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:31.240]  yes yeah he's just high radiation levels you can see the camera for those of you who are watching
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.560]  we've got one camera focused on the geiger counter the other one is focused on jacari
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:39.480]  and you can see that they're walking and as they're walking they're taking these radiation levels
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:44.680]  and there should be 30 cpm that's what they're saying is normal now yeah right now it's about
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:50.920]  82 okay so it's actually going down as you're getting closer to the water water yes but it's
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:56.440]  very high up at the beach so that may indicate that it is some kind of radioactive dump this up
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.200]  there as opposed to something's coming in off of the water as it's going down as we were talking
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:04.200]  to one of the locals i'm not sure if i mentioned this earlier but she's telling us out that out
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:09.560]  here somewhere there were a lot of waste barrels that were dumped and she thinks that that's what
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:13.720]  may be leaching into the water and whether it's that whether it's Fukushima whether it's
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:19.000]  radium or whatever else you know these levels are excessively high yeah exactly and it's
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:25.240]  interesting that the what's what started this really was this 500 reading that an individual
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.680]  did and then put the video up on youtube and it went viral and everybody was asking well why
[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.200]  isn't the city concerned about it why aren't they doing anything about it and so then we had
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:40.120]  a an engineer who actually works for a company that builds geiger counters and he went out and
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:45.560]  looked at it and he saw an even higher level he saw a 1400 increase so he was very concerned
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:50.600]  about it and what he saw was not any cesium 137 which would indicate it's coming from Fukushima
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:57.800]  but he also he saw radium and thorium in the sand there so either way it's something people should
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:02.360]  be concerned about now you're seeing lower levels you're seeing more like the regular background
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:07.560]  levels now you're seeing 30 to 50 against some up here against some rocks i'm seeing about 50s right
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:12.520]  now okay watch out all these rocks out here chicory is moving around the beach and he's taking
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:18.040]  a reading so we can see how the levels are going now further up when you were up away from the water
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:25.960]  that was where you saw the highest readings and we were hitting about 270 280 yeah and say 30 is
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:29.880]  what's normal and david you know there's so many things going on whether it's uh as paul was talking
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:35.880]  about the starfish melting or the bald eagles getting the tumors uh the conjoined whales and
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:40.600]  whatever we can't say all that is directly related to Fukushima but somebody should be taking a look
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:46.680]  at these things what what what is causing this yes exactly we see that happening all across the
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:52.120]  pacific ocean and as paul mentioned there was one fellow who wrote an article about his 3000 mile
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:57.480]  trip this is somebody who had done this before going from japan to california he took a 3000
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:03.480]  nautical mile trip and he wrote an article the ocean is dying he said he saw usually he would see
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:09.960]  abundant evidence of sea life he could just drop his net into the ocean and he would catch a lot of
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:15.960]  fish but he said he didn't see anything when he was coming across except some diseased whale that he
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:21.800]  he saw pretty much in his opinion the pacific ocean between japan and california was essentially dead
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:28.520]  that's right now david we're hitting about 98 close to 100 oh okay over 100 now they're saying
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:34.760]  that 30 is the normal level and you know people we talked to a few people who were aware of the
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:39.720]  situation uh we'll put those reports out later uh one person said he wasn't aware but he was very
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:45.240]  much concerned and he you know was of the opinion that whatever it was whether it's fukushima whether
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.880]  it's radium whatever it is you know it's a excessively high and he's concerned for his family
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:54.200]  now to be clear where you are right now is half moon bay in california right that's just outside
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:18:00.680]  of san francisco is that correct this is uh this is about southwest of san francisco and this is
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:05.000]  surface beach as the locals call it here maybe we can pan around and give them a shot of the water
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.800]  here guys so we're real close to the water here we're looking at that on the map now and and here's
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:14.360]  the beach where they are now you're going to be heading up the same beach uh david i'll just
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:18.200]  interrupt you for one moment it's the same beach where the gentleman came out here with his geiger
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:22.280]  counter and started the whole deal now our next mission uh we're going to be moving all the way
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:27.480]  up the coast all the way up to washington so we'll stop at various fisheries other beaches and so
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.880]  forth and we're going to do a lot of this stuff get as in depth as we can and also talk to locals
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:37.240]  and see what they think is causing these uh these reactions okay that's great well thank you jacari
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:41.400]  i think the people there at half moon bay in that area the people of san francisco
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:45.800]  they need to be concerned about this they need to get some answers some logical answers from
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:51.480]  their local local government there not just uh this ridiculous excuse that is probably disposable
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:57.400]  eating utensils that that's just there is a real issue there up in the sand away from the water
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:02.360]  they're seeing consistently high levels of radiation as they move around and we'll be joining
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.520]  jacari they're going to be doing this for about a week going up and down the west coast they're
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:10.840]  going to go all the way up to seattle and then you're going to go down to southern california
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:14.760]  and at the bottom of the hour we're going to be talking to anthony gucciardi about
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:20.520]  what he his take on fukushima we've seen a lot of things happen he called up and asked the government
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:27.320]  about their 14 million purchases 14 million units of potassium iodide that they purchased and
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:32.280]  they want that in just 30 days that was a story that paul joseph watson broke when he looked through
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:37.000]  fed biz dot op and of course when anthony called up the government and talked to them about that
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:43.480]  they were dodging and weaving and eventually they just hung up on him so we're going to have anthony
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:48.040]  give us his take on what's going on after talking to that fellow and what he sees happening as we
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:54.040]  see events across the pacific ocean and again it's ultimately up to you to first take care of your
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:58.520]  family take care of yourself and then try to get the government to take care of the community at
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:03.800]  large ask some questions because we see high levels here to tell you about how you can help spread

[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:31.960]  maybe it's a bad, bad. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in studio with
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:38.120]  Anthony Gucciardi and we've been talking about radiation we've been talking about Paul Joseph
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:42.360]  Watson's article we talked to Paul from the UK he's got an article that's linked on the Drudge
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:47.960]  Report that's uh 1400 radiation hotspot found on the San Francisco beach you can find that at
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:53.640]  infowars.com and we've got our own crew out there we've been talking to Jacare Jackson and the
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:59.800]  infowars crew that's out on half moon bay just outside of san francisco they recorded a thousand
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:03.560]  percent increase in radiation and they walked across the beach they were seeing this pretty
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:08.920]  consistently as they walked across the beach a very high elevated level from what people would
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:15.080]  expect what's your take on this anthony well the secret here is that we already know from independent
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:19.240]  investigations into Fukushima when the japanese government was saying everything's fine you have
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:25.640]  nothing to worry about they emptied 78 percent of the radioactive waste and material into the
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:30.840]  pacific ocean so there's no question the media right now and the government's acting like it's
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.240]  a conspiracy theory to even say that that happened or that's a conspiracy theory to even say that
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:40.360]  the Fukushima plant melted down and radiation went into the pacific ocean there's no question
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:44.440]  that it did and there's no question that it is affecting us right now and it is coming to the
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:51.160]  west coast i mean we look at all these incidents the 1400 percent increase in radiation the conjoined
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:56.520]  whale calves the gray whale calves for the first time ever they were mutated and conjoined and
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:00.920]  they're all dying along the west coast the eagles getting the tumors everything is coming together
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:07.000]  starfish melting some of these incidents might be separate but ultimately there's no question
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:11.880]  that 78 percent of all the radioactive material from Fukushima which was two and a half times higher
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:16.840]  than tepco admitted in that study they found that so tepco lied all about it the japanese
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:22.280]  government lied all about it said people stay in Fukushima everything's fine when it was massive
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:26.920]  amounts of radiation and recently by the way it was the highest ever coming from Fukushima so it's
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:32.440]  not over expert say it could last thousands and thousands of years so there's no debate it is here
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:37.720]  it is coming to the west coast and a good smart government as i've said before would actually
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:42.280]  buy potassium iodide for its citizens even though potassium iodide is not the best it's an emergency
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:46.840]  thing they would buy really nascent iodide but anyway they would inform their citizens and
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:51.720]  say hey this is happening so they can prepare themselves but instead they're denying it and
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:56.360]  they're promoting this delusion that everything's fine yeah and that the radiation is just from
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:01.560]  red painted utensils or you know anything it's it's not the fact that a massive nuclear plant
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:07.000]  exploded an empty 78 percent of all its radioactive material into the ocean which is actually going
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.520]  flowing over to the west coast no no no it's utensils or it's just all in your head you know
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:18.600]  the wildlife melting and all of this hot spot radiation as far away as st louis that's nothing
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.680]  so there's no question they're covering itself you know it's a pattern of behavior that we see
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:26.280]  over and over again first of all they say that they don't want to panic people and yet they have no
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:30.920]  problem at all panicking us if it fits their agenda when it's something like global warming they want
[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:36.680]  to panic us because they want us to do to follow in their solution they want to present to us a crisis
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:41.560]  which in most cases is a phony crisis so that we can buy into their solution but when we have a
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.800]  real crisis like we see here they want to deny it you know what i see you're talking about them
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:51.240]  just dumping this stuff into the ocean it's very similar isn't it to the way they just dump fluoride
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:57.000]  into the water i mean i put it in there and you know forget about it it's it's also another toxic
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.440]  waste that comes from industrial sources well it's also like the genetic modification of the food
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:07.480]  supply you can't really reverse that even with oil spills which are bad you know in some ways
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.800]  environmentally they kind of clean themselves in this crude oil yeah except when we put those
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.960]  artificial chemicals in to scrub yes then it's actually the worst part about it or to hide it
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:20.920]  yeah exactly which which is the worst thing genetic modification though is very similar to a nuclear
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:26.520]  plant melting down because once something is modified the ultimate genealogy of the other
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.920]  plants and in the spectrum of that arena environmentally are also going to be mutated
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.720]  it propagates that accumulates it exactly and it contaminates organic fields well this is now
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:40.600]  contaminating our food supply in a large way and contaminating the wildlife which are then breeding
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.640]  and becoming mutated and having conjoined gray whales and all this insanity we can't really
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:50.200]  control that very well just like we can't control GMOs which is why everyone on this planet needs to
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:55.800]  can be concerned about Fukushima and usually i'm not for nations coming together through things
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.720]  like the united nations at all we need to come together though and stop Fukushima we need the
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.760]  best scientists from every nation to come together and fix this and you notice they're not promoting
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:07.880]  that though because that's not part of their agenda well they are coming together they're
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:12.680]  coming together as a cover-up warming they're coming for global warming even though the actual
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:17.000]  nuclear commissions are raising and creating new levels raising the rates and creating new
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.840]  levels for Fukushima because that's how bad it is it's worse than Chernobyl and they're saying now
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:26.600]  Yale and other professors are saying the rods most likely will blow up if they're transferred
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:31.720]  improperly and we have homeless people cleaning the area and duct taping up the plant to fix it so
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:36.600]  this is absolutely concerning meltdown level and no one's doing anything about it well we're
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:41.000]  going to continue to talk about this with Anthony Gutiarty right after the break this is something
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.920]  that is very concerning and we see the governments are coming together but they're coming together
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:49.400]  to cover this up to raise the rates as you're talking about of exposure we'll be right back
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:57.240]  with Anthony Gutiarty we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:17.880]  are the social engineers adding it to the water symbol dumb down the host population that the
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:23.000]  parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:28.280]  supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the

[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:07.480]  with some important information i want to tell you about matt redhawk and his team of patriots
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:12.120]  over at my patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:16.200]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell us

[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:35.960]  in studio with anthony gucciardi we've been talking about what's going on with the elevated levels
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:41.480]  of radiation in california paul joseph watson was talking to us earlier from the uk he's got a
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:47.480]  story from info wars dot com that's been linked to on drudge 1400 radiation hotspot found on san
[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:53.560]  francisco beach and we have the info wars crew there and they recorded elevated levels there as
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:59.080]  well about a thousand percent increase so we'd like to take your calls get your take on this uh
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:04.840]  tell us if you've seen anything that you think is unusual or any personal experiences or just
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:08.600]  what you think about what's uh being recorded out there is we've got our crews going to be going up
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:13.880]  and down the west coast of california because you know what the national news isn't covering it
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:19.000]  the local news isn't covering it but it's real and whether or not the radiation is coming from
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.800]  fukushima on those beaches or whether it's some toxic waste that's put there it's something you
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:27.560]  should be concerned about so that number to call in if you want to talk to us and give us your take
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:38.120]  on this is 1 800 259 9231 again that's 800 259 9231 anthony you know the key thing here is i'm
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:43.400]  going to reiterate and then i want to get into one other key point is that we don't know the origin
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:48.680]  of some of these incidents but we do know that the fukushima radiation the radioactive waste
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:53.960]  was dumped into the pacific ocean 78 percent of it according to one of the independent studies
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:58.120]  that challenged tepco and then tepco had to go on record and admit that they were wrong
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:04.040]  so we do know that it is here it is already happening and that was back in 2011 so they did
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:08.680]  already dump the radioactive material into the pacific ocean which affects the entire food
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:13.480]  chain and checks affects the entire food supply as well so we do know that's happening but i wanted
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:19.640]  to talk about low level radiation and dr christ busby a nuclear expert is really really on point
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:26.040]  with this specifically that high level radiation we all know is bad but low level radiation might
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:31.240]  actually be one of the worst kinds of exposures you can have so jacari and everyone out there
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.920]  unfortunately are putting themselves in danger because just as certain compounds in drugs like
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:42.680]  tylenol when you have too much of them it's a bad thing when you overdose it's a bad thing
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:47.080]  but there's been more deaths according to the statistics i've been looking at and there's some
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:52.520]  some articles on time magazine in time magazine specifically the low levels just a few pills of
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:57.880]  these of these things in the wrong circumstances can kill you quicker than the overdoses in fact
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:02.200]  the overdoses your body can somehow handle better because it knows how to fight it but the lower
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.840]  levels can infiltrate your biological system it's interesting in ways that are different so low
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:13.640]  level radiation as chris busby explains dr christ busby can be more damaging so this is actually
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:17.160]  really really concerning because everyone's saying well it's not that much of an increase yeah it's
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:22.280]  a lot but it's not that much it could actually be worse well it's accumulative as well right yeah
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:28.840]  i mean that why is it that the x-ray technicians at the dental office or whatever they always leave
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:33.560]  the room i mean it's a low level of radiation but they even put covering over you when they're
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.240]  taking an x-ray of your teeth so the technicians are not going to stay in the room they're going
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:41.400]  to get out because it's cumulative and even if they were across the room they would be getting
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:45.480]  this over and over and over again so they stand on the other side a lead shielded wall when they do
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.560]  that it's something that everybody should be concerned about and i guess what's really amazing
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:52.920]  to me and it's one of the reasons why alex sent the crew out to the west coast is that
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:58.280]  here you've got somebody who has a video he's not with the press he's just a citizen that
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:04.440]  goes out with his geiger counter he looks at a 500 increase the media is not interested
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:09.320]  they get a local official goes out there and gives a preposterous explanation for it then we find
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:15.480]  10 times increase a 14 times increase so we're seeing it going up by five times by 10 times
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:20.520]  by 14 times and people ought to be asking themselves what's going on here whether or not it's from
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:24.600]  Fukushima it still represents a health threat the whole debate is silly though because back
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.880]  in 2011 we already know there were hot particles according to scientists as far as boston and two
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:33.560]  out of the three monitoring stations that's on my new piece that's on story lincoln info wars right
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:40.120]  now we've already known that berkeley uc berkeley found increased radiation levels in california
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:45.560]  in 2011 we've already known that they were measuring it for years and saying that yes it is happening
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:49.480]  we've already known that Yale professors are saying that Fukushima radiation is already here
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:53.400]  we are we've already known that thai wood problems have already developed in california
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:58.680]  we've already known all that so it's here the media is making the debate is of is Fukushima
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:03.640]  actually affecting us in any way it's already affected us this is just extra stuff right it's
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:08.440]  already here the radiation levels already increased everywhere across the board in many ways background
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:14.440]  radiation the past 60 years and Fukushima has just exacerbated that the key thing here is which of
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:19.160]  these scenarios are Fukushima and then oh that's just kind of a distraction though because we already
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:23.720]  know Fukushima is an issue we already know it's a major tumor on this entire planet we need to fix
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:28.040]  it immediately you know so that's the key thing and it's the low-level radiation that could actually
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:33.000]  be affecting us more yes that's true i'm interested to find what jacar in those guys actually read
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.240]  once they go up through seattle and they go up along the coast and see if it's you know consistent
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:41.800]  or if it's higher in some areas or just massively high in some areas lower in other ones and i hope
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:44.680]  they're taking their survival shield while they're out there because they're actually affecting their
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:48.840]  health very badly that's right well we asked for your take on this we give out the 800 number we
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:54.280]  got a couple of callers here rich what do you think about the radiation issue what's your take
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:02.840]  hello rich are you there speaking yes what do you take out what you think i i i feel it i i feel
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:08.760]  sometimes that like there's needles penetrating my skin and burning my bones to be honest with you but
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:18.440]  i call because i've heard of a substance called brown's gas and it's what you do is you take water
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:25.000]  and you put a of current through it and you get hydrogen and oxygen and then you put them under
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  pressure recombine them and light it up and you can use this it it not necessarily really hot but
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:39.560]  it's a the type of chemical reaction it's a form of implosion that can neutralize radioactivity
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:45.480]  and have you heard of that anthony well i wouldn't exactly count on that in the event of a you know
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:51.960]  major nuclear incident once you're having radioactive contamination around you but the funny thing is
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:56.680]  that there are ways to help neutralize radiation it's just we're not taking those steps in the
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.480]  united states because the government thinks it's red utensils that's uh increasing the radiation
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:07.560]  count in the fukushima areas i i guess actually the fukushima plant doesn't exist they were a plant
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.600]  that made red utensils that's the secret it didn't blow up and melt down they were just
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:17.800]  manufacturing red utensils at major rates maybe we ought to stop the manufacture of those dangerous
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:21.800]  red utensils yes those are the real dangers not the radiation thank you rich let's go to
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:29.480]  mike and illinois mike what's your take on this you know uh i've been following this for a while
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:42.600]  and uh i would suggest to well i there are some uh on youtube i watch a live chat pretty much every
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:53.080]  night by a guy named beautiful girl by dana who has begun to get um get to a lot of people
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:41:00.200]  and they're now listening to him and he was the diver off the coast he lives in british colombia
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:07.560]  and he was a diver for i believe over 30 years and uh he can get you in touch with a lot of people
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:12.200]  um well what is he saying is he saying there's radiation increases when he's finding that in
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:18.760]  it while diving or what oh yeah well he doesn't dive anymore it's too dangerous because of the
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:25.880]  radiation yeah why why isn't he diving what's his concern well he didn't really say why but what his
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:32.840]  concerns are is that the he heard about the story that you were reporting on about the sea being dead
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:42.440]  a while back and uh he was also reporting about uh since that earthquake in october at seven point
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:51.880]  three that that is when japan uh shut everything down you can't get any information from them other
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:59.160]  than through tepco well tepco is basically run by the mafia certain mafia elements and they are
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:02.600]  lying on record over and over again and they'll never tell the truth unless they're unless they're
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:07.240]  forced to and acquiring homeless people to clean up the plant and as i was talking about
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:13.240]  two and a half times the real radiation uh the the fake numbers were confirmed to be false and
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:17.080]  i thought it was like radiation it wasn't like half times 18 i thought it was like 18 because
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.480]  they had their guy they had geiger counters i wouldn't go one day though yeah the highest
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:25.720]  levels were recent which is the most concerning thing it's going up not down it's just getting
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:31.240]  worse and worse and if they move one of these 1400 rods a lot of the experts say in fact
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:34.680]  most of the experts say the ones that say it's not going to be that bad are really conservative
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:39.320]  the real top experts on are saying even on huffington post that just one of those rods could
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:44.280]  cause a meltdown that is leading to fukushima forever as in thousands and thousands of years of
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:48.600]  bombardment of radioactive attack on the biological population you know if you're there
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:53.320]  and you're looking at a geiger counter and your geiger counter maxes out on the meter
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:57.720]  wouldn't you think that it would be obvious to you certainly if you're somebody that works
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:02.040]  at a nuclear power plant i mean they were obviously lying to people i mean what a flimsy excuse to say
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:07.000]  that well we now tell you that the radiation levels are higher because our geiger countermeters
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:12.520]  were not capable of going that high you you know if your meter is is maxed out i mean any idiot
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:17.080]  would know that with a geiger government just bowels to tepco and just lets them do anything
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:23.640]  they want absolutely is god over there and it seems as if we can't force tepco to do anything
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:27.960]  because the united states isn't really doing anything about they're living in a delusion
[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:33.080]  and promoting the delusion that fukushima is not a big deal and that's as a result causing
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:36.600]  tepco to be able to do anything they want well i think it'll be interesting to see what happens
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:41.640]  with these 70 plus sailors who are on the uss reagan and they were there for just four days
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:46.680]  and now a massive amount of these young healthy people are coming down with various forms of
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:51.160]  cancer and they're suing they're not covering up for the japanese government they're not
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.240]  covering up for tepco they're coming after them so it'll be interesting to see what comes
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:02.280]  line out of that thank you mike let's go to trish in canada trish hi there thanks for
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:10.360]  checking my call um while you were doing your show i called the embassy of japan in our capital
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:17.400]  city of otawa and i asked them why is the japanese government lying to the world about the effects
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:24.840]  of this issue and the lady tried to get me to send a general email so i did insist on speaking
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:32.840]  with someone and i knew i was on tape and the lady was trying to act like she didn't understand
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:40.840]  the nature of my question so basically i left it at you know i know you're a very smart person
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:48.520]  you work at the embassy it's a high level functioning individual and i encouraged her to eat lots of
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:53.960]  tuna that's good so she wouldn't even acknowledge the question as to why they're lying about fukushima
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:58.200]  when everyone knows they are it's just like when i called to ask about the 14 million doses of
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:03.640]  potassium iodide which someone inside that exact government organization told me was a bizarre purchase
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:07.640]  who we've had in contact with before and then i called the individual and he said no it's just
[02:45:07.640 --> 02:45:11.960]  a routine purchase i said oh so you don't have any concerns about fukushima he said well i can't
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.120]  talk about that and i said oh so so why did you buy it and then he hung up on me goodbye and he hung
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:19.880]  up on me and said you know he just he just purchases for the government he doesn't know anything
[02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:25.560]  yeah and then they purchased that massive amount and they wanted it in just 30 days i mean yeah
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:29.560]  both of those things are red flags well it's enough for maybe some of the military maybe
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:35.080]  some of the government branches but here's the thing i encourage them to supply the people
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:40.200]  with forms of iodine but they're not doing that they're supplying it for themselves that's not
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:44.760]  enough for the general population at all that's enough for maybe you know a couple million people
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:48.680]  for a few doses you know because it actually works in different concentrations the amount they're
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:54.040]  getting but a smart government would supply iodine to its public but they're only concern
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:57.880]  they're only concern is continuity of government i mean if you want iodine you've got to buy it
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:01.560]  yourself you've got to take care of yourself because you know what guess what the government's not
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:05.880]  going to be there to take care of you i mean there's still people living in the area of fukushima
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.920]  and according to what i've seen the japanese government doesn't say here you know take a
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:15.960]  lot of iodine or get out of here at least but they just say everything's fine the plan is under
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.200]  control you know we have homeless people cleaning it up with duct tape and it's going to be perfectly
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.560]  fine that's true that's true well thank you very much trish and canada thank you for taking it on
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:30.200]  to call them and complain about it it's something that i maybe if a lot of people did something
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:34.040]  about it something would happen who knows but at least the person you talk to knows that there's a
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:39.640]  risk now if you didn't headline bomb in the media i mean rt does like 50 stories about a day because
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:44.200]  i know that's how they get traffic because it's so popular i mean if the media actually cared
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:48.520]  here's another thing if the media actually cared about views and money they would talk about fukushima
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:51.560]  every day they would talk about gmail every day they would talk about fluoride they would talk
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:55.720]  about all this stuff they'd talk about gun rights and everything but they don't care about actual
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:47:01.240]  views or money they care about towing the actual government line that fukushima is fine that gmls
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:06.280]  don't exist it's the conspiracy theory that guns are bad and cause more crime they don't care about
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:12.360]  views that's why you know alternative news info wars all these websites are skyrocketing info wars
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:18.200]  being the major flagship because actual views and and all the conversions go to those topics
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:22.120]  things like fukushima people care about this well because it's stuff that affects their life right
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:27.160]  now exactly it's not a puff piece if cnn actually wanted views and money and everything like that
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:30.920]  because money is not the rafferty jack if they really wanted it they would talk about fukushima
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:34.920]  all day and they would get tons and tons of views and they become number one but they're not ever
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:40.280]  going to do that never exactly like i pointed out before is like look at ask the people in san
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:46.040]  francisco how many puff pieces has the local news run when they're not really interested in covering
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:51.160]  massive amounts of increase in radiation levels on their own beach they're not asking any questions
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:54.200]  that's not they're not going out there with a geiger counter i mean we got to send people
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:59.160]  from austin texas to california to report on something that is affecting the people
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:03.800]  in that area it's just amazing no one else cares and no one else is doing it now that said there
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:07.640]  are a lot of good youtube videos popping up from people with the geiger counters testing the snow
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:12.920]  and everything such as st louis that dutch sinsey i think his name is and he has a lot of good videos
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:16.840]  also other people are realizing this now and looking into it and that's the key is if we can
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:22.680]  enable others to do it as well we can maybe get enough of a surge to essentially headline bomb
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:27.400]  the media and make them covered but once again they're not looking for views they're not looking
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:31.720]  for money they're looking for their agenda to follow and nothing else otherwise they would
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:36.920]  already be covering it so this i mean this is the last fight we have the last push because once
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.800]  those rods once the two rods come together the spent fuel rods and everything once that happens
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:46.680]  i mean it's focusing forever yeah this is the time to stop it this is really really is and
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:52.120]  it's crucial for humanity that we get that out that's right valeria new mexico do you want to
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:49:01.240]  give us your take on this um i have a question about the nascent iodine and um i have bought it
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:07.800]  of course and have been taking it for a couple months now and nowhere can i find the amount
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:13.880]  you're supposed to take in an emergency you know if you don't want to take the tablets and also
[02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:18.920]  how much should you be giving your your pets well the thing is the reason we don't say that is
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:23.320]  because we encourage you to speak your physician uh you know legally and everything we can't tell
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:27.800]  you how much you need to take because everyone's different i would encourage you to do your own
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:32.200]  research though there's a lot of stuff out there and you know one of the cool things about nascent
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:37.320]  iodine is you can take it every day with potassium iodide you do not want to take it every day
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:42.680]  that's 100 for sure i would encourage you to look it up for yourself speak to a naturopathic
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:47.800]  doctor maybe or a certified healthcare practitioner that's natural if you if that's the way you want
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:51.800]  to go that's the way i would do it speak to a naturopathic doctor there is information online
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:57.640]  as well i can't tell you what's right for you but i know that in a nuclear disaster i would
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:02.280]  definitely be taking the nascent iodine and preparing myself which i do on a daily basis
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:07.720]  anyway so i'm already building up you know preparing my body for what i know is already out there
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:11.480]  and that's the key thing about taking it every day but i would encourage you to look up for
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:14.360]  yourself i don't want to tell you a certain dosage on air and then someone out someone
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:18.280]  goes out and takes it it's not enough you see what i'm saying so thanks a lot for uh checking
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:21.480]  it out though and we've gotten a lot of great reviews about it nothing but good stuff actually
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:26.680]  i found a lot of youtube videos with like 10 000 views reviewing it but anyway thanks a lot thank
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:33.080]  you velary in new mexico let's go to john in pennsylvania john what's your take on this my take
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:42.280]  on this is that it is just an absolute atrocity for humanity i have a little boy and i'm worried

[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:15.800]  anthony gucciardi and we've been taking your calls we had to go to break we had john from
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:19.160]  pennsylvania we're going to try to get to everybody's calls here at the end of the show here we've
[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:23.640]  got a little bit of time but we've got bill in texas west and indiana pollin texas and mike
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:27.320]  and wyoming we're going to try to get to everybody but real quickly john you were saying that you're
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:32.680]  on the east coast you're concerned about the food supply for your family we're going to have jacari
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:36.280]  jackson and the info wars crew that's out on the west coast they're going to be going to some fish
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:41.960]  markets as well as going up and down the coast taking readings but uh you wanted to make a comment
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:48.440]  about what your concerns are yes i appreciate you taking my call i will try to be as quickly as
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:55.160]  possible but what i find is that you know here we have russian troops necessarily with the us are
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:00.360]  they going to be planning any kind of evacuation over the next six or seven years because the
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:08.120]  food chain is going to be totally disrupted so i just don't know how this is not a world emergency
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:14.840]  at this point well you know it's not a it's not a paranoia it's actual fact yeah it's true look
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:20.040]  as you look at other nations that are banning gmo's it's very similar if they could take action
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:23.560]  against fukushima i mean these other nations are seeing the insanity of what we're doing
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:29.080]  not just us the united states but other nations as well all these you know japan other nations
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:35.160]  are just putting fear to the wind and just going and destroying everything just warping the planet
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:40.040]  with genetic modification with allowing fukushima forever to just happen and saying yeah let the
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:44.920]  homeless fix it you know move the fuel rods everything and putting fluoride in the water supply
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:51.320]  destroying the plants with glyphosate just doing all this and other nations are running scared and
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:55.800]  they're getting rid of our imports and they're getting rid of gmo's and banning them poland
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:59.320]  banning them peru banning them hung and we see some countries that are getting rid of fluoride
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:03.560]  in the water too a lot of them a lot of them are european areas exactly they're waking up meanwhile
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:09.080]  we're here in this delusional state just not even acknowledging that our food is modified that our
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:14.920]  food is full of garbage that radiation is coming through the west coast via the pacific ocean where
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:20.360]  78% again of the radioactive waste was dumped from fukushima we're just sitting here in this
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:26.200]  delusional state just not even realizing this as the rest of the world is freaking out yeah
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:30.920]  absolutely and we're like trying to tell you that it's happening and just trying to say that it's
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:36.360]  happening is hard not even the stage where we fix it but just the stage where someone says it's
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:41.400]  happening is hard to do with the media saying well is it really even happening when it's already
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:46.360]  known to have been happening for two years yes the radiation is already it's already ongoing
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:49.800]  well it's a different agenda the government has a completely different agenda thank you john and
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:57.160]  pennsylvania bill in texas what's your comment guys really enjoy your uh comments today something
[02:56:57.160 --> 02:57:04.280]  you might want to look back in history ask yourself why 30 millis sieverts is what considered normal
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:10.840]  background radiation along the coast there when it should be zero and if you'll google or look
[02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:18.280]  back wikipedia there was an incident in world war two called port chicago uh which was a uh
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:26.600]  an inland harbor uh just north of the the golden gate cities and uh they said an ammunition barge
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:35.160]  blew up uh when in fact a lot of people say that that was a dirty bomb the government tested to
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:42.440]  see if a harbor blast would work better than an aerial blast and port chicago is a very interesting
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:49.800]  piece of history they roads cannot go in there that their barriers now and have been since world war
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:56.440]  two and uh i think part of the reason that 30 millis sieverts is what they consider standard
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:02.760]  radiation when zero should be the number was probably tied into that port chicago incident
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:09.000]  in 44 i believe it was they said an ammunition barge blew up that's really interesting thanks bill
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.160]  you know we've seen that happen the government is not averse to experimenting on its own citizens
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:16.840]  oh there's been plenty of radiation testing there's also increased the background radiation
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:21.560]  including medical stuff and Chernobyl over everything you know many many things that
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:25.640]  the government has had a hand in have increased the radiation and again low levels can be even
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:28.840]  more dangerous than high levels well we've seen the government just recently experimenting on
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:32.600]  people in the new york subway system exposing them to airborne things saying that they're
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:36.360]  testing for a pair so then perfectly safe hang on we're going to be right back and over tribe
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:39.160]  we're going to try to take these last three phone calls here we'll be right back

[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:25.960]  and now live from austin texas alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night
[03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:30.280]  julian for alex i'm joined in studio with anthony gucciardi and we're going into overdrive for one
[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:34.520]  more second to try to clear off the people who called just as we were running out of time we've
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:39.160]  got west in indiana paul in texas and mike and wyoming sorry about the rest of people we're not
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:43.960]  going to be able to get to you but let's go first to mike and wyoming you had a comment about japan
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:50.520]  and robots yes hi i i was just curious uh considering that japan is the acknowledged
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:58.440]  leader in the field of robotics uh why would you sacrifice hapless homeless people to try to
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:05.400]  do the cleanup rather than showcase your uh advanced robotic technology well kashima is
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:11.240]  perfectly safe that's a great question no it's a good point why are we not also having the best
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:15.240]  scientists from around the world go in and decide the best ways to clean it up without using human
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:21.320]  beings you know that's a good question actually darpa has a robotics competition that they've
[03:01:21.320 --> 03:01:27.480]  set up and the winner so far at this point is a japanese company now in order to participate in
[03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:32.680]  this contest they had to disassociate themselves with any government funding with any university
[03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:38.440]  research funding they are the leader by far in this contest and it's one of the companies that was
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:44.600]  bought by google and uh they bought other companies that are involved with darpa projects like boss
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:49.640]  dynamics which has been making one hideous device after the other and so you see a lot of articles
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:54.760]  that have come out saying this robot may save your life someday and it's like i don't think that's
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:02:00.680]  so yeah i don't think that's the mission statement of darpa but building terminator robots that kill
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:05.800]  people to even think about building robots that go in and stop fukushima because i guess they're
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:10.040]  so reckless they don't even care about their lives being endangered by the fukushima plan either
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.560]  that's right thank you michael let's go to west end indiana west what's your comment
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:18.920]  yeah thanks for taking my call um first and foremost i just want to say that you've done
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:24.680]  a great show been listening for quite some time and what i want to say about fukushima is i i think
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:32.760]  that then the japanese government allowing that radiation to leak into the water supply is an
[03:02:32.760 --> 03:02:38.920]  egregious act of war not only against humanity but against mother nature herself and what i'm
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:45.640]  really concerned about or what are the ramifications long term that from their actions and one question
[03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:52.360]  that i had is uh on the global warming debate if you had to recommend a website or a book what would
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:58.600]  you recommend for someone who's relatively new to understanding this debate about global warming
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:04.200]  what website uh there's like there's several good websites uh one of them is uh what's that
[03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:09.320]  or book as well he asked yeah one of them is uh what's up with that i mean you can look up uh the
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:13.880]  i think lord montan who we have on the radio show here quite often he does an excellent job
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:20.040]  of debunking global warming and he's pointed out that we've had a record rise in co2 and yet for
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:27.560]  17 years we've had global cooling and so the hockey stick that came up from man and others
[03:03:27.560 --> 03:03:32.200]  that's just total hogwash it isn't happening for every day too they have some great stuff on that
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:39.160]  yes absolutely absolutely uh let's go to paul in texas paul what's your comment hey how's it going
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:43.960]  doing good how are you pretty good pretty good listen i just want to say uh everybody out there
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:51.480]  you hear me uh get the pro pure water filtration system it is the mercedes bends of water filtration
[03:03:51.480 --> 03:03:56.200]  i'm telling you it is unbelievable and that's all i want to say have a great day well thank you
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:04:01.480]  that's a great unsolicited commercial for us and you can get that 10 off if you go to info wars
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:07.080]  life dot com so check that out and you know ultimately your health is your responsibility
[03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:11.880]  and so we try to give you tools to do that it's a win-win situation it helps you take care of yourself
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:17.080]  your health the family your family's health and it also funds our operation that's what pays for us
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:22.120]  to do the kind of reporting that national and local news is not doing about these health issues
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:27.080]  and and really in a sense like we're talking about before it's this idea that the government has
[03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:31.880]  that they can just dump anything that's toxic into the ocean and forget about it or dump fluoride
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:37.160]  into the water and forget about it consequences of that are just staggering exactly and that's why
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:41.640]  we're working on ways to protect yourself with fluoride shield with survival shield addressing
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:46.040]  fukushima addressing the fluoridation of the water supply and funding all this going out and
[03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:49.560]  doing our own readings we're going to keep it up and we're going to fight against fukushima in the
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:56.360]  last battle for the radiation-free planet that we are almost living on that's it for today alex
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:05:22.280]  will be back tomorrow info wars tonight at seven central eight p.m. eastern
