[00:00.000 --> 00:06.340]  We are live, Wednesday, April 20th, 2016.
[00:06.340 --> 00:11.640]  You're about to hear some of the most powerful 9-11 inside information ever.
[00:11.640 --> 00:12.640]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[00:12.640 --> 00:17.640]  Uh, first class, uh, galley flight attendant and our person is in fact, and we can't get
[00:17.640 --> 00:18.640]  the shit off here.
[00:18.640 --> 00:19.640]  The door won't open.
[00:19.640 --> 00:24.360]  How should the U.S. respond to such a devastation?
[00:24.360 --> 00:27.280]  Well, I think they have to respond quickly and effectively.
[00:27.280 --> 00:31.480]  They have to find out exactly what the cause was, who did it, and they have to go after
[00:31.480 --> 00:34.760]  these people because, uh, there is no other choice.
[00:34.760 --> 00:44.840]  Obviously, for the war in Iraq, it's a big, fat mistake, all right?
[00:44.840 --> 00:50.680]  It took Jeb Bush, took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately
[00:50.680 --> 00:52.680]  said it was a mistake.
[00:52.680 --> 00:56.440]  The war in Iraq, we spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives.
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.920]  We don't even have it, Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves
[01:00.920 --> 01:01.920]  in the world.
[01:01.920 --> 01:03.720]  We have destabilized the Middle East.
[01:03.720 --> 01:09.160]  On Monday, the Obama administration and the State Department said the release of the paper's
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.440]  detailing Saudi involvement in the 9-11 attacks and its support for al-Qaeda would damage
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.400]  U.S. national security and endanger citizens living abroad.
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.440]  Both the Obama and Bush administrations have refused to release the papers stored in a
[01:25.440 --> 01:28.160]  guarded vault beneath Washington, D.C.
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.600]  The FBI has also refused to unseal the documents.
[01:31.600 --> 01:33.840]  It needs to be classified.
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.760]  Former director of the FBI, Robert S. Mueller, said in a secret meeting, the White House
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.240]  has threatened to veto legislation that would release the documents.
[01:43.240 --> 01:47.120]  It's difficult to imagine a scenario where the president would sign it.
[01:47.120 --> 01:51.040]  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday.
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.480]  He said the bill would jeopardize international sovereignty and put the U.S. at a significant
[01:56.480 --> 01:57.480]  risk.
[01:57.480 --> 02:02.240]  Obama allies on Capitol Hill, including an unnamed Republican senator, have vowed to
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.720]  prevent the Senate from taking up the justice against sponsors of terrorism act.
[02:07.720 --> 02:13.280]  The bill would remove Saudi Arabia's immunity in federal court and allow victims of the
[02:13.280 --> 02:15.720]  9-11 attacks to sue the kingdom.
[02:15.720 --> 02:16.720]  Governor Bush.
[02:16.720 --> 02:17.720]  How are we doing?
[02:17.720 --> 02:18.720]  Good, how are you doing?
[02:18.720 --> 02:21.880]  I'm just wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted
[02:21.880 --> 02:22.880]  from the 9-11 commission report?
[02:22.880 --> 02:23.880]  Yes, sure.
[02:23.880 --> 02:24.880]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[02:24.880 --> 02:25.880]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[02:25.880 --> 02:26.880]  Got them?
[02:26.880 --> 02:27.880]  Well, we...
[02:27.880 --> 02:28.880]  Andrew, may I have them?
[02:28.880 --> 02:29.880]  Hopefully we can get them.
[02:29.880 --> 02:33.920]  In order to have the bill move forward, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would need
[02:33.920 --> 02:35.920]  to file procedural motions.
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.080]  60 votes are required to have the bill move forward.
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.920]  After 9-11, it was clear that the Congress was going to be called upon to conduct some
[02:44.920 --> 02:47.680]  form of an inquiry as to what happened.
[02:47.680 --> 02:53.280]  The decision by the leadership was to combine the intelligence committees of the House and
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.320]  the Senate into a single body for the first time in the history of the Congress that had
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.320]  occurred.
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.160]  On April 10th, the former chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and
[03:03.160 --> 03:09.200]  Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Joint Congressional Inquiry into the 9-11 attacks, Bob Graham,
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.080]  told CBS News he believes Saudi Arabia was behind the attacks.
[03:14.080 --> 03:17.600]  What I'm trying to tell you is, so what?
[03:17.600 --> 03:21.960]  We did not invent corruption.
[03:21.960 --> 03:27.440]  Graham said support came from the Saudi government, charities and rich people in the country.
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.200]  He said that support was downplayed because of the special relationship between the United
[03:33.200 --> 03:36.000]  States and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.840]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[03:37.840 --> 03:42.360]  For example, here's Donald Rumsfeld chopping at the bit to keep the momentum of the New
[03:42.360 --> 03:44.760]  World Order's tyrannical soft war moving.
[03:44.760 --> 03:47.760]  We have been attacking in five years.
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.600]  Health, there's the perception that the threat is so low in the society that it's not surprising
[03:53.600 --> 03:56.600]  that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment.
[03:56.600 --> 04:00.760]  And the same thing is in Europe, there's a low threat perception.
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.800]  Correction for that, I suppose, is an attack.
[04:04.800 --> 04:06.520]  Building 7, I often hear about.
[04:06.520 --> 04:07.760]  No plane hit Building 7.
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.320]  Why did Building 7 come down?
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.320]  What do you tell people?
[04:10.320 --> 04:12.080]  What is Building 7?
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.080]  Building 7.
[04:13.080 --> 04:16.520]  I have no idea, I've never heard that.
[04:16.520 --> 04:22.840]  We must never forget our fellow Americans that paid the ultimate price in a bid to end the
[04:22.840 --> 04:29.080]  American way, quarterbacked by a protected elite class now blackmailing the US government
[04:29.080 --> 04:34.040]  by threatening to sell off 750 billion in US assets.
[04:34.040 --> 04:39.760]  This obvious and inflated admission of guilt by the Saudis begs the question, how much
[04:39.760 --> 04:48.760]  are the 2,996 innocent fellow American lives that perished on 9-Eleven 2001 worth to you?
[04:48.760 --> 04:50.760]  What's going on, Betty?
[04:50.760 --> 04:53.760]  Betty, talk to me.
[04:53.760 --> 04:55.760]  Betty, are you there?
[04:55.760 --> 04:57.760]  John Bowne, for Infowars.com.
[04:57.760 --> 05:24.760]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[05:24.760 --> 05:35.080]  Back on March 1st, a voting location in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was locked down to
[05:35.080 --> 05:37.440]  accommodate a visit by Bill Clinton.
[05:37.440 --> 05:39.840]  They are affecting the voting at this poll.
[05:39.840 --> 05:44.340]  It's fraud and illegal, stated the person who filmed the footage, from one side of the
[05:44.340 --> 05:45.640]  street to the other.
[05:45.640 --> 05:48.640]  There's no way anybody can get down there to vote.
[05:48.640 --> 05:54.000]  New Bedford Mayor John F. Mitchell then campaigned for Clinton during a Bullhorn speech.
[05:54.000 --> 06:00.000]  violation of Massachusetts law. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-act two SuperMail Brain Force Prostigar Silver Bullet.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy them, folks.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  Thank you, brother.
[06:11.000 --> 06:13.000]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[06:13.000 --> 06:19.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  Welcome to the Info War.
[06:21.000 --> 06:27.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, A-Q-F-X, uh, Nathan and I.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  Right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  What products are you taking? Are you taking?
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  Everything from, uh, SuperMail to, uh, Brain Force to Winterson, uh, X2.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[08:08.000 --> 08:17.000]  That's veteran Denver police officer Charles Jones IV, smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and trying to erase the evidence.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  I'm not deserving what they're doing in their own city. I don't understand what's going on.
[08:26.000 --> 08:37.000]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[08:37.000 --> 08:45.000]  Doesn't raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  How can you ask such a question?
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  What difference at this point does it make?
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  What I say goes, see, I'm the law around here.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  You came, you saw, you died.
[09:19.000 --> 09:26.000]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[09:26.000 --> 09:35.000]  We just have to be repetitive about this. We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  We are trained to deceive if we have to. You really don't have to trust me. You shouldn't trust me.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the myth.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[09:48.000 --> 09:55.000]  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  Help getting us youth? Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[10:04.000 --> 10:13.000]  It's the Alex Jones show because there is a war for your mind.
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing just amazing historical things happen every day now.
[10:20.000 --> 10:33.000]  The conspiratorial, patriot, extreme right wing view of the world is being documented to be the true state of the planet and how things operate.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  Now, I don't call it the extreme right wing patriot movement. That's what the mainstream media calls it.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  We are a movement based in the United States, but allied across the world.
[10:44.000 --> 10:53.000]  There are patriots and pro-humans in parties in Africa, in parties in Asia, in parties in Europe, in parties in Central and South America,
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  as well as North America and the Pacific Islands, right through to Australia.
[10:59.000 --> 11:12.000]  We study history. We study economics. We study empires. We study cartels.
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  We are learned. We are informed. We are involved.
[11:19.000 --> 11:32.000]  We are empowered individuals, as the Pentagon calls us. And the Pentagon is tasked with going after its number one enemy, J. Helm's own document submitted,
[11:32.000 --> 11:47.000]  the empowered individual, not a terrorist, not a criminal, but the empowered individual enlightened with a mind of renaissance.
[11:47.000 --> 12:02.000]  That individual will not fit in to this new robotic planetary dark age that the establishment is trying to foist upon us.
[12:02.000 --> 12:13.000]  But the spirit of liberty that beats in the human breast, the indomitable human spirit that refuses to submit, is beginning to rise.
[12:13.000 --> 12:23.000]  And just as the Earth itself goes through birth pains and just as tectonic activity rises to the highest level ever recorded,
[12:23.000 --> 12:35.000]  just as volcanoes begin to erupt as above so below, that's what the ancient alchemist said.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  And you're seeing that happen yet again in front of everyone. This is a great time of change.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  A lot of horrible things are going to happen in the next decade, obviously.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  But a lot of amazing things are going to happen as well.
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  Humanity is entering its birthright of super science.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  And I used the 1900 term for comic book super science, imaginary super science.
[12:59.000 --> 13:09.000]  What was super science 100 years ago has been surpassed in almost every imagination of the mind of man.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  Quite a species. And that's why you've been told you're ugly.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  It's why you've been told you're a failure. It's why you've been told you're not beautiful and have no power.
[13:20.000 --> 13:31.000]  Because as Mahatma Gandhi said in our heart, in each human there is the seed of the universe.
[13:31.000 --> 13:41.000]  That's what we're talking about here today. The globalists want to rob that seed, that potential of our destiny,
[13:41.000 --> 13:49.000]  and run for the hills with it. This is a mugging, a cosmic globalist mugging of our species.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  An attempt to harness our species. True slavery.
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  Slavery to the next power. Slavery squared. Total control of reality.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  False paradigms. Programmed masses.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  Donald Trump, just a symbol of populism, a flawed one as all humans are, was able to have an election.
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  The last five contests that the Republicans cancelled them and just gave all the votes to the anointed one, Ted Cruz, anointed by,
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  I guess our high priest, Glenn Beck, because he said so, and he wears ironic sweaters to look non-threatening,
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  so everything's fine when he creeps around. We must do what he says.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  Him and Count Chocula, excuse me, Ted Cruz.
[14:45.000 --> 14:55.000]  They have actually got to have an election, and he dominated getting all the delegates in New York.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  Now, of course, Hillary was behind the polls in New York, but Bernie Sanders magically lost.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  And of course, when he wins states, she gets the delegates.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  That's why Cruz just started having the Republicans cancel primaries all out,
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  because if you have them and then give the delegates when Trump wins,
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  and then Tennessee, Arizona, Louisiana, and a bunch of other states, it's a little bit embarrassing.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  You know, like in Wyoming was another one.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  So you just cancel things outright, like Colorado and now other states.
[15:24.000 --> 15:32.000]  And the problem is, is that they can't get the Republicans and the party machines in states like Pennsylvania and New York.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  They're just not agreeing to say there was never voters.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  They didn't exist, and you're a cuckoo if you say it.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  I saw this talking point starting three weeks ago, and I played a lot of clips of it, made a big deal out of it,
[15:43.000 --> 15:52.000]  because Cruz would go on national television and radio and say the Texas senator,
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  I mean, I got to say it, the carpet-bagging senator.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  I now do not accept Ted Cruz as a Texan.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  He's not from here.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Nothing against Canadians.
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  You've got a great country.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  But, you know, just please, man, stop with the cowboy hats and the boots and making us all look bad, okay?
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  I mean, seriously.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  I mean, you hand that guy a lariat.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  He would, he'd think it was for hanging the Constitution by the neck until dead.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  He would know what to do with it.
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  So there was a paradigm shift when Sean Hannity, I've been a critic of over the years, you know, at least he's pro-gun and stuff.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.000]  I mean, I'm not an enemy with him.
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.000]  I don't think he's like, he's not duplicitous and sneaky like, like Len Beck.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  And I don't like to bash these people.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  I'm not in competition with them.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  I'm changing the narrative.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm changing the talking points.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  They follow us.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  And that's a fact.
[16:38.000 --> 17:02.000]  We influence them and take their fake conservatism and bring it into true constitutional libertarianism because we educate the public to where they're forced to follow or become passe, become obsolete, become redundant, become vestigial, become ceremonial, become empty if they don't follow because the truth is unstoppable.
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.000]  To his credit, Hannity really got it and I'm going to play the clip coming up.
[17:07.000 --> 17:14.000]  Cruz is on, he goes, listen, man, you've been on my show more than anybody and you keep playing this mind game where you talk about landslides and these terms.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  You've been canceling elections and don't give me this.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  Nothing's going on and voters aren't upset.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  My audience is really upset.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  We're going to play the clip.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  That's a paraphrase and Cruz just keeps going.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  No, I want a landslide.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  I won.
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.000]  He's a sore loser.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  Only Trump.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  It's just amazing.
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  And to finally see Hannity go, Hannity goes, stop it.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  Stop it.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  Stop it.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  Stop it.
[17:41.000 --> 17:50.000]  When someone's looking at you insulting you, it's like if you're standing there in high noon outside and the sky's blue and somebody goes, no, it's not.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  It's black or it's it's purple.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  And you're like, no, it's an Azure blue sky, heavenly.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  And they look at me and go, I say it's not.
[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  There comes a point where no matter how big your red carpet is or how fancy your tuxedo is or how slick you can talk, people just go, hey, the sky's blue.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  Two plus two equals four.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  Obamacare's a ripoff.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  You are coming after our guns.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  The country's run by foreign banks.
[18:14.000 --> 18:22.000]  The Chinese communists lecture us and own our debt and tell us what to do along with the Saudi Arabians who run slave brothels.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  They're lecturing us on human rights and they run the UN Human Rights Commission.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Man, this is funnier than George Carlin.
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.000]  If it wasn't so serious.
[18:37.000 --> 18:51.000]  So look, the world is going to decide that two plus two equals four or it's not as as Eric Blair, aka George Arwell wrote in 1948 when he published 1984.
[18:51.000 --> 19:03.000]  I believe it would be like if the socialists took over, they would destroy language, turn everything on its head, call tyranny love, create social justice warrior networks of young trendies running around, denouncing everyone to have them drug off the reeducation centers
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  because he'd worked for the British secret police.
[19:05.000 --> 19:15.000]  He'd been an MI6 and OSS and he worked for the communists as well as a commander in the Spanish Civil War fighting the Nazis.
[19:15.000 --> 19:22.000]  He wrote essay after essay nonfiction about how he figured out the communists were as bad as the Nazis.
[19:22.000 --> 19:31.000]  And how they didn't want to set up a nice world and they wanted to rape your wife and have you starve to death when they sat up in a castle.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  They want to stomp on your face because they like it.
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.000]  You ask, why does a pedophile want to grab your kid out of their backyard? It's horrible. Why? Because you're not like them.
[19:42.000 --> 19:52.000]  You're attracted to Wonder Woman. Who wouldn't be? Powerful, beautiful, creature made of God, reproductive, the feminine energy.
[19:52.000 --> 20:14.000]  That's what a real man's attracted to. Not these people. They want to grab your five-year-old out of the backyard and torture them to death. Okay? That's who they are.

[22:36.000 --> 22:45.000]  I loved my dad. But boy was he stubborn. He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it. He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[23:29.000 --> 23:39.000]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan. My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold that in 1985 he changed gold ownership forever.
[23:39.000 --> 23:54.000]  Currently, our national debt is spiraling out of control, but gold coins could be the answer. Call 1-866-525-gold or go online to usmoneyreserve.com to get new, never before released information about gold.
[23:54.000 --> 24:09.000]  Go to usmoneyreserve.com or call 1-866-525-gold.
[24:09.000 --> 24:31.000]  I'm looking at infowars.com right now. I'm also looking at dredgerport.com. If you're a TV viewer, I'm going to point to it. Saudi Arabia borrows $10 billion as oil slump drains reserves.
[24:31.000 --> 24:42.000]  They supposedly have all these trillions, but they've got to borrow money because they've got more than 10,000 princes worth hundreds of millions or billions of piece depending on which one you talk about in all their little palaces.
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  You always hear about these people worth $100 billion, these boxers, and a year later they're bankrupt. A fool in his money will soon be parted.
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  Fresh evidence links Saudi Arabian government to 9-11. Mainstream news. We're going to get into those articles.
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  Again, paper. National poll, only 6% trust media, but it should be less.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  And then Politico founder says the death of the clicks is here.
[25:09.000 --> 25:27.000]  Yeah, I called in my sales staff for radio ads and click ads four and a half years ago and I said, listen, I'm going to let three of you go and I'm going to keep two of you.
[25:27.000 --> 25:37.000]  And I said, I'm doing this because people have been fighting me on sponsorship and I said I will only take stuff that I endorse that I absolutely know is the best.
[25:37.000 --> 25:47.000]  And I have to hear constantly about how, you know, this is a pretty good sponsor.
[25:47.000 --> 26:05.000]  And I said, let me explain something. You're going to see the death of the clickbait and everything is going to be about viral videos and news and analysis and people and sources that the population trust.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  So credibility is everything, not just to be successful, but to who I am.
[26:10.000 --> 26:18.000]  Now, I'm not a total purist because you can't be. I'm on radio stations across this country airing local ads and things that I can't tell you're perfect and I can't speak for them.
[26:18.000 --> 26:28.000]  And I'm not judging anybody. The network, quite frankly, has some ads that things that I can't better speak for, but that's their ads. That's fine. Some are great. Some, you know, probably not so great.
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.000]  I'll just be honest with you in my view. Nobody's perfect, but you got to make a real effort.
[26:34.000 --> 26:41.000]  I'm not going into a plug here. I'm explaining my philosophy that you better treat people like you want to be treated.
[26:41.000 --> 26:53.000]  I mean, that's, man, I tell you, the golden rule really makes a lot of sense to me.
[26:53.000 --> 27:03.000]  And just like you're seeing the collapse of the media, the old dinosaur media, you're seeing the collapse of the establishment and their attempt to reach into totalitarianism to save their program.
[27:03.000 --> 27:12.000]  They even convinced themselves that the collapse that was coming out of their predatory system would be good to consolidate control.
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  But in truth, they're all greedy and backstabbing as well and haven't even been following their own eugenics protocols.
[27:19.000 --> 27:32.000]  And this whole thing is going to spin out of control and explode. They think they can just follow the AI computer systems they've got and follow decisions off of trends.
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.000]  That only works if the people running the system actually let the artificial intelligences control it, but they don't.
[27:38.000 --> 27:48.000]  They're getting in there constantly trying to tweak it or change it to improve their combines particular position.
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  And so the combines more and more are at odds with each other and there's cracks forming in these alliances.
[27:53.000 --> 28:04.000]  I don't need an AI algorithm to tell me that. I got the one built over this species development and all the experiences of my ancestors.
[28:04.000 --> 28:20.000]  I'll put that up against your supercomputer any day because I have morals and I have a compass and I have a rule, a social code I follow because it's written in my DNA.
[28:20.000 --> 28:29.000]  That's the thing about evil people. They think because they can cheat and steal and lie and do bad things and get ahead for a little while that they're advanced and intelligent.
[28:29.000 --> 28:43.000]  They think really good people don't understand evil and don't understand all the things they know and more and that we're weak because we won't use the type of tactics you use your fools.
[28:43.000 --> 28:51.000]  You're like someone that gets in the community pool that's got 50 people swimming in it and starts urinating in it.
[28:51.000 --> 28:58.000]  Telling yourself that oh it's just me doing it but then everybody else starts doing it or let's go on further.
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.000]  You start doing not number one but the other one in the pool and that's what you guys are doing.
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  You think it's not affecting you and your kids and the pool looks like a latrine at this point.
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  You people don't even care if nuclear reactors melt down now. You just turn the alarms off and let them leak.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  93% of them, the International Atomic Energy Commission admits are leaking currently.
[29:22.000 --> 29:29.000]  They're just falling apart, melting down, exploding. They used to at least care. They don't care anymore.
[29:29.000 --> 29:37.000]  You people are disconnected. You've stolen trillions, you live in palaces and you're disconnected from the grassroots.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  Well, I'm not. Oh, Politico, thank you for telling me that the click age is ending.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  We told you four years ago. We changed it into our own internal funded model. We are the trailblazers.

[31:50.000 --> 32:19.000]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan. My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold they change gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minute and sold to U.S. citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[32:19.000 --> 32:34.000]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control. Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[32:34.000 --> 33:00.000]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com. As for a special gold guide with new never before released information about gold from the U.S. Money Reserve, call 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com. I'm Michael Reagan. Thank you.
[33:04.000 --> 33:14.000]  Oh, yeah, it's a cheesy song, but everybody knows they love it. So I'll admit, I don't think it's cheesy. I like it. Crank it up. It's the Eye of the Tiger. Ha!
[33:14.000 --> 33:24.000]  Defending the public from enemies and money and democracy. It's Alex Jones. Pull up.
[33:24.000 --> 33:40.000]  Red light. Looking over to ladies. Of course, you married guy can't do that. It's the Eye of the Tiger, baby. Not acting confident. I am confident. Confident in the truth. Confident in my love of humanity.
[33:40.000 --> 34:01.000]  Rising up. Thrill the fight. Yeah, let's play some of this. I did. I did my time. I took my chances. I want to salute all the patriots out there that expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[34:01.000 --> 34:24.000]  You've been vindicated yet again. Federal Reserve's private. Vindicated. Stock markets. Everything rigged. Vindicated. Cancer viruses in the polio vaccines. Now globally recalled. Vindicated. Fluoride, brain damaging people in mass. Vindicated. Vindicated.
[34:24.000 --> 34:42.000]  Pro-human. Anti-eugenics. Humans of the stars and beyond. Vindicated. Committed to win. Vindicated. Spirit of 1776. Rising. Vindicated.
[34:42.000 --> 34:56.000]  And that toast is with coffee. They say that's not good luck. Yeah, it is. We're toasting to the big wake up that's happening right now. I'm going to be honest with you. I say this broadcast isn't teleprompter free.
[34:56.000 --> 35:16.000]  It is teleprompter free. But it is guided by something else. Human will. And a script written thousands of years ago. It's the same fight every generation goes through. But this one is the key crossroads. The gateway to the future.
[35:16.000 --> 35:30.000]  He's the eye of the tiger. Right now. The commitment. It isn't thinking about winning. It's going to win. Rising up. Straight to the top. We're going to break the chains.
[35:30.000 --> 35:46.000]  They tell you caring and having passion is stupid. Being scared little nerd. Hiding out is the way to go. When I say a scared little nerd, I mean the big tough guys act them like they got all the answers.
[35:46.000 --> 36:02.000]  When you start talking to him, that legs a mile wide a millimeter deep. But we're talking about has no depths. It's eternal. It's continual. It's a figure eight set on its side.
[36:02.000 --> 36:18.000]  Infinity. Stare into infinity. Len Beck says I'm scary. You bet I am. I was him. I'd be scared. Scared of the truth. Scared of the standard.
[36:18.000 --> 36:32.000]  He lifted up against the enemy. When the enemy comes in like a flood. All right, there you go. A little bit of spoken word for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:32.000 --> 36:50.000]  Just admit you love the song, folks. Don't get shamed of it. Rap song retains riots. Trump assassination. Media celebrates. Paul Watson wrote this article yesterday. And I mentioned it. I covered it some but I didn't play it. We've bleeped it.
[36:50.000 --> 37:06.000]  And the reason I'm covering it the day after we broke it in the day after it was on drugs and went super viral. It was the fifth biggest story on Google knows. I started to read the comments on world a hip hop star, whatever it's called.
[37:06.000 --> 37:21.000]  I followed some of the links and man, it was just very, very saddening. Because it's even a kind of a well-natured video. It's like, I like white people and I like Mexicans and I'm, you know, a black guy and man, we're all together.
[37:21.000 --> 37:38.000]  And I was like, what? That Trump's a racist and he's scared. He's coming to get us. Somebody needs to kill it. And these folks really think they're fighting somebody evil because the media told him so. It's sad.
[37:38.000 --> 37:53.000]  Donald Trump has said he thinks vaccines are dangerous because it hurt his family. And Donald Trump, by the way, nobody even knows that. I'm just gonna stop right there. Donald Trump knows China has a 35% tariff on us on average. Sometimes it's higher.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  So it's impossible to compete and they're shutting us down.
[37:57.000 --> 38:14.000]  So this is somebody who the elite are scared of because they've got a dossier on him and they believe he really intends to deliver. Why wouldn't you want to deliver and save America and be a superstar and be the New George Washington?
[38:14.000 --> 38:29.000]  Yeah, it's because he is an egomaniac, a good one. That's a bad trait. If you're a good person who cares about other people and you've got delusions of grandeur and they happen, they're not delusions of grandeur.
[38:29.000 --> 38:45.000]  A couple of times I've been called by psychology today and the big psychology publications. One time it was a Clinton operative to the interview. He was a psychologist and he's asked me during the interview, he goes, so you think people watch you in public and talk about you in public?
[38:45.000 --> 39:00.000]  And I said, yeah, I'm a public figure. Some people do. And he goes, so then in the magazine, I'm narcissistic and crazy and think people are talking about me because I'm imagining it. And I was talking to another psychologist that was doing a piece. I went ahead and talked to him just for fun.
[39:00.000 --> 39:14.000]  And I was telling him how many listeners we had and they were laughing on, oh, sure. And then in the article, it said that I basically was exaggerating our audience. Actually, our audience is bigger than I say, but the numbers I give you are what we can prove.
[39:14.000 --> 39:29.000]  It's not about Alex Jones, but it Alex Jones in this radio show is a microcosm of the success of the Liberty Movement and Gallup polls and other polls out showing the mainstream media has a 6% approval rating.
[39:29.000 --> 39:46.000]  Well, 6% trust it. Trust. It's Congress has a 9% approval rating for a couple years now. And they sit there in their arrogant con artist mode. And I rarely do interviews anymore, but I'm just when I do, I'm gonna start taping them.
[39:46.000 --> 39:56.000]  I'm gonna say, yeah, I'll do an interview with you at the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times or Vanity Fair or wherever. But I'll do it over the phone and I'll do it. I'm going to tape it and put the whole interview out.
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  Because I'll sit there and they'll go, so you believe there's a world government? I'll go, yeah, let me give you a few quotes world leaders. They go, oh, those that's another world government they're talking about.
[40:03.000 --> 40:12.000]  And they play these mind games. Let me play the Sean Hannity piece first because this is Sean Hannity just going, look, man, I'm not playing along with this. Stop it.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  Senator Cruz, you've been on this show more than anybody. He sells them because he's been a supporter of them before.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  But you see Cruz destroying himself with Clinton level whoppers. I mean, lies that would make Pinocchio blush.
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  That would make Pinocchio's nose blush. And Gepetto run in fear.
[40:34.000 --> 40:45.000]  I mean, he is stabbing himself on his own Pinocchio nose. He is falling on his own lies. He's going, we've had a huge landslide. The democracy has spoken. Who voters have spoken? These are the terms he uses.
[40:45.000 --> 41:00.000]  Landslide, grassroots rebellion, uprising, complaining Donald, loser Donald. They've never canceled these things before.
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.000]  I guess in Nevada once they did four years ago and it was a huge to do so they didn't do it this year as bad.
[41:07.000 --> 41:15.000]  But I mean, this is the biggest theft we've ever seen where they look at us. I was getting a cup of coffee.
[41:15.000 --> 41:38.000]  I quote John Goodman, I'm finishing my coffee. I'm back there in the coffee room and we got TVs on every room to monitor enemy transmissions.
[41:38.000 --> 41:47.000]  But you know, the Republican leadership just loves, you know, those parties and you just see him looking. I bet you those little eyes and pretty boy Paul Ryan.
[41:47.000 --> 41:56.000]  And he's sitting there going, we're going to follow the rules and that's what we're going to do with the delegates and, you know, the delegates can vote who they want.
[41:56.000 --> 42:07.000]  So we're going to follow the rules. Okay. I mean, it's so creepy. Folks understand we have election laws. You act like one person, one vote. It's a felony to vote illegally.
[42:07.000 --> 42:17.000]  There's all this public money spent. We have popular vote. And if you say we don't, well, then we need to change what you're doing because that makes you a dictatorship.
[42:17.000 --> 42:29.000]  Even if what you're saying is true, you can just declare yourselves this new oligarchy in the parties like the Central Committee and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and others.
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  Just a few months ago would kind of go in and out of attacking Trump or supporting him because they know where the populist movement is, whether you love Trump or hating.
[42:35.000 --> 42:42.000]  They don't want to be against their audience. Now they're forced to come out against the Republican establishment because their listeners are driving them to do it.
[42:42.000 --> 42:55.000]  And that's a beautiful thing. They're not buying it. And that's why Hannity's like, stop, stop, stop saying you had a landslide in states where there was no election. Stop it.
[42:55.000 --> 43:03.000]  And that's how I feel when somebody sits there and con games me. I've got pretty good children.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  But my son has a tendency to put tangerine and orange peels he's done since he was two years old under the couch cushions.
[43:09.000 --> 43:22.000]  And the other day we're in there, we're reading, we're in the living room, classical music's on, this was going on in my house on Saturday, and I watch him stuff tangerine peels underneath the seat.
[43:22.000 --> 43:34.000]  Just unconsciously, about an hour later, I said, son, Rex, go over there and get the peels out. He goes, there are no peels. I looked up and said, you see those? He goes, I didn't do that.
[43:34.000 --> 43:44.000]  And I said, you're grounded for a week, brother, and you're out of tennis practice and everything else. And he looked at me and he's so honest, he's so good.
[43:44.000 --> 43:53.000]  But when they're young, they get to that age, they want to test stuff out. There's a lot of room, remember doing it. And I said, you subconsciously stuffed them under there right in front of me an hour ago.
[43:53.000 --> 44:06.000]  And it's just, it's a little stuff like that. And I didn't really get mad at him, but he's not a 50-something-year-old US senator who I watched stuff the orange peels under the seat under the red sofa.
[44:06.000 --> 44:18.000]  I watched it. Don't tell me, Cruz, I didn't see it. Stop treating me like a moron. He's got top psych warfare British firms writing his scripts now.
[44:18.000 --> 44:33.000]  Oh, you're paying millions, so they come up with total ball face con lies to keep stating. The democracy is a spoken landslides. I get all the delegates. I'm winning. The people have spoken. This is an uprising.
[44:33.000 --> 44:50.000]  You know, I could have told you those lies for nothing. I mean, notice how the con man goes to the bigger con man, like the emperors' new clothes and pays them for the imaginary gold sewn outfit he's going to wear.
[44:50.000 --> 44:58.000]  And there's nothing there. And Ted Cruz has put on this outfit and walked out naked in front of everyone and went, I'm winning the grassroots. I'm the king.
[44:58.000 --> 45:05.000]  Everybody's going, he's butt naked. But the media goes, no, he's not. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. And finally, people just go, you know what, he is naked.
[45:05.000 --> 45:15.000]  Man, put it away. Put some underwear on, Cruz. He's like, it's golden. You know, there's parable of the emperors' new clothes. I'm sure you do, folks. If not, just Google it.
[45:15.000 --> 45:24.000]  So let's go to Hannity. I'm not going to play the whole thing. It's just long, but he just starts flipping out on him. As you show, this is the normal behavior.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  When you're being lied to, here it is.
[45:28.000 --> 45:36.000]  It's more than a process question. It's an integrity of the election question, and everybody's asking me this question. So I'm giving you an opportunity to explain it.
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  Sean, the only people asking this question are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.
[45:41.000 --> 45:51.000]  Why do you do this every single time? No, you got to stop. Every time I have you on the air, and I ask a legitimate question, you try to throw this in my face. I'm getting sick of it.
[45:51.000 --> 46:00.000]  I've had you on more than any other candidate on radio and TV. So if I ask you, Senator, a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don't you just answer it?
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  Sean, can I answer your question without being interrupted? Go ahead.
[46:03.000 --> 46:12.000]  In the last three weeks, there have been five elections in five states. Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Wyoming.
[46:12.000 --> 46:18.000]  We've won all five. Over 1.3 million people voted in those five states. What?
[46:18.000 --> 46:30.000]  We won all five. All of this noise and complaining and whining has come from the Trump campaign, because they don't like the fact that they've lost five elections in a row, that Republicans are uniting behind our campaign.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  It does it again.
[46:31.000 --> 46:43.000]  They're screaming on drudge, and it's getting echoed. This notion of voterless election. It is nonsense. They are making it up. Over 1.3 million people voted. We won landslides in all five.
[46:43.000 --> 46:49.000]  Now, there is a second component beyond the elections, which is the individual delegates are elected by the people.
[46:49.000 --> 47:02.000]  Donald Trump's campaign does not know how to organize on the grassroots. And so when the delegates are elected, conservative activists, real conservative activists, and they elect delegates, and we are winning those elections over and over and over again,
[47:02.000 --> 47:07.000]  the Donald Trump campaign doesn't know what they're doing. They don't show up in Colorado.
[47:07.000 --> 47:16.000]  Okay, so they go and they claim, oh, you were all delegates from years ago. That's how it works. You show up.
[47:16.000 --> 47:24.000]  And there's just no election. And then they organize who they think has pledged a cruise and they claim he wins all 34 delegates.
[47:24.000 --> 47:35.000]  And he calls that a voter. This is the new weird, again, alchemy, twisting, turned lead into gold baloney that they're engaged in.
[47:35.000 --> 47:46.000]  And then he goes into states where he wins the popular vote in Arizona and all these other places, Louisiana, Tennessee, and then takes them, Georgia.
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  And then it turns out in many cases, the party's just claiming these superdelegates are represented. They're just making it up. Lawsuits are being filed.
[47:56.000 --> 48:07.000]  And then just like a lawyer would do, a fancy Goldman Sachs lawyer would do. I mean, I love New Yorkers. I love Northerners.
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  I love real Americana Yankees. I don't like a bunch of foreigners move in and then say they don't like Donald Trump because he's not an American,
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  and then the person that wouldn't even born here. Nothing is people that weren't born here, but, you know, folks bashing Donald Trump.
[48:18.000 --> 48:29.000]  But I'll tell you, you got somebody from Canada talking about Donald Trump and New York values and bashing Donald Trump.
[48:29.000 --> 48:37.000]  The folks with New York values that he was talking about, slicksters, con artists like Goldman Sachs people like himself.
[48:37.000 --> 48:45.000]  They're the ones that voted for you, Cruz. That's where he got votes was in Manhattan.
[48:45.000 --> 48:56.000]  The people, the farmers, the shop owners, the factory owners in the smaller towns in rural New York, they went basically 100% for Trump.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  Those are New York values and those are Texas values.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  It makes me sick to see somebody from Canada play the region card on the American people who are battling for this country's future.
[49:09.000 --> 49:18.000]  This country is in a death battle and Americans have to come together now against the globalist and the communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and everybody else lecturing us.
[49:18.000 --> 49:28.000]  And I don't want to hear any more of that Hillary Clinton bashing Southerners with her crud or fake Southerners bashing Northerners.
[49:28.000 --> 49:36.000]  It's a load of bull. It's more Balkanization, more race baiting, more garbage.
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  Now, by the way, I've gotten where when we have a special, I ended on the day we're going to end it generally.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  And it's normal because we can only have a special so long because if something gets ready to sell out, we got to hold something back.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  We sign up for auto shipping, get 10% off everything at m4store.com. You can cancel anytime.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  Set it for 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and out.

[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  That's what we set out to do. Weldon and Tim are always adding more to it, other great companies.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  But we're extending it maybe just a few more hours because I need to hold some back and not just sell out of it before it gets here in a month.
[50:18.000 --> 50:26.000]  BrainForce are top-neutropic. We've got enough to keep going a few more hours at the sale and I'm going to hold some back. It'll go to regular price.
[50:26.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's 45% off retail right now. Find out about LC&N, AlphaGPC and other key compounds it has with these upload acids that are patented to be able to really deliver to the brain.

[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  But VAR, COPA herb extract, it's got a bunch of other stuff I can't pronounce.
[50:48.000 --> 50:54.000]  But the top is scientists and chemists and folks that come with this and it's very popular on the third-party review sites.
[50:54.000 --> 51:12.000]  5-star reviews, info wars, life.com. It is ending in a few hours. BrainForce available.

[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  Unfortunately, our national debt is spiraling out of control. But gold coins could be the answer.

[52:41.000 --> 53:04.000]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.000]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply. It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.000]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[53:16.000 --> 53:29.000]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[53:29.000 --> 53:35.000]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market. The gold standard in water purification.
[53:35.000 --> 53:40.000]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  Big Berkey. The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[54:21.000 --> 54:41.000]  Just slid back into the chair here a little bit late. Almost a little bit late because I was busy sending a tweet out.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  And I don't normally tweet at Drudge or tweet at Trump, but I really think there's been a missed opportunity here.
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.000]  Drudge has admitted he linked to it yesterday and linked to it a few weeks ago in the first broker last week.
[54:52.000 --> 55:03.000]  Phyllis Laughley is a true intellectual woman, super smart, founded the modern conservative movement that tried to stop the globalist takeover, the whole Berry Goldwater deal.
[55:03.000 --> 55:09.000]  She's 91 years old. My grandmother's about to be 91 and she's sharper than my grandmother who's still completely there.
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  And there was a coup by Cruz operatives to take over her very powerful organization Eagle Form.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  Because she supported Trump, they said that she was mentally ill basically and crazy.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  Really along with the majority of other Americans.
[55:25.000 --> 55:33.000]  Maybe the Republicans have a rule that Ted Cruz is allowed to take over the millions of the bank accounts and all the chapters and organizations of women and others in Eagle Form around the country.
[55:33.000 --> 55:49.000]  Maybe so. Maybe that's the case, but I think routinely Donald Trump tweets info wars.com videos and articles.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  And I know a lot of my thoughts get telegraphed over to Trump and he resonates with a lot of them.
[55:54.000 --> 56:05.000]  But I really think he should make an issue about Phyllis Laughley, not just with conservatives, but everybody about how Cruz tried to take over this lady's organization.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  So she's on with this in one hour. I should have added that earlier. She'll be joining us in the third hour.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  We have another informative guest joining us in the next segment.
[56:14.000 --> 56:27.000]  I don't have the staff to even go back when he was on last year and predicted that this year would be incredible earthquakes and more, but now you see that he's going to be joining us to talk about earth changes and more in the second hour.
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.000]  And then the third hour we've got David Knight always does a great job. He'll be on showing a quarterbacking the operation.
[56:33.000 --> 56:44.000]  But Phyllis Laughley is going to be on and I just tweeted it out. You go to real Alex Jones and retweet that everybody with the link to info wars.com forward slash show.
[56:44.000 --> 56:55.000]  So that everybody at the Eagle Forum that survived the coup and everybody else can hopefully retweet this. And again, this tweet won't save the world, but I'm just getting better at actually trying to promote the show, which is growing.
[56:55.000 --> 57:04.000]  But if we just do a few other things, kind of like untie the boat from the dock when the motor's going, we'll go a little bit faster. And you, the listeners really are the engine of this whole operation.
[57:04.000 --> 57:23.000]  So info wars.com forward slash show. Send that link out to everybody info wars.com forward slash newsletter. Put in your email if you want key alerts and, you know, just a lot of inside info that we're able to send directly to folks that sign up for the email alerts and info wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.000]  I want to get into this whole rap video saying basically killed Donald Trump.
[57:29.000 --> 57:39.000]  And then the people on it really look like they're proud of themselves and think they're doing well. There's a there's a there's a jolliness to it.
[57:39.000 --> 57:46.000]  Like, you know, Santa Claus talking about this stuff, because it's like, Hey, the mainstream media says it's okay to do and everybody jumps in on it.
[57:46.000 --> 57:56.000]  It reminds me of that, you know, lighthearted video where folks are like, when looking for the leprechaun, they're like, everybody see the leprechaun and say, Yeah, yeah, it's like it's fun.
[57:56.000 --> 58:05.000]  So there's this jolliness to it. And that's what's so scary about it is that it's just whether it's, you know, UT students or whether it's women or whether it's whoever it is.
[58:05.000 --> 58:14.000]  You know, at a feminist meeting, they just really think it's the right thing to talk about killing people because you disagree with them.
[58:14.000 --> 58:22.000]  And the media and the Secret Service and everybody else just let them do it. In fact, there's an article out today. Secret Service is overwhelmed. They can't even deal with all this.
[58:22.000 --> 58:29.000]  So Donald Trump's pretty mild. He's just a nationalist. And he's got him so scared, folks. It's crazy.
[58:29.000 --> 58:36.000]  We'll be back with the second hour. If you're listening to us on AM and FM stations. Oh, that's so important. Tell everybody you're everybody at your work, you name it.
[58:36.000 --> 58:42.000]  Lunch is coming up right now to tune in in their lunch hour to this local affiliate you're listening to or send out that link to info wars.com.
[58:42.000 --> 58:49.000]  That's how we win the war. People power grassroots. Nothing can stop you.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  Then vote for delegates to attend the National Convention.
[59:16.000 --> 59:23.000]  Fox use his computer to show the ballot and the situation. Sanders voters are being put in on the left side of the Democrat ballot.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are listed. The voter chooses one. No problem.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  On the right side of the ballot are a slate of delegates to be sent to the National Convention. The voter is to choose six.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  The rub six Clinton delegates options are listed. Only five are listed for Sanders.
[59:38.000 --> 59:45.000]  So there you have it. Yet again, the corrupt elite are trying to rig this entire vote.
[59:45.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Stay tuned for more reports info wars.com. I'm Joe Biggs. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  The class flied mugged by the Cruz operatives.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  Unsuccessfully, they kind of hit her on the head, got the purse away for a minute.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Bystanders tackled them, got the purse back. I mean, that's by allegory of them trying to take over the Eagle Forum.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  She's going to be joining us. Popping in the third hour today. We have standale and huge earth changes coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  I mean, I really cannot stress to you enough that you know, I don't really cover earth changes though I follow them.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  I never get into the planet X or never get into all the stuff.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  And now all crazy. It's like National Geographic. There is a giant Kuiper Belt gas giant the size of Jupiter, you know, coming in and then the earthquakes and record levels and just it's crazy.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  I don't know what's going on, but I know standale predicted on the show last year.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  We look at the date when he was here.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Because I mean, I guess I never even asked you guys to do this. We can go find where he said next year is going to be just the most, you know, tectonic ever and back then, California was
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  that area of the plate from northern Mexico there in the Baja up into almost up to Seattle.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  That is all completely overdue. And then now mainstream seismologists everywhere are the same the same thing.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  So that's coming up here in the next segment. You know, this came out a few days ago, but it's back in the news today.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  And I really want to do a piece where I look at Mono, I mean Bono.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  And when I look at George Clooney and all these guys because I've talked to a lot of big insiders in Hollywood.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  And I've actually been at parties before where some of these people been there and I mean exclusive parties.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  There's like 60 people, 20 people.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  And they are the most insulated fake intellectual know it all pampered, but on a very short lease from the producers.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And I don't want to bash people like Matt Damon and George Clooney and Alec Baldwin.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  It's been very useful to me to quote Kim Jong Il in Team America.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  But what shocked me the last few years was talking to people and they go, no, no, no, with Clooney, it's all an act.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  And with Matt Damon, it's all an act.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  And with Ben Affleck, it's all an act.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  And that behind the scenes, this is other big stars have told me this.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  They literally know about everything.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Like Ashton Kutcher, I know, like is into the show and all the New World Order and all that stuff.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  We've had a lot of people on the show as well, but they get in big trouble when they come on or even send something out.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  They get threatened, you name it.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  Well, it's one thing, you know, be like most of the other stars like Kurt Russell, who, you know, is obviously a patriot knows what's going on.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  If you get asked a question, they go ahead and tell the truth or just don't say anything.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  But instead, these guys know about everything and have decided Leonardo DiCaprio, you name it, to wallow with the establishment when they know it's all a giant fraud just for their careers.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  People go, well, yeah, that's how you climb ladders.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  That's how you brown nose.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  And I guess that's the that's the separation right there.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  I'd rather go out and create my own media system and make films that are seen hundreds of millions of times and really interface with humanity and have a future for my progeny.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Then just fly around in helicopters and have these weird neurotic anorexic wives.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  I've been out in LA a lot folks.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  They are so depressed.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  It is. It's horrible.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  It's horrible.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  But again, they're just actors who play the part for the producers.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  And so you have people like Chris Carter, who's a listener and says he likes my work and the world government's a threat.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  And I haven't gone out to meet him yet.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  He says he wants to.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  And I want to too.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  But see, I'm kind of at that level where I'm not bragging.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  I'm just saying being a Liberty lover, see is I'm not down there as an actor like one of these people who just gets up there and I guess acts again.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Like they, you know, want to carbon tax and save the earth and the polar bears.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  I'm really care about humanity.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And so the good news is I'm interfacing with the producers and the people that these folks like George Clooney work for.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  That's what George Clooney wants to be a director and a producer and has other people basically make his films.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  And then, you know, he can be like the big wig and pretend he has a brain.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  But the truth is he does have a brain.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  That's what's scary.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  These guys all know about this stuff.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Brad Pitt has seen my films.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  He has seen the late great Aaron Russo's film.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  And what does he do?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  He goes in grovels to the UN and his wife goes and joins it and the CFR.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  I mean, like 10 years ago or 11, 12 years ago, Brad Pitt's like, oh, really cool.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Have these interactions.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  I'm not going to even get into it.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  It's so stupid.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  I mean, I'm not into Billy Corgan because he's a big rock star or whatever.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  I'm into it because he's informed and knows what's going on and has the courage to speak out when they try to penalize it.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  It's not about worshipping celebrity Joe Biggs here with info wars.com fresh evidence links Saudi government to 9 11 article up by Daily Mail on the drudge report.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  Fresh information allegedly connecting the government of Saudi Arabia and the 9 11 terror attacks has been released.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  Officials have revealed that the fly certificate of Al Qaeda bomb maker, Ghassan Al Sharbi was discovered hidden in an envelope from the Saudi embassy in Washington when they arrested him in 2002.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Al Sharbi is believed to have learned how to fly with the hijackers but did not take part in the attacks shortly before his arrest.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  He buried a bundle of documents which is believed to have included the certificate.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Now, how long has Alex been saying that there's been something like this going on saying that Saudi Arabia was behind this and that our government knew about it and kept it under wraps.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  That's why it's an inside job.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  That's why you need to continue to watch info wars.com because we are the ones breaking this kind of news on a daily basis.

[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how young Jebedee and the products at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  Phyllis Schlafly, who cruise operatives reportedly tried to take over her operation a few weeks ago, has only done one video since this happened, breaking down what happened that I know of.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  She's going to be joining us much exclusively for first, here today, popping in in the third hour.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  It's going to be a big deal because Ted Cruz and the Republican Party say that popular voting never existed in primaries and that we've all made it up and that we're all insane.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Well, maybe the Eagle Forum was never controlled by her and it just belonged to Ted Cruz forever. Maybe he founded it 55 years ago.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  And TPP tells us that it's secret and runs our country now and that we're not allowed to see it. So, you know, the sky's the limit when you get to this level of con artist behavior.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  We're also going to be getting into more of what's happening in Hollywood.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And people like Bono, who for decades puts out the first iPod for people with HIV, and then it turns out less than 1% of the money went to people.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  And then he does it for the UN and continues and sends less than 1% to actually help anybody.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  I mean, the best charities give like 85 to 90%. I get you have overhead. There's nothing wrong with that with advertising and getting more money.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  But I want to really start focusing in because here's George Clooney raising $15 million for Hillary and the DNC in just a few days, but then denounces money and politics a day later.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  And I've known people that know Clooney and these other folks and I've seen it for myself with some of these Hollywood stars.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Their actors, when they get up on TV and call for carbon taxes and gun control, a bunch of them are actually libertarian patriots like Kurt Russell. They know what's going on.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  But they won't go public. It's like Jeff Bridges contacted me just to say, hey, you know, I like what you're doing, appreciate your courage, whatever, but doesn't go public.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Or somebody like Kurt Russell comes out, well, I'm not liberal or conservative. I'm 1776. I don't like global government in the New World Order.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Or Bruce Willis used to be a Republican till he saw my films. He told Rick Linklater and I later had a chance to talk to him briefly.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  But yeah, I'm not going to go public. The public's too dumb. None of this is going anywhere. But yeah, you're dead on what you're saying.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  He told Vanity Fair, he said there's a world government. Same folks that killed Kennedy are still running things today.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  I used to be a Republican, but now I realize both parties are controlled.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Again, if they ever lose Hollywood, they lose everybody because 80 to 90% of the propaganda is in movies and in fiction now.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  It's not even in news. We're winning the Info War in the 10, 15% of people that get their information from the news because they've been forced to just lie and lie and lie until the mainstream media in major
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Gallup polls and others has a 6 to 10% trust rate. The latest is 6%. We covered that.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  And there's other paradigms to the mainstream media.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Our Earth, however it was created, however old it is, I don't go with a lot of the mainline Christian interpretations that are men's interpretations of the Bible.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  That the Earth is 6,000 years old. I don't go with mainline science that it's 4 or 5 billion years old and we only get hit by asteroids every 2 million years.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  Now they admit because of Shoemaker-Levy research and what happened with that comet that, no, it's happening every 100,000 or so.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  And satellites show us giant craters all over the world that have just been filled in with water or filled in with trees, filled in with foliage.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  I don't know all the mysteries of the universe, but I know this.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  The Ring of Fire from the Pacific Ocean all the way around from Asia to the tip of Chile has triggered everywhere in the last decade, but key plates off California and in California.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  And I've been listening to this fellow on Coast to Coast AM for, I don't know, 15 years, 20 years.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  I've read some of his work. He's really, we've had volcanologists on, we've had seismologists on and they're all getting government funding.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  So they're very careful about what they say.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  But basically everything I hear them saying now, I heard five years ago from Standaio.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  And if you go to the last interview we did, in fact, what was the name of it?
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Somebody search YouTube and find it or search our database to find the date and find it on YouTube.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  I think we have the headlines on our computer in there.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  He was on about, I don't know, a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  He's on intermittent. Let me show them one more.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  He said specifically watch 2016, watch what's going to unfold.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And the fact that it's so overdue in California that we're going to see just one of the biggest quakes ever there.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And it, it could bring our economy into tailspin.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  He also talked about Yellowstone a decade ago and how it's rising and falling.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Basically everything he said.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  And quite frankly, I'm, even though he's well spoken and a great guy and hasn't, you know, great, you know, curriculum vitae.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  I would just roll my eyes and say, okay, yeah, because I don't get into the whole earth changes thing.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  Because you kind of think of this happens to somebody else.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  This happened to the Romans in Pompeii or it happened in the Pacific in Krakatoa a hundred years ago.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  And the last time he was on was over a year ago.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  Time flies, February 6, 2015.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  You can pull that interview up and hear it for yourself.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  But the body was works there. The books he's written.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  He has predicted things more accurately than anybody I have read or talked to.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Here's the headline, volcanic experts, super eruption coming.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  And now you see what they're calling unprecedented eruptions, unprecedented geological activity, tectonic activity.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Now the sun's cooled off. That affects our climate.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Is that doing it? Is it the magnetic field?
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  He's the expert because he looks at all the studies, the full spectrum.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  So many experts, the universal level, just write their own little papers in their one little area.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  And don't do the general research.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Ecuador Earthquake, death toll rises 350.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Channel 9, first alert.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  Could a super volcano under Yellowstone National Park erupt soon?
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  Aspen quakes, quakes, Halt Sony's senior plant may impact iPhone production.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Ecuador quake, survivors tell harrowing tales.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  The shaking continues, the most dangerous volcano in Mexico has erupted in spectacular fashion.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  The headlines that there's record volcanic activity.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  Should Northwest residents be worried about this week's back-to-back earthquakes?
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  We're seeing record earthquakes since they started recording them accurately with seismographs over 100 years ago.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Sharp shock hits Ecuador. It goes on and on.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  That's just some of the news. You've seen it everywhere.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  So finally the mainstream media is paying attention.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  I hope that we've seen the worst of it.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  But the point is we're floating around on crust that is on top of molten magma on a huge planetoid going 30-something thousand miles an hour through space.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  So when they say man-made climate change will arrest you if you disagree with it, of course there's climate change.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  It's always happening.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Now they're saying the world has to stay the same or humans did it.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  So so much ties into this.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  He's with us for the rest of the hour, five minutes to the next hour.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  Standao.com and going over his bio.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  He held an above top secret security clearance and worked undercover with the FBI.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  He was part of an exclusive black project specializing in the development of advanced technology.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  He stands diverse background in compasses, computer programming, marine architecture, advanced propulsion engineering, biblical studies and earthquake forecasting.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  And I'm not going to go over all the things that he's breaking down, but we're going to get into earthquake sweating right now.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  Pretty wild stuff.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Standao, great to have you with us.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  Thank you for inviting me again, Alex.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  There's certainly a lot happening to talk about.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  Well, everything you said over a year ago here, I thought it was six months ago, is basically now happening.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  Tell us what's happening from your research.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  What's coming next?
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  Because obviously the government and people are going to play this now.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  Well, there are probably good reasons for that.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Not that I side with the the illuminous.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  They have their own agenda.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  But the scientific community is hamstrung.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  And if they weren't, they have the fear of causing a panic if they predict earthquake or volcano.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  And it doesn't happen.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  And so they're put in a rock and a hard place to tell the public.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  And now then, of course, they've got a White House muzzle on them so they can't say anything.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  I have gotten information out that is not mainstream or is not even on the internet from a couple of individuals who are involved inside USG.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  And they have said that they've been making drivers, truck drivers and technicians that are delivering stuff to USGS at Yellowstone have been for the last two years to not tell anybody about it.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  And the number of seismometers that they're putting in and the fact that they're connected to a supercomputer.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  I think they moved it from Texas now then to Utah to the new center.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  But there there's a lot of effort being pointed at Yellowstone.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  And you can see the evidence of it in a lot of the video coming out of there that they're allowing to come out.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  And also last month, toward the end of the month, they closed down the whole network of seismometers, you know, updating and changing and whatever.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  But we got no feeds at that time from them.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  And Yellowstone is only one part of our problem.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  There are other volcanoes around the planet that are starting to erupt.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  Even North Korea has asked the United States for help with one that's about to erupt there, a big one.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  And the earthquakes, well now, you know, in the last seven, eight days, we've seen a number of earthquakes.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  I'm just looking at it here on my map, which I sent to your producer.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  You can put it up, shows the earthquakes over the last two weeks that are above a richer 5.5.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  And you can see in that on the western side of the Pacific, the second row right image.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  If you want to click on that there, that's the one. Yeah, click on that.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  There you go.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  Now, the size of the circle indicates the magnitude.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  And over Japan, which is right over here on the left side of the Ring of Fire,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  you can see that they had not only a 6.3, but a 7.2 and a bunch of aftershocks in that area.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  And over in Ecuador, you can see they had a series of 7.9, a bunch of aftershocks.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  And in Guatemala, near Central America there, and over off the coast of Australia up in Vanuatu.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  All around the Ring of Fire, but North America didn't get hit.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  Now, that's the issue. I heard you talking about that before we went to the break.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  The problem with this is that it's not only California, it's the whole west coast that hasn't released.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  And we know that up near Oregon and Washington, in the Juan de Fuca plate,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  that little kind of reddish area outlined there.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  Stay there. Stand over. We're coming right back to you.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  You'll have the floor to break this down.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  If you're a radio listener, infowords.com, forward slash show.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  You can see all these graphics for yourself.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold,
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  they change gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to U.S. citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  as for a special gold guide with new, never before released information about gold from the U.S. Money Reserve.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  Call 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  I'm Michael Reagan. Thank you.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  GoBurkey.com
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  I'm 36 years old and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy, drives and stamina.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  My yoga practice has deepened and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwey.com.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  Are you concerned about the power grid? About the new war on the power grid?
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  Here's why. An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just been written.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  Why do this? Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  The answer is simple. America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Do you fear for your life? Go to waronthegrid.com. That's waronthegrid.com.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Don't wait, waronthegrid.com.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  We're on a very active planet with a changing climate, changing tectonic forces.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  Stan Dayo, who's been accurately predicting earthquakes for decades,
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  and really been warning folks that we're building towards a huge crescendo,
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  now word for word what he said, I've seen in CBS News, you name it,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  scientists warn of the big one to hit California.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  If you just joined us and you're a radio listener, he's showing from the USGS and other bodies
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  maps of the record level of very strong earthquakes the last few weeks,
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  all around the ring of fire where the big plates come together.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  But nothing hitting the northern area of North America or the southern area,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  that entire plate line. So fears of the big one as seven major earthquake strike
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  Pacific region in just 96 hours.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  He was on a year ago talking about how it's weird that nothing's hitting the west coast.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Is something going on here? Is this being artificially manipulated and held back?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  I know they, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 98 told a press conference,
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  it was in the Army Times, that they have tectonic weapons.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  But I don't want to go too far. Let's get back to what you were getting into
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  just as we went to break, Mr. Dayo, and this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  You were getting into this plate, nothing's happening, and why that's so troubling.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Okay, all around the ring of fire over the last 57 years,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  there have been major releases of stresses that have been building up along the ring of fire,
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  where these little red lines are here on the image I've got.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Those are the edges of the tectonic plates. But scientists all over the world have noticed
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  that there is a big gap in the northern hemisphere part of the Pacific Rim plate
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  that is not releasing the seismic tension that's building up.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  And that is north of California. The bottom part of it comes down to the northern part of California
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  in the Juan de Fuca plate. It is building up so that when it releases,
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  it might release as much as a 9.2 Richter earthquake.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Now, where it is situated, it would cause flooding down in California coast.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  It would cause tsunamis that would hit over into Japan.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  It would force a local tsunami to go maybe 160 miles up into Oregon,
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  through river valleys and things. It's a very precipitous situation,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  and that could then trigger the numerous faults that run parallel to San Andreas
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  plus San Andreas, and start breaking California up into islands.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  So I can understand why no one comes out and officially says this,
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  because it would impact the economy of the United States and the world for that matter
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  very negatively if the panic started. But they have been doing the right thing,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  saying, well, in the next 30 to 50 years, there's a 10% chance
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  or maybe a bit more of a Richter 8 to 9 earthquake striking the northwest United States coastline.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  And they're trying to tell the people at Think and look ahead.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Maybe you better do that. Maybe you better get prepared and get out of there
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  or at least be able to weather something like this.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Sure, but you've been saying this for years, but now it's come out that a lot of top seismologists
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  and volcanologists are afraid of having their funding cut.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  They're being told, don't panic the public. Plus, if, thank God, it doesn't happen,
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  then they, quote, get discredited. But we saw the tsunami in Japan.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  We've seen the tsunamis before that kill hundreds of thousands in Asia.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  I mean, we're due for this. And a lot of seismologists, as you know,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  are saying they think it's a lot closer and is basically imminent.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  From your research and your sources, is it imminent? Is it 10 years off?
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  What's really happening?
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  When you say imminent, if you mean this year, I don't know.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  There are certainly peculiar signals I'm getting in the research I've been doing.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  If you go back to my show images page, second row middle image and click on that,
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  you can see the first one I've published on the internet here in a number of years
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  where I've been trying to find a way to predict the big earthquakes
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  a day, two, three days before they happen.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  And we see seismic forecast Japan, beta test version.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  I know that's when George Norrie has you on a lot. You have been accurate.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  I'd say, what, about 80% of the time, it's pretty scary.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Yeah. And that was when I had access to the naval data at Monterey, California.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  And when they changed over the programs and the satellites and everything,
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  they didn't do that report to the public anymore.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  And that's what scares me is they're shutting all the data down.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Well, probably with good intent because I'm a wildcard.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  I'm not financed by anybody but me and the good Lord.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  And, you know, I'll say what I think and I'll report what I see.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  And so if they let me use official naval data and explain how I was doing it
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  and predict massive quakes, if I predicted this massive quake somewhere,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  it would be the same as them saying it.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  And they don't want to panic because they've got their own agenda
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  for timing and release of the information.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  So I can understand, you know, I'm not mad, but I found another place
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  to get some of the information I used to use from the Navy.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  If you look at this image you got there that seismic forecast,
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  you can see that yellow circle around the lower part of the island.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  Put that back up. Yes.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  Okay, well now you can see that there's kind of green and pink signals
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  over the southern island of Japan.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  That's where we had those two big earthquakes on the outside of that circle
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  and it's moving up upward on the islands of Japan.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  So there's more coming.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  All right, we've got a long 18-minute segment coming up.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  We're going to come back, give you the floor to really break down the numbers
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  and where the most dangerous places in the world are,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  where you believe the next big ones are coming.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  But it doesn't matter if it's in northern Europe,
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  it doesn't matter where it is, Russia, Oklahoma,
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  there's just earthquakes everywhere where you never had them.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  The Empires on the Run.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules,
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
