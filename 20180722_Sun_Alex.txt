[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  The
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.400]  Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:18.400 --> 00:25.720]  The View, a panel of leftists spewing Alinsky-I-Propaganda slogans based on weaponized disinformation
[00:25.720 --> 00:27.320]  to their gullible mob audience.
[00:27.320 --> 00:33.880]  It's only a matter of time before Trump derangement syndrome begins to bubble to the surface.
[00:33.880 --> 00:39.000]  I mean, I have been in the crime business for over three decades, and I think I said
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.720]  that before.
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.500]  And I know a con when I see it.
[00:43.500 --> 00:48.840]  And I think that what has happened in the last, I think that what has happened truly
[00:48.840 --> 00:53.560]  in the last campaign, and everybody needs to be concerned about that.
[00:53.560 --> 00:55.480]  Lady Justice is supposed to be blind.
[00:55.480 --> 00:56.480]  Not an ideologue.
[00:56.480 --> 00:57.480]  I'm not.
[00:57.480 --> 00:58.480]  I am in law enforcement.
[00:58.480 --> 00:59.480]  Let me ask you the question.
[00:59.480 --> 01:00.480]  Right and left.
[01:00.480 --> 01:05.760]  Do you think Donald Trump embraces and embodies conservative ideology?
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.920]  Remember, he used to be, have a different position on pro-choice.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.720]  He's imposing tariffs.
[01:13.720 --> 01:15.000]  He's against globalism.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.240]  Do you think he is an ideologue that is faithful to conservative policies?
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.680]  You know, I'm not here to talk about what Donald Trump is and isn't, but I don't know
[01:22.680 --> 01:23.680]  about it.
[01:23.680 --> 01:24.680]  No, you got to answer the question.
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.120]  You want to talk about Donald Trump.
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.480]  You tell me what metric in this country is worse off.
[01:32.480 --> 01:35.080]  Unemployment is lower than it's been in 50 years.
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.560]  Minorities, Hispanics, African-Americans have dropped what he had when he had his
[01:40.560 --> 01:41.560]  hate crimes.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.560]  And wait a minute.
[01:42.560 --> 01:45.680]  The GDP under Obama was barely one.
[01:45.680 --> 01:46.680]  We're going up to four.
[01:46.680 --> 01:49.520]  And if Democrats don't get there, you know what, together, he's certainly going to get
[01:49.520 --> 01:50.520]  to the last one.
[01:50.520 --> 01:51.520]  Here's my question for you.
[01:51.520 --> 01:53.880]  Here's my question for you, because you talk about, you talk about.
[01:53.880 --> 01:54.880]  I am not.
[01:54.880 --> 01:55.880]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.160]  Did you just point at me?
[01:58.160 --> 01:59.160]  Yeah.
[01:59.160 --> 02:00.800]  Listen, I don't have Trump deranged me.
[02:00.800 --> 02:01.800]  Let me tell you what I have.
[02:01.800 --> 02:02.800]  Okay.
[02:02.800 --> 02:08.600]  I have a lot of, I'm tired of people starting a conversation with Mexicans, or Lyres, and
[02:08.600 --> 02:09.600]  rapists.
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.000]  I'm tired of people starting a conversation.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.400]  This is where the Trump derangement syndrome starts to fester.
[02:16.400 --> 02:18.320]  Whoopi is arguing a moot point.
[02:18.320 --> 02:19.480]  Yes, Whoopi.
[02:19.480 --> 02:24.360]  Over 32% of federal inmates in the U.S. are illegal aliens.
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.960]  And yes, roughly 5,000 U.S. citizens die every year as a result of illegal alien drivers.
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.080]  And yes, there is a largely ignored rape epidemic of American children by illegal aliens.
[02:36.080 --> 02:42.040]  And yes, it does cost the U.S. taxpayers roughly $113 billion per year to pick up the
[02:42.040 --> 02:44.720]  tab on the illegals pouring over our border.
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.360]  Whoopi's frustration is meaningless, because regardless of what fantasy the left may believe,
[02:51.360 --> 02:57.000]  we do have immigration laws, and most Americans want them enforced and strengthened.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.880]  Listen, I'm 62 years old.
[02:59.880 --> 03:02.520]  There have been a lot of people in office that I didn't agree with.
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.880]  But I have never, ever seen anything like this.
[03:06.880 --> 03:09.560]  I've never seen anybody whip up such hate.
[03:09.560 --> 03:13.080]  I've never seen anybody be so dismissive.
[03:13.080 --> 03:19.200]  Next, Whoopi mockingly asks what is the deep state, as if it were on par with the fictional
[03:19.200 --> 03:20.720]  Legion of Doom?
[03:20.720 --> 03:25.520]  One of the things that you talk about a lot, and I'm curious about it, is the deep state.
[03:25.520 --> 03:28.440]  How long has the deep state been there, and who's running it?
[03:28.440 --> 03:31.440]  Unfortunately, the judge isn't permitted to answer.
[03:31.440 --> 03:33.080]  So I will answer for her.
[03:33.080 --> 03:38.120]  The deep state is a massive bureaucratic fourth branch of government that continues to infest
[03:38.120 --> 03:43.320]  Washington D.C. as it remains indefinitely immune to our election process.
[03:43.320 --> 03:48.040]  As presidents and congressmen have come and gone, foreign and internal corruption have
[03:48.040 --> 03:54.240]  ensured that the deep state has grown in stature, feeding on limiting and ultimately destroying
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.920]  our Bill of Rights in order to gain an elitist totalitarian stranglehold on our country and
[03:59.920 --> 04:01.320]  its citizens.
[04:01.320 --> 04:07.640]  Its minions inhabit the intelligence community, the Pentagon, congressional lobbyists and politicians
[04:07.640 --> 04:12.480]  think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations and representatives of the United
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.280]  Nations as the UN Agendas 21 and 30 are wielded on sovereignty across the globe.
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.840]  Its origins in the United States are embedded in the history of the Federal Reserve, and
[04:24.840 --> 04:27.000]  we have been told of its intentions.
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.880]  Eisenhower warned us of the military-industrial complex, JFK warned us of secret societies,
[04:33.880 --> 04:40.320]  and previous presidencies have exposed its power by cow-towing the policies in direct
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.760]  opposition of their own promises to the American citizenry.
[04:44.760 --> 04:51.000]  It's not a small, insignificant boogeyman whoopee, it is massive and it is very real.
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.360]  The irony is, the daughter of one of its most prominent agents, John McCain, is sitting directly
[04:57.360 --> 05:00.960]  across from you, a man that we know.
[05:00.960 --> 05:06.040]  Taking your body is hard work, that's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily
[05:06.040 --> 05:08.840]  digestive pack to help you fuel it right.

[06:48.800 --> 06:55.280]  On this live Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Roger Stone is going to be hosting.
[06:55.280 --> 07:01.240]  I asked Roger Stone to host today because literally hundreds of stories that he's broken the last
[07:01.240 --> 07:03.720]  two years have turned out to be deadly accurate.
[07:03.720 --> 07:08.360]  So I'm going to ask him to review some of those, but also tell us what's coming next.
[07:08.360 --> 07:15.000]  But first, I wanted to reveal some incredible hypocrisy, in fact, it's beyond hypocrisy.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.640]  It is an insult to every thinking human being.
[07:18.640 --> 07:20.440]  And that's Hillary Clinton.
[07:20.440 --> 07:27.760]  She's come out today and said that she believes the Russians are going to hack the 2018 election.
[07:27.760 --> 07:31.360]  So she wants Democrat-controlled Homeland Security, they've got their people still in
[07:31.360 --> 07:34.360]  control, to federalize the elections.
[07:34.360 --> 07:40.040]  Obama signed an executive order to do this 10 days before he left office in 2017.
[07:40.040 --> 07:41.640]  Have they ever get this in place?
[07:41.640 --> 07:46.160]  We'll never have real elections again like Venezuela.
[07:46.160 --> 07:49.080]  They know there's been a major political realignment against them.
[07:49.080 --> 07:53.280]  And so now they're seeking to end our representative republic.
[07:53.280 --> 07:56.600]  Now, let's get to the major hypocrisy.
[07:56.600 --> 08:02.240]  She added on to this lie, when the evidence says the Democratic Party has illegal aliens
[08:02.240 --> 08:06.440]  voting all over the country, they've legalized it in San Francisco and Chicago and other
[08:06.440 --> 08:07.440]  areas.
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.480]  No, the evidence is the deep state, the globalist, the special interest backed up by the Communist
[08:12.480 --> 08:15.000]  Chinese are the ones manipulating our elections.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.280]  That's where all the evidence is in every Netflix show and Hollywood movie and the news,
[08:19.280 --> 08:23.000]  95% anti-Donald Trump, anti-nationalist, but I'm sorry.
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.840]  I'm digressing.
[08:24.840 --> 08:29.680]  What is the big giant piece of beyond hypocrisy?
[08:29.680 --> 08:32.200]  Hillary Clinton thinks you have no memory.
[08:32.200 --> 08:34.120]  Hillary Clinton thinks you're an idiot.
[08:34.120 --> 08:38.320]  She wrote a book in 2014 called Hard Choices.
[08:38.320 --> 08:44.400]  And in the book, Hard Choices, she talks about her deep bonding personally in private secret
[08:44.400 --> 08:47.840]  meetings that she only reveals in the book with Vladimir Putin.
[08:47.840 --> 08:50.320]  Then I did some research.
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.760]  You can look it up online.
[08:51.760 --> 08:57.680]  She also filed when she was secretary of state more than six times we know of to allow Bill
[08:57.680 --> 09:06.800]  Clinton to get a waiver around several federal laws to meet secretly with Vladimir Putin
[09:06.800 --> 09:09.720]  as her agent for the Clinton Foundation.
[09:09.720 --> 09:16.480]  The state department does not tell us if they ever gave the authorization, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:16.480 --> 09:17.840]  That is the mega hypocrisy.
[09:17.840 --> 09:23.600]  She is not only saying that the Russians plan to steal the 2018 election with no proof,
[09:23.600 --> 09:26.680]  saying that voters don't really want to realign, they don't really want to be populist, they
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.320]  don't really want to be nationalist, they don't really want to be free market.
[09:29.320 --> 09:35.480]  They're not really rejecting Bernie Sanders and Ms. Cortez and all their communism.
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.800]  No, no, no.
[09:36.800 --> 09:37.800]  The Russians did it.
[09:37.800 --> 09:40.040]  But here's the hypocrisy.
[09:40.040 --> 09:46.760]  She met with Putin at least twice secretly and brags about their deep bonding and Putin
[09:46.760 --> 09:51.400]  telling her about his mother surviving in World War II under a pile of bodies and all
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.000]  this other stuff and she only tells you in a book it had been secret and then she turns
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.680]  around and says President Trump cannot be trusted that he's compromised because he
[10:02.680 --> 10:07.760]  met with Putin behind closed doors at a public sanctioned event.
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.320]  Public summits, they always had private summits, always with world leaders.
[10:11.320 --> 10:12.800]  When you're the president, that's what you do.
[10:12.800 --> 10:18.320]  But the way they twist this and the way they think that the public would never figure
[10:18.320 --> 10:21.680]  this out, that the public would never understand this is just insane.
[10:21.680 --> 10:26.440]  But what's even crazier is I did Google and Bing searches and found it very hard to even
[10:26.440 --> 10:29.880]  find the original articles where she admitted all this four years ago.
[10:29.880 --> 10:33.840]  They have been definitely downvoted, blocked, removed, you name it.
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.280]  Because long before they made up the Russian narrative to blame American voters and populism
[10:38.280 --> 10:41.840]  and claim that we didn't really elect Trump, she was deeply in bed with the Russians, the
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.280]  Chai Khoms and others and sold out 20-plus percent of our uranium via Uranium-1.
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.280]  Robert Mueller landed on tarmacs with secret uranium transfers to let them see how strong
[10:52.280 --> 10:53.280]  it was.
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.960]  And no matter how many Snopes articles they write, these are the facts because it comes
[10:57.960 --> 11:01.480]  from Hillary's own statements and the State Department record as well.
[11:01.480 --> 11:03.240]  So you heard that right.
[11:03.240 --> 11:09.440]  Hillary Clinton met when she was Secretary of State secretly with Vladimir Putin repeatedly
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.120]  and sought authorization from Bill Clinton to do it at least six times.
[11:14.120 --> 11:16.000]  This needs to be investigated.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.640]  This needs to be exposed.
[11:17.640 --> 11:20.440]  This is the evidence of the real Russian collusion.
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.440]  Now we're about to go to Roger Stone live, but I wanted to add this point.
[11:24.440 --> 11:32.000]  Roger, in January of 2017 and right through March, first broke the illegal FISA warrant
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.040]  meaning that they had gotten the warrant against Carter Page and others by line to the FISA
[11:36.040 --> 11:37.040]  court.
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.000]  Then earlier this year, the FISA court issued a report admitting that they'd been lied to
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.840]  at least four separate times and calling for an investigation.
[11:43.840 --> 11:46.280]  That got almost no coverage as well in the control press.
[11:46.280 --> 11:48.280]  I wonder why.
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.320]  And now it's all come out that indeed the president was illegally spied on even before
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.520]  he got the nomination going back to 2015 by Barack Hussein Obama who was running the
[11:58.520 --> 12:00.240]  operation out of the White House.
[12:00.240 --> 12:06.160]  This is a ultra-massive scandal and Roger Stone will now break it all down today and
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.280]  look into the future about what he believes is coming next, but make no mistake.
[12:11.280 --> 12:12.920]  They know humanity's awake.
[12:12.920 --> 12:14.720]  They know we're involved.
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.880]  They know we're informed and they're making their move to shut down the free press, to
[12:18.880 --> 12:24.120]  shut down info wars like never before, congressional hearings last week, every major so-called
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.240]  news channel attacking us calling for us to be shut down because we continue to be way
[12:28.240 --> 12:29.560]  ahead of the curve.
[12:29.560 --> 12:34.840]  We continue to be next level, next year's news today and that's why info wars is so
[12:34.840 --> 12:35.840]  precious.
[12:35.840 --> 12:42.320]  I wish the other talk show host, I wish the other Patriot sites were as informed as we
[12:42.320 --> 12:43.320]  are.
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.440]  Quite frankly, the other place I see that is this cutting edge is zero hedge, sometimes
[12:47.440 --> 12:48.560]  daily caller.
[12:48.560 --> 12:49.840]  I want to be eclipsed.
[12:49.840 --> 12:53.080]  I want to be made obsolete because I want my children to have a future.
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.040]  I want the type of understanding we have to be mainstream and it's beginning to become
[12:57.040 --> 13:00.840]  mainstream in the general public's minds and the globalists know if everybody catches
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.040]  on the fact that info wars is the zeitgeist, we will win very, very quickly instead of
[13:05.040 --> 13:11.280]  a long, protracted, serious, ongoing, force generation warfare type situation that we're
[13:11.280 --> 13:12.280]  all witnessing right now.
[13:12.280 --> 13:14.440]  But make no mistake, this is history happening.
[13:14.440 --> 13:20.200]  It's critical that you spread the articles from newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com.
[13:20.200 --> 13:23.600]  The reason it's hard to spread those links is because we are the resistance.
[13:23.600 --> 13:25.040]  We are over the target.
[13:25.040 --> 13:27.040]  We have the information.
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.880]  Thank you all for making info wars a force to be reckoned with.
[13:30.880 --> 13:31.880]  You are the info war.
[13:31.880 --> 13:32.880]  You are the resistance.
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.920]  Now back to Roger Stone, but don't forget Hillary Clinton from her own mouth said she
[13:37.920 --> 13:41.840]  met secretly with Vladimir Putin and bonded with him and tried to get Bill Clinton in
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.800]  secret meetings with him.
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.120]  Now, she says Trump is a traitor, compromise and not trusted for meeting with him at a
[13:49.120 --> 13:50.620]  public summit.
[13:50.620 --> 13:55.720]  This is the truth and they hope the death of logic, but logic and memory is not dead
[13:55.720 --> 13:56.720]  and we will prevail.
[13:56.720 --> 13:59.720]  Thank you all.
[13:59.720 --> 14:17.760]  Welcome back to the next hour of the Alex Jones show how fitting that clash between
[14:17.760 --> 14:24.840]  Judge Jeanine Pirro who served with distinction as the district attorney of Westchester County,
[14:24.840 --> 14:31.680]  an able advocate for women, for children, putting criminals behind bars in an epic clash
[14:31.680 --> 14:37.000]  with Anna Navarro who according to the New York Times lied in her application to become
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.120]  a state employee about going to law school.
[14:41.120 --> 14:47.480]  Let's be very clear Anna Navarro cannot hold a candle to Jeanine Pirro when it comes to
[14:47.480 --> 14:55.560]  accomplishments or her authority on law enforcement issues and the entirely bogus nature of the
[14:55.560 --> 15:04.040]  mainstream media's continued false Russia narrative that Anna Navarro is just another
[15:04.040 --> 15:07.120]  nattering Nabob of.
[15:07.120 --> 15:14.920]  We're going to break down for you in the next hour this CYA move by the FBI releasing the
[15:14.920 --> 15:21.680]  Carter Page material that they used as the underlying rationale for their illegal FISA
[15:21.680 --> 15:22.680]  warrants.
[15:22.680 --> 15:25.200]  Alex Jones is absolutely right.
[15:25.200 --> 15:31.880]  The FISA warrants are the rosetta stone of understanding this entire Russian scandal.
[15:31.880 --> 15:59.720]  You'll be right back to lay it out for you.
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.600]  You know if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it in
[16:03.600 --> 16:05.240]  Fuller's life.

[20:23.560 --> 20:27.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:27.500 --> 20:30.080]  I'm your host, Roger Stone.
[20:30.080 --> 20:37.080]  It's very important to understand that a FISA warrant can only be issued against an American
[20:37.080 --> 20:44.320]  citizen if they are actively involved in espionage for a foreign power against the United
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.960]  States.
[20:45.960 --> 20:53.040]  How ironic that it is the information regarding the misuse of FISA warrants that Deputy Attorney
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.240]  General Rod Rosenstein has been stonewalling about.
[20:57.240 --> 21:03.680]  How ironic that the government refuses to hand over in discovery in the Paul Manafort
[21:03.680 --> 21:10.520]  trial any evidence regarding his being subject to a FISA warrant.
[21:10.520 --> 21:20.200]  How ironic that the government has now essentially released a document which demonstrates that
[21:20.200 --> 21:27.440]  their entire justification for a FISA warrant against Carter Page, a man who doesn't know
[21:27.440 --> 21:34.000]  much about headgear, was based on their own phony dossier.
[21:34.000 --> 21:43.040]  Wait a minute, FBI Director James Comey told us that the FISA warrant was based on a broad
[21:43.040 --> 21:45.800]  mosaic of information.
[21:45.800 --> 21:51.800]  The documents produced by the government today show that that is a lie.
[21:51.800 --> 22:01.240]  In fact, extraordinarily, for a 400-page document today, almost 300 pages are completely and
[22:01.240 --> 22:03.320]  totally redacted.
[22:03.320 --> 22:05.200]  That means blacked out.
[22:05.200 --> 22:06.280]  They're useless.
[22:06.280 --> 22:08.440]  They tell us nothing.
[22:08.440 --> 22:16.000]  And then you have media outlets like Vox trying to go out there with the establishment spin.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.680]  The FBI established surveillance of Carter Page because they believed the Russians were
[22:23.680 --> 22:25.840]  seeking to recruit him.
[22:25.840 --> 22:26.840]  No.
[22:26.840 --> 22:35.000]  Carter Page was subject to a FISA warrant because the government created a false narrative
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.600]  to make it appear that he was being recruited by the Russians, thus the use of FISA warrants
[22:41.600 --> 22:44.280]  for political purposes.
[22:44.280 --> 22:49.520]  That's why the current scandal is a much greater scandal than a watergate.
[22:49.520 --> 22:55.400]  You see, in a watergate, private individuals affiliated with President Nixon's campaign
[22:55.400 --> 23:02.000]  broke into the watergate complex of the Democratic National Committee and placed bugs, bugs that
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.480]  didn't really work very well.
[23:04.480 --> 23:10.040]  Also private citizens affiliated with the president's campaign infiltrated the campaigns
[23:10.040 --> 23:17.440]  of two of President Nixon's opponents, Senator Hubert Humphrey and Senator George McGovern.
[23:17.440 --> 23:20.600]  What we have here is far more egregious.
[23:20.600 --> 23:27.440]  It is the willful use of the power and the authority and the extraordinary technological
[23:27.440 --> 23:37.760]  capability of the government itself to hijack the 2016 election, to rig the election against
[23:37.760 --> 23:46.240]  Donald Trump and, as Peter Stroke so eloquently put it, to create an insurance policy in case
[23:46.240 --> 23:48.240]  Trump won.
[23:48.240 --> 23:55.720]  Now we know why Peter Stroke went to the FISA judge in proper contact that is memorialized
[23:55.720 --> 24:03.120]  in documents that were finally obtained by Devin Nunes, the hard-charging and courageous
[24:03.120 --> 24:09.360]  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, that shows that Stroke was trying to make sure
[24:09.360 --> 24:14.920]  that the phony FISA warrant request would be honored by the judge.
[24:14.920 --> 24:20.760]  That judge, when he realized he'd been had, when he realized he'd been lied to, recused
[24:20.760 --> 24:25.040]  himself and a new judge took his place.
[24:25.040 --> 24:32.000]  Why we have not been told the entire story is because it underpins the fact that the
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.000]  Obama Justice Department and the Obama FBI were caught in this stunning abuse of power.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.920]  That's why it's important to understand that the entire Russian collusion is an attempt
[24:48.920 --> 24:53.800]  to distract from this underlying crime.
[24:53.800 --> 25:00.720]  The entire fabricated narrative of Russian collusion is meant to distract from the fact
[25:00.720 --> 25:07.840]  that Bill and Hillary are in bed with the Russians, that the Podesta brothers are profiting
[25:07.840 --> 25:14.360]  from their business associations with the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin, that Bill
[25:14.360 --> 25:22.680]  and Hillary have taken $145 million from the Russian energy company at the precise time
[25:22.680 --> 25:29.800]  that they are seeking to obtain control of 20% of America's uranium reserves.
[25:29.800 --> 25:36.800]  What I've called the largest single treasonous financial crime in American history.
[25:36.800 --> 25:43.040]  And therefore, the phony Russophobia, oh look over there, Donald Trump's in bed with the
[25:43.040 --> 25:50.160]  Russians, is meant as a distraction from the fact that the Obama administration was rigging
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.600]  the election through the use of phony spying and FISA warrants, and it was Bill and Hillary
[25:56.600 --> 25:58.640]  who were compromised.
[25:58.640 --> 26:04.240]  That's what's so amazing about this video that we will show you in the next segment.
[26:04.240 --> 26:10.680]  Hillary Clinton is saying that Donald Trump is compromised based on his very public meeting.
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.520]  The irony of this smacks you in the face.
[26:13.520 --> 26:21.320]  It's Hillary Clinton who is compromised, compromised in the uranium one deal, compromised
[26:21.320 --> 26:29.120]  in the phony reset, and the Mueller investigation, which we're going to break down for you in
[26:29.120 --> 26:38.200]  the next segment, is the further continuation of this phony Russian collusion meme.
[26:38.200 --> 26:40.760]  A public distraction.
[26:40.760 --> 26:49.120]  Now the indictment of 13 Russians, followed by the indictment of 17 Russians, intelligence
[26:49.120 --> 26:56.040]  agencies, this is the kabuki theater of the DOJ, knowing that neither one of these cases
[26:56.040 --> 27:03.520]  were supposed to go to trial, when the 13 Russians accused of hacking into social media
[27:03.520 --> 27:10.240]  went to trial, suddenly Mr. Mueller was not in such a hurry to approve their crimes.
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.480]  Mueller and Rosenstein clearly understand that the Russian spies are not showing up
[27:14.480 --> 27:21.960]  for trial, and therefore their fake narrative that the DNC was hacked by Russia is today
[27:21.960 --> 27:28.840]  a formal accusation, a charge in a very detailed and very well written indictment.
[27:28.840 --> 27:34.240]  But in our system, an indictment is exactly that, it is not a conviction.
[27:34.240 --> 27:41.720]  Why mainstream media talking heads like Chris Cuomo pretend they don't know that IT counter-intelligence
[27:41.720 --> 27:48.480]  experts like Bill Biddy and Ray McGovern have pointed out the overwhelming forensic evidence
[27:48.480 --> 27:54.360]  that tends to disprove this notion of Russian hacking, asking me last week when I appeared
[27:54.360 --> 27:56.280]  on CNN, where did you see this?
[27:56.280 --> 27:57.280]  Where did you hear this?
[27:57.280 --> 28:03.680]  Chris, I read it in the Nation magazine, Biddy and McGovern are recognized experts in their
[28:03.680 --> 28:11.160]  field, and the download times of the material that was allegedly hacked point not to a hacking,
[28:11.160 --> 28:17.800]  but a download to a portable device where the material was spirited out the back door.
[28:17.800 --> 28:22.920]  We're going to be taking your calls later in the program, also Michael Caputo, one
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.640]  of the many victims of the Mueller witch hunt, will be joining us.
[28:28.640 --> 28:30.840]  We will be right back.
[28:30.840 --> 28:35.520]  But before I leave, I want to remind you, we need your help at the Info War Store to
[28:35.520 --> 29:05.280]  fight the war of censorship that is being waged against us daily.

[29:38.280 --> 29:42.920]  root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[29:42.920 --> 29:48.840]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[29:48.840 --> 29:51.760]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[30:57.320 --> 31:00.440]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[31:00.440 --> 31:04.800]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.800 --> 31:09.520]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.040]  to detoxify the body.
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.920]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.920 --> 31:17.440]  It's made in the USA.
[31:17.440 --> 31:22.360]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[31:22.360 --> 31:24.200]  the body and it supports the info war.
[31:24.200 --> 31:26.480]  It is a classical 360 win.
[31:26.480 --> 31:30.960]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:30.960 --> 31:35.720]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.720 --> 31:36.720]  get.
[31:36.720 --> 31:39.840]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.840 --> 31:44.880]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[31:44.880 --> 31:50.080]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[31:50.080 --> 31:52.800]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.800 --> 31:56.080]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:56.080 --> 32:00.320]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield, infowarslife.com.
[32:00.320 --> 32:04.200]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[32:04.200 --> 32:05.560]  Introducing pollen block.
[32:05.560 --> 32:10.720]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[32:10.720 --> 32:17.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[32:17.560 --> 32:23.440]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[32:23.440 --> 32:26.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[32:26.760 --> 32:31.680]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[32:31.680 --> 32:38.040]  of this research a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[32:38.040 --> 32:43.240]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current research
[32:43.240 --> 32:48.040]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme
[32:48.040 --> 32:52.160]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:52.160 --> 32:54.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[32:54.880 --> 33:03.520]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:03.520 --> 33:14.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.200 --> 33:25.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:25.880 --> 33:33.840]  The great mystery is why the president has not spoken up for our country.
[33:33.840 --> 33:39.920]  And we saw that most clearly in this recent meeting with Putin.
[33:39.920 --> 33:45.720]  We don't know what was said in the room, we're just the two of them.
[33:45.720 --> 33:51.480]  Putin is basically telling the world what was decided.
[33:51.480 --> 33:58.000]  He has been giving press statements, he's calling in Russian ambassadors to other countries,
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.800]  he's reaching out to other leaders and he's basically saying, well, here's what we decided
[34:02.800 --> 34:05.920]  and we're hearing crickets from the White House.
[34:05.920 --> 34:12.920]  There are some techs experts in Silicon Valley with whom I have met who say that maybe what
[34:12.920 --> 34:19.520]  they'll do this next time is to really disrupt the actual election, shut down the servers
[34:19.520 --> 34:26.560]  that you send results to, interfere with the operation of voting machines because still
[34:26.560 --> 34:31.680]  too many of them are linked to the Internet.
[34:31.680 --> 34:36.000]  That is so hypocritical that it is laughable.
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.120]  Has Hillary Clinton forgotten that her boss Barack Obama was caught up on a hot mic telling
[34:41.120 --> 34:46.160]  the Russians that after he was reelected in his last election, he would have much greater
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.640]  flexibility in giving them whatever they wanted?
[34:50.640 --> 34:55.520]  Does she really expect us to forget the fact that when the Russians rolled into Crimea,
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.360]  she as Secretary of State and Barack Obama, her leader, did nothing?
[35:01.360 --> 35:07.040]  Does she really expect us to forget about the cash she took in Uranium One or the failure
[35:07.040 --> 35:13.720]  of her Russian reset or the fact that her minions, the Podesta brothers were literally
[35:13.720 --> 35:19.680]  making millions in banking and gas in Uranium in Russia?
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.120]  No, that is about as funny as you can get.
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.320]  And then the question of the hacking of the elections is hysterical.
[35:27.320 --> 35:35.600]  As we reported right here at Infowars last week, two British royals, billionaires, members
[35:35.600 --> 35:43.200]  of the Queen's Privy Council, globalist associates of George Soros have gotten a complete
[35:43.200 --> 35:51.680]  monopoly on the software that is used in 90% of the computerized voting machines in the
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.840]  United States.
[35:53.840 --> 35:59.520]  If there's any danger of hacking in the next election, it's not from the Russians, it's
[35:59.520 --> 36:09.800]  from Hillary's compatriot and patron George Soros and his two business billionaire royals
[36:09.800 --> 36:14.120]  who are protected by the Queen.
[36:14.120 --> 36:23.560]  Now the Mueller investigation is of course the next extension of the phony Russian collusion
[36:23.560 --> 36:29.800]  narrative that is designed to distract us from the real illegal activity, the use of
[36:29.800 --> 36:36.600]  FISA warrants and the abuse of power involved in spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[36:36.600 --> 36:44.040]  It was revealed on Friday that my longtime friend, Kristen Davis, has been subpoenaed
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.920]  by the special counsel.
[36:45.920 --> 36:53.360]  Now Kristen Davis is maybe better known to many of you as the Manhattan Madame.
[36:53.360 --> 37:00.160]  Many years ago she was convicted of running one of the largest and most successful call
[37:00.160 --> 37:03.000]  girl rings in the world.
[37:03.000 --> 37:10.360]  She went to prison for her illegal activity, but Governor Elliot Spitzer, who utilized
[37:10.360 --> 37:18.640]  her call girl service, paid no real price and actually went on to host a show at CNN.
[37:18.640 --> 37:25.120]  It shows you the disparity in our justice system in how men and women are treated.
[37:25.120 --> 37:31.400]  Now the special counsel wants to question Kristen Davis who has worked on and off for
[37:31.400 --> 37:37.960]  me for 10 years about Russian collusion and WikiLeaks collaboration.
[37:37.960 --> 37:39.480]  Here's the problem.
[37:39.480 --> 37:46.880]  Kristen Davis didn't work for me at all in 2015 and she didn't work for me in 2016.
[37:46.880 --> 37:55.600]  Although I paid her in December of 2016, she didn't come to work for me until January.
[37:55.600 --> 38:03.880]  That's because in all of 2015 she was incarcerated and in 2016 she was with child.
[38:03.880 --> 38:11.120]  So she can have no knowledge of these activities, but now Kristen Davis, a single mother who's
[38:11.120 --> 38:18.760]  in the perfectly legal cosmetology business, has to pay legal fees to go before the grand
[38:18.760 --> 38:24.560]  jury and be questioned about matters that she knows nothing whatsoever about because
[38:24.560 --> 38:26.920]  she wasn't even there.
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.000]  She wasn't in my employ.
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.120]  This kind of reminds me of the special counsel's efforts to subpoena a young man named Andrew
[38:35.120 --> 38:36.280]  Miller.
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.800]  Andrew Miller was an associate of mine for a number of years.
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.320]  He's a very active libertarian.
[38:42.320 --> 38:47.840]  He supported Gary Johnson for president in both 2012 and 2016.
[38:47.840 --> 38:53.960]  He left me three years ago to go into the perfectly legal marijuana business with all
[38:53.960 --> 38:58.320]  the requisite permits and approvals in the state of California.
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.920]  In other words, Andrew Miller, who Mr. Mueller is seeking to drag in front of a grand jury,
[39:03.920 --> 39:09.880]  was also not working for me during the 2016 election, although we weren't certainly in
[39:09.880 --> 39:13.120]  touch and he did work on tiny projects.
[39:13.120 --> 39:21.040]  But like Kristen Davis, he has no knowledge of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration.
[39:21.040 --> 39:27.120]  This is a continuation of the witch hunt, yes, a fishing expedition.
[39:27.120 --> 39:33.200]  Now Mr. Mueller's agents don't like it when we call his investigation exactly what it
[39:33.200 --> 39:35.720]  is, a fraud.
[39:35.720 --> 39:41.480]  They have come up with no evidence of collusion or conspiracy or coordination between the
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.360]  Russian state and the Trump campaign.
[39:45.360 --> 39:52.200]  He is fooled by the show trial of the first 13 Russians and nobody will believe that the
[39:52.200 --> 39:58.840]  16 Russians more recently charged have been definitively declared guilty when they haven't.
[39:58.840 --> 40:04.880]  It's a public relations move designed to bolster Mr. Mueller's sagging credibility based on
[40:04.880 --> 40:08.720]  his failure to find any Russian collusion.
[40:08.720 --> 40:17.560]  Now a single mother seeking to raise her son, my godson, Carter Stone Davis, is being harassed
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.800]  and has to have shell out legal fees to be interrogated about affairs she knows nothing
[40:22.800 --> 40:23.800]  about.
[40:23.800 --> 40:28.400]  Her crime, she's a friend of Roger Stone's.
[40:28.400 --> 40:35.720]  Joining us coming up is another patriot who has paid a heavy price for his advocacy of
[40:35.720 --> 40:42.120]  the candidacy of Donald Trump and that is Michael Caputo, who will join us shortly.
[40:42.120 --> 40:45.360]  And then we're going to be taking your calls to do that.
[40:45.360 --> 40:55.360]  You call us at 877-789-2539, that's 877-789-2539.
[40:55.360 --> 41:02.840]  Many info warriors want to understand why the FBI did this CYA move today, essentially
[41:02.840 --> 41:05.400]  feeding off their own BS.
[41:05.400 --> 41:12.280]  They create a fake document and then they cite the document they created as the rationale
[41:12.280 --> 41:18.240]  to claim that Carter Page had been recruited by the Russians, a narrative that they themselves
[41:18.240 --> 41:19.880]  created.
[41:19.880 --> 41:28.600]  This is extraordinary, yet the MSNBCs, the Voxes, the Daily Beast, they continue to regurgitate
[41:28.600 --> 41:37.000]  the same crap that the FBI was justified in their examination of the affairs of Mr.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.800]  Page.
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.600]  When we come back, Michael Caputo joins us, but before we get there, I want to ask you
[41:43.600 --> 41:50.200]  to go to the Infowars.com store now because we face the greatest challenge in our history.
[41:50.200 --> 41:56.160]  It was info wars that broke the news that Tony Podesta would be given immunity in the
[41:56.160 --> 42:04.120]  trial of Paul Manafort when Podesta did the same thing that Manafort is accused of, lobbying
[42:04.120 --> 42:09.080]  for the Ukrainian political party without registering.
[42:09.080 --> 42:15.120]  Mr. Mueller exposes the completely partisan nature of his entire probe in that he is given
[42:15.120 --> 42:21.920]  Bill and Hillary's pal Podesta immunity for a crime that Manafort will now be prosecuted
[42:21.920 --> 42:22.920]  for.
[42:22.920 --> 42:24.640]  How convenient.
[42:24.640 --> 42:31.240]  Who are the other four people that Mr. Mueller has asked the court to grant immunity to?
[42:31.240 --> 42:35.120]  We'll be reporting on that story at Infowars as well.
[42:35.120 --> 42:40.600]  So we'll be right back with Michael Caputo and he'll help us break down the news about
[42:40.600 --> 43:00.120]  Carter Page and the FISA warrants.
[43:00.120 --> 43:05.800]  Anyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[43:05.800 --> 43:11.400]  We have global, hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[43:11.400 --> 43:16.680]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of
[43:16.680 --> 43:21.120]  replacing us with machines and Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have
[43:21.120 --> 43:22.120]  a human future.
[43:22.120 --> 43:26.920]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders and
[43:26.920 --> 43:32.520]  my only message is this, everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.680]  We should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching
[43:36.680 --> 43:40.360]  their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[43:40.360 --> 43:44.520]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power, we already have the power but we have
[43:44.520 --> 43:50.080]  to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[43:50.080 --> 43:52.720]  Infowars is on the front line and so are you.
[43:52.720 --> 43:59.040]  We are the resistance.
[43:59.040 --> 44:05.360]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.760]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[44:11.760 --> 44:19.000]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com you are funding the revolution.
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.920]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[44:23.920 --> 44:24.920]  at infowarstore.com.
[44:24.920 --> 44:28.600]  I don't want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste

[44:33.760 --> 44:34.760]  children and adults.
[44:34.760 --> 44:38.960]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[44:38.960 --> 44:46.800]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands
[44:46.800 --> 44:50.320]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.560]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[44:54.560 --> 45:01.560]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[45:01.560 --> 45:07.160]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[45:07.160 --> 45:12.280]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[45:12.280 --> 45:17.320]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.280]  sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and wake up America, Patriot
[45:22.280 --> 45:23.280]  Blend coffee.

[45:27.360 --> 45:32.320]  the world's finest coffee beans, carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used
[45:32.320 --> 45:34.520]  in big agricultural productions.

[46:55.840 --> 47:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.000 --> 47:37.960]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[47:37.960 --> 47:41.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[47:41.520 --> 47:47.560]  We're going to give you an extraordinary example of Trump derangement syndrome.
[47:47.560 --> 47:53.560]  Michael Caputo, a longtime friend of mine and a key soldier in the Trump Revolution, was
[47:53.560 --> 48:00.280]  back in the newspapers this week because a Republican political strategist named Sherry
[48:00.280 --> 48:08.280]  Jacobus actually advocated the violent rape of Caputo's children on Twitter.
[48:08.280 --> 48:15.240]  The response of her employers at USA Today was not favorable.
[48:15.240 --> 48:20.080]  Joining us now to break this vile story down is Michael Caputo.
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.680]  Michael, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[48:25.680 --> 48:31.280]  I've seen a lot of things in politics, but this was among the most vile, distasteful,
[48:31.280 --> 48:34.320]  incredible things I've ever seen.
[48:34.320 --> 48:37.760]  Tell folks exactly what happened here.
[48:37.760 --> 48:44.400]  Well, Sherry Jacobus was a columnist for the USA Today, and she was a Republican operative
[48:44.400 --> 48:46.640]  about 10 years ago.
[48:46.640 --> 48:51.920]  She tried to get a job with Donald Trump and was turned down and went crazy after that.
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.000]  She started becoming very active on Twitter and social media, beating up on Donald Trump
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  and anyone near him.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.680]  And about a year ago, she decided that I was going to be one of those people she's beating
[49:02.680 --> 49:03.680]  up on.
[49:03.680 --> 49:09.720]  For that entire time, she picked on my family, my wife, sort of asking about telling me that
[49:09.720 --> 49:15.280]  my children were going to hate me after I go to prison, et cetera, et cetera.
[49:15.280 --> 49:19.640]  And at first, I engaged her to try and calm her down, and then I ignored her, but she
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.080]  continued to do it even though I had blocked her.
[49:23.080 --> 49:29.480]  And then when you and I revealed that the FBI had sent an informant at Henry Greenberg
[49:29.480 --> 49:35.080]  to try to entrap us in 2016, she unblocked me because she had been blocking me for some
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.000]  time and then started going after me.
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.920]  Well, about late last week, Roger, I was going back and forth with a Florida Politico reporter
[49:43.920 --> 49:45.480]  named Mark Caputo.
[49:45.480 --> 49:49.320]  You know, he and I are not related, but you're friendly with him, and so am I.
[49:49.320 --> 49:54.600]  And we were talking just simply about very general issues, and Sherry jumped in and started
[49:54.600 --> 49:56.200]  going after me.
[49:56.200 --> 49:59.720]  So I did what I have been doing ever since that he started.
[49:59.720 --> 50:02.600]  I didn't want to engage with her anymore.
[50:02.600 --> 50:08.400]  And I just tweeted back at her a hashtag, which I created for her, Bitter, Childless
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.800]  and Alone, because she's bitter about Donald Trump not hiring her.
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.280]  She's childless for reasons that became obvious in the last couple of days.
[50:18.280 --> 50:21.280]  And she's very alone.
[50:21.280 --> 50:23.200]  When I did that, she went nuts.
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.760]  And she sent a tweet saying that when I'm in jail, my toddler daughters can actually
[50:28.760 --> 50:39.600]  work for Epstein, the Clinton pal who was arrested for and found guilty of sexually
[50:39.600 --> 50:42.320]  attacking an underage girl.
[50:42.320 --> 50:45.320]  I mean, I couldn't even understand it, Roger.
[50:45.320 --> 50:50.720]  It didn't make sense to me that any one of us all would advocate the pedophilia rate
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.680]  of toddler children.
[50:52.680 --> 50:54.280]  So let's put up that tweet again.
[50:54.280 --> 50:58.120]  Let's just take a look at that to give you some idea of the debasement.
[50:58.120 --> 51:03.400]  Are your daughters, these are children, ugly like you, she asks, or can Trump use them
[51:03.400 --> 51:05.040]  at the Epstein parties?
[51:05.040 --> 51:10.560]  Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, friend of Bill and Hillary's major donor to the
[51:10.560 --> 51:12.120]  Clinton Foundation.
[51:12.120 --> 51:17.880]  So they can survive when you're broke bitter, I assume she means alone, and in prison for
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.360]  treason.
[51:19.360 --> 51:26.680]  I understand that the editors at USA Today did not look kindly upon this slur.
[51:26.680 --> 51:27.680]  What happened then?
[51:27.680 --> 51:34.440]  Well, according to USA Today, I notified them via Twitter, asked them if it was normal for
[51:34.440 --> 51:42.640]  their columnists to advocate the rate of toddler girls, and then according to their account,
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.520]  within an hour they called her up and fired her ugly ass.
[51:47.520 --> 51:52.080]  And of course, we also know that she was a columnist over at the Hill.
[51:52.080 --> 51:54.760]  She no longer writes there anymore either.
[51:54.760 --> 51:59.360]  Sherry Jacobus' platform is just now Twitter, and that's it.
[51:59.360 --> 52:00.680]  And you know what, Roger?
[52:00.680 --> 52:02.080]  I can't understand it.
[52:02.080 --> 52:07.320]  But Twitter doesn't have a problem with her advocating the rate of toddler girls.
[52:07.320 --> 52:13.120]  I've notified Twitter, they wrote back and said, this doesn't violate our terms of service.
[52:13.120 --> 52:14.120]  So she's saying-
[52:14.120 --> 52:15.120]  How amusing.
[52:15.120 --> 52:16.120]  On Twitter.
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.240]  How amusing.
[52:17.240 --> 52:23.680]  I'm banned for life at Twitter because I hurt Jake Tapper's feelings, but Sherry Jacobus
[52:23.680 --> 52:30.120]  can advocate the abuse of children by a pedophile, and that's perfectly all right.
[52:30.120 --> 52:34.120]  I think it lets people know exactly what's going on at Twitter.
[52:34.120 --> 52:39.280]  It is part of this war of censorship that we're facing here at InfoWars every single
[52:39.280 --> 52:40.280]  day.
[52:40.280 --> 52:43.280]  You are held to a different standard.
[52:43.280 --> 52:44.280]  They would like to take-
[52:44.280 --> 52:50.040]  Well, I think, you know, Roger, Sherry did this with my girls advocating their rate.
[52:50.040 --> 52:56.600]  About four or five times in different tweets actually alleged that I was raping them, and
[52:56.600 --> 52:59.440]  those tweets are still up.
[52:59.440 --> 53:04.360]  She's not deleted them because she's mentally ill, and Twitter doesn't seem to have a problem
[53:04.360 --> 53:05.520]  with them.
[53:05.520 --> 53:11.760]  So I'm kind of palms up about it, Roger, you know, I don't understand it at all.
[53:11.760 --> 53:17.040]  So I know, Michael, that you have very successfully been raising money from the president's supporters
[53:17.040 --> 53:22.680]  for a legal defense fund, and that you've been helping other supporters of the president,
[53:22.680 --> 53:29.600]  who have been subject to the Mueller witch hunt, the phishing expedition that he is conducting.
[53:29.600 --> 53:36.520]  What's your analysis of the subpoena to Kristen Davis and the subpoena to Andrew Miller, who
[53:36.520 --> 53:38.000]  you certainly know?
[53:38.000 --> 53:45.480]  Well, Roger, I always thought from the very beginning that they asked me in for an interview
[53:45.480 --> 53:49.320]  with Mueller, and of course, the Senate and the House did as well, because I'm an old
[53:49.320 --> 53:50.320]  friend of yours.
[53:50.320 --> 53:54.080]  And I think that, you know, I was the first one of your friends to be called in.
[53:54.080 --> 53:59.160]  Now there have been several, including Andrew and Kristen.
[53:59.160 --> 54:03.240]  This is not an investigation of a crime, Roger.
[54:03.240 --> 54:07.320]  This is an investigation of Donald Trump to try to find a crime.
[54:07.320 --> 54:10.600]  And they're going to the people who are closest to him like you, Roger.
[54:10.600 --> 54:17.080]  You've been advising him on politics for three decades and more, and they're basically phishing
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.800]  around you, trying to grab everybody that you've ever intersected with, to try to get
[54:21.800 --> 54:27.320]  somebody to identify some kind of crime or help them create one out of whole cloth that
[54:27.320 --> 54:28.320]  doesn't exist.
[54:28.320 --> 54:29.320]  That's what this is about.
[54:29.320 --> 54:34.960]  I mean, Andrew Miller, as you know, Roger, he's a house painter in St. Louis.
[54:34.960 --> 54:41.200]  You know, Kristen Davis is a cosmetologist in the New York City area.
[54:41.200 --> 54:44.760]  Neither of these people had any access to Donald Trump.
[54:44.760 --> 54:47.880]  Neither of them really were even interested in Donald Trump.
[54:47.880 --> 54:52.440]  The only reason they're being interviewed is because the Mueller team is trying to get
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.960]  you right dead center in the jackpot, Roger.
[54:54.960 --> 54:56.360]  You know that.
[54:56.360 --> 55:00.920]  And they're weaponizing the powers of the Department of Justice to do that.
[55:00.920 --> 55:02.520]  Here's their problem.
[55:02.520 --> 55:08.000]  They just cannot accept the fact that I was able to deduce what WikiLeaks was going to
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.280]  do by a careful reading of the WikiLeaks Twitter feed and by carefully reading every
[55:14.280 --> 55:17.640]  public interview that Julian Assange gave.
[55:17.640 --> 55:19.520]  Stone must have known in advance.
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.440]  He must have been collaborating with WikiLeaks and the Russians.
[55:23.440 --> 55:26.600]  The problem is we can't find any evidence of it.
[55:26.600 --> 55:28.880]  That's because there isn't any.
[55:28.880 --> 55:31.040]  Yes, it was deduction.
[55:31.040 --> 55:33.120]  Yes, it was accurate.
[55:33.120 --> 55:38.360]  Yes, the WikiLeaks disclosure about Hillary Clinton were devastating.
[55:38.360 --> 55:45.440]  They show what a venal, greedy, corrupt witch she is and what a fraud her presidential campaign
[55:45.440 --> 55:46.440]  was.
[55:46.440 --> 55:52.280]  They show her up to her knees in dirty tricks herself, helping orchestrate the anti-Trump
[55:52.280 --> 55:54.960]  demonstrations at his rallies.
[55:54.960 --> 56:00.640]  What better way to distract from the criminality and the conduct of the Clintons than to raise
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.680]  a question about where WikiLeaks got the documents.
[56:04.680 --> 56:08.520]  Sorry, leftists, I know you find this hard to believe.
[56:08.520 --> 56:14.600]  There is no evidence that I knew in advance about the source, content, or the exact disclosure
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.160]  timing of the WikiLeaks' disclosures regarding the DNC.
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.780]  I don't know where they got the material, I never received it from them, I never passed
[56:23.780 --> 56:30.880]  anything on to Donald Trump or the Trump campaign or Julian Assange or WikiLeaks.
[56:30.880 --> 56:38.560]  This is a left-wing conspiracy theory that Mr. Mueller is chasing down every blind alley
[56:38.560 --> 56:40.120]  he can find.
[56:40.120 --> 56:44.520]  They will find no evidence that this happened because it didn't.
[56:44.520 --> 56:48.800]  Michael Caputo, thanks for joining us here at the Alex Jones Show.
[56:48.800 --> 56:52.200]  We give our regards to your family and your daughters.
[56:52.200 --> 56:57.640]  I'm sorry they had to put up with this kind of vile abuse, but I know that you are standing
[56:57.640 --> 56:59.480]  tall for the president.
[56:59.480 --> 57:04.800]  Thanks, Roger, thanks a lot for having me on, and by the way, don't jaywalk because
[57:04.800 --> 57:08.360]  that will end up in the Mueller investigation.
[57:08.360 --> 57:09.360]  Thank you, Michael.
[57:09.360 --> 57:16.960]  We'll be right back because one of the leading memes of last week is that Donald Trump doesn't
[57:16.960 --> 57:20.020]  trust his own intelligence agencies.
[57:20.020 --> 57:24.040]  He trusts Vladimir Putin over the word of his own intelligence agencies.
[57:24.040 --> 57:29.280]  We're going to take a look at those intelligence agencies and take a look at their record regarding
[57:29.280 --> 57:55.760]  veracity, and maybe you will see why the president is right not to believe them.
[57:55.760 --> 58:14.440]  This
[58:14.440 --> 58:19.440]  Like earth iodine crystals, this essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid
[58:19.440 --> 58:23.800]  hormones which influence every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[58:23.800 --> 58:29.280]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and
[58:29.280 --> 58:31.520]  overall brain fog.
[58:31.520 --> 58:37.400]  Survival Shield X2 and Biotrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[58:55.040 --> 58:57.200]  supplements don't work fast enough.
[58:57.200 --> 59:02.000]  That's why InfowarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue Line, Super

[59:47.600 --> 01:00:15.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.280]  At the beginning of the program, Alex Jones laid out for you the fact that Hillary Clinton
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.960]  in her own book revealed that she herself had gotten warm and fuzzy with Vladimir Putin
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.560]  in a secret meeting in which he took her to a special room.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.880]  They bonded over stories about their families.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.520]  She asked them about the famous Russian Tigers.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:48.160]  Now, she does an about face and accuses Donald Trump of being in the pocket of Putin.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.680]  Hillary Clinton?
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.680]  Hypocrisy?
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]  Seriously?
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.080]  Perhaps you haven't read the Clinton's War on Women.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:04.000]  This woman is an evil, greedy, foul mouth, short tempered, corrupt witch.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.120]  And why she has not been prosecuted?
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:14.640]  Well, Donald Trump and his family are persecuted is an extraordinary example of the bias of
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.560]  the mainstream media and the fact that the Trump Justice Department is still in the hands
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.200]  of Obama-Clinton operatives.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:31.920]  We also have extraordinary news in that the Intercept reports that the Ecuadorian government
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:38.080]  is about to pull the rug out from under valiant journalist Julian Assange.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:45.360]  The clamor on the American left to extradite and prosecute Assange is extraordinary.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:51.980]  At the same time, they're praising the Washington Post in a new movie for publishing classified
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:59.920]  information regarding the Vietnam War when Julian Assange publishes classified information.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.320]  They want him prosecuted.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.720]  Even the Obama Justice Department determined that if Assange was prosecuted, you would
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.400]  have to prosecute the Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:18.280]  numerous other mainstream media outlets that have obtained classified information from
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.940]  whistleblowers and published it.
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.440]  That is what journalists do.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.320]  That is the epitome of a free press.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:34.120]  This can boomerang badly on the mainstream media and the intelligence agencies because
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.960]  Assange himself, of course, knows where he got the DNC material.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.400]  He has offered publicly on numerous occasions to prove that he didn't get it from the Russians.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:53.320]  Amazingly, of course, the Justice Department and our CIA and FBI have never taken him up
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.920]  on his offer.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:00.440]  Does anyone think that if he is extradited to the United States and put on trial, he
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:06.360]  will not reveal for the world to see that the Russians probably didn't really hack
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.240]  the DNC at all?
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.960]  One person knows where he got the information, and that would be Julian Assange.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.680]  Many months ago, I wrote a piece for Info Wars in which I advocated a pardon for Julian
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.680]  Assange.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.800]  I feel stronger about that now than I did then.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.240]  This crusading journalist has never, in the 11 years that he has been publishing, ever
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:36.200]  been accused of publishing information that was not correct, authentic, and accurate.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.000]  Can the Washington Post or the New York Times say that?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.640]  We're going to put up a petition at Info Wars of Americans urging the president to pardon
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.160]  this heroic journalist.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.200]  The idea that he will be extradited to the United States is an abomination.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:02.400]  He is a journalist, perhaps one of the most influential journalists in the country today.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.720]  And he is living in squalor.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.520]  He is in bad health.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:13.480]  He is in a virtual captive in a tiny closet that they call the Ecuadorian Embassy.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.800]  This must come to an end.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:23.800]  It is time for Julian Assange to be released, and I urge the president to consider a pardon.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.480]  When we come back, I'm going to review some of the extraordinary specials we have going
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.720]  on at the InfoWars.com store.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:38.240]  Some of our very best products are available now at a very, very deep discount.

[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:58.600]  This to be it, here is your last.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:04.480]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWars

[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.320]  and flax fiber.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.440]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:30.080]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.000]  InfoWars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic, and
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.440]  clinically studied ingredients.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:42.400]  Good prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:49.280]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.960]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:38.480]  So one of the great and incredible claims of last week is that Donald Trump should trust
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.320]  his own intelligence agencies.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.080]  Let's take a look at that for a moment.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.520]  First of all, there's General James Clapper.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:53.000]  He lied under oath to the U.S. Senate about whether the United States had a metadata collection
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.520]  program on American citizens in violation of the Constitution.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:04.320]  The releases by Edward Snowden and the Intercept proved that Clapper was lying.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.200]  Then there's Andrew McCabe.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:12.200]  He lied about being the leaks about the dossier to the media.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.960]  Then of course, there's James Comey.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.200]  The former FBI director.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:24.640]  He lied about the broad mosaic of evidence that justified the surveillance warrant on
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.120]  Carter Page, among other things.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.440]  And then of course, there is Robert Mueller.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:38.440]  He lied about the cover-up of the fact that five of nine hijackers were reportedly training
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:47.240]  at a Sarasota-based flight school and covered up the ties between the family that was harboring
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.960]  the hijackers and the 9-11 plot.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:56.600]  And then of course, there's the biggest liar of them all, John Brennan.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:04.000]  Joining us on the war room tomorrow, John Guandolo, an FBI counterintelligence expert,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.320]  joins us on the question of John Brennan and whether or not he converted to radical Islam,
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:18.200]  as I reported in several of my books, and whether John Brennan is indeed the centerpiece,
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:25.200]  the mastermind of the bogus dossier, and whether he's lied to the Congress about it.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:32.360]  We know that John Brennan lied about spying on a U.S. Senate committee that was fulfilling
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:38.800]  its oversight role in investigating the CIA's illegal use of torture.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.120]  John Brennan is a psychopath who continues to threaten the president of the United States
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120]  on Twitter.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.240]  Where do you see what Mueller has, Brennan tells us.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.240]  Wait a minute.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.800]  John Brennan is a private citizen.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.120]  How would he know what Mr. Mueller does and does not have?
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.240]  This is the same John Brennan who supported the Communist Party candidate for president
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:10.720]  in 1976, the same John Brennan who admitted in a lie detector test that he was a member
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:19.180]  of the Communist Party, but who was nonetheless confirmed to be Barack Obama's CIA director.
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:25.440]  We also know that Brennan, when stationed in Rida as the CIA's station chief, converted
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.480]  to radical Islam.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.880]  John Guandolo of the FBI joins us tomorrow to flesh this out at the war room at five
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.600]  o'clock Eastern.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:43.200]  Join Owen Schroyer and I as we prosecute the case against one of the most dangerous deep
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.720]  state liars of them all, John Brennan.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:55.080]  So should the president, based on the records of Clapper, McCabe, Comey, Mueller, and Brennan
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.880]  trust our intelligence services?
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:04.600]  The last president who trusted them was John F. Kennedy, and we know how that worked out.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.040]  Now we're going to go to the phones.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:13.440]  I am, well, I'm a little at a loss.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.480]  I think Jesse of Pennsylvania is on the line.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.560]  Let's go to that call.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.800]  Roger, how's it going, man?
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800]  Love the show.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.800]  Love the product.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.800]  Thank you.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.520]  Thank you to all the bodies, but I wanted to ask you how fast and how soon this whole
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.920]  rush of things in the book and Hillary, can we get that to Trump right at his fingertips
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.720]  and get that out to the tweet?
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:43.360]  And also how quick do you think, if any, justice in the future for all of it?
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:49.920]  Well, Jesse, this is one of the confounding questions as to why the president has not
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.680]  moved to terminate Rod Rosenstein, the man who admitted in the New York Times that he
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:02.720]  was furious when Trump exposed the fact that he had written the memo explaining why and
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:09.200]  how Comey should be fired as FBI director and who appointed Robert Mueller as the special
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.840]  counsel, despite the fact that Mueller had interviewed with President Trump for the job
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:22.600]  of FBI director as well as the job of Attorney General, thus he had a conflict and a motive
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.000]  to oppose the president based on being passed over for those two jobs.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.040]  Mr. Rosenstein got his first job in government from Mr. Mueller.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.200]  This whole thing is a fetid mess.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:43.240]  Some around the president have told him that if he fires Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Sessions,
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.280]  Mr. Mueller, that he will be impeached.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:53.040]  On the contrary, if he does not fire them, they intend to charge the president with some
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:01.240]  bogus process crime this October to give the Democrats something to run on.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:08.320]  They can't run on their positive program for the economy or on trade or on immigration
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.880]  or any other issue because they have no programs.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:19.440]  Their entire party platform boils down to, we hate, Donald Trump.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.440]  He should understand soon that the Mueller investigation is a speeding bullet and it
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:31.160]  is headed his way and that Mueller and his deep state allies will continue to press for
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:38.360]  an interview with the president, which experts like Alan Dershowitz and Judge Andrew Napolitano
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.160]  have correctly labeled a perjury trap.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.000]  Thank you very much for your call.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.800]  Let us hope the president will realize soon that these gentlemen need to be terminated
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.480]  and then prosecuted.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.160]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.280]  We've got about three minutes left.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.200]  Paul in Las Vegas, what's on your mind, Paul?
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.800]  How are you doing, Roger?
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.000]  I wanted to thank you personally for the brain force now that I've been taking it.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  I have a patent.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.640]  I've really been working hard to better my life.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]  Your products are great.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.080]  I wanted to thank Alex and everybody for all you guys do around here as well.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.640]  I think with the Mueller situation, what we've got going on is not only a witch hunt, but
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.000]  when you say the leftovers, they're all corrupt and they know that they're going to be going
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  down with the ship.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.360]  I think that's why they're all fighting against people like you and the former guest.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.120]  They're going after people like that because you guys have the goods on them, if you will,
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:41.240]  it's from the timeline situation and the one time when you were talking, you was explaining
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.560]  about the WikiLeaks thing.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.200]  You definitely predicted that.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.880]  I remember, I was listening to the show, the very show where you said the next shoe to
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.080]  drop will be the pedestrian's time in the barrel, whatever.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.160]  You predicted everything because you were doing your homework.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.400]  These people shouldn't be doing anything to you but listening to what you have to say
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.440]  about all the crimes of these people.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.120]  Chronically, Julian Assange himself has said, Roger Stone never said or tweeted anything
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.240]  that we at WikiLeaks hadn't already published or announced ourselves.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.400]  All one had to do was pay attention.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:23.920]  So it is extraordinary that this witch hunt continues, but I must tell you, the cost to
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.440]  me and my family is extraordinary.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:35.040]  You see, if they come up empty-handed on Russian collusion, if they can find no collaboration
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:41.520]  with WikiLeaks, which they won't, they have to bastardize my now iconic tweet regarding
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:51.040]  John Podesta because I said the Podesta's time in the barrel, Podesta's, apostrophe S, possessive,
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.960]  two brothers, John and Tony, whose extensive Russian business dealings had been reported
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.720]  in the Panama Papers in April of 2016.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:07.960]  You see, I didn't predict or foreshadow that Podesta's emails would be published by WikiLeaks.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.640]  I had no idea that that was going to happen.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.320]  I never said anything whatsoever about his emails.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:20.920]  This is more of the Trump derangement syndrome of the mainstream media and the far left who
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:26.080]  just can't accept the fact that Hillary Clinton got walloped by Donald Trump in one of the
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.240]  most improbable, come-from-behind victories in American history.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.640]  Thank you so much for your call.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.860]  On the other side, we're going to go back to the phones.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:46.280]  That number again, if I may, 877-789-2539, I'm on the Alex Jones show.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.360]  I'll be taking your questions.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:57.600]  Give us a call.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.480]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.960]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.000]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.200]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula, the new platinum
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:20.640]  standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.400]  Vitamin mineral fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your

[01:16:51.080 --> 01:17:01.440]  mineral fusion today, available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.560]  Years ago, Infowars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.560]  yeast.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.120]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:15.000]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.200]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.400]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400]  product to help your body fight back.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.120]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.800]  tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.880]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.480]  bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.480]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.280]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:58.120]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:03.520]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.880]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.440]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.760]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  symptoms.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.640]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.320]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:50.120]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.800]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:58.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.120]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.320]  Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.320]  every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  one system.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.880]  The Pro Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.560]  filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.360]  220 plus contaminants from your water.

[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.960]  toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.

[01:19:54.680 --> 01:20:01.040]  Pure Whole House filtration system today.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:09.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:23.680]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.800]  This is Roger Stone.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.280]  Welcome back to the War Room.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.680]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:40.000]  Tomorrow, Owen Schroyer and I will bring you a special report on U.S. Senator Elizabeth
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.200]  Warren and her efforts to cozy up to Indian gaming interests in an effort to bolster her
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.160]  phony claim of being a Native American.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:59.760]  That full expose tomorrow on the War Room, not to mention the violent attack today by
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:06.280]  Warren supporters against one of Elizabeth Warren's leading Republican opponents.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.000]  We'll break it all down for you tomorrow on the War Room.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.320]  That's four o'clock Central, five o'clock Eastern.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:20.800]  We are going to go back to the phones, but my lawyers and my wife would be very upset
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.640]  if I didn't mention to you that the witch hunt that I have been subjected to, the lawsuits
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:34.400]  by an Obama-blessed group based in Washington, the lawsuit against me by the Democratic National
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:42.320]  Committee, sore loser lawsuits, the investigation of the House Intelligence Committee, the investigation
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:50.080]  of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the investigation of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the investigation
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:57.440]  of Special Counsel Robert Mueller are costing me hundreds of thousands of dollars and literally
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.760]  threaten to destroy my family and bankrupt me.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:07.920]  You'll find stories online that say Roger Stone is worth $20 million.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.280]  That is false.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:15.120]  Those are probably put online by David Brock and the folks at Media Matters to discourage
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.240]  you from giving me the vital help I need.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:27.040]  Please take a moment and go to StoneDefenseFund.com and help me fight this deep state takedown effort,
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:34.080]  this effort to smear me, accusing me falsely of Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration,
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:39.240]  or some nonsense regarding the criminal John Podesta's emails.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:45.680]  This is nothing less than an effort to punish me for the simple crime of supporting Donald
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.720]  Trump for president.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.800]  I need your help.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.880]  I do not exaggerate the cost.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.800]  Before I am finished fighting the deep state attempts to destroy me, I will be millions
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.720]  of dollars in debt.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:07.480]  Please take a moment to go to StoneDefenseFund.com and while you're at it, don't forget that
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:13.640]  Alex Jones and the folks at InfoWars are fighting essentially the same war.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:21.000]  That's right, bogus lawsuits, harassment lawsuits with no basis in fact or reality, but designed
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.760]  to generate the most vicious negative headlines possible and then be used as an underlying
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:37.400]  rationale to censor InfoWars off of YouTube, off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of television,
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400]  off of radio.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.480]  You see, the left cannot win a battle of ideas.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.640]  The left cannot win a debate regarding the issues.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:52.480]  And now their answer is the heavy-handed play of censorship.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:58.000]  Alex Jones is going to have to spend millions of dollars in the courts fighting these efforts
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.400]  to shut InfoWars down.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.080]  Do Alex Jones and I exaggerate the dangers?
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.560]  Not in the slightest.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.640]  The Mueller investigation has the deep pockets of the taxpayers.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:17.280]  He's just brought on a whole new platoon of left-wing Democrat prosecutors spending
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:24.120]  millions more and still hasn't produced an iota of evidence of Russian collusion with
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.720]  the Trump campaign.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:33.320]  At best, he has exposed some ham-handed Russian meddling that appears to have had no effect
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.400]  in our election.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.960]  So please take a moment to go to the InfoWars.com site.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.720]  When you get there, there's a special place to go where you can make a contribution.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:49.920]  If you're not in the market for one of our terrific nutraceuticals, now at bargain-basement
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.880]  prices, if you're not going there to buy my book, Stone's Rules, or my other book, The
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:04.880]  Making of the President 2016, well, you can give a generous contribution of $25, $50, $100,
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.880]  $500.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.680]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have given as much as $1,000.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.960]  Why?
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.160]  Because they know we are the tip of the spear.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.200]  Because they know we are the resistance.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:25.480]  Because they know that Alex Jones is controlled by no multinational corporate advertiser.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.360]  We answer only to you.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.760]  InfoWars is completely listener and viewer-financed.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:41.280]  We don't have a right-wing George Soros writing huge checks to underwrite the activities of
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.760]  our investigative journalism.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:48.880]  And therefore, we need you to look at these terrific specials, whether it is knockout,
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:56.640]  silver bullet, super male vitality, so many of these products at 50% off.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.400]  How does Alex Jones do this?
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.520]  I often think these products are loss leaders.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.920]  Here's the secret.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:09.760]  He knows that if you try these products, there's an overwhelming possibility, likelihood, that
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:17.280]  you will be satisfied, and then you will go to reorder through our auto-ship program.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.560]  That keeps the war for freedom and the First Amendment well-funded.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.840]  That's how he can afford these deep discounts.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.640]  Please go to the InfoWars store now and grab your copy of Stone's Rules.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:38.080]  When I come back, I'll tell you how you can get your copy of my newest book, A Road Manual
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:45.360]  for Victory, personally autographed and mailed back to you, an offer that I have set up for
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.520]  InfoWarriors only.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:55.680]  If you purchase the book now at InfoWars and you mail it to me with your receipt demonstrating
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:02.120]  that that's where you bought it, I will sign it and return it to you at my own expense.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:09.040]  Again, though, this is only for people who buy the book at the InfoWars.com store.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:15.200]  You can help me, you can help the Stone family, you can help InfoWars, and you can read my
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:23.600]  personal analysis of maxims and guidelines and rules that I have learned in a successful
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.360]  career of 40 years in the public arena.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.680]  I'm very proud of this book.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:35.800]  It's kind of like Machiavelli's The Prince or Sun Tzu's The Art of War.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:44.760]  Yet, you'll find handy information that goes well beyond politics about food, fashion, automobiles,
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:51.280]  and a myriad of subjects that cover the many things I have learned in 40 years working
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.160]  for three American presidents.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.660]  I'm Roger Stone.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.520]  You're at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.880]  We're going to come back and take more of your calls.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.440]  That number, 877-789-2539.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.360]  We haven't gotten in as many calls as I had hoped, so we're going to try to get you back
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.080]  into the queue.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:18.240]  Please call in now with your call for me on any topic at all, and I will be pleased to
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:25.840]  let you know the inside story on Washington and the deep state takedown attempt against
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:26.840]  our president.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.320]  I'm Roger Stone.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:58.160]  I'll be right back.

[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.520]  This is Bernie Sanders and there's a lot of corruption in this country. And if you want
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:30.520]  to hear about corruption, then you'll listen to Roger Stone on Infowars. Does he tell the
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.520]  truth?
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:37.200]  All right, a great track there by the Rolling Stones, a story I saw on Carol written by
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:45.440]  the great Chuck Berry and of course kind words of my friend, Senator Bernie Sanders. Clearly
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.640]  that was an impressionist. I think you probably figured that out.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:55.240]  So we're going to go back to the phones because I know a lot of Info Warriors have questions.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:02.000]  The news coming out of Washington, the assault on the president because he has put peace
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:10.560]  ahead of politics has left a lot of Info Warriors heads spinning because the viciousness of
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:16.880]  the mainstream media and the hypocrisy of those who refuse to acknowledge that from
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:23.760]  a policy point of view, Donald Trump's administration has been much tougher on the Russians than
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:31.440]  Barack Obama ever was. The sanctions sting. That's why Putin would like to have them removed.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:39.840]  The idea that the president somehow capitulated to Putin is nonsense that is meant to continue
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:47.840]  to foster their phony Russian collusion narrative. Let's go to the phones. Chris, in Virginia,
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.720]  you're on the line with the Alex Jones show. What's on your mind?
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.520]  Hey, Roger, what's going on? When I see you on today and I see your name in the news this
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:05.480]  past week, you have me thinking, why is the state targeting Roger Stone again? Because
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.160]  you were supposed to be dead when they tried to attack. It was going to make that booster
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:15.600]  for 2.0 things sick. But by the grace of God, you know, you're still with us. But I
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.720]  think so. That made somebody in the state very angry. So that's why they hit you with
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:25.280]  all these bogus lawsuits and stuff. But it has to be more than just because you support
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:31.040]  the president. What else do you think that you could have done or?
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:38.320]  Well, I think this is payback for the fact that I wrote the definitive opposition dump
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:45.480]  on Bill and Hillary Clinton, the Clinton's war on women. I outlined in great detail the
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:53.080]  fact that Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted or raped multiple women and that Hillary Clinton
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:59.440]  was the cleanup officer, that it was Hillary Clinton who ran the nasty lawyers and the
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:05.800]  heavy handed private detectives in an effort to silence those women. I also worked with
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:15.800]  others, including the Joe Gilbert, the brilliant Hollywood documentary producer, to introduce
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:23.560]  America to Danny Williams. Danny Williams is indeed the son of Bill Clinton, banished
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:31.960]  from Bill Clinton's life by Hillary Clinton. 38 million Americans saw the Danny Williams
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:39.800]  story banished is the name of the documentary, which debuted right here at Info Wars. So
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:48.440]  yes, I am a target of the deep state. This is payback for the fact that I not only supported
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:54.960]  Donald Trump, but I stripped away the fraudulent narrative that Hillary Clinton was an advocate
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:02.160]  for women when in fact she was a terrorizer of women and many African Americans learned
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:09.360]  about Hillary Clinton's abuse of Danny Williams. Danny Williams is a fine young man. He works
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:16.400]  two jobs to support his five children, a job by day and a job at night. I think he works
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:26.520]  in a meat packing plant by day and a 7-Eleven at night. His father is worth $300 million.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:33.360]  I have exposed the truth about Danny Williams and that is one of the many reasons why Bill
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:40.360]  and Hillary have insisted that their longtime hitman Robert Mueller take me down. But he
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:47.920]  has no evidence of Russian collusion, no evidence of WikiLeaks collaboration and therefore the
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:54.200]  question is an obvious one. Will they manufacture some other offense, something that has nothing
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:02.120]  to do with the 2016 election, either to silence me and get me off of Info Wars where I join
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:10.000]  Alex Jones as the leading critic of the Mueller investigation, better known as a witch hunt,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.920]  a fishing expedition, or is it because they want to pressure me to testify against the
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:24.280]  president? I've known Donald Trump for 39 years. If they think that they can squeeze
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:31.000]  me to testify against him and to bear false witness against him on the issue of Russian
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:38.800]  collusion, they will be sadly disappointed. But to fight them, I need all of you and all
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:45.480]  of my supporters and friends to go to StoneDefenseFund.com, as I said earlier. Thank you so much
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:50.160]  for your call. I think that explains why I have been targeted.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:58.680]  Let's go back to the phones. Pastor Sam in New Mexico, or pardon me, in Mexico joins
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:04.600]  us now at the Info Wars hotline, right here at the Alex Jones show. Pastor Sam?
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:12.440]  I'd like to thank you for bringing me from brass sailor buttons, Stone's Rule number
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:20.040]  23, the blazer is the foundation of the gentleman's wardrobe. I've gone to strictly for ferio
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.240]  Rubio Roster style buttons on your recommendation and made it part of my personal style. And
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:28.800]  I'm very liberated. You've helped me a great deal.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.240]  Well, for those who don't know, pro ferio Rubirosa was one of the great playboys of
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:43.200]  the 1940s and 50s. And he was known as one of the best dressed men in the world. A well
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:50.840]  cut, well made navy blue blazer in single or double breasted in three button or two
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:58.840]  is a fundamental for any young gentleman's wardrobe, a very key element of Stone's rules.
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.840]  So Pastor Sam, what's on your mind? I wanted to ask you what your thoughts
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.280]  are on the fact that Donald Trump has finally put the Federal Reserve in the crosshairs.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:16.800]  It appears that he started with an offhanded comment as far as not being thrilled about
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.520]  the raising of interest rates. But now it comes out and CNBC today published on Inco
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:30.760]  Wars that he's making major steps to appoint a number of directors to the Federal Reserve
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.920]  that could change the whole monetary policy of that entity.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:43.000]  Yeah, you know, I was very pleased as someone who is a long time admirer of Ron Paul, the
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.320]  last vote I cast as a Republican before I switched briefly to the Libertarian Party
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:56.760]  was for Ron Paul in the Florida Republican presidential primary. Then when Donald Trump
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:05.000]  staged his hostile takeover of the GOP, I switched back to the party of my ancestors.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:12.880]  But as an admirer of Ron Paul and an admirer of Rand Paul and an aficionado of their very
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:20.040]  apt criticism of the Federal Reserve, I was very pleased by the president's comments.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:28.040]  He clearly understands the manipulation of the economy. We're cruising along at 4% economic
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:35.400]  growth. Almost 3.4 million jobs have been created since Donald Trump became president.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:42.440]  Donald Trump is a businessman who understands the Fed intimately and has had the courage,
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:48.080]  unlike other presidents, to criticize them when they try to manipulate our money. Great
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:53.880]  question, Pastor Sam. Thanks for calling in. We've got about a minute to go. That's just
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:00.120]  enough time to remind you that we have some incredible specials going on at the Infowars.com
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:09.600]  store. Some of our very best products, Supermail Vitality, Survival Shield X2, The Real Pill,

[01:42:47.120 --> 01:43:04.920]  Anyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified. We have global
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:09.680]  hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations. They're trying to
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.400]  wreck free market and consolidate total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.600]  machines. And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future. They
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.880]  are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders. And my
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:30.400]  only message is this, everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now. Everybody
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.560]  should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:40.000]  their anti-human plan because they crave to control people. Those of us that are pro-human
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.200]  don't crave power, we already have the power, but we have to realize these scum are coming
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.400]  after us and we have to speak out and take action now. Infowars is on the front line
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:44:16.400]  and so are you. We are the resistance.

[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:03.320]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.520]  We have found an extraordinary, new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:15.320]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:21.200]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.600]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.960]  trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:38.200]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.760]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:48.040]  blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:54.400]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:57.680]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.640]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:08.180]  and joint support. Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies. Bodies contains one
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:13.160]  of the most potent forms of turmeric available. Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:17.680]  and is one of the most studied herbals today. It is well-known in traditional medicine for
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:22.000]  its soothing properties. Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.480]  black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility,
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:32.000]  mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more. Regular turmeric root from the
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.320]  store only contains one to five percent of actin ingredients. But our turmeric root extract
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.640]  contains over ninety-five percent of the actin ingredients. Bodies combines turmeric with
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:48.480]  organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:47:13.040]  full body support. Try Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:20.040]  Hi, fellow Americans. Let me make this perfectly clear. You're listening to Roger Stone on
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:26.040]  Infowars. Do you worry that, is it time for the Fed
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:30.320]  to be doing what it's doing? Just to get a policy question, should they be raising rates
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.040]  on the trajectory that is indicated right now? I put a very good man in the Fed. I don't
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:40.360]  necessarily agree with it because he's raising interest rates. I'm not saying that I agree
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.720]  with it and I don't necessarily agree with it. I must tell you, I don't. I'm not thrilled
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.400]  because we go up and every time you go up, they want to raise rates again. I am not happy
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:57.800]  about it, but at the same time, I'm letting them do what they feel is best.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:04.640]  That's the bite I was looking for. Donald Trump, businessman, Donald Trump, entrepreneur,
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:12.000]  Donald Trump, job creator, understands the vital role that interest rates play in the
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:19.080]  resurgence of the American economy. They told us under Barack Obama that 4% economic growth
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:26.200]  was structurally impossible, and the average economic growth, that is, the GDP, under Barack
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:32.320]  Obama was about a point and a half. Let me point out that the President's corporate
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:39.000]  and personal tax cuts have still not had sufficient time to get the complete traction
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.160]  that I think they will ultimately gain to turbocharge this economy, and that is why the
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:54.560]  left is so hysterical. Because as the economy grows, the President's political support in
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:02.920]  the country grows and is galvanized, making their efforts to void the 2016 election on
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:10.080]  the basis of some fraudulent claim of Russian collusion harder and harder to pull off.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.600]  So, let's go back to the phones now. That number, for those of you who still want to
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:25.600]  get a call in, 877-789-2539. That's the Info Wars Hotline, direct to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.920]  I'm your host, Roger Stone, and we're going to go to Scott in Missouri. Scott, what's
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.920]  on your mind?
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.920]  Hello.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.920]  Scott, go ahead.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:42.320]  Yes, sir. Thank you, Roger. I was curious because I was thinking about the Nexium scandal
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:47.520]  from the Broke few months ago. I know your name was mentioned in various circles. I had
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:53.120]  a quick observation and question about it because it does appear that there's one problem
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:57.800]  with the Nexium narrative, but it does appear to coincide with something that was documented
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:03.800]  on Info Wars in the spring of 2008, and that is the Blackmail Honeypot against then-New
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:09.880]  York Governor Elliot Spitzer, which is this article written by former Info Wars, of course,
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.360]  while I, Wayne Madsen, mentioned your name as perhaps being involved with. I wondered
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.480]  what is your defense for that? You say that you were simply the whistleblower of Nexium,
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:25.480]  but this would coincide around a Honeypot operation that your name has been said to
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.680]  be implicated with.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:31.600]  I'm delighted that you asked this question. I think these are very separate scandals.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.680]  As I think Frank Parlotto, the crusading journalist and art voice in Buffalo, who is
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:45.280]  more responsible than anyone breathing for exposing the Nexium scandal, has reported,
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:53.480]  I never saw any evidence that this was any kind of sex call, but nonetheless, I terminated
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:51:01.400]  my relations with them and became a source for Parlotto. In the question of Elliot Spitzer,
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:10.120]  does Mr. Madsen claim that Governor Spitzer was not patronizing prostitutes, was not using
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:18.480]  multiple call girl rings at the same time that he was prosecuting others for patronizing
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.480]  prostitutes?
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:24.960]  His issue, since I'm a libertarian, I think prostitution by adults, of course, should
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:34.040]  be legal. I think his crime was hypocrisy. But the idea that I participated in any kind
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:41.440]  of sex cult with Nexium, no, I saw the thing as a financial fraud. And therefore, after
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:48.280]  working for them for about two months and learning that they didn't understand how our
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:55.280]  system of government worked, and seeing all these rich little girls signing over their
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:03.560]  trust funds to Keith Ranieri and his hench people, I blew the whistle on Nexium. Thank
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:06.520]  you so much for your call.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:15.160]  Let's go back to the phones. We have about five minutes left. Let's see, how about Carlos
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:18.440]  in Canada? Carlos, are you still with us?
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:26.560]  Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Stone. I just wanted to draw attention to the Benghazi attack
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:35.080]  that has been covered up quite effectively, but in fact is principle and should be key
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:43.760]  in any attempts by Hillary Clinton to be a candidate for president. The evidence since
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:50.520]  the Benghazi attack now has shown an indisputable case at the CIA for the time shipping arms
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:59.760]  and missiles from the US control facilities from Libya towards Syria. And the cover up
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:07.560]  of this, the transaction can go well. But as it turns out, four Americans died under
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:16.480]  the Secretariat of State, Hillary Clinton efforts. In particular, Ambassador Christopher
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:24.400]  Stevens, who had been doing much of the dirty work, doing, pushing the drug business, pushing
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:32.560]  the guns, and pushing even children, and I repeat children, in this sorted affair, was
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:41.960]  actually betrayed and left to die, killed by a group that was run by the Secretary of
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:48.840]  State Administration as a cover up because things were going not well. This is something
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.640]  that I believe has been covered up terribly. And the individuals who are now attacking
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.520]  the president should be aware of the fact that Americans need to know the truth of what
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:06.880]  really happened in Benghazi. She alone set up Ambassador Stevens by denying protection
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:13.720]  and she transmitted by email from her private server by herself, the location where the
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:22.280]  ambassador was, and the evidence of his travel plans. There were a thousand emails between
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:28.680]  Hillary Clinton and General Petraeus that were not turned over to the original FBI investigation.
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:33.760]  Americans should know what were in those thousand emails. And as you know, General Petraeus,
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:39.200]  who would have been forced to testify and not take the fifth, was subsequently removed
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:47.400]  as general because he had an affair with someone. So all I have to say is that I think it's
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:54.000]  time for Americans to look into the Benghazi attack and to look for justice to those patriots
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.920]  who died that evening so undeservedly. Well, that was an excellent analysis of exactly
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:07.080]  what happened. The only thing I would have to add is the lie that the uprising at our
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:15.080]  facility in Benghazi was caused by an anti-Islamic video that showed in Turkey was fabricated
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:22.920]  by Sidney Blumenthal, also known as Sid Vicious, the henchman for Hillary Clinton. He thinks
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:30.920]  he's Ted Sorensen. He's actually Al Capone. This is one of the Clinton's key dirty tricksters,
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:37.480]  but we now know that entire narrative is a lie. Yes, you're absolutely right. I thank
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:44.600]  you, Carlos. It is time for justice and truth for those brave Americans who were killed
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:51.560]  in Benghazi. Hillary Clinton has even more blood on her hands, but then that is not
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:58.480]  a surprise to us. I thank you for joining us today on the Alex Jones show. It has been
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:04.120]  my privilege to dive into the host's chair. I hope we were able to explain to you why
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:12.160]  the illegal unconstitutional FISA warrants are the Rosetta Stone, the key thing to understand
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:18.880]  about the Obama effort to hijack the last American election, and why the Russian collusion
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:25.760]  investigation by Robert Mueller and Democrats in the Congress is meant to distract you from
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:33.480]  that scandal, a scandal that makes Watergate look like, well, a second rate burglary. This
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:39.920]  has been the Alex Jones show. One more time, you can get your copy of Stone's Rules, my
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:45.800]  terrific new book, at the Infowars.com store, and while you're there, take advantage of
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:52.880]  some of the extraordinary specials on our most popular products. My personal favorite,
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:57:00.120]  Brain Force Plus, but also Silver Bullet, the finest collidal silver you can find on
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:07.200]  the market today, known for centuries as an antiviral and antibacterial. Or look at our
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:14.040]  First Amendment-oriented T-shirts. We need your support, as never before, to push back
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:21.400]  against the globalists and those who would censor Infowars entirely and remove us from
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:28.720]  our position as the tip of the spear and the leader of the resistance. God bless you, God
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:51.600]  bless America, victory or death. Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:58:09.560]  the air worldwide. Thanks for
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:22.160]  coming.
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:44.120]  I saw up with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.960]  Supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:14.460]  You are the InfoWord.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:18.460]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:21.960]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:25.860]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:30.060]  with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:34.260]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles,
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:37.960]  to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:44.960]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:55.960]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
