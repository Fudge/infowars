[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07.000 --> 00:16.000]  When a person dies and is buried, it seems a certain voodoo priest who will have the power to bring him back to life.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.000]  How horrible.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  It's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own.
[00:20.000 --> 00:28.000]  You see them sometimes walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  You mean like Democrats?
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  And the candidate looked around for a podium from which to give his speech.
[00:35.000 --> 00:45.000]  And the only thing he could find was a pile of that stuff that best Truman took 35 years trying to get Harry to call fertilizer.
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  So he got up on the mound and when they came back, he gave his speech.
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  And at the end of it, the farmer said, that's the first time I ever heard a Republican speech.
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  And the candidate said, that's the first time I've ever given a Republican speech from a Democratic platform.
[01:24.000 --> 01:49.000]  I had a conversation the other day with a friend who's also an advocate in the LGBTQ community in Florida,
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  who rightly took me to task for my tweets mocking and culting using transgender stereotypes.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  I apologize to my friend and I want to apologize to the trans community and to Ann.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  Those tweets were wrong and horrible.
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  I look back today at some of the ways I've talked casually about people and gender identity and sexual orientation, and I wonder who that even was.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  Will the left take out one of its propaganda mouthpieces?
[02:15.000 --> 02:25.000]  MSNBC host Joy Reid is under the microscope after recently fending off a homophobic rant posted to her blog she claims was fabricated.
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  Now Joy Reid has been outed yet again by the PC social media police as having supported the 9-11 documentary, Loose Change,
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  inciting with none other than public enemy number one, Alex Jones.
[02:38.000 --> 02:48.000]  Buzzfeed writes, a March 22, 2006 post to her web blog, Reid blog, archived by the Wayback Machine entitled The Official Story,
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  links to Loose Change 9-11, a viral 80 minute web video originally released in 2005.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  Loose Change, which was produced in part by InfoWars Alex Jones,
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  alleged that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center were in fact planned by the U.S. government.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  The central claims in Loose Change have been widely debunked.
[03:11.000 --> 03:20.000]  Of course, Buzzfeed references popular mechanics, blatant, incutile CIA propaganda, and Vanity Fair, a far left polarizing rag,
[03:20.000 --> 03:29.000]  both of them using the mass media phenomenon known as expectation bias to stop the public from asking relevant questions.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  And of course, there is no mention of the 3,000 plus architects and engineers that have sifted through the eyewitness accounts,
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  countered the NIST and FEMA evidence, and remained banished from the national conversation on 9-11 Truth.
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  Buzzfeed's hubris-riddled, gerbil-esque article continues referencing Reid's 9-11 Truth or Post.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  The fundamental question is, do you believe the official story of 9-11 in the Post, Reid's?
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  If you do, great. If you don't, then everything that happened after that is called into serious question.
[04:01.000 --> 04:09.000]  Even if you're agnostic or you tend to believe that Al Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center in the Pentagon and the government had no warning,
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  such a thing could happen. It's worth taking a second look.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  You gotta ask yourself, where is all this going?
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  When Roseanne's American anomaly of a TV show that spoke to 12 million viewers per episode came to a grinding halt,
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  while Joy Reid can barely muster 1 million viewers, exceeded the left's tolerant muzzle on homophobia,
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  and was given the platform and the time to come up with a shady excuse about it,
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  and continues to keep her job, and has now been outed as one of them.
[04:43.000 --> 04:51.000]  The boundaries of Gestapo's social media PC culture are closing in on our dying process of free speech.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  What happened to the public arena, where ideas were met with either of them?
[04:56.000 --> 05:21.000]  That's right. We'll be back. That's John Bown reporting. Stay with us.

[06:21.000 --> 06:48.000]  It's Friday, June 1, 2018. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  If you're a TV viewer, you'll be able to see this.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  If you're a radio listener, you can pull it up for yourself.
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  Democrats panic as indictments of Comey, Clinton, and McCabe loom.
[07:05.000 --> 07:18.000]  And then we have a special report where I break down my DOJ and White House sources saying Trump, as of the first of the year, had made the decision to take the gloves off.
[07:18.000 --> 07:26.000]  You heard that from Ali Alexander, who's worked at the highest levels of the Republican Party, that he was told the same thing, that Trump actually...
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  Well, I was told not to share the full details of it, but let's just say he blew up.
[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  The Trump you see in public is the real Trump, where he's all focused and zinned out, but then there's the other Trump.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  And let's just say he turns things over and things.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  And he's made the decision. He is coming after them. And boy, does he have the goods.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  So the fight is on. That's why you're seeing all this insanity.
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  There's that headline, March 18. There's another one.
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.000]  March 17 is when I got the news, breaking Trump preparing mass indictments of Clinton crime network.
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  The United States is only weeks away from rebirth, but more battles lie ahead.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  You might want to go read those articles. You might want to go see those. Why?
[08:12.000 --> 08:28.000]  Zero Hedge has a very nice boil down, as they do. And the Washington Post and others in the Wall Street Journal are all reporting about the interrogation of Comey about McCabe.
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  Comey's thrown him under the bus and gone on national television and said, well, you know, it's not good to lie.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  And McCabe has lied.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Well, yeah, he lied to the Justice Department. He lied to Congress. He lied to everybody.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Also leaked criminal information. That is the leaking was criminal.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  And so you see Comey moving away. Comey directed this.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  So the rats have left the sinking ship.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  They're now in pieces of driftwood fighting with each other over the scarce space as the storm blows in and the waves begin to crash.
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.000]  And a little piece of driftwood they're on isn't holding them up anymore and more and more. They're underwater gasping, gasping, gasping for air.
[09:09.000 --> 09:19.000]  Those few seconds when the, when the driftwood pops back up from under the wave, the little rat hands, the rat paws, little rat fingernails dug in, dug into the driftwood.
[09:19.000 --> 09:29.000]  But now the driftwood's pulling apart their little, little claws, little red eyes darting about as they hit all the panic buttons and destroy Alex Jones, destroy Trump, destroy the Americans.
[09:29.000 --> 09:38.000]  Crush them, sue them, lie about them. Help us.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  Let's see. You got fake lawsuits against me and then your top people in Hollywood get indicted for rape. I'll take that tip for tat.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  Because we're going to give a lot more than we get.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  I believe in giving. And now Trump believes in giving, giving you hell.
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  So fill your hand.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  We're going to go over all of this, ladies and gentlemen. The indictments loom.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  No more. Leave us alone. We'll leave you alone.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  Trump already tried that. What did Giuliani say three weeks ago?
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  And then again, two weeks ago, then again a week ago, drop it now, stop it now. It's fake. Get out of the way.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  Stop trying to sabotage. Stop trying to lie about it. Stop trying to side with foreign governments.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  Or we're going to tear you apart.
[10:35.000 --> 10:43.000]  We're going to tear you apart and Trump means it. And that's why all the world from Saudi Arabia to North Korea, they're listening.
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  It was always part of the negotiation that North Korea would try to ask for too much or weasel out of it.
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  Trump would say the summit's off and then four days later the summit's back on because North Korea rolled back over.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  And they might try that game again. But there's a new sheriff in town and things are different.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  And we're getting 30 years of suppressed technology fast-tracked in medicine. And it's not going to be just there.
[11:06.000 --> 11:16.000]  I have been told by high-level sources before Trump even got in that he has been briefed by the generals on the suppressed technologies in close to free energy,
[11:16.000 --> 11:25.000]  beyond quantum computing, stuff that makes maglev trains look like tinker toys.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  Incredible sciences in plants, in farming.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  But the biggest area is energy.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  Advanced spacecraft. I mean, Trump is really looking at starting to turn this loose.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  The globalists don't like that.
[11:49.000 --> 11:57.000]  The globalists are like, oh, the Chinese have lasers that can kill our satellites. Yeah, well, we had them in 1975.
[11:57.000 --> 12:11.000]  We had in orbit by 1978 over a hundred drone attack ships that just sit there with their power off, waiting with large loads of D.U.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  Shabo rounds, meteor guns from orbit.
[12:17.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now, they had that in the 70s. They accidentally declassified it in 92 in a debate on C-span. So then Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars, when it was secret to talk about it, Colonel Bowman.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  Okay, now you know the truth.
[12:33.000 --> 12:43.000]  We are 45 years ahead of the Chai comms. Everything you see on the battlefield that we have is 30 to 40 years old.
[12:43.000 --> 12:53.000]  Just like they had the B-2 bomber for 20 years in active duty in service before it was shown to people in 1989.
[12:53.000 --> 13:07.000]  My dad saw B-2 bombers, Apache helicopters, and stealth fighters when he was 10 years old in military drills that happened south of Dallas.
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  When I was a kid driving outside Dallas, I saw stealth fighters. These stealth fighters you see today, but they were gray.
[13:15.000 --> 13:23.000]  Three of them flying at like 200 feet above the ground over farmland.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  That was 35 plus years ago.
[13:30.000 --> 13:38.000]  So just to understand, the globalists had captured America and they had all those systems and were suppressing it and stealing all our technology. It's all stopping.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  There'll be no Chinese century.
[13:41.000 --> 13:54.000]  As long as it's communist, I welcome a Chinese century and renaissance, but none of the communists. There'll be none of that.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  Notice the crews in there of your TV. You were just searching whatever I say. They're actually finding it.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  I'm surprised how much this is now coming out.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, you can never keep somebody alive for sure because an artery might blow.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  It's like putting new parts in an old car. So many parts are going bad. You've got to put all new parts in it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:18.000]  But they can stall death 50 years now in most cases. And if you can do that, that's basically close to immortality.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  And that's the big secret. And they don't want you to have that. Well, Trump wants you to have that.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  I told you the most important thing at the inauguration was life extension technologies and other technologies.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  And I told you it'd be in a speech and it was because we're dialed in. I don't have to talk to the president to know what he's doing.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  We are jacked into the same spirit and the enemy knows it. They cannot stand it, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  And Trump is for real and he's delivering. He's not out to get you. And this is an incredible time to be alive.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  We're going to come back and get into the looming indictments and how these are going to go down reportedly.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  And so much more of the deep state. They are in prime attack mode right now because they are cornered rats on that piece of beachwood,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  driftwood. Please remember, we are listed supported. We're going to have to end this special early next week.
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  We have free shipping on all of our best selling nutraceutical items and many other items like swarable food.
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  But if you'll just try brain force and see what a good, clean, high quality natural boost for your brain is,
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  it's incredible. If you'll get alpha power, 50% off, we sold out of alpha power and we had it at 30% off.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  It's back in libido, stamina, energy, mind, but they all are different formulas that hit from different angles.
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.000]  Different people like different formulas, better. Brain force, alpha power, 50% off, X2, 50% off.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  But only when you get it with bio tree selenium, it's also 50% off. They go together.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  The new product, the real red pill, plus now with energy and you don't just get great products.
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  You can find the tip of the spear, the dreaded information warfare attack system,
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  the globalist absolutely shaken fear of you by funding us will bring them down.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  But the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best. Get a sunny bay heating pad.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  The best relief for that pain is a sunny bay heating pad.
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  Sunny bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work

[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  Why take another pill?

[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.

[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions,

[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  Watch me.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  I got it. Hey!
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  I got something that makes me want to shout.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  Oh yeah.
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  I got something that I'm super bad.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  I got something that I'm super bad.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  I got something that I got to move.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  That tells me what to do.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Sometimes I do.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  Now I got to move.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  That tells me what to do.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  You know why the globalists are saying Alex Jones's sponsors have been taken?
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  Alex Jones is being sued. Alex Jones is a loser. Alex Jones is failing.
[21:09.000 --> 21:21.000]  Because they want to project the idea to their faltering, failing, race-baiting, politically correct culture of destruction that they're winning when they're losing.
[21:21.000 --> 21:29.000]  When their program of demoralizing this country and sabotaging it has the wheels coming off.
[21:29.000 --> 21:41.000]  You know in China they execute Gage. Did you know in Russia it's tolerated but you don't push it on kids?
[21:41.000 --> 21:52.000]  So our media puts out travel alerts if you're going to go to the World Cup or any other event in Russia because the Russians might be mean to you if you are two guys and you kiss in public.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  I've looked into that. That's not really the case.
[21:55.000 --> 22:02.000]  What I'm getting at here is that China kills Gage.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  The Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, al-Qaeda kills them. You never hear about that.
[22:07.000 --> 22:19.000]  It's all about how Russia does this or some talk show host, some liberal talk show host, ten years ago or five years ago on her blog said something about the gay mafia.
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  Then everybody can all get upset about it and get their feathers all in a big ruffle.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  It's all just simulated civil rights.
[22:29.000 --> 22:42.000]  Starbucks is funding all this race-baiting garbage so that that's an ideology, a corporate ideology to control their people and to distract them from real issues like unionizing or higher wages.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  It's all distraction airing.
[22:44.000 --> 22:52.000]  Meanwhile, Democrats panic as indictments of Comey, Clinton and McCabe loom.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  That was an infowars.com exclusive on March 18 and March 17.
[22:56.000 --> 23:02.000]  Two different articles, when I had been told that no, they're going for the indictments. They have it.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  They are in the White House. They're working with the Justice Department.
[23:06.000 --> 23:22.000]  They know the Inspector General is bringing all this information out and it won't matter what old twinkle toes Jeff Sessions does because this is going to move forward and this information is going to be completely damning.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  And it's coming out very soon.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  But then there's the new article out today.
[23:27.000 --> 23:37.000]  Comey grilled as Fed seriously considered charging McCabe in criminal referral.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  Wall Street Journal, we're going to cover it all in the last segment of this hour.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  But not now because I should have said this right up front.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  I'm never really good at plugging.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  So I've got to tune into each segment because you never know what's coming up.
[23:47.000 --> 23:57.000]  Dinesh D'Souza just got his pardon announcement yesterday from the President of the United States, something CNN called very dangerous.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  Yes, Clinton pardoned cocaine dealers, sex traffickers, hundreds of pardons.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  Obama did similar things, but the media would never really cover that much.
[24:07.000 --> 24:15.000]  Oh my gosh, but a filmmaker and a former member of Reagan's cabinet, Reagan advisor, an amazing American success story.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  He didn't fill out a pack form on five donations he gave.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  Oh my gosh, and it came out in his divorce.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  And so Dinesh D'Souza, the second biggest documentary maker in the world.
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  How do you deal with him?
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  Oh, just throw his button present for nine months.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  That'll go well.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  You know, we really pushed it to Trump.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  He didn't even know that our pie had been convicted by a judge of contempt was facing here in prison.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  And I know a lot of folks pushed D'Souza.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  In fact, I personally pushed Stone.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  I'm just bragging, this is true.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Other people did it.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  Other people did as well.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  I said to D'Souza, to D'Souza, to D'Souza, to D'Souza, to D'Souza.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  Because that'll bring all that up and show the hypocrisy.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  I know for a fact Stone brought that up to Trump, because he told me he did.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.000]  And CNN's real scared they go, you can just bring it up to Trump, then he looks into it, he makes the decision.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  That hadn't been done in 100 years.
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  Presidents used to make the decision, but they have a pardoning board, you know, that the president gives it to them, they decide.
[25:15.000 --> 25:22.000]  No, the president has that executive power, and they can't stand watching him use that veto.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  And the only person that can veto the president is the public.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  If they think it's bad, then they'll support impeachment in Congress.
[25:29.000 --> 25:39.000]  The only thing the president can't have his veto over the legislative and judicial is in terms of impeachment or crimes he's committed.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  He cannot pardon himself.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  And the fact that he's exercising that is muy delicious.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  I mean, it is really, really, really good.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  And he's doing it for all sorts of good people.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  Martha Stewart, totally political.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  That was, Comey did that.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  They never go after real king pins.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  They knew exactly what, you know, all these Ponzi scheme operators were doing.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  They knew all about it.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  They were involved.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  They were on the boards of the law firms that would then certify the stuff that Madoff was doing to say they had protection.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  But then Martha Stewart, she didn't inside her trade selling $800,000 in stock.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  No, but she misled investigators, which wasn't even true.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  Oh, and he's talking about Blagojevic, too, who did nothing compared to them.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  Imagine getting Blagojevic out so he can testify.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  You guys want to fight?
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  You want to take the gloves off?
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  Trump's putting brass knuckles on.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  You started the fight.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  You took the gloves off.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  You've been kicking this country while it's been down forever.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  Now get ready because Trump's like a big old bear and he's getting up on his hind legs.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  And you know what that means.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  He's going to chew your head off.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  Couple bites.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Bye-bye.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  He's got the people.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  He's got the law.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  He's got the history.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  He's delivered in a year and a half.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Everything's turning around.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  You're crapping your britches.

[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  You're like, the people aren't listening.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  They're not following what we said.

[34:56.820 --> 35:02.700]  No matter whether he's an arms dealer or a drug trafficker. He's not dangerous to them
[35:02.700 --> 35:08.620]  In fact, he's on their side in the sense that he is willing to lavish billions of dollars
[35:08.620 --> 35:14.540]  I mean may not do millions but tens of millions of dollars into progressive and left-wing causes
[35:15.060 --> 35:22.420]  I actually am dangerous to them. Why because I'm actually out there undermining their ideology at every turn
[35:22.420 --> 35:29.900]  And so to pardon me is to unleash me in an even bigger way. So when I hear these kinds of things from CNN far from like
[35:30.340 --> 35:37.180]  Trying to refute them. I essentially look behind the curtain and I go I know why you're saying that in a certain sense. You're right
[35:38.980 --> 35:44.900]  Incredible and of course the word is that the president's told you that he wants to unleash you now. Can you talk about that?
[35:45.940 --> 35:48.820]  Yeah, I was in my study two days ago
[35:48.820 --> 35:56.100]  Working away and the phone rang, you know unknown caller and I picked it up and it was the White House operator
[35:56.100 --> 36:02.340]  And she just goes she confirmed it was me and hold the line for the president of the United States and Trump comes on
[36:03.140 --> 36:09.020]  And the first thing he said to me was hey Dinesh, you know, I'm sitting here with John Kelly chief of staff
[36:09.780 --> 36:15.060]  And we both want to let you know that we think that you're a great voice for freedom and for America
[36:15.060 --> 36:21.500]  And he said I got to tell you man-to-man that you know your case you you know, you got screwed
[36:21.660 --> 36:24.980]  He goes you you should have gotten it. He was a technicality
[36:24.980 --> 36:27.300]  You should have gotten a fine and move on with life
[36:27.300 --> 36:32.700]  But no these guys went after you with everything they got and he goes it was a terrible injustice
[36:32.860 --> 36:39.060]  He goes the good thing is you know, I'm in a position to correct it. So I want to I want to clear your slate
[36:39.060 --> 36:41.060]  I'm gonna give you a full pardon tomorrow morning
[36:41.060 --> 36:47.460]  and I am just I want you to go out there and just do what you're doing at an even bigger scale than ever and
[36:48.260 --> 36:53.560]  Boy, that's gonna upset the young Turks and others who would in debates with you defend
[36:54.020 --> 37:00.100]  Hillary and all her crimes, but say you're a criminal and have the audience his at you. I mean these people are incredible
[37:01.500 --> 37:07.380]  In in in the way they're trying to persecute people and destroy people that they intellectually can't fight
[37:07.380 --> 37:12.300]  Of course, you had your big film coming out for 2016. They wanted to stop you putting it out
[37:12.300 --> 37:18.140]  So they put you in prison and bragged about it. I mean that is just frightening how authoritarian they really are
[37:18.940 --> 37:26.300]  Well, what's happened is that the left in America is using the judicial system to what you may call it create the American version
[37:26.780 --> 37:33.580]  Of the show trial now, of course in the Stalinist show trials. They literally would torture people
[37:33.580 --> 37:39.220]  Pull out their fingernails and this kind of thing the American version doesn't look like that
[37:39.220 --> 37:41.220]  The American version is something like this
[37:41.660 --> 37:45.700]  Hey, Dinesh, we're gonna charge you with exceeding the campaign finance law
[37:45.940 --> 37:50.100]  But just in case you're thinking of of pleading not guilty
[37:50.660 --> 37:55.700]  We have an ace up our sleeve. We're ready to drop on you a second charge
[37:56.260 --> 37:58.340]  Not that you did anything different or wrong
[37:58.340 --> 38:04.260]  We're not claiming you had made a second offense. We're going to re-describe your offense in another way
[38:04.260 --> 38:06.700]  So we're not going to say you filed a false document
[38:07.220 --> 38:11.100]  And that happens to carry a penalty of five years in federal prison
[38:11.100 --> 38:14.820]  So how would you like to take a chance to completely ruin your life?
[38:15.060 --> 38:21.300]  Well, if you don't want to do that, why don't you plead guilty to the first charge and we will drop the second charge?
[38:21.300 --> 38:28.020]  So this is the game they play they use the plea bargain system to bludgeon me into making a quote
[38:28.860 --> 38:34.540]  Voluntary confession and then people like my prosecutor Pete Burrari yesterday. He was on Twitter
[38:34.540 --> 38:40.100]  He goes, let's just be clear about this Dinesh to sue the voluntarily pleaded guilty
[38:40.180 --> 38:42.860]  So this is their game. They essentially
[38:42.860 --> 38:50.380]  Extract a confession out of you with a threat to do even more and they go, oh, look, he admits he did it. He's so evil
[38:51.460 --> 38:56.380]  Exactly, so there they then put on the robe and played with false neutrality
[38:57.540 --> 39:01.300]  And act as if this is something that I you know, I just fessed up to
[39:01.660 --> 39:07.140]  As opposed to the fact that they had me over a barrel and the thing to remember about this kind of bludgeon
[39:07.140 --> 39:13.860]  You know this plea bargain bludgeon is it tends to pressure not just the guilty but even the innocent of course it does
[39:13.980 --> 39:17.660]  In the limited time we have hopefully you'll come on for 30 minutes or a full hour that in the near future
[39:17.660 --> 39:21.780]  But I know you're really the man of the hour right now as you're being kind of released like the Kraken
[39:21.900 --> 39:23.900]  You know out of your a
[39:24.220 --> 39:27.820]  Political no man's land. Thank God. Of course, you got a new film new book coming out
[39:28.060 --> 39:34.220]  They never shackled you completely, but you are now absolutely being magnified as I'm so excited that you know
[39:34.220 --> 39:39.100]  Trump sees that as he's like releasing in a great intellectual mind against the enemy. This is a war
[39:39.980 --> 39:44.260]  Anything else Trump told you what'd you say to him? I mean if someone was private, you know, that's fine
[39:44.260 --> 39:48.820]  But that's what Trump's told me before he said we need you in there fighting hard press the attack keep it up
[39:48.820 --> 39:54.780]  You know just we're gonna make America great again and then to see how the president's turning the country around now and how
[39:55.100 --> 39:58.820]  It's just panicking these people that they're pulling their hair out to Nash. I
[39:58.820 --> 40:05.540]  Think the broader issue here Alex that Trump is is well aware of is what you can call the
[40:06.220 --> 40:10.620]  Gangsterization of politics that has occurred under Obama and Hillary now
[40:10.620 --> 40:16.740]  This was not the way American politics used to be so I can't really imagine Jimmy Carter
[40:16.740 --> 40:19.180]  You know, he was an ideological nincompoop
[40:19.700 --> 40:23.820]  You know, he had his own problems, but I don't see him
[40:23.820 --> 40:32.100]  You know trying to lock up his political opponents any more than say George HW Bush would dream of locking up Michael Moore
[40:32.460 --> 40:40.460]  It was it was a different era, but with Obama we got this sort of a linsky idea that look let's just use the IRS against them
[40:40.460 --> 40:45.860]  Let's just weaponize the Justice Department and the FBI. Let's secretly tape them
[40:45.860 --> 40:50.020]  Let's put a spy in the campaign so you can see here on my case
[40:50.020 --> 40:56.700]  In a sense as a miniature of some of this this larger problem of the gangster gangster
[40:56.700 --> 41:02.580]  And that's where we were going next in a few minutes. We have left it is incredible now the Wall Street Journal now
[41:04.020 --> 41:08.520]  The Washington Post they're all reporting that they are looking at indictments of McCabe
[41:09.060 --> 41:10.740]  for lying
[41:10.740 --> 41:14.180]  For for illegally leaking for all of this and that leads back to Comey
[41:14.180 --> 41:19.380]  I've I've heard and I'm gonna know if you've heard that they are seriously going for the juggler now not because
[41:19.380 --> 41:26.540]  We're being political gangsters, but because these gangsters have gone too far and have to be dealt with they're too dangerous to not prosecute
[41:27.700 --> 41:31.820]  Well, let me give you you know a small glimpse of my own dealing with the Comey FBI
[41:31.820 --> 41:37.980]  So they created a file on me and a congressional oversight committee wanted to get the file
[41:38.660 --> 41:43.980]  But the FBI kept saying we can't give it because it could it has the names of confidential informants
[41:43.980 --> 41:50.700]  It'll inhibit our ability to do our work national security is at stake. The case is still pending all lives
[41:51.300 --> 41:55.380]  And and when you get the file and if they finally got a redacted version of it
[41:55.460 --> 42:00.020]  But then when you look in the file you see the reason why they were so reluctant to
[42:00.340 --> 42:03.060]  Cough it up and the answer is right in the file
[42:03.060 --> 42:10.220]  It says Dinesh to Susan is a right-wing provocateur who made a movie critical of the Obama administration in other words
[42:10.220 --> 42:18.940]  My political bona fides are in the file and the FBI me highlighted that to signal to the holder justice department
[42:18.940 --> 42:22.220]  Hey, here's a political enemy. You may want to go after this guy
[42:22.340 --> 42:28.860]  So this is the dirty stuff that they do exactly even MSNBC when they were persecuting tens of thousands of Christians with the IRS said well
[42:28.860 --> 42:33.740]  Of course we are your racist. They just dehumanize us like the Nazis did they persecute us
[42:33.740 --> 42:38.900]  But I think the worms turning and you agree though that we can't take the you know not take the gloves off now
[42:38.900 --> 42:42.020]  We have to go after them because they've actually committed the crimes
[42:43.300 --> 42:46.860]  Yes, I think I'd you know, we don't want to become like them
[42:46.860 --> 42:51.100]  I don't think you'd necessarily have to fight gangsterism by becoming a gangster
[42:51.100 --> 42:56.540]  But on the other hand you do have to fight gangsterism by becoming tough and you do have to enforce the law
[42:56.540 --> 42:58.540]  That's right. Dinesh is Susan amazing. Thank you
[42:59.140 --> 43:06.040]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Lelani estates
[43:06.040 --> 43:12.240]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[43:12.880 --> 43:19.800]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[43:19.800 --> 43:23.960]  To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[43:24.640 --> 43:31.560]  Alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[43:31.560 --> 43:39.240]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[43:39.480 --> 43:48.040]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[43:48.400 --> 43:53.720]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[43:54.040 --> 43:58.400]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[43:58.400 --> 44:05.520]  As the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs with changes in diet

[46:59.260 --> 47:05.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:21.380 --> 47:27.420]  Coming to you from the former United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas
[47:27.420 --> 47:29.420]  It's Alex Jones
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.200]  Valerie
[48:11.140 --> 48:15.020]  People asked on the internet as I was looking at YouTube this morning as that meme goes viral
[48:15.020 --> 48:18.040]  They said it was that edited and I'm like no that's live and
[48:19.060 --> 48:23.900]  Did you guys script that no that's why Owen's so great is that?
[48:23.900 --> 48:29.620]  We can riff off each other as the joke because there's so many good things happening, and then that's all
[48:30.420 --> 48:35.220]  Mainstream corporate media does is just increase races races races races
[48:37.220 --> 48:44.720]  And speaking of that Starbucks training employees forced to watch video after video of white cops attacking blacks
[48:46.460 --> 48:48.460]  Imagine if you made
[48:48.460 --> 48:53.940]  Workers watch videos of black people attacking white people and racially motivated attacks
[48:53.940 --> 48:58.100]  I mean it happens on both sides, but it is about ten times more often black on white
[48:58.100 --> 49:00.500]  That's FBI numbers, and that's done because
[49:02.300 --> 49:07.220]  Some of the leftist groups the new black panther party head I've had him on from Houston
[49:07.220 --> 49:11.580]  You know he said the newspaper don't go engage in crime in the black area go mug a white person
[49:12.540 --> 49:14.540]  Remember that a few years ago
[49:14.540 --> 49:19.420]  That story is up on drugs report calm. It's a excellent
[49:20.500 --> 49:27.220]  Information liberation article. It's got our video and report with a whistleblower in it Starbucks training employees force to watch a video after video
[49:27.220 --> 49:29.220]  Of white cops attacking blacks
[49:29.860 --> 49:33.340]  You know the number one killer of blacks is black folks, right?
[49:33.340 --> 49:36.300]  And I wish it wasn't happening. Well number one after abortion areas
[49:36.300 --> 49:43.340]  I'm sorry many areas over 70% of blacks get aborted, but the average is now down to like 47% reverend shoulders corrected me
[49:43.340 --> 49:45.340]  He was on a few weeks ago. We want to get him back on by the way
[49:47.260 --> 49:51.620]  He exposes the genocide going on against black people particularly, but
[49:53.140 --> 49:59.420]  You look at this I mean imagine if a company said we're worried about racism, so we're gonna show you black people on
[49:59.900 --> 50:01.900]  World star hip-hop site
[50:02.940 --> 50:07.380]  Doing the knockout game and then these people died after they were hitting their head at the concrete
[50:07.380 --> 50:15.380]  Or we're gonna show you black folks coming in and saying all this racist stuff and shooting people. Can you imagine that?
[50:18.180 --> 50:22.460]  Can you imagine I mean that is nothing but to create racial division that's coming up
[50:23.300 --> 50:27.060]  Some of the other guests we've got a member of the 30 year old
[50:28.460 --> 50:34.980]  Teenager that would move out of his parents house that got kicked out by the court last week and he came in studio Mike Rotondo
[50:34.980 --> 50:42.540]  It's going to be joining us coming up today. He'll be popping in. It's not gonna be on Skype or phone. Oh
[50:43.940 --> 50:45.580]  Good cuz
[50:45.580 --> 50:49.100]  We don't want to lose any of the effect and he's he's thanked me in USA today
[50:49.500 --> 50:52.900]  Things he's now moved out of the house people said oh, why'd you give them $3,000?
[50:54.180 --> 50:59.260]  Because I did it voluntarily ladies and gentlemen and because no one else was giving him any money and
[50:59.260 --> 51:06.860]  They were just saying look at this slob, but not making a big deal out of people having to pay for abortions in many counties
[51:06.860 --> 51:09.780]  Like Travis County where I live you have to pay for that as a taxpayer
[51:10.620 --> 51:12.620]  And many other areas people have to pay
[51:13.020 --> 51:18.500]  Millions and millions and millions of millions a year in San Francisco for thousands over the years of sex changes
[51:18.860 --> 51:24.620]  Who just moved to San Francisco? You want to have a sex change and then I got to pay for it
[51:24.620 --> 51:32.100]  So again, I just wanted to really investigate this guy and not just see him one-dimensionally and I got to say I think he's
[51:32.500 --> 51:34.500]  little autistic behaving
[51:35.540 --> 51:38.020]  Because he's got that same kind of satisfied
[51:39.260 --> 51:44.260]  Stupid intelligence because he's smart. He's witty, but at the same time you can't get through to him
[51:46.860 --> 51:48.860]  So we'll see what happens with him
[51:49.220 --> 51:53.780]  But he always wants the perfect thing to do and he can never figure out exactly what it is
[51:53.780 --> 51:58.500]  He's gonna do and that's the problem you just get out there in life and take the bull by the horns
[51:58.900 --> 52:05.020]  You know if the if the star cheerleader doesn't want to go out with you and because she's a senior and you're a freshman
[52:07.500 --> 52:09.500]  Then move on
[52:09.500 --> 52:13.740]  Don't end up you know never dating a girl because you were scared of rejection
[52:14.380 --> 52:18.220]  By the way, you might find out the little nerd girls a lot more fun than the star cheerleader
[52:18.340 --> 52:22.060]  So, you know, that's what this stuff comes down to but I digress
[52:22.060 --> 52:24.060]  I want to get into
[52:24.300 --> 52:26.300]  the really positive news
[52:26.300 --> 52:29.820]  when we start the next hour and I really want you to join me for this because
[52:31.340 --> 52:32.780]  Trump is for real
[52:32.780 --> 52:36.500]  He isn't out to get us. He really believes in Americana. He really wants free market
[52:36.500 --> 52:40.180]  That mean he didn't kind of strong man that mean that you know, he isn't
[52:40.740 --> 52:43.420]  Have some issues with military dalliances
[52:43.780 --> 52:50.060]  But he's really got the tiger by the tail and it's so far been steering it with masterful a
[52:50.060 --> 52:52.060]  plum and
[52:53.260 --> 53:01.620]  This is providence happening right now ladies and gentlemen and the position is really polishing him out and
[53:03.020 --> 53:06.940]  I see something really really strong
[53:07.380 --> 53:10.380]  Coming out of Trump and the more we get behind him the better
[53:10.900 --> 53:13.820]  If we desert him because he can't do a hundred percent of what we want
[53:14.380 --> 53:16.380]  Enemy forces will slide into the gap
[53:16.380 --> 53:22.340]  But they hate Trump legitimately. Yeah, I saw a photo yesterday that I wanted to tweet out
[53:23.620 --> 53:25.620]  Then I got locked out on my Twitter
[53:25.620 --> 53:29.940]  We had to change the passcode because somebody was sending on our authorize stuff in my name and
[53:30.940 --> 53:34.100]  So I couldn't tweet it. Let me see if I can find it
[53:35.340 --> 53:43.620]  Maybe show it on my phone to TV viewers, but just this image of Trump. I think is the most iconic. I think really captures him
[53:43.620 --> 53:49.700]  See if I can find it go to it in a minute. I want to find this shot in HD
[53:49.700 --> 53:53.300]  I think this shot right here because he looks really old and
[53:54.020 --> 54:02.020]  He looks completely dedicated and you can see the determination and how he's giving himself
[54:02.980 --> 54:04.980]  Completely to this and killing himself
[54:05.980 --> 54:07.980]  That's the real Trump right there
[54:07.980 --> 54:18.100]  He's killing himself and they know he's got a good spirit and he is working 18 hours a day giving in his 110%
[54:18.940 --> 54:20.940]  Something I can't even do it 44 years old
[54:21.140 --> 54:24.060]  And I'm known for energy and that's Trump right there
[54:24.060 --> 54:30.220]  And he is like he said he changed during the campaign and he changed even more and then this really is
[54:30.900 --> 54:32.900]  America's chance at reprieve
[54:32.900 --> 54:38.380]  That photo right there. I want to get that photo. I want to blow it up put it on the wall
[54:39.260 --> 54:46.500]  Because I'm telling you folks, you know a man by his enemies and you know how much they hate him because they know how real he is
[54:46.860 --> 54:49.580]  Turns out Obama's been spying on him the whole eight years
[54:50.780 --> 54:52.340]  and
[54:52.340 --> 54:57.220]  Trump knows all about the pedophiles and the globalists and the devil worshipers and the whole thing and
[54:57.220 --> 55:03.220]  And he's really trying his best because they wanted destabilization in North Korea
[55:03.220 --> 55:08.700]  They want destabilization worldwide. They want society falling apart. They want us to be on Prozac
[55:08.700 --> 55:12.700]  They want us to be depressed. They want it's in their own documents
[55:12.700 --> 55:18.380]  They heads of Facebook have gone public and said I was wrong. We designed it to depress you and hurt you and I
[55:18.620 --> 55:20.620]  Apologize Sean Parker
[55:20.620 --> 55:27.060]  You won't get that out of Zuckerberg. I got a big stack of articles here tech Titans tiptoed towards monopoly
[55:28.300 --> 55:34.580]  And they admit even the Wall Street Journal that Google Facebook Twitter and Amazon want a monopoly and
[55:35.460 --> 55:37.460]  Want to shut everybody else down
[55:38.180 --> 55:42.700]  No wonder they push race war. They are so villainous people
[55:42.700 --> 55:50.100]  It's all coming up and it's serious
[55:51.100 --> 55:55.060]  And Trump is just simply trying to give us a fairer shake
[55:55.900 --> 56:02.220]  By a group of corporate globalist that are teaching Americans how to hate themselves how to hate their country and how to disintegrate
[56:03.620 --> 56:08.780]  They were gonna bring us down when Hillary got in so bad and have culture and race and sexist wars
[56:08.780 --> 56:14.900]  and they're still going out with the plan even though she was defeated and it's consciously evil and
[56:16.580 --> 56:21.340]  That's why they changed the subject to Russia and to Julian Assange and to Alex Jones and to Roger Stone
[56:21.580 --> 56:23.940]  Because they got their butt handed to him in the election and
[56:24.540 --> 56:28.740]  Then it got proven that they're in there getting foreign funding from the Chinese
[56:28.860 --> 56:34.980]  Communist and the Vatican and the EU and Hollywood by the billions and that they have a culture of hating America
[56:35.620 --> 56:37.500]  because their tyrants
[56:37.500 --> 56:45.140]  Because they know there's a spark in America of free market and self-defense and 57 Chevy's and and you know all of it
[56:46.100 --> 56:48.100]  and Muhammad Ali and
[56:48.420 --> 56:52.700]  Marilyn Monroe, they know there's something special in America that real melting pot
[56:54.620 --> 56:57.380]  They want us to be domesticated and stupid and fearful
[57:00.220 --> 57:03.740]  It's their plan and they failed they bet wrong
[57:03.740 --> 57:11.900]  So we got to be all in right now ladies and gentlemen and move forward and it's spreading all over the world
[57:12.700 --> 57:17.980]  We have some big challenges coming down the road with the AI and all the rest of it and population and out of control
[57:17.980 --> 57:23.540]  You know tech giants and all of it, but at least we're starting to wake up out of the coma and I've got a shock

[1:00:23.940 --> 1:00:27.620]  That's the liberal mentality. I don't like you. I hope you die
[1:00:28.860 --> 1:00:30.860]  Not hey, I'm willing to debate
[1:00:33.660 --> 1:00:35.660]  How you like me now

[1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:10.980]  Yeah, let's put the live feed up. I should have told you in the last hour. I said the next is Susan
[1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:14.580]  I got distracted that Owen shroyer and
[1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:18.940]  Rob do and some of the crew went down to the biggest
[1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:24.420]  Abortuary in central, Texas. It's off of 290
[1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:27.700]  290
[1:01:27.700 --> 1:01:29.460]  eastbound
[1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:34.100]  Right before I 35 and it looks like a few, you know dozen or so supporters
[1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:40.060]  We just plugged it once yesterday on here showed up and we can show you the sign government funding planned Fahrenheit
[1:01:40.060 --> 1:01:43.820]  500 million a year and they've killed millions of people
[1:01:44.580 --> 1:01:46.580]  in our a
[1:01:47.260 --> 1:01:49.260]  Zero government funding
[1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:56.020]  So it just shows you where the real death is and what's really going on and when we showed up out there a couple years ago
[1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:59.780]  We plugged it for about a week out. That's why the communists showed up
[1:02:00.340 --> 1:02:04.820]  Who also then proceeded to tell us that they killed their kids that they were devil worshipers
[1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:10.420]  So it was quite interesting. So do see some of the comments when we just launched this feed
[1:02:10.420 --> 1:02:12.420]  We'll post a lot of feed in four Wars
[1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:14.980]  in our a
[1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:22.500]  You know protests the I don't know what they're calling the event but in four Wars protests planned parenthood death camp
[1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:29.140]  Maybe post that info wars calm folks want to watch the feed and they usually cap us on Facebook
[1:02:29.140 --> 1:02:31.140]  We sue Facebook live and it would get
[1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:35.860]  The average video about a million views and Facebook reached out to me
[1:02:35.860 --> 1:02:37.060]  They said come up to New York
[1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:40.060]  I mean with some Facebook executives and don't be mean to Zuckerberg and play ball and
[1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:44.860]  Then when we didn't they dialed it back to a hundred thousand could watch and then now it's like a thousand watch
[1:02:44.860 --> 1:02:49.180]  It doesn't matter everybody else grabs it routinely it goes viral and hundreds of thousands or millions see it
[1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:53.980]  You can't stop the signal, but it always caps at about 680 something people
[1:02:54.820 --> 1:03:00.220]  No matter how many want to tune in everybody says it kicks them off. It won't let them but anyways the feed just went live
[1:03:00.220 --> 1:03:05.620]  Let's go to a few minutes of it's people are in the comments saying we hope trucks run you over and kill you
[1:03:05.620 --> 1:03:11.260]  Oh, I know you're such liberals you care about children so much that you want people to have a government funded assisted suicide
[1:03:11.620 --> 1:03:15.860]  But don't want people to have the right to a terminally ill to take experimental treatments
[1:03:16.620 --> 1:03:21.300]  They could save them because you people are part of a death cult your control freak rats
[1:03:21.300 --> 1:03:28.220]  Let's continue here with this live feed is right now. Here we go. I'm just basically out here
[1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:34.540]  It's pretty much no matter what you think about it. You know to say taxation is theft got a new one
[1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:37.340]  Taxation is death
[1:03:37.340 --> 1:03:39.660]  Taxation is death. Yeah, yeah, because that's what they're doing
[1:03:39.660 --> 1:03:44.740]  They're spending our tax money on not just on illegal wars that we've been doing for many years
[1:03:44.740 --> 1:03:49.620]  You know, we've been doing that not declaring war on people and then setting up bases in their country
[1:03:49.620 --> 1:03:53.900]  But, you know, 500 million a year goes to Planned Parenthood from our federal government to
[1:03:54.540 --> 1:03:55.940]  to basically
[1:03:55.940 --> 1:03:59.180]  You know kill babies because one parenthood likes to say that oh
[1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:03.100]  We do all kinds of women's health things and they do do some of some of that
[1:04:03.620 --> 1:04:07.980]  But when you have people call them up and ask for ultrasounds and stuff like that
[1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:09.620]  Oh, no, we don't do that. We don't do that
[1:04:09.620 --> 1:04:13.900]  Even though they say ultrasounds one of our main things I will continue to give you some shots out there
[1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:18.900]  But nice families go interview the lady do or with her daughter that that's interesting. This guy's interesting, too
[1:04:18.900 --> 1:04:20.900]  but
[1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:24.940]  We will we will we will come back in a little while with more of that here with Owen shroyer has to say
[1:04:24.940 --> 1:04:27.620]  I guess he's probably out there with a live feed as well. We haven't seen Owen yet

[1:04:36.900 --> 1:04:40.660]  She comes she comes now into her oblivion
[1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:44.260]  How about we actually try to save some children by getting out there right now?

[1:07:35.860 --> 1:07:37.860]  And right now that was a couple years ago
[1:07:37.860 --> 1:07:44.060]  But with the commie devil worshipers showed to protest us when we were having a pro-life rally outside the biggest
[1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:48.060]  Abortuary in central, Texas where Owen shroyer and the crew are today
[1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:52.740]  But the commie devil worshipers didn't show up today because they got their butt handed to him last time
[1:07:53.100 --> 1:07:58.100]  Politically when they physically attacked us they were made to look like idiots. We're gonna be going to Owen here in a few minutes
[1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:00.600]  But first drumroll please I
[1:08:01.580 --> 1:08:03.580]  Told you two weeks ago
[1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:09.940]  From sources in the meeting with Cudlow and the president that when the new quarter
[1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:13.460]  Comes out
[1:08:13.620 --> 1:08:19.020]  Because you get the quarterly numbers after the quarter ends it would be at four percent
[1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:25.220]  But that they wanted to be careful and not overestimated well guess what
[1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:32.180]  May jobless rate is at three point eight percent black unemployment at a record low
[1:08:33.940 --> 1:08:38.660]  And the word is very very soon you're gonna hear of the four
[1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:46.060]  Point zero the word is it may even be higher the water. They said conservatively four percent
[1:08:47.740 --> 1:08:54.980]  Remember the New York Times the Washington Post Barack Obama. They all said you'll never get to three Obama never got to three
[1:08:54.980 --> 1:08:59.100]  He said what are you gonna do wave a magic one? Can we pull up the magic one quote, please?
[1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:02.740]  The magic wand quote

[1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:10.620]  Could care less about Hollywood or power all that crap
[1:09:11.380 --> 1:09:13.500]  But I savor
[1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:17.740]  Patriots having a foothold in the swamp and having Trump I
[1:09:20.420 --> 1:09:22.420]  Saved
[1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:27.660]  And they are just pulling their hair out because they want to run our lives brainwash our kids
[1:09:27.860 --> 1:09:35.100]  Deny us medical care put us into the death panels case for killing granny Bill Gates all of them and admit it and then they say oh Trump's bad
[1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:38.340]  We're letting people get experimental care of their
[1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:42.420]  Facing death
[1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:48.260]  Yeah, here it is here's Obama saying Trump cannot wave a magic wand right now growth is what?
[1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:51.140]  3.3
[1:09:51.140 --> 1:09:52.900]  Estimates are
[1:09:52.900 --> 1:09:54.740]  internally from the White House
[1:09:54.740 --> 1:09:57.580]  4 to 4.1, maybe even 4.2
[1:09:58.100 --> 1:10:02.900]  When the numbers come out in about a month and remember you heard it here first
[1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:05.660]  next year's news today
[1:10:07.220 --> 1:10:14.540]  Tomorrow's news today the dreaded info wars. Here's Obama saying huh what's Trump gonna have some magic wand besides?
[1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:17.460]  He's never gonna be president member. I like Baldwin. Oh
[1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:20.540]  I like Baldwin. You're very useful to me
[1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:26.220]  We now take you live
[1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:35.000]  What they call in Team America fag and it stood for something like the
[1:10:36.860 --> 1:10:38.860]  Yeah, yeah the what actors killed
[1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:47.180]  Yeah film actors gear we now take you live to fag and then Kim Jong-il goes. Ah, I like Baldwin
[1:10:47.180 --> 1:10:53.100]  He was just sir. I'll take care of it right away, sir. I mean you're not getting what you want
[1:10:53.620 --> 1:10:56.140]  and then symbolically it's Michael Moore with the
[1:10:57.140 --> 1:10:59.980]  Explosives trying to blow up the team America
[1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:08.460]  So so here is Obama saying you can't have cars you can't have TVs you can't have air conditioning to Africans
[1:11:08.460 --> 1:11:12.860]  Remember that but he also says you just can't wave a magic wand. Well, it's not a magic wand
[1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:16.460]  If I've been chained up in a prison for my life
[1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:21.620]  You know in shackles for ten years and then you take me out of the shackles that I can now walk around
[1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:26.940]  In fact, let's hear a message from fag first Sean Penn and others
[1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:34.760]  Yeah download that I want to play it. Oh, and I love how it's gonna be all over George Soros Media Matters today
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:38.040]  Jones and another homophobic rant
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:44.200]  Oh, but you don't say that about the America because they are self-part folks in Hollywood even though they're a different vein of that
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:45.560]  I tend to like them
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:48.120]  They're irreverent. They have a right to make the joke
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:51.520]  It's funny and I'm gonna make the joke not because I hate people
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:58.760]  That have different lifestyles than others. It's ridiculous, but I will I will play stuff like this
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:01.080]  You know, I didn't use to because I'm a more serious broadcast
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:04.760]  But I'm gonna start playing stuff like this because I'm gonna do what I want
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:09.760]  I'm gonna exercise the First Amendment and you're gonna get used to it. George Soros you evil
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:13.120]  Scrotum head
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:19.760]  It's a self-propelled scrotum. You've seen they've seen him in France three days ago trying to have the EU takeover and have authoritarianism
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:25.400]  And he just looked like a big old rotting bag of pus. Excuse me. Let's go to Obama. Here it is
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:27.960]  when somebody says
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:32.680]  Like the person you just mentioned to I'm not going to advertise for
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:35.600]  That he's gonna bring all these jobs back
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.600]  Well, how exactly are you gonna do that? What are you gonna do?
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:45.920]  There's the there's no answer to it. He just says well, I'm gonna I'm gonna negotiate a better deal. Well, how?
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:49.480]  What how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  what magic wand do you have and
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.440]  Usually the answer is you don't have an answer
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:12:58.440]  so
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:09.000]  And of course within months it all turned around because they were artificially I'm gonna use the analogy again. I've done this myself
[1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:13.440]  You got your boat tied up you're getting gas
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:17.240]  You're tied up in two or three places you start driving off
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.920]  You forgot one and the boats like and it won't move you go. Oh, I'm tied up the dock
[1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:26.720]  So Trump went over and said America. It's okay for you to have jobs. He called a bunch of corporations said move back
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:32.320]  He said hey, we're gonna get lower taxes here on corporations. So you don't you know move overseas and all the sudden
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:38.880]  It'd be like if you had your sunroof open and it was raining and water was falling on you and Obama goes
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:42.280]  Oh, what are you gonna do wave a magic wand to close that sunroof and I'm like no
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:46.560]  I just hit the button
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.840]  And that's how dumb they think you are
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:55.080]  So, so let's hear that from Obama one more time
[1:13:55.080 --> 1:13:59.880]  Then we're gonna go to Owen shroyer live at the Abortuary outside of it making some great points
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.480]  here, let's go ahead now and
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:07.920]  Play Obama again one more time two years ago here it is and when somebody says
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:13.320]  Like the person you just mentioned to I'm not going to advertise for
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:16.260]  That he's gonna bring all these jobs back
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:19.280]  Well, how exactly are you gonna do that? What are you gonna do?
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:26.600]  There's the there's no answer to it. He just says well, I'm gonna I'm gonna negotiate a better deal. Well, how?
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:30.140]  What how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:32.840]  What magic wand do you have and?
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:36.000]  Usually the answer is
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:41.680]  You don't stop there. I love the power trip of Obama. I'm not even when Trump was in the lead then as the lead candidate
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:49.000]  I'm not even going to dignify and give him advertisement the power trip that oh, you're so important Obama
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:55.080]  And then they say Obama was shell shocked when Trump won and Ben Rhodes or that video that just got released in that night
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:57.080]  He can't talk
[1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:03.480]  These people are control freaks, they don't know what's going on. I told you Trump would win
[1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:06.880]  If we could stop the election fraud they stole
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:11.200]  Six states tried to steal five, but Homeland Security locally clock
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:16.520]  Homeland Security breaking into the computers and in live time block them in
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.480]  five states
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:23.680]  Of course they were trying to steal they stole the nomination from Bernie
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:28.160]  Don't know what it's like to be poor
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:33.760]  My buddy Sanders face mark. So when we come back, we'll have Ben Rhodes all sad and we'll go to
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:37.000]  Oh and shroy are live on the scene
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:39.760]  It's all coming up today
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:46.080]  We're gonna win win win. You're gonna get so tired of winning her to say please stop and we're not going to do it

[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:20.280]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down

[1:20:03.420 --> 1:20:16.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:16.460 --> 1:20:26.060]  Savannah Hernandez is out there as well with Alan Shroyer
[1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:33.660]  and Rob Dew at the Abortuary. She's talking to some of the crowd. We're gonna pop in and hear what she has to say
[1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:40.860]  Then I'm gonna get into the devastating success that Trump's having bringing the country back from the dead
[1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:44.860]  Because we had a bunch of globalist vampires drinking our blood
[1:20:45.740 --> 1:20:51.820]  Imagine about a thousand little vampire bats subbing on us and Trump's on our way back from the dead
[1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:57.420]  Imagine about a thousand little vampire bats subbing on us and Trump's already kicked about half of them off
[1:20:57.580 --> 1:20:59.580]  They're hopping around biting him
[1:20:59.580 --> 1:21:03.420]  Crapping themselves flipping out rolling around having little fits of anger
[1:21:04.620 --> 1:21:08.540]  But he just every day is just basically swatting more of them off and
[1:21:09.660 --> 1:21:12.940]  Some of them are flying up against the wall and breaking their backs and then vomiting up the blood
[1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:18.380]  They stole and flipping out in it. I mean, they're just just think of the democrats as a little demonic vampire bats
[1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:25.900]  Having convulsions. Let's go to Savannah Hernandez and hear who she's talking to in Austin at the Abortuary that we're there exposing
[1:21:25.900 --> 1:21:27.020]  Go ahead
[1:21:27.020 --> 1:21:30.540]  Outside of that, I can't really find a justification for murdering babies
[1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:40.140]  At the same time, I would really appreciate it if pro-life groups or those who are generally opposed to the practice of abortion
[1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:48.860]  would help crowdfund medical science to the point where we can increase the date of viability for the unborn because
[1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:53.740]  While I do believe that women should have a choice to evict
[1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:57.500]  A baby from their womb if they want to they don't have a right to kill it
[1:21:58.220 --> 1:22:03.020]  So I want to I'm hoping that medical science will one day be able to square the circle
[1:22:03.020 --> 1:22:09.820]  And a baby will be safely removed from a womb perhaps artificially incubated and brought to viability
[1:22:10.460 --> 1:22:14.940]  And then that can be the end of this issue and we can go back to focusing on more important things
[1:22:14.940 --> 1:22:17.100]  I've never heard that idea. Wow a new idea
[1:22:17.820 --> 1:22:21.820]  Going back to Owen's sign, I mean what were our stats that we put up here, Owen?
[1:22:22.380 --> 1:22:25.340]  I think we put that 75 million children are killed
[1:22:26.380 --> 1:22:29.420]  Um from Planned Parenthood and the NRA has killed zero
[1:22:29.420 --> 1:22:34.700]  I mean, you know a lot of people do argue that the NRA all the blood of the children mass shootings
[1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:38.300]  It's on their hands. What do you have to say about that as a gun owner?
[1:22:39.820 --> 1:22:42.460]  Well, I mean, I'm no real fan of the NRA anyway
[1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:50.540]  But I don't think they've ever murdered anybody and I feel like it's just unfair to paint them as that kind of an organization
[1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:53.020]  I feel it's uh
[1:22:53.420 --> 1:22:58.060]  That's the type of personal attack that he's got a gun or chips. I don't like NRA. I don't have a real argument
[1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:01.500]  Hey, they're not hardcore enough. I feel like the left really demonizes gun owners, you know
[1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:06.460]  Meanwhile, they're promoting the killing of millions of babies. I mean like as a gun owner in america
[1:23:07.020 --> 1:23:09.020]  I guess like how do you feel about that?
[1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:13.100]  Well, I mean, I don't really believe it's just the left that's doing that either
[1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:21.020]  I feel like the right is also promoting a whole lot of child murder in the form of the wars that the united states engages in across the world
[1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:23.980]  And that's both a left and a right thing
[1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:30.860]  So if you're gonna care about babies, you should care about those and trying to get out in the womb or outside of the womb
[1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:33.900]  And whether or not they're american or whether they're not americans
[1:23:34.140 --> 1:23:34.860]  All right
[1:23:34.860 --> 1:23:38.220]  Interesting fellow. We'll get back to some other folks and check in with them. They're gonna be out there for hours
[1:23:38.460 --> 1:23:40.460]  Which probably put this address on screen
[1:23:41.420 --> 1:23:44.940]  It's uh, right off. It's it's the main Planned Parenthood
[1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:47.180]  Abortuary in austin, you know, there's a couple of them
[1:23:47.180 --> 1:23:50.380]  But it's the main one one the biggest of the state right there on 290
[1:23:50.380 --> 1:23:58.220]  And i-35 on the west side of i-35 on the eastbound side of the frontage road
[1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:02.140]  You really can't miss it planned parenthood protests in austin
[1:24:03.100 --> 1:24:09.740]  And it is 201 east bend white boulevard building b austin texas 787 oh four
[1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:15.980]  Okay now getting back to the collapse of the globalist
[1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:22.060]  Unprecedented trump aims to defy midterm campaign history
[1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:30.380]  And then the even bigger news trey gowdy's recent activity highlights deep state action against devon nunez
[1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:36.620]  It's now being confirmed and we've got indictments being readied
[1:24:38.220 --> 1:24:40.780]  That's even in the wall street journal the washington post for
[1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:43.340]  mccabe
[1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:50.620]  So this circle in the wagons with these federal prosecutors and these clinton people and even some of these conservatives have been playing a double game
[1:24:50.940 --> 1:24:52.940]  Is coming to an end?
[1:24:54.700 --> 1:24:57.980]  So we're going to review what trey gowdy's really done versus his rhetoric
[1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:01.500]  Coming up the start of the next segment, but since i mentioned it
[1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:05.020]  We mentioned ben roads one of the chief strategist
[1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:09.340]  For hillary's campaign after the word came that she lost she threw such a fit
[1:25:09.340 --> 1:25:14.700]  We first broke that the day after that she was drunk throwing things attacking podesta
[1:25:15.260 --> 1:25:17.980]  This was all confirmed like a year later. We broke this here
[1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:20.220]  The day after the election
[1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:23.900]  That that that she threw a fit. It's what they're so mad folks. We've got the sources
[1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:26.380]  They don't they just lie
[1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:29.740]  And that she wouldn't even concede basically and then they had to basically sedate her
[1:25:30.460 --> 1:25:32.460]  And remember she wasn't seen for weeks
[1:25:32.860 --> 1:25:34.860]  Only popped up for a few seconds a few days later
[1:25:34.860 --> 1:25:39.820]  She totally whacked out of her mind and here's ben roads. This just got released from the night of the election
[1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:42.380]  2 30 in the morning when they know it's all over
[1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:47.740]  HBO footage of ben roads on election night is as bad as people said it was. Let's go ahead and roll it
[1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:52.300]  With the space alien megan kelly. She was like a bleached out gray alien. Here it is
[1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:58.060]  I just came outside to try to process all this
[1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:00.060]  Um
[1:26:03.660 --> 1:26:06.860]  It's a lot to a lot to process. I mean
[1:26:14.620 --> 1:26:17.740]  They already printed I can't even madden president up
[1:26:19.580 --> 1:26:21.580]  Over newsweek
[1:26:21.580 --> 1:26:23.580]  I
[1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:28.540]  I
[1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:37.100]  That's all these people do is put on this nice guy act. These are the nastiest people are on the wiki league scheming
[1:26:38.940 --> 1:26:40.940]  I can
[1:26:42.460 --> 1:26:45.660]  I can I can put it into words. I I don't know what the words are
[1:26:45.660 --> 1:26:50.380]  Well, the words are you tried to run a demonic
[1:26:50.940 --> 1:26:52.940]  female version of the crypt keeper
[1:26:53.660 --> 1:26:57.980]  With a laundry list of bloodthirsty activity and betrayal and pedophile protection
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:00.540]  that the world's ever seen
[1:27:01.180 --> 1:27:04.380]  And you're all in the wiki leagues thousands of pages. They want to divert us from
[1:27:05.180 --> 1:27:12.140]  Bragging about race war bragging about division bragging about the democratic party gonna own women and all their money
[1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:14.140]  Ha
[1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:21.340]  And so then you don't get all the things you thought you got you didn't get to pee pee all over america to feel like a big boy
[1:27:22.940 --> 1:27:27.020]  You want to do like a dog rubbing its butt on the carpet? He's wanting to kind of scoot around america forever
[1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:29.900]  And it's just again. They thought they had us intimidated
[1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:32.940]  They don't understand we were asleep
[1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:38.300]  So now they're doubling down the intimidation the threats the losses the attacks and they go you're supposed to go away
[1:27:38.300 --> 1:27:41.100]  You're supposed to just fold up
[1:27:43.740 --> 1:27:45.740]  I'm not going away

[1:27:53.740 --> 1:27:56.220]  And I'm promoting freedom when we come back
[1:27:56.620 --> 1:28:01.980]  We've got savannah hernandez out there at the scene of the abortuary talking to some other ladies
[1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:05.020]  And will I hear what she has to say on the other side?
[1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:08.380]  We're just picking up their facebook youtube and twitter feeds. It's better than us using skype
[1:28:08.540 --> 1:28:13.260]  But then they can't hear us. We're kind of staring into that. We have it posted on info wars dot com

[1:28:23.180 --> 1:28:29.500]  Um, you know many many more positive things than they do negative, but it's people that are doing it's like it's doctors and they're killing babies
[1:28:30.220 --> 1:28:32.220]  uh and
[1:28:32.220 --> 1:28:37.900]  Not the other way around it's not the scalpel. It's not scalpel control or vacuum cleaner control or
[1:28:38.620 --> 1:28:43.660]  Acid control, you know, they pump acid in the baby flops around for about 30 minutes and then they chop it up

[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:42.320]  spread, it's over for the globalists. You'll never, never defeat the human spirit. You'll never defeat God. You'll never win. We know who they are and we're sick of them.
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:35:00.320]  You guys know who he is? Alex Jones, that's info wars. Very popular. Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones for Alex Jones, Alex Jones for info wars.
[1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:20.320]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it just like the Stockholm syndrome and so that's why the joke is on you and that's why it's going to continue.
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:28.320]  Oh, here I am. Rock you like a hurricane.
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:37.320]  Repent now, repent now. I know your mustache is cool. You got little gold frame glasses. You scared me so bad.
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:50.320]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide is Alex Jones.
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:36:09.320]  And I wanted to share this momentous occasion with Roger Stone, again former top advisor to Trump of 40 years, patriot, former head of the campaign that has turned the whole world around. We just had the North Korean delegation go into the White House 15
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:21.320]  minutes ago. They're meeting with the president. The globalist left is by side themselves trying to sabotage it. The out of control neocons Bolton are trying to sabotage it. It's incredible.
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:31.320]  Unemployment 3.8 the lowest ever recorded in modern history. The word from inside the Cutlow meeting soon 4% growth rate will be announced.
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:45.320]  And now the reason Roger's here with us. Comey grilled as fed seriously consider charging McCabe in criminal referral. That's out of the Washington Post and that's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:57.320]  Oh, yes, the word is going back to around Christmas or after Trump said that's it. They're not suing for peace. No quarter given. No, no taken. We're going on ramming speed and Roger's got his ear to the ground on this.
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:07.320]  You saw the Dinesh DeSousa pardon genius. It's not a convicted coke dealer weapons, you know, Traveller. That's why the media is upset so much to cover.
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:21.320]  The trade gout is now being outed as basically working for the deep state to shield the FBI and just department. So it's all happening and it's such a big deal to see this unfolding.
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:34.320]  It's a real celebration because I think you can mark the last few weeks as the breaking of the deep states back. Now, doesn't mean they're not going to savagely try to tear the heads off of the low hanging fruit because they can't get at POTUS.
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:41.320]  He's broken through their mind control. He's broken through all their demonization and control. He's broken through them trying to attack anybody that supports him.
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:51.320]  And in their rage, anybody like stone or myself have been chosen for destruction. So I'm just saying I want to keep going in the fight.
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:59.320]  We are beginning to win, but the battle is raging. 2018 is everything. Now unprecedented Trump aims to defy midterm campaign history.
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:09.320]  The Democrats are panicking even in their fake polls. The Republicans are neck and neck or ahead, which means they're 10 points ahead, which means only massive election fraud can stop us now.
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  We're removing the neocons. We're removing the leftist scum. We are turbo charging will not be the Communist Chinese century. It will be the new American century and not the one Dick Cheney talked about.
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:25.320]  This is winning. Stone, I can feel it. What do you want to tackle first?
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:32.320]  Well, Alex, I couldn't agree with you more. You know, it takes an ocean liner, a substantial amount of time to turn.
[1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:42.320]  But the president is now finally on offense. And I think a majority of Americans now realize that Mueller is the criminal. Comey is the criminal.
[1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:50.320]  Brennan is a criminal. McCabe is a criminal. And these people must be brought to justice.
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:39:05.320]  That the Washington Post prints an op ed from the psychopath, criminal John Brennan, a traitor and the man who I believe is the perpetrator of the phony dossier who lied about it under oath in front of the Congress.
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:14.320]  And the folks at the Washington Post should really be ashamed of themselves. But you're right. The forces of freedom are on the move.
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:31.320]  Rudy Giuliani is exactly the wartime conciliary the president needed. And I believe when the inspector general's report is finally rendered, Jeff Sessions is going to get his walking papers, the single worst attorney general in US history.
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:41.320]  And they've signaled the whole deal. Giuliani goes, oh, we're not getting rid of him yet. The AG report comes out. We'll see. And then torpedoes away. They're all gone and lavish indictments.
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:49.320]  But as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start celebrating yet. How could the enemy grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:58.320]  Well, they're trying even as we speak this morning. I believe that as many of two of my former associates were in front of a grand jury in Washington, D.C.
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:13.320]  where they are being pressured into bearing false witness against me as the special prosecutor comes up with no evidence of Russian collusion, no evidence of trafficking and allegedly hacked emails with WikiLeaks,
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:29.320]  no evidence of advanced knowledge of John Podesta's emails being published. So now they seek to concoct some other phony offense in an attempt to squeeze me into testifying against the president.
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:46.320]  In other words, they want me to be a rat. They want me to perjure myself to help bring down the president. That is not going to happen. Zero chance. And I would remind anyone who's headed to the grand jury, perjury before the grand jury is a crime.
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  Tell the truth. I urge everyone to simply tell the truth.
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:41:04.320]  You were all over the news last night and this morning going, it's dangerous that the president, old 45, old reliable, did this pardon for DeSousa because he could do it for Stone or others.
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:11.320]  He could do it for Cohen. I mean, hey, that's executive power to balance out the out of control courts, the out of control Congress.
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:21.320]  That's why the president has that guys. And so they're just beside themselves that he's actually now beginning, as you said, to go on offense. I just sense victory. I just sense it. Oh, my God.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:33.320]  Well, let's be clear. No one deserves a pardon more than that great patriot General Mike Flynn. His entire indictment is a fraud. The FBI themselves conceded that he hadn't lied.
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:45.320]  This is a vendetta left over from the Obama administration. I believe Mike Flynn is not only a great patriot, but a man whose greatest public service to this country lies ahead of him, not behind him.
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:49.320]  If there is one person who deserves a pardon more than any other.
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:42:03.320]  And by the way, the president can issue a pardon at any time prior to conviction, prior to prior to indictment, after conviction, after a guilty play at any time, the president can can issue a pardon.
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:07.320]  We learned that in the Ford pardon of Richard Nixon.
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:21.320]  I remember about a year ago, I said, next time you talked to 45, I said, you got to bring up the Susa. And I'm not saying we did that. I know we did it. And we're credited with our with the Sheriff of Ohio, because he didn't even know that that had happened with that judge, the judge or self convicted him.
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:25.320]  I'm just going from memory, but I didn't you bring it up to the president about the Susa.
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:38.320]  I have suggested that although it was some time ago, so either he retained it or perhaps someone more recently recommended it to him. But this is an extraordinary miscarriage of justice.
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:45.320]  The Dinesh to Susa made a made a violated a federal campaign finance law.
[1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:56.320]  Roseanne Barr has pardon me. That's incorrect. Rosie O'Donnell has violated the exact same law by millions. Exactly. We'll be right back.
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:32.320]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:36.320]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.

[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:31.320]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:47.320]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:58.320]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it.
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:14.320]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said America is back. Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge and the world is taking notice.
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:29.320]  Ladies and gentlemen to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans we are offering free shipping and info wars store.com and 50% off on more than 20 best selling items like brain force the amazing new trope.

[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:10.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:25.320]  You can come inside Hollywood receiving this transmission.
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:40.320]  You are the resistance Hollywood Babylon baby Hollywood.
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:48:04.320]  Who is that man is that Elvis all right back to Roger Stone and then coming up.
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:12.320]  The fourth hour we're trying to get Katie Hopkins on so they'll be on next week from Russia.
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:18.320]  Mike Rotondo the 30 year old we got a victim out of his parents house.
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:20.320]  I love taking control of the news cycle.
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:25.320]  Some of the listeners are like why would you give that bum $3,000 someone to see what he was like.
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:34.320]  Not that the welfare stuff he was doing off his parents was nothing compared to people getting sex changes paid for by taxpayers or abortions or all the anchor babies.
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:45.320]  And then now he's moved out of his house and I got hundreds of news article headlines talking about how the left pays for sex changes with our tax money and for anchor babies.
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:47.320]  So don't say this guy's the biggest enemy in the world.
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:51.320]  So I took that and got let's not exaggerate because mainstream media is worthless.
[1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:59.320]  They charge millions of dollars, millions and millions to be on the front page of USA Today worthless crap, hundreds of thousands for a full page yet.
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:01.320]  I just do that stunt.
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:03.320]  And I'm in hundreds and hundreds of publications.
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:11.320]  Good morning America everywhere pointing out that they are funding anchor babies to have everything free and all this other crap.
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:17.320]  And then I've got conservatives going, Jones is an idiot funding that deadbeat.
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:22.320]  Okay, I got millions of dollars advertising for $3,000. Yeah, I'm real stupid.
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:23.320]  I'm real dumb.
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:27.320]  Why doesn't everybody else show me how it's all done when I told you Trump was going to win?
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:29.320]  I told you 5g give you cancer.
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:30.320]  I mean, I'm bragging.
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.320]  It's all right here.
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:34.320]  Anyways, we're telling the truth.
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:35.320]  The globalists know the truth.
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:36.320]  They use it against you.
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:38.320]  We're showing you the hat trick.
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:42.320]  We're showing you the how there's a table and you think he's getting a rabbit out of the empty hat.
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:46.320]  There's a there's a door opening in the table and there's a rabbit under there.
[1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:50.320]  And there's a hot blonde assistant under there too doing my toenails.
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:55.320]  And the point is, is that he's reaching down into it and he's getting a rabbit out of that.
[1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:57.320]  Then the trap closes and he pulls it out.
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:00.320]  It's that simple.
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:02.320]  We had rain coming into the car.
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:05.320]  Trump's closing the sunroof.
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:07.320]  He's untying the boat.
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:15.320]  Now, Roger is going to not be here next week, but the week after that's when we're going to do a Friday 24 hour broadcast or a long broadcast.
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:19.320]  Then we're going to come back on Saturday and go to midnight and then come back Sunday.
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:26.320]  So it's going to be three days of expanded transmissions to just chronicle the incredible history and time we're in.
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:27.320]  But here's the thing.
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:30.320]  People ask why I'm such a maniac sometimes.
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:38.320]  When you unlock areas in you where you decide to not be afraid and when you decide to take action and you have victory,
[1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:48.320]  but then the enemy turns up the heat, your brain begins to flip the switches for you to be very aggressive, very smart, very decisive, very on target.
[1:50:48.320 --> 1:50:54.320]  And for all these other men that act like they're strong or just want money, women are looking for that.
[1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:56.320]  People are looking for daredevil.
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:50:58.320]  They're looking for trailblazing.
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:01.320]  They're looking for real strength.
[1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:02.320]  And I'm not a percent.
[1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:03.320]  I'm the biggest, baddest guy around the world.
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:08.320]  I'm just saying when it comes to blowing holes in enemy operations, really trying to promote freedom.
[1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:09.320]  You know, Trump's up there.
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:10.320]  Info wars is down here.
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:13.320]  You got Roger Stone, Drudge, all these other great trailblazers.
[1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:16.320]  We're in this special college together.
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:21.320]  We're in this brotherhood, this sisterhood, but I'll tell the listeners, don't thank me.
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:25.320]  You are the blood of this operation.
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:27.320]  Without you, there's nothing.
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:32.320]  So when I say I salute you, when I say I thank you,
[1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:35.320]  I run out of these families that are just in awe when they meet me.
[1:51:35.320 --> 1:51:36.320]  People are like, you're in awe of me?
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:38.320]  I'm just a red blooded American like you.
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:39.320]  You love what we're doing.
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:40.320]  You're a supporters.
[1:51:40.320 --> 1:51:41.320]  You get your family attacking you.
[1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:43.320]  You get fired for saying you love America.
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:44.320]  You get fired for being pro-gun.
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:46.320]  You get harassed.
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:48.320]  I know Real Liberals at UT.
[1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:53.320]  One guy knows been a big film editor and also produced a pretty big movie.
[1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:54.320]  He said he didn't like Hollywood anymore.
[1:51:54.320 --> 1:51:56.320]  He was making a million bucks a year.
[1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:57.320]  He came back.
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:51:58.320]  He was going to be a psychologist.
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:00.320]  His dad's a famous medical doctor.
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:03.320]  One of the top kidney doctors in the world.
[1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:05.320]  And I've known him since college.
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:08.320]  And he's Jewish.
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:09.320]  And I'm not going to say his name.
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:11.320]  He's a good friend of mine since college.
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:12.320]  And he's really classy.
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:13.320]  He's a classical liberal.
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:14.320]  He just loves everybody.
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:15.320]  He's nice and smart.
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:18.320]  They kicked him out of the psychology department and said,
[1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:19.320]  no whites allowed.
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:23.320]  And they're on record saying, and we don't want Jews in here either.
[1:52:23.320 --> 1:52:25.320]  That's UT.
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:29.320]  The political correctness has gone to cuckoo land, folks.
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:30.320]  It's crazy.
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:34.320]  And the globalists and the communist Chinese funding it have a plan.
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:36.320]  UT is run by the Chinese communist.
[1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:37.320]  That's in the news now.
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:38.320]  So I'm going back to Roger Stone this segment.
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:43.320]  The next point is, is that the left has gone completely insane.
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:49.320]  Everybody's going to get persecuted unless we stand up to this and say no.
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:51.320]  And it's now time.
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:52.320]  You better do it.
[1:52:52.320 --> 1:52:53.320]  You better decide which side you're on.
[1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:55.320]  Plus return on the tide.
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:52:58.320]  Now people like me and Roger might get drilled in the ground,
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:52:59.320]  but that doesn't matter.
[1:52:59.320 --> 1:53:00.320]  We are still fighting.
[1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:03.320]  But if you pray for us, if you financially support us,
[1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:07.320]  we will absolutely rip holes in them because they're attacking us.
[1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:08.320]  We're in the spotlight.
[1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:12.320]  So every dollar you support us with is like a million dollars in regular political warfare.
[1:53:12.320 --> 1:53:18.320]  I mean, you cannot deliver munitions to the front where soldiers are killing more
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:19.320]  than enemy politically.
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:20.320]  I mean, you give us weapons.
[1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:22.320]  We are the kamikaze pilots.
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:23.320]  We are the daredevils.
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:25.320]  We are flying the Death Star trench.
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:28.320]  We've already blown up Death Stars.
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:31.320]  We've already blown up, on the side of our helmets, is Death Stars.
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:32.320]  You understand that?
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:33.320]  That's why they hate us.
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:35.320]  We've already aced their head.
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:36.320]  We've already blown them.
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:39.320]  The enemy snipers have pictures of us on their sleeves.
[1:53:39.320 --> 1:53:40.320]  They're looking for us.
[1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:41.320]  Where are they?
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:42.320]  Get them.
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:43.320]  Get them.
[1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:44.320]  There's bounties out.
[1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:48.320]  There's a 15 million dollar political bounty from Soros out on me.
[1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:51.320]  He's already spent 15 million, I've confirmed.
[1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:52.320]  Yeah.
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:55.320]  I know, I'm proud to be in this position.

[1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:21.320]  crazy.
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:22.320]  I'm ranting.
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:23.320]  Only four minutes left in this segment.
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:27.320]  But stonecultric.com, you have your legal defense, people should support it.

[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:32.320]  They should understand that we are the champions.
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:36.520]  None of us are perfect, but we've been chosen now as figureheads of the left for us to be
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:37.520]  destroyed.
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:39.520]  No, Alex, you're absolutely right.

[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:57.120]  It doesn't matter, but we need your support.
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:03.720]  I got a bill from my attorney this morning for $40,000 just for the motion to dismiss
[1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:09.320]  the harassment lawsuit filed against me by that Obama front organization in Washington,
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:10.320]  DC.
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:15.640]  The whole purpose here, Alex, is to bankrupt you, bankrupt infowars, bankrupt me, bankrupt
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:17.040]  the stone family.
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:24.040]  So stonedefensefund.com, infowarsstore.com, where the donate button can easily be found.
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:26.400]  You are the lifeblood of this revolution.
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:29.440]  We cannot soldier on without your support.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.400]  This is not a spectator's support.
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:34.400]  This is total participation.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:35.480]  I'm not bitching at the audience.
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:36.480]  They've been great.
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:37.720]  They've supported us, the affiliates, everybody.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:38.720]  But this is it.
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:39.720]  This is history.
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:40.720]  This is happening.
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:44.120]  Roger, from your sources, I have separate sources that said, no, Trump's pissed, the
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.000]  loves are off, I've talked to a lot of other sources.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.920]  They say that Trump is, these are criminals, everybody knows these criminals, you better
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:51.760]  indict their asses.
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:53.280]  And the word is they're closing in.
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:57.720]  So on this particular death star, this is the big one, how far until we get up to the
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:02.680]  exhaust port just below the main port, how long do we fire those photon torpedoes right
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:04.200]  down the shaft?
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:07.160]  Well, I think there are two things to watch for.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:09.800]  One is the coming inspector general's report.
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:14.800]  I think that that's going to decapitate a number of people in the forefront of the deep
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:18.120]  state kickdown of Donald Trump.
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:24.040]  Secondarily, keep an eye on the decision by Judge Ellis of Virginia regarding the Manafork
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:25.200]  indictment.
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:32.440]  And also keep an eye on this recent legal opinion by Professor Stephen Calabrese that
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:38.080]  Mark Levin and Sean Hannity have talked so extensively about that questions the entire
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:44.800]  unconstitutionality of Mr. Mollier's very appointment, therefore any action on his part
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:46.960]  would be unconstitutional.
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:49.840]  Those are the three things to watch carefully.
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.240]  Armageddon is just around the corner.
[1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:56.800]  Armageddon for the deep state because this is not your regular president, the swamp
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:56:58.000]  going along with corruption.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.960]  He plans to pull the rotten teeth very soon, doesn't he?
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:02.520]  It sure looks that way.
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.240]  I think his patients are really worn thin.
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:09.520]  He's tired of being a punching bag for the mainstream media.
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:11.560]  He's tired of the abuses.
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:14.960]  The real squeeze is on Donald Trump Jr. right now.
[1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:16.880]  Never mind Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:21.680]  Yeah, we're under the microscope and that pressure's coming, but they're really trying
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:28.280]  to squeeze Donald Trump Jr., a great patriot in my opinion, and that is the line that if
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:31.880]  crossed will mean nuclear war against Mr. Mollier.
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:36.560]  But he can't help it, Mollier's so used to having America down with his boot on our
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:39.520]  neck, he just thinks he can't be defeated.
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:44.000]  That old rotten brain up there has no idea what he's about to go under.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.560]  We will defeat you, you globalist trash.
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:51.440]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:56.800]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply
[1:57:56.800 --> 1:57:59.240]  of storable meals is crucial.
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:03.840]  With InfoWars Life Select's storable food, you can make sure you and your family are
[1:58:03.840 --> 1:58:05.920]  ready for any emergency.
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:11.120]  With drinks, snacks, and meals in amounts ranging from 72 hours to a full year, there's
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:16.600]  no better place to look for healthy, easy, and incredible meals, including meals such
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:21.680]  as traveler's stew, homestyle potato soup, and a variety of other meals for breakfast,
[1:58:21.680 --> 1:58:23.000]  lunch, and dinner.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  InfoWars Life Select's storable food will help you eat comfortably in a time of need.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.200]  They even work great for camping.
[1:58:30.200 --> 1:58:35.080]  Simply pack a 72-hour kit to go and you have easy to cook and transport food for you and
[1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:36.880]  your loved one's trip.
[1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:39.320]  Don't be caught surprised by an emergency.
[1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:43.000]  Make sure you're stocked up today with all the food you need for an affordable price
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:48.280]  with InfoWars Life Select's storable foods.
[1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:53.240]  The scientists at InfoWars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:54.960]  and joint support.
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:58.120]  Remember the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:01.920]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:06.280]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[1:59:06.280 --> 1:59:10.440]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:14.720]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:19.920]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and
[1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:21.680]  so much more.
[1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:26.760]  Another turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our
[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:31.880]  turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:37.920]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:40.720]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:51.600]  Try bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[1:59:51.600 --> 2:00:05.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:11.800]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:16.600]  I'd love to try to spin it.
[2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:21.920]  Oh, Republicans have all three branches of government.
[2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:25.080]  Only because there's enough of them following their oaths.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.840]  We don't have Hollywood.
[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:28.560]  We don't have the Chai comms.
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:29.920]  We don't have the big banks.
[2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:31.280]  We don't have the big corporations.
[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:32.840]  We don't have Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:34.120]  We don't have all the universities.
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:39.240]  We don't have that mass trying to bring down the country.
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:47.440]  We in a last ditch effort have part of Congress, part of the courts, and the executive.
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:49.440]  Trump doesn't have real trifecta yet.
[2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:56.720]  He gets a hold and even gains seats coming up in the midterms that are only, my God,
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:00:57.720]  only a few months away.
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:00.760]  This is such an incredible time to be alive.
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:06.960]  If we can hold on, we have really, for this phase of the war, won.
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:11.200]  I mean, we can rest, but I mean, this is just, this is nail body.
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:13.120]  Roger, get back into Donald Trump Jr.
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:15.880]  They are honing in on him.
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:19.600]  I mean, I would say you're, they've said you're the main target right now, but I agree they're,
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:22.840]  they're, they're, well, what do you say he's the main target?
[2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:24.960]  I know they've really been going after him.
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.160]  They are just, their arrogance is just unbridled.
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:31.000]  They're so foolish.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:35.800]  Sources tell me that that is their real primary focus, Donald Trump Jr.
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:40.640]  I want to address some of you just said, Alex, which is things in Washington cannot be viewed
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:42.760]  in terms of Republican Democrat.
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:44.320]  That's outmoded thinking.
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:46.800]  This is patriots versus globalists.
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:49.360]  This is outsiders versus insiders.
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:54.380]  The, the deep state conspiracy is a bipartisan criminal conspiracy.
[2:01:54.380 --> 2:01:56.360]  Party label means nothing.
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:58.840]  People send me Robert Mueller as a registered Republican.
[2:01:58.840 --> 2:01:59.840]  So what?
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:02.240]  He's committed crimes on behalf of the Clintons.
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:06.000]  His party registration is unimportant.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:07.560]  Party labels mean nothing.
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:13.040]  Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, these guys are in bed with the deep state.
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:15.880]  Their party registration is immaterial.
[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:18.620]  What we need is not a Republican majority.
[2:02:18.620 --> 2:02:21.760]  What we need is an American majority.
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:23.960]  And we're headed in that direction.
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:26.720]  So don't view things in terms of the parties.
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:32.040]  No, right now, even though all three branches of government are technically Republican,
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:39.480]  you have Republicans like Lindsey Graham suggesting that Robert Mueller cannot be fired.
[2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:44.760]  Lindsey, I know you can't read very well, but, but he's entirely fireable.
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:50.220]  He serves at the pleasure of the executive and the idea that any one person is above
[2:02:50.220 --> 2:02:51.720]  the law is a Republican.
[2:02:51.720 --> 2:02:54.240]  Oh, they're even trying to imply Trump can't do pardons now.
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:55.960]  It's just pure BS.
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:03:02.000]  No, but it's perfectly all right for Barack Obama to pardon drug dealers and other psychos.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:09.880]  And communist bombers, precisely, but when, but when Donald Trump uses the pardon power
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:16.720]  to pardon, say, Jack Johnson, the black boxer, something that Barack Obama has done.
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:22.120]  I've urged the president to give a posthumous pardon for Marcus Garvey, who I think was
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:24.040]  harassed by the federal government.
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:25.800]  There would be an act of justice.
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:26.800]  Absolutely.
[2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:27.800]  Well, let's expand on that.
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:32.360]  I mean, it's beyond just the fact that Trump can do this.
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:36.000]  He's doing it for good people that aren't drug dealers, that aren't arms dealers, that
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:37.360]  aren't sex traffickers.
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:42.440]  And Obama and Clinton all did that, and the media didn't even cover it.
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:45.640]  I mean, it's just outrageous how criminal these people are.
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:51.080]  Well, and they criticized Trump today for not going through the normal pardon process
[2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:54.000]  of application being made and going through committees.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:59.840]  Have they forgotten the Mark Rich pardoned by Bill Clinton, where money was paid to the
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:00.840]  Clinton Foundation?
[2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:03.600]  But again, that's exactly what that's to be a bureaucracy, to pay the foundation for
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:04.600]  the pardon.
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:06.080]  That's to be a bureaucracy taking control for the president.
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:07.320]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:10.760]  So it's a perfect example of the double standard.
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:17.360]  No, we are in for an epic battle in the days and weeks ahead, and you're absolutely right.
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:22.000]  There comes a point where when I first learned that federal prosecutors were sifting through
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:25.280]  every molecule of my being, it upset me.
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:30.920]  Now all it's done is elevate my ability and my willingness to fight.
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:33.600]  I am ready to fight.
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:36.000]  This is an abomination.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:40.080]  There is no evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks hijinks.
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.760]  This is nonsense spurred on by the mainstream media.
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:45.640]  So let's get it on.
[2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:50.320]  I am so ready, but I need the support of the info war audience.
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:51.320]  That's right.
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:52.320]  Great job, Roger.
[2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:54.640]  We're going to come back and get an update on the 30-year-old that got evicted from his
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:56.960]  parent's house.

[2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:20.440]  Changing War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:20.440 --> 2:06:36.640]  Well, I tell you.
[2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:40.920]  It was just a few days ago that we had Mike Rotondo here in studio with us.
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:46.280]  He's the 30 year old that last week got evicted out of his parents house.
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:51.720]  And my point was, let's humanize him, and I still gave him a stiff talking to here about
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:53.560]  baby bird getting out of the nest.
[2:06:53.560 --> 2:06:59.280]  But I said, listen, we pay, really it's billions a year for taxpayer paid abortions, taxpayer
[2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:05.360]  paid for sex changes, all this stuff, and billions and billions for anchor babies, illegal
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:09.080]  aliens from all over the world come in or they come in on work visas or travel visas
[2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:13.080]  and have their babies here from China, Mexico, you name it.
[2:07:13.080 --> 2:07:16.320]  That's never demonized or attacked as it's freeloading or lazy or bad.
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:19.240]  At least he was doing it with his parents.
[2:07:19.240 --> 2:07:20.240]  And that's still bad enough.
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:24.480]  But I'd rather have, you know, my kids with me at 30, then, you know, suicide or something
[2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:26.480]  or Lord knows what, or on the street on drugs.
[2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:32.780]  The point is that I gave him a stiff talking to, but I wanted to get those other talking
[2:07:32.780 --> 2:07:37.640]  points in on the back of his story, because then I could get hundreds of newspapers to
[2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:43.040]  quote me saying he's not a welfare queen compared to these people on a Richter scale.
[2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:49.120]  He's a two or a three, whereas the anchor babies are a 10 or these big corporations anchor
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:53.560]  babies are like a nine Google, Facebook, Twitter, paying no tax, having the laws written where
[2:07:53.560 --> 2:07:57.280]  they pay no tax basically, and then lecturing middle class people are not paying enough
[2:07:57.280 --> 2:08:00.520]  taxes that is like an 11.
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:04.120]  So there's the headline of your radio listener, I'll read it to you from USA Today, hundreds
[2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:06.320]  of publications picked it up.
[2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:10.880]  And we got that point in over the media, if you guys put the USA Day back up for me, just
[2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:11.880]  real quick.
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:12.880]  Thanks.
[2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:15.200]  That 30 year old man finally moves out of his parents house.
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:20.240]  Thanks to Alex Jones, well, thanks to the listeners, thanks to the producers getting
[2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:21.240]  him in here.
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:22.240]  It was just a great way.
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:25.280]  One of those little golden moments where I had an idea.
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:26.960]  I did it.
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:27.960]  Grab control of it.
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:28.960]  It blew up.
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:33.920]  Kind of like I knew that when Hillary couldn't open the can of pickles, so they already
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:39.000]  had it open and can of pickles, jar of pickles, a glass jar that they pop.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.320]  And I knew that everyone would know they popped.
[2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:42.320]  I knew they'd make.
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:46.720]  I was sitting there at the breakfast table after I worked out with Pat Riley at my house
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:50.160]  at like nine in the morning about to come into the office.
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:51.160]  I'm sitting there.
[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:52.160]  This is a couple of years ago.
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:56.040]  Obviously the middle of campaign two years ago, and I said, I got an idea.
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:59.120]  Now I went and got a jar of pickles out of the deal.
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:01.120]  It was actually a couple of them.
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:02.120]  And I tested one.
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:03.120]  I said, see how it pops with Hillary?
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:04.120]  It doesn't pop.
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:05.320]  And I said, on area here it popped.
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:06.320]  They're going to think this is stupid.
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:07.320]  They're going to pick it up.
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:09.400]  It's going to be all over the nose.
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:14.440]  And then everyone's going to pop the pickles and know that it was fake for her that she,
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:16.600]  you know, and he's like, really, that'll be big.
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:23.000]  And I said, watch, it's those little golden juicies where you just have this idea spontaneously.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:30.040]  It follows through, you hijack the news cycle and we did it again with Mike Rotondo.
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:35.400]  So Mike, thanks for helping us get millions of dollars of free advertising here in infowars.com.
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.880]  Now you're learning capitalism or maybe you already knew it, but you thought it was generous
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:39.880]  to $3,000.
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:40.880]  I think it was well worth it.
[2:09:40.880 --> 2:09:43.800]  So thank you for, thank you for being involved in this, my friend.
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:49.000]  Thank you for, again, for the $3,000 that's made it so that I can move out without going
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  on the streets.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.760]  Who is this Jedi with?
[2:09:52.760 --> 2:09:59.560]  Hi, I'm Tony, I actually went to Mike's house because he lives around the corner from where
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:04.920]  I stay, because I was watching infowars, I'm a fan of your show, I was watching infowars
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:11.480]  and I decided to stop by after work one day and I stopped by and he wasn't home but his
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:12.480]  mother was there.
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:20.760]  When I told her my last name, she told me, wow, my family has that same exact last name.
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:26.880]  And through a conversation, I ended up finding out that me and Mike are cousins and that
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:29.840]  I did not even know that until that day.
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:30.840]  So she told me to stop by.
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:32.640]  You guys do have a family resemblance.
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:34.160]  What is the Rotondo name?
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:35.640]  What's the lineage of that?
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:37.160]  Well, mine's Masteral Pool.
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:41.360]  It would have been Masteral Palo, but it's Masteral Pool.
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:46.160]  His mother's, I believe, father, father, father's...
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:48.480]  Tell me mother's side.
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:49.480]  Your mother's.
[2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:50.480]  Yeah.
[2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:54.680]  But my mother's mother's father?
[2:10:54.680 --> 2:10:55.680]  Yes.
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:10:58.840]  I believe it's that, something like that.
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:01.000]  I'm behind 57.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  Tell me what your backgrounds are.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  That's interesting.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:13.480]  I'm Italian, Irish, German, and we have a little bit of, I believe, my sister just
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:14.480]  an ancestry.
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:15.480]  So you have a strong...
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:17.480]  You have a powerful liver.
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  Huh?
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:20.680]  You have a powerful liver.
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:27.960]  Oh, yeah, yes, that's, yeah, and yeah, but basically, people ask me, it's just Irish
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  Italian.
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:30.680]  Well, there you go.
[2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:35.360]  So, it turns out you guys are distantly related, so you've come over and helped him.
[2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  Where are you now, Mike?
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:39.840]  I mean, you've moved out now.
[2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:46.000]  Right now we are in Tony here's sister's son's house, their son's room.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:47.520]  My sister's house.
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:49.160]  This is my nephew's room.
[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:52.400]  He's got the camera and the microphone and everything.
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:53.400]  I understand.
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:54.400]  I'm saying, where are you moving?
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:55.640]  You're like in a hotel room or something?
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:11:58.840]  What are you going to get in your little baby bird nest?
[2:11:58.840 --> 2:12:03.720]  I'm going into an Airbnb for the next week or so, but Tony here said that after that
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:08.000]  I could stay with him for a long term, you know, a long period of time.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Well, that's nice with Tony.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  And then you don't get a job.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.280]  Maybe you guys can be reporters or something.
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:18.520]  What I'm asking you is though, is don't you want to get your own nest because, you know,
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:21.240]  when you bring girls over and then you don't want, you know,
[2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:25.000]  Girls, but then you got to, you know, you got to take them out.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.920]  You got to buy the movie and, and you know, then you come back and nothing's done and
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:30.920]  nothing.
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:31.920]  You didn't get anything done.
[2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:32.920]  I don't know.
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:33.920]  Tell them you're liberal and they're racist.
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:34.920]  So they don't buy you dinner.
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:35.920]  You got to try that.
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:36.920]  Maybe.
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:45.440]  But you got to understand, like you got to give to get, you know what I mean?
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:46.440]  Right.
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:48.760]  You can also go Dutch or whatever they call it.
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  Is that what it's called?
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:50.760]  Both people pay.
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:51.760]  Yeah.
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:56.040]  Or I could go out with a woman who has a very strong belief for women's rights and
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:12:57.040]  well, I was a teenager.
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:00.360]  There were some housewives in the neighborhood that bought, you know, they take me out to
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:04.520]  dinner and stuff just as I was helping them paint their toenails.
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:05.520]  That's right.
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.160]  But that's been about it for, yeah, go ahead.
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:11.640]  Was that a secret up until now?
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:12.640]  No.
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:13.640]  I'm just, I'm joking.
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:14.640]  You think I really that cool?
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:15.640]  Let's get serious.
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:21.040]  Uh, here, all I'm just saying is I just, well, you have a baby and we want to get you back
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:24.840]  on your feet so you can get, you know, reunited with your ex, at least the point to be with
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:26.360]  your, with your son, right?
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:28.400]  That's, but that's not related to that.
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:33.240]  And you can't, uh, you can't take a father who's involved with a child out of that child's
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:34.240]  life.
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:37.320]  If you have a good job and you're back on your feet again, the court will let you start
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:38.480]  being with your son again.
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:39.960]  That's how that works.
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:41.320]  I, I disagree.
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:45.080]  I think that, uh, your child is a right and your child's right to a father is a right.
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:46.920]  Well, listen, I'm sure you got screwed over.
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:51.640]  I'm saying they won't be able to stop you if you, you basically said the court adjudicated
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:53.680]  you as having a screw loose.
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:57.360]  I'm saying, who's them wrong?
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:03.880]  Um, I, hey, listen, I'm not, Mike, do you think I might be just a little bit smart?
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:04.880]  I'm not even that smart.
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:06.080]  I'm trying to give you basic advice.
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:08.280]  Uh, what's your buddy's name again?
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:09.280]  What's your name again, brother?
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:10.280]  Tony.
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:11.480]  Tony, an info wars listener.
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:13.480]  Can you get some sense into this guy?
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:14.480]  Oh yeah.
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:18.280]  He's going to be staying with, he's going to be staying after he gets done with his
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:19.280]  B and B.
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:20.280]  I'm going to talk to him.
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:21.280]  I work.
[2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:24.000]  He's going to get a job and he's going to help pay for the food and the lights and
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  all that.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Right.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  Yes.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:28.880]  I want you to slap him upside his head right now.
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:29.880]  Yeah.
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:33.760]  In a month, if he's being a deadbeat, are you going to slug him in the face for me?
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:34.760]  Yeah.
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:35.760]  You got it.
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:36.760]  Hey, we can make money that way.
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:40.560]  I'll tell you what, Mike, if you don't get a job in the next month, start contributing,
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:43.040]  how about I pay a $5,000 to knock your teeth out?
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:44.520]  You sign a contract.
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:46.520]  I read my teeth.
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:49.520]  It's going to cost a lot more than $5,000 to fix my teeth.
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:50.920]  Well, no, it'll be legal and lawful.
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:54.720]  I mean, in some states it might be illegal, but I'll, I'll knock your teeth out for 10
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:55.720]  grand.
[2:14:55.720 --> 2:14:56.720]  How's that sound?
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:14:59.880]  I'll just, I'll just the front teeth.
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:01.880]  How about I break your nose?
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:06.280]  I'm serious.
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:07.600]  I'm just joking.
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:09.600]  I'm just getting a sound bite.
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:10.600]  Yeah.
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:12.680]  Mike, I actually like you.
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:14.040]  You know what I think we're going to do with you and Tony?
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:16.840]  I think we're going to both hire you guys as auxiliary reporters.
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:18.120]  How's that sound?
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:21.160]  I would love that personally because I, I like your show.
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:22.800]  Me personally, I would love that.
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:23.800]  I like your show too.
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:26.440]  I just don't think I'm a reporter type person.
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:31.480]  Hey, if I say you are and you want to make money and use your, use your noggin.
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:33.560]  Tony, it's a package deal.
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:35.280]  I want you guys out there.
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:38.240]  I'm going to send you both to cover the Swedish bikini team.
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:41.320]  That would, that would be different for free.
[2:15:41.320 --> 2:15:43.640]  I mean, I, I'm thinking about going into comedy.
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:44.640]  All right.
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:45.640]  No, I'm serious.
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:48.560]  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to make you guys top sponsors of the Swedish
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:55.560]  bikini team this year and I have you both there as oil boys, we'll be right back.
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:15:59.080]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and it's not suitable for all investors.
[2:15:59.080 --> 2:16:01.000]  Fire your stockbroker and hire yourself.

[2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:17.480]  people how to trade the markets.

[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:30.200]  Listen up.
[2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:34.840]  Before you sign up for some garbage program or awkward in-person seminar, you really need
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:38.640]  to hear about the online trader program that everyone's talking about.
[2:17:38.640 --> 2:17:42.960]  This is the program that allows you to get your account funded with someone else's money.
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:43.960]  That's right.
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:48.640]  Apiary fund will gladly put up to $100,000 of their money into your trading account.
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:52.720]  From the best part, you get to keep 85% of the profits without putting in a dime of your
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:53.720]  own money.
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:56.200]  Apiary fund and this program are growing like crazy.
[2:17:56.200 --> 2:18:01.960]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just
[2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:07.920]  encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:16.160]  or books or videos or other material from infostore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:21.200]  I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products at
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:22.200]  infostore.com.
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:25.760]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:29.600]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:32.040]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:36.120]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:43.960]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[2:18:43.960 --> 2:18:47.520]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:49.160]  satanic pedophile armies.
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:52.280]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:57.280]  against us, so we need your support.
[2:18:57.280 --> 2:19:01.160]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:02.160]  Thanks for holding.
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:03.160]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.040]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:12.280]  I remember back when infowars and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:16.640]  it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool.
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:20.720]  And read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests, and I've been
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.120]  using your products since the first iteration of survival shields, and since then I'm on
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:31.680]  the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body, it's all
[2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:32.680]  amazing.
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:33.680]  Thank you, brother.
[2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:37.680]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[2:19:37.680 --> 2:19:42.080]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more
[2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:46.280]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:50.280]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:59.560]  the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[2:19:59.560 --> 2:20:09.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:09.280 --> 2:20:18.880]  You know, a little bird told me that at the Pentagon, they actually called what's happening,
[2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:22.280]  Operation 1776 Worldwide.
[2:20:22.280 --> 2:20:28.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:28.800 --> 2:20:36.280]  Isn't that funny that what Trump's doing is now being called 1776 Worldwide?
[2:20:36.280 --> 2:20:37.960]  Where did I hear that?
[2:20:37.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  You watch, in the next year or so, you'll hear that term 1776 Worldwide.
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:47.960]  Think about it.
[2:20:47.960 --> 2:20:50.160]  That's the power of ideas.
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:58.080]  Flesh and blood can go, but ideas, as long as humanity survives itself, are eternal.
[2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:07.920]  All right, let's go back to Mike Rotondo.
[2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:16.120]  Mike, I'm telling you, I know you're probably going to get a fair shake.
[2:21:16.120 --> 2:21:20.200]  You'll get your son at least partially back if you get a job, show you got a place, show
[2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:21.360]  you're on your feet.
[2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:23.600]  I talked to you on air and in person about what happened to you in court.
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:24.600]  I get it.
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:25.600]  You got railroaded.
[2:21:25.600 --> 2:21:31.280]  But I'm saying you have a right, sure, but you have to position yourself to show that,
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:33.800]  even if that's not a fair deal.
[2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:35.840]  There's hoops you got to jump through in life, okay?
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:36.840]  It's like lifting weights.
[2:21:36.840 --> 2:21:38.120]  You get stronger, okay?
[2:21:38.120 --> 2:21:39.280]  So that's all I'm saying.
[2:21:39.280 --> 2:21:44.360]  And then I'm like, hey, how would you like to do, occasionally, I'll say, I want you
[2:21:44.360 --> 2:21:45.360]  to go cover this.
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:48.800]  It can't be, well, you know, I'll say, hey, in a month, I want you to go cover this and
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:51.960]  I'll pay you both 500 bucks and I'll send you the camera or whatever.
[2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:54.880]  You can hire a camera and I'll pay them and I want you to go cover this or I want you
[2:21:54.880 --> 2:21:59.280]  to go do personal on the street and I want you to ask the questions I give you.
[2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:02.440]  We're talking a couple hours of work, you can send us the raw footage or get an editor
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:04.280]  and you make money.
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:07.880]  And then you get known and then it's fun, if you agree with our politics or like it,
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:08.880]  you could do that.
[2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:12.800]  But it's like, well, I don't know, I want to do it this way, I want to do it that way.
[2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:18.120]  On getting yourself right with the court with your kid, on trying to get you a job, on
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:19.120]  trying to give you advice.
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:21.360]  You're like, well, well, I don't really see myself as this or that.
[2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:23.520]  Well then what do you see yourself as?
[2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:27.520]  And hopefully when you're living with Tony here, he can like show you how to get this
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:28.520]  done.
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:30.720]  So let me hear from you and I want to hear from Tony about his ideas.
[2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:31.720]  Go ahead.
[2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:39.760]  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:45.800]  I was talking to him personally about how much I like info wars and I thought, you know,
[2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:52.520]  when I heard you ask him to do some reporting for you, I was like, damn, that sounds like
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:54.160]  a really cool job.
[2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:55.800]  That's something I would like to do.
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:22:59.520]  I actually said that to him long before I even heard about it.
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  Is it conspiracy?
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:04.360]  I really, I really, um, yeah, conspiracy is like Trump's going to win and we're going
[2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:08.200]  to go about 3% growth rate and sell G five gives you brain cancer.
[2:23:08.200 --> 2:23:10.200]  Sir, it's not conspiracy theories.
[2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:14.680]  Yeah, I would really, uh, yeah, no, I think that, I think that's great.
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:20.560]  Like to me, to me, that's a, uh, that's a very, very good job, uh, almost a, I would
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:27.200]  almost classify it as like a dream job because I've been watching you for a very long time
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:31.280]  over, over, I'd say at least eight or nine years.
[2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:33.360]  Mike, what do you say to that?
[2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:40.320]  I say Tony, if I, if I, after this week where I, you know, some legal, legal matters, if
[2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:43.760]  I kickstart my business, would you do that with me?
[2:23:43.760 --> 2:23:44.760]  Yes, I would.
[2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:45.760]  Yes, I would.
[2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:47.760]  No, I gotta, no, I gotta do that.
[2:23:47.760 --> 2:23:52.360]  No, I definitely would make an opportunity.
[2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:53.880]  You know, Mike, you are so funny.
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:23:58.480]  When we called you, Mike Ratonda this week to get you back on, you're like, I'm really
[2:23:58.480 --> 2:23:59.480]  busy.
[2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:00.480]  I'm kind of big now.
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:01.480]  I got a lot of calls coming in.
[2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:02.800]  That's not what I said at all.
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:07.000]  You have such a ridiculous Cheshire cat smile on your face.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:10.880]  I mean, I'm really trying to figure out cause let me tell you something, you're weird in
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:17.880]  a good way, but I'm just showing how opportunity, people pass by opportunity all the time, don't
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:21.200]  even know it, but you've got to be positive enough to seize on it.
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:25.000]  See, I have to invest in you, I should give you the stuff I want you to do.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.560]  I got so much on my plate, I got all these great reporters that followed reports from
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:32.760]  England and Millie Weaver and all this, I've even played their reports, Paul Watson, everything,
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:34.200]  but I'm, I've got you on right now.
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:35.200]  I'm not bragging.
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:37.200]  I'm saying I've got you on.
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:41.320]  I'm trying to believe there's value in you.
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:46.080]  But you know, Tony seems like a great guy, but you, you're just sitting there smiling
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:48.280]  like this is a big joke.
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:52.520]  Um, well, Tony is a great guy.
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:58.760]  I guess I'm not that, but, um, all right, all right, um, I just, I just don't see myself
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:24:59.760]  as a reporter.
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:03.360]  I just don't see that as something that, but like first, honestly, uh, Alex, I was talking
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:07.400]  to a lot of people today because today was the day I had to be out by noon and, and I
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:11.400]  had CNN call me and I said, you know, I'm, I'm really not doing this anymore.
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:14.320]  I'm really not, you know, I'm not mad at you.
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:18.240]  All I'm saying is they're not going to offer you a job.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:21.000]  And if you just want, if you'll be teachable, you can do it your own way.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:24.120]  And it's not like Howard Stern hires people because, you know, they make fun of them and
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:25.680]  it's pathetic and they humanize them.
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:33.360]  I would want to try to change your worldview and, and, and I don't want to say real rehabilitate
[2:25:33.360 --> 2:25:36.760]  you, but I'm saying I would like to see you successful.
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:38.320]  I wouldn't want you to be a laughing stock.
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:43.000]  I want to make the globalist a laughing stock who have created a culture that produces people
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  like you.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  You understand that?
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:50.080]  And yeah, the people, the people who are, you know, out there thinking, oh, Mike Rotondo
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:54.200]  would a laughing stock living with his parents, get a job, you know, et cetera.
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:56.800]  I, I don't think those people's opinions matter.
[2:25:56.800 --> 2:25:57.800]  I don't think that.
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:00.720]  No, I know, but do you realize the judo, I'm not that smart.
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:04.000]  But when we do things right, when we hit holes in ones, we hit them.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  Okay.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:13.240]  So what I'm saying to you is what I'm getting at here is that do you understand that you
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:17.520]  can't just do everything perfectly the way your brain has it all figured out the way
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:18.520]  you want to go.
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:22.240]  That's how you end up being 30 years old, your parents house.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:28.160]  Um, I, I think that that's how, I mean, I understand that there's a lot of people who
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:32.440]  go through their whole lives like that and never wind up achieving those goals.
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:38.720]  But I think that I learned a lot simply by failing at those goals.
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:41.840]  And I've learned a lot of really unique things that a lot of people I don't think have an
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:43.800]  opportunity to learn.
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:46.120]  I'm sure it would be when we learn from everything, don't we?
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:50.600]  Uh, going back to Tony, Tony, you seem to like your distant cousin, uh, Mr. Rotondo.
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:53.320]  I mean, what would you describe him like when he's not on air?
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.320]  Cause I can't figure him out.
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:59.200]  Um, I can describe him as a really nice, quiet guy.
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:04.320]  I didn't, I didn't know Mike prior to going to the house that day.
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:07.960]  I, I learned he was my cousin that day.
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:09.440]  So he lived around the corner for me.
[2:27:09.440 --> 2:27:14.040]  I didn't know that until that day, but, you know, he looks a little like Vlad the, he
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:17.360]  looks a little bit like Vlad the impaler little bit.
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:19.640]  I'll get rid of the beard and the mustache on that.
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:24.920]  Uh, otherwise he's, he's, uh, he's really, he's got good manners with his good, nice
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:25.920]  guy.
[2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  He's been really nice to me.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:27.920]  He's easy to talk to with me.
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:30.560]  Um, I think he's just a good dude.
[2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:31.560]  Well, good.
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:34.120]  What are you going to do in a month if he hadn't given you money for the groceries he's eating
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:35.600]  the power in the water?
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:39.120]  I put the deposit down, he put a deposit down.
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:49.040]  And I, uh, I hope that, uh, you know, he's, uh, working by then and, um, maybe, um, like
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:56.120]  you've already been saying, going the route that you have, uh, laid out, you know, you
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:28:01.640]  guys spoke and you know, it's, it's not, I mean, I came back from, let's do one more
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:03.640]  segment with you guys and we get another note.
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:04.640]  I appreciate it.
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:05.640]  You understand, Mike?
[2:28:05.640 --> 2:28:09.520]  I appreciate you guys who rub the media's nose in, in you being successful because they
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:12.920]  are the ones trying to make everybody like this, trying to arrest people's development,
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:16.960]  trying to break down the culture that paying for all this free crap for all these slobs
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:20.760]  and they pointed you like you're the bad guy to cover for what they are.
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:23.520]  I want you to transcend these people.
[2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:24.520]  Yeah.
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:33.200]  So you're telling me straighten up, fly right, do these things and you can have XYZ in a conventional
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:34.520]  and well established way.
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:39.320]  That's a very hard argument to, uh, that's a very hard, um, it's, it's hard to argue
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:40.320]  with that.
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:41.320]  But hold on.
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:44.160]  Let me hear the rest and we come back on the other side of this quick break.
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:48.200]  We'll be right back as we try to, uh, see where this guy's going to go in the future

[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:00.240]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom, but where do you go when there's
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:01.400]  nowhere to go?
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:03.640]  The answer is the Biffy bag.
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:07.960]  The Biffy bag is a pocket sized disposable toilet that fits in your glove box, tackle
[2:29:07.960 --> 2:29:10.360]  box, toolbox, backpack or purse.
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:15.120]  The Biffy bag has everything you need for a sanitary and comfortable relief experience.

[2:29:30.640 --> 2:29:34.560]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead
[2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:35.560]  my family to freedom.
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:40.440]  Today, we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:43.560]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:47.840]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our black rifle real

[2:29:56.400 --> 2:30:01.680]  UFO Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[2:30:01.680 --> 2:30:06.840]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:13.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:19.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[2:30:19.560 --> 2:30:22.880]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:27.800]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:32.880]  of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:33.880]  symptoms.
[2:30:33.880 --> 2:30:37.720]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:42.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:48.280]  triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[2:30:48.280 --> 2:30:51.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:56.320]  Live to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:30:56.320 --> 2:31:00.920]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home, but sometimes
[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:03.040]  supplements don't work fast enough.
[2:31:03.040 --> 2:31:07.880]  That's why info wars life has created a powerful new addition to the super blue line, super
[2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:10.080]  blue silver immune gargle.

[2:31:15.080 --> 2:31:18.240]  for the bathroom, kitchen or wherever you go.
[2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:23.280]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentists recommended for daily use whenever you feel
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:24.920]  like you need to stay clean.

[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.120]  stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:38.000]  With powerful yet simple ingredients, immune gargle features silver sole nano silver for
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:40.320]  a powerful cleansing alternative.
[2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:45.560]  With super blue silver immune gargle, staying toxin free is easy and affordable.

[2:31:55.960 --> 2:32:01.520]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is sending
[2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:03.640]  down over the UK.
[2:32:03.640 --> 2:32:09.320]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gage, you'll get
[2:32:09.320 --> 2:32:11.480]  six months in prison.
[2:32:11.480 --> 2:32:15.280]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:20.040]  Three in and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:24.920]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:30.640]  people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[2:32:30.640 --> 2:32:31.880]  what we have to say.
[2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:34.760]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[2:32:34.760 --> 2:32:40.360]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and sign up for the
[2:32:40.360 --> 2:32:44.680]  free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:51.120]  in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:52.120]  to this fight.
[2:32:52.120 --> 2:32:59.040]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:25.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:25.880 --> 2:33:55.720]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:33:55.720 --> 2:34:25.520]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:54.520]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:35:24.320]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:54.120]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:36:22.920]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:52.720]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:37:22.520]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:51.320]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:38:21.120]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:50.920]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:39:20.720]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:50.520]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:40:20.320]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:23.120]  I don't remember exactly what the judge said.
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:29.920]  It was kind of a blur, but it was basically the findings that it can only be supervised
[2:40:29.920 --> 2:40:32.120]  visitation with a mental health professional.
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:35.720]  So I meant I had to pay a professional for their time.
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:36.720]  I get it.
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:38.120]  Stop worrying about the money.
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  The money will come.
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:41.120]  I get it.
[2:40:41.120 --> 2:40:42.120]  Did you hurt yourself?
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:44.120]  Did you hurt your son?
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:45.120]  No.
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  I was an excellent father since he was a baby.
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:53.920]  So what, did you get a new boyfriend or something?
[2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:54.920]  That did happen.
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:56.920]  Look, dude, you got a man up.
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:58.920]  You got to go make money.
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:00.920]  You got to get your own life going.
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:06.920]  You got to get a good lawyer that wants to, you know, you probably, I'll tell you this,
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:07.920]  a lot of lawyers want attention.
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:10.920]  You get a good family law lawyer that want to come on the show and talk about it.
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:13.720]  That right there is publicity for them.
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:21.320]  If you man up and start, get the job and become a reporter and kick-ass, I will look.
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:25.320]  If you follow that stuff and getting you a lawyer and exploring what went on, if I
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:29.220]  find out your telling truth about you and your son, I will help you get a lawyer.
[2:41:29.220 --> 2:41:33.800]  Just the fact your ex sees this, things will start changing, but you've got a man up and
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:36.520]  stop trying to act like a baby and have it your way.
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:39.820]  Manning up is what I'm doing Alex by standing up to the government, which I'm not afraid
[2:41:39.820 --> 2:41:40.820]  of.
[2:41:40.820 --> 2:41:44.520]  I know, but if I know how to help you and if I see your telling the truth, there's
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:47.320]  ways to do this, you understand?
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:50.320]  Have you ever, have you ever ridden a bull?
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:51.320]  The what?
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:52.320]  Ever ridden a bull?
[2:41:52.320 --> 2:41:53.320]  No.
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:55.320]  Oh, I've ridden a mechanical bull once.
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:41:57.320]  I didn't do very well.
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:41:58.320]  Me too.
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:02.320]  But you listened to folks that have ridden a bull before.
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:03.320]  Right.
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:09.160]  No, I have not gotten advice from someone who's been bullriding.
[2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:12.400]  My point is, is that you, it's a dangerous thing you're involved in.
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:16.480]  You need to listen to people who have knowledge, not try to reinvent it yourself, you understand
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:17.480]  that?
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:23.920]  I just, I, I think that with my strategy and, and approach is, is really good.
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:28.520]  Well, you better do it in the next, I don't know, I don't know, uh, New York law, but
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.160]  it's pretty similar all over the country.
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:32.920]  Within a year and a half, if you're not with your son, they'll terminate your parental
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:33.920]  rights.
[2:42:33.920 --> 2:42:35.600]  What's going to this?
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:37.560]  That's a horse, not a bull.
[2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:39.760]  They don't scare me, Alex.
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:42.360]  All right, we'll be right back.
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:43.560]  I'll finish up with both of you guys.
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:47.360]  I just, when I'm saying you need to follow through, man, you need to follow through and
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:49.200]  get out of the haze and just stop.
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:50.200]  They don't scare me.
[2:42:50.200 --> 2:42:56.000]  Well, you better scare you because you hadn't had your son in eight months.

[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:27.280]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:31.880]  You know, I like Indians, you know, from the subcontinent India.
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:35.320]  Every Indian I've ever met is hardworking, smart, kind of libertarian, doesn't like the
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:36.320]  system.
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:37.320]  And that's the Susan.
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:38.960]  He wasn't even born in this country, he wasn't.
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:44.080]  And he came here, ended up being in Reagan's cabinet when he wasn't even 30 years old because
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:45.080]  he earned it.
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:50.880]  He's super smart, he's super cool, and he doesn't buy into how they demonize me and
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:53.880]  say don't come on the show, you know, he gets it.
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:55.600]  He just got pardoned by Trump.
[2:47:55.600 --> 2:48:01.520]  Now imagine a Dinesh D'Souza versus Mike Ratondo and his friend, who's a nice fellow, we're
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:03.880]  going to talk to him more in a second.
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:07.360]  I'm offering to mentor Mike Ratondo.
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:08.360]  He said, oh, you're too radical.
[2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:09.360]  I don't agree with your politics.
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:10.360]  I'd say, oh, totally agree.
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:11.360]  Got it.
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:14.800]  He said he likes my politics in here on air in the other studio when he was here last
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:15.800]  week.
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:17.960]  We did one in here and we did a live one in there as well.
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:18.960]  Both of these are live.
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:22.360]  But we had commercial free podcasts for the new podcast studio.
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  And that was it.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:30.080]  Or I guess the long form studio and I'm sitting here trying to tell him, I mean, look, I've
[2:48:30.080 --> 2:48:34.960]  had my children for almost three years with supervised visits for their mom and I didn't
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:35.960]  push for that.
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:37.960]  But that's what happened because I knew what I was doing in the legal system.
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:41.240]  And now I have my children 50-50 and that's great.
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:42.240]  I'm sitting here.
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:43.240]  I've been through this.
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:45.840]  I'm telling you how to navigate stuff and you just don't even want to hear what I'm
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:46.840]  saying.
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:47.840]  They're like, well, I don't know if I want a job.
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:48.840]  I don't know if I want this.
[2:48:48.840 --> 2:48:49.840]  I don't know if I want that.
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:52.400]  You have to do something is what I'm getting at.
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:57.280]  And listen, we have the lowest unemployment ever recorded in modern history, 3.8%.
[2:48:57.280 --> 2:48:58.280]  Wages are going up.
[2:48:58.280 --> 2:48:59.280]  It's causing some inflation.
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:00.600]  Nothing's perfect.
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:04.760]  You can get pretty good paying jobs everywhere right now if it's just willing to work.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:06.800]  So you keep saying, oh, I've got this job.
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:08.360]  Oh, I've got this business.
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:09.360]  We don't want your secret.
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:11.760]  We don't want your genie in the bottle.
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:13.760]  Tell us.
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:16.800]  So it's not just stuff in the air.
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:20.680]  Tell me what it is you're planning to do as a business.
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:21.680]  Tell me.
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:28.080]  Well, I just had someone reach out to me yesterday that develops an app in the area.
[2:49:28.080 --> 2:49:33.320]  And, you know, Dan, you want to hit me up and tell me back, you know, he talked to me
[2:49:33.320 --> 2:49:35.400]  about the business that he works for.
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:39.600]  And it really sounds like a dream come true to me to work with this company that develops
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:40.600]  this app.
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:45.800]  So you have, you have, you have skills in building, building apps.
[2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:48.240]  He said that there's a lot of different things that I could do.
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:53.680]  I don't necessarily need to be a programmer, but a lot of the things about what their business
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:58.560]  needs are things that I was actually, well, the things that I'm very interested in.
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:01.560]  What is that?
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:05.560]  Different types of data analysis.
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:06.560]  Data analysis.
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:10.440]  All right, Tony, we're going to get you guys back on.
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:13.320]  Because this unfolds, but let me ask you about this.
[2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:14.320]  What do you know?
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:19.240]  Did you do anything about the, your friends saying that he, that one ever see his parents
[2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:20.240]  again?
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:21.240]  I think that's kind of me.
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:23.000]  I think we should encourage him to see his parents again.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  And also, did you call the police on them?
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:26.840]  Let me ask Mike before we go back to Tony.
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:29.920]  Mike, did you call the police on your parents about the toys?
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:39.240]  The toys and inheritance of mine that I was, my father was trying to prevent me from receiving.
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:43.320]  So I thought you told me, cause I'm reading this off of Syracuse.com.
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:45.320]  I thought you told me, this was just posted today.
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:50.800]  I thought you told me you moved down with your distant cousin, but, but it's saying
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:55.240]  you got evicted.
[2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:58.600]  I had to be out by noon today and I, I did that.
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:00.000]  Well, did your dad take your toys?
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.040]  I mean, did you carry your toys out?
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:07.920]  It's my son's toys, my, my toys, I don't characterize as toys.
[2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:09.160]  I'm not being mean here.
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:10.160]  I'm trying.
[2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:11.160]  I'm staying as the story accurate.
[2:51:11.160 --> 2:51:12.480]  Let's roll some of the video in the background.
[2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:13.480]  What happened?
[2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:15.080]  What happened at the house?
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:20.840]  I asked my father for, you know, for additional toys that were in the basement, which is locked
[2:51:20.840 --> 2:51:25.000]  and things in there are not available to me, uh, physically.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.160]  And I said, you know, is there anything else on there?
[2:51:27.160 --> 2:51:31.800]  He said, no, I said, are there any, um, uh, you have a green bin down there?
[2:51:31.800 --> 2:51:34.080]  He said, uh, yes, I said other toys in there.
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:35.640]  He said, I don't think so.
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:42.080]  I said, uh, something about, I don't remember how the conversation actually went, but basically
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:47.000]  my father said to me, I bear the burden of proof to name items which are not available
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  to me.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  And if they are found, they will be produced.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  Well, you have been there.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  You're 30.
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:54.160]  I mean, you've had time to get this stuff together instead of the, instead of the hour
[2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:56.880]  you're supposed to be out.
[2:51:56.880 --> 2:51:59.000]  You know what possession is nine tens of the law means?
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:01.900]  That's his house, his castle, his property.
[2:52:01.900 --> 2:52:04.800]  If you didn't get your crap out before, it's not his problem.
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:05.800]  I didn't.
[2:52:05.800 --> 2:52:06.800]  I didn't get it out.
[2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:09.040]  Uh, I, this was all prior to noon today.
[2:52:09.040 --> 2:52:10.800]  This was actually yesterday.
[2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:15.480]  God, Mike, what I'm telling you is it's not your dad's fault.
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:17.720]  You didn't get your crap out the very day you're supposed to be out.
[2:52:17.720 --> 2:52:18.720]  It's not his fault.
[2:52:18.720 --> 2:52:19.720]  It's not out.
[2:52:19.720 --> 2:52:22.200]  It's, I did get my crap out.
[2:52:22.200 --> 2:52:25.680]  He actually, after the police left, he mysteriously found it after the police told me that I'd
[2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:26.920]  file a civil suit.
[2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:31.640]  Why didn't you just go get the toys yourself?
[2:52:31.640 --> 2:52:35.960]  I, that's not, that's very confrontational, Alex, and very unwise with the, because you
[2:52:35.960 --> 2:52:36.960]  can cause it.
[2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:37.960]  Wait, you were already in that.
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:38.960]  Where's video?
[2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:39.960]  You carry yourself out of the house.
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:40.960]  What he said.
[2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:41.960]  You can't go in the basement.
[2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:42.960]  Correct.
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:43.960]  Okay.
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:44.960]  Now there you go.
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:45.960]  Then my dad wouldn't let me in the basement.
[2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:46.960]  Well, now I see you got a point.
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:48.160]  I'm not trying to be a jerk here, man.
[2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:52.600]  I'm trying to get you to like face up the consequences.
[2:52:52.600 --> 2:52:55.440]  What is your response to me saying there's so many jobs out there right now because of
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:58.280]  unemployment being so low?
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:03.640]  I'm hoping that I can get a job with this company that who contacted me yesterday.
[2:53:03.640 --> 2:53:05.200]  I'm hoping that that would work out.
[2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:09.160]  Well, I want to thank Tommy, your distant cousin for being a listener and hearing about
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:10.160]  this and trying to help you.
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:11.720]  And I appreciate what you're doing because he needs some guidance.
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:14.760]  And I'm not, we're not having Mike on the talk down to him here.
[2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:16.120]  He's smart in many ways.
[2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:19.600]  They're just, how would you describe him, Tony?
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:23.600]  Because it's just, there's something weird.
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:32.800]  I would just describe him as a little bit quirky, but a good guy, seems a little quirky.
[2:53:32.800 --> 2:53:45.400]  I had my suspicions of maybe a little bit of Asperger's actually the rule we're sitting
[2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:52.240]  in is my nephew's, which he has, my nephew has full, he has autism and you know, when
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:56.440]  I've seen that, that's what really hit me in the heart a little bit.
[2:53:56.440 --> 2:54:00.880]  I heard you say that and I wanted to make sure, you know, I went over and just seen
[2:54:00.880 --> 2:54:04.400]  that he was all right because I'm a good person in my heart, you know, and I'm just
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:05.400]  Tony, I think that's it.
[2:54:05.400 --> 2:54:10.200]  I think Mike is a little bit autistic and I'm not trying to diagnose this.
[2:54:10.200 --> 2:54:11.600]  I'm not a, you know, a medical doctor.
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:12.600]  He just has that thing.
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:13.600]  Yeah.
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:14.600]  Yeah.
[2:54:14.600 --> 2:54:15.600]  No, if I have it, that's fine.
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:19.800]  I don't, I mean, if I have it and it can get diagnosed, I can, there's, there's professionals
[2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:21.920]  who know how to help me, I'm sure.
[2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:25.280]  But, you know, it doesn't matter to me if I have that or not.
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:26.400]  No, you're not bad.
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:28.560]  I've got my own issues, I'm sure.
[2:54:28.560 --> 2:54:32.840]  Now they have names for it, I'm sure, but it's, it's, it's what they project on.
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:35.520]  I'm just saying there's a lot of chemical in the environment.
[2:54:35.520 --> 2:54:38.160]  Our brains, for a while, we're getting bigger.
[2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:43.440]  People have really big brains, tend to have a lot of wiring issues.
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.960]  So you know, there's a fine line between idiots of odds and, you know, people that
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:48.960]  are mentally retarded.
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  I'm not saying you're retarded.
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:50.960]  You're there, you're smart.
[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:52.920]  You make witty comments, but you don't get it.
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:53.920]  You don't connect.
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:55.200]  And you're not doing it as a jerk.
[2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:57.000]  You're just kind of in your own world.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:00.800]  And so I just, I was just hoping that we could try to help you out.
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:06.200]  Tony, maybe you can work with him and figure out some things he wants to report on.
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:09.440]  I'm not going to, I don't think it's a pearls before swine situation with you.
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:11.240]  I'd say back on the camera.
[2:55:11.240 --> 2:55:15.080]  Um, yeah, I want, I would like to, I would take up you up on that offer.
[2:55:15.080 --> 2:55:16.080]  I would do that with him.
[2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:17.640]  I would report for info wars.
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:18.640]  Here.
[2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:19.640]  I would love to do it.
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:21.880]  I, I don't want to be a public figure anymore.
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:25.320]  In fact, I'm thinking that this interview here may be ending my dialogue with the public,
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:26.320]  but, um, is it all right?
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:30.360]  What if I go with Tony and Tony does the actual recording?
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:32.200]  What if, can we, can we do that?
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:33.200]  Yeah.
[2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:35.200]  I mean, I think, I mean, I think that's an idea.
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:36.200]  Absolutely.
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:37.200]  Okay.
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:38.200]  So let's, let's do that.
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:41.920]  Let's, uh, if Tony, Tony's the, you know, the, the guy in the public, we'll work something
[2:55:41.920 --> 2:55:42.920]  out.
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:45.360]  Now we still got to have the fact that you're involved in it somehow, but yeah, no, I think
[2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:46.360]  that's reasonable.
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:49.400]  So you're negotiating and you're navigating things.
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:56.600]  I'll, I'll, I'll be, uh, a creative, I think, uh, you know, so I'll, I'll help.
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:55:57.600]  Yeah.
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:55:59.600]  A lot of times the reporter is, is creative.
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:00.600]  That's what you want.
[2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:01.600]  As reporters that operate on their own.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:02.600]  All right, guys.
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:03.600]  We'll talk to you soon.
[2:56:03.600 --> 2:56:04.600]  Thanks for coming on.
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:07.320]  We'll get a chapter two, hopefully next week.
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:09.280]  So if you want to come back with us, that'd be great.
[2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:10.920]  And, uh, we'll, uh, just move forward.
[2:56:10.920 --> 2:56:11.920]  So have a great weekend.
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:12.920]  Coming up.
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:13.920]  He's going to contact you.
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:14.920]  Pardon?
[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:16.920]  Tony's going to contact you.
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:17.920]  Say it again.
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:22.200]  Tony is going to contact Tony is going to contact you about what you want to talk to
[2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:24.200]  your, talk to your manager.
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:25.200]  All right.
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:30.800]  We'll start getting you limos, helicopters, everything on your own airplane, like a problem.
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:31.800]  Aircraft carriers.
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:32.800]  All right, guys.
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:38.000]  Hey, in fact, since that's his manager now, let me talk to, let me talk to Tony.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:39.400]  So let's get Tony's number.
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:40.400]  Thank you guys.
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:42.400]  I'll see you guys every great weekend.
[2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:47.520]  See, he's kind of a comic, he needs to go nationally as a comic.
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:49.600]  He's pretty funny.
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:52.240]  He's just nothing compared to people who make me pay for their sex changes and abortions.
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:53.240]  I'm sorry.
[2:56:53.240 --> 2:57:01.040]  I'm not going to hate the guy because he is, is, is, is, is, you know, someone of a dead
[2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:02.040]  beat.
[2:57:02.040 --> 2:57:03.040]  We'll see what happens.
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:06.520]  I'm trying not to be a dead beat, but the fight, Soros, the global is the whole new world
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:07.520]  order.
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  I need your funding.

[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:50.400]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:51.400]  Thanks for holding.
[2:57:51.400 --> 2:57:52.400]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.200]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:58:01.520]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and
[2:58:01.520 --> 2:58:05.840]  I had to load down the page on my dial-up into there, and I thought it was pretty cool, and
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:09.880]  read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests, and I've been
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:14.240]  using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then, I'm on
[2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:20.800]  the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body, it's all
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:21.800]  amazing.
[2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:22.800]  Thank you, brother.
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:26.840]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:31.240]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:36.360]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God, and I wanted to say that
[2:58:36.360 --> 2:58:41.800]  it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:42.800]  worldwide.
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:51.760]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[2:58:51.760 --> 2:58:56.240]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:57.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:57.600 --> 3:00:20.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:25.680]  We just had the main North Korean delegation leader meet at the White House after lining
[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:30.600]  it up with Pompeo yesterday that they are agreeing to unconditional denuclearization
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:35.480]  in exchange for economic boosting help and things like that.
[3:00:35.480 --> 3:00:36.480]  This is a big victory.
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:42.240]  We expected negotiations to go back and forth on all of this, and the media tried to enact
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:47.400]  like, oh, it's all derailed because it didn't happen right away, and cheerleading that this
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:54.000]  thing would all be off the rails because they've kept the Korean Peninsula in crisis for 60-plus
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  years.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:59.760]  This is June 12th summit with Kim Jong-un is back on.
[3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:03.040]  President Trump said Friday he will meet with Kim Jong-un in Singapore later this month
[3:01:03.040 --> 3:01:07.880]  after all ending more than a week of uncertainty about whether direct denuclearization talks
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:09.280]  would go on.
[3:01:09.280 --> 3:01:15.840]  He North Korean official Kim Jong-chul, who is sanctioned under the 2014 Sony cyber attack,
[3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:20.160]  talked to Trump in the Oval Office for more than an hour on Friday and delivered a letter
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:22.280]  from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
[3:01:22.280 --> 3:01:27.120]  In the letter, the head of the Communist dictatorship was expected to show interest in the meeting
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:32.760]  with Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, and basically agreed to go along with a basic
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:34.560]  framework where there won't be a meeting.
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:39.000]  Another one, the latest, Trump says June 12th summit back on, so that's going on.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:43.200]  Just recapping for Dr. Nick Baggis takes over and hosts today what we're going to be breaking
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:48.320]  down on the war room coming up at three o'clock with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone and everything
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:49.600]  else is happening.
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:53.520]  Comey Grilled is fed seriously considered charging McCabe and criminal referral.
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:55.480]  That's been reported in the Washington Post.
[3:01:55.480 --> 3:01:58.040]  We told you that back in March.
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:01:59.040]  So it's happening.
[3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:04.480]  Trey Gowdy, recent activity highlights a deep state action against Devon Nunez.
[3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:11.160]  Something has been increasingly weird about DOJ and FBI at releasing the two-page electronic
[3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:19.240]  communication that was written by CIA Director John Brennan to initiate the July 2016 counter-intelligence
[3:02:19.240 --> 3:02:23.640]  operation into the campaign of President and candidate Donald Trump.
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:28.120]  And then it just goes on to break down that there's something, according to the CIA Director
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:33.120]  John Brennan's testimony, he personally briefed the gang of eight members, including Devon
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:37.200]  Nunez individually, 2016 on the orientation document.
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:41.520]  As such, 2018 Devon Nunez would be only seeking a review of the document.
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:44.240]  He was already briefed on.
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:48.440]  It just doesn't make sense unless, well, unless the Brennan organization document and the
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:52.800]  briefing Brennan gave to the White House Intelligence Chairman Devon Nunez doesn't match, and that's
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:53.800]  the reason.
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:59.320]  And that goes on to show how Gowdy has worked to block all that and block the investigations
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:02.720]  of the FBI and block getting those documents out.
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:06.760]  Removing Nunez allows the placement in the controlled agent Gowdy, the DC process of
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:10.720]  putting strategic political person in the center of the known risk is very familiar.
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:14.000]  And it just goes into all the things Trey Gowdy has done.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:19.800]  It's a conservative freehouse breakdown of that is another one sources Trey Gowdy, big
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:23.840]  league politics, blocked investigation into the FBI.
[3:03:23.840 --> 3:03:28.800]  And then it goes over some of the background of that.
[3:03:28.800 --> 3:03:34.920]  A lot to digest there, but the good news is.
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:36.360]  Trump has turned the economy back on.
[3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:40.480]  He's definitely challenging the existing power structure that wants crisis, letting people
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:45.120]  have access to all these hidden treatments and cures that he's accelerated.
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:47.000]  That's a big one in my view.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:51.800]  But he needs to start talking about 5G vaccines, everything that is hitting us and attacking
[3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:52.800]  us.
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:55.520]  If you love your children, if you love your own life, we've got to look at the larger
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:01.320]  master plan and what's behind all this and Dr. Nick Begich, who pioneered exposing all
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:05.360]  of this is father of famous congressman, the dad mysteriously his brother, I was a U.S.
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:06.360]  Senator.
[3:04:06.360 --> 3:04:07.360]  We don't know that.
[3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:10.440]  We don't know that because you need to find out earthpulse.com is the website where the
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:14.280]  next to Susan on earlier that interview is going up on info wars.com and the next to
[3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:18.480]  Susan gives exclusive details of just conversations with Trump and being pardoned.
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:21.720]  That just went up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[3:04:21.720 --> 3:04:24.560]  So we'll come back with Dr. Nick Begich on the other side.
[3:04:24.560 --> 3:04:27.960]  He'll be hosting the rest of this transmission.

[3:04:54.560 --> 3:04:58.400]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:02.920]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[3:05:02.920 --> 3:05:08.360]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:13.760]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:15.280]  to unhealthy levels.
[3:05:15.280 --> 3:05:21.800]  To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:25.800]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:27.680]  in the rainwater.
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:32.520]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:38.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[3:05:38.600 --> 3:05:44.560]  As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned
[3:05:44.560 --> 3:05:50.800]  is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply, but more importantly
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:06:06.120]  a good water filtration system will purify it.
[3:06:06.120 --> 3:06:14.160]  Live from Austin Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:14.160 --> 3:06:17.360]  The world is at a crossroads deciding its future.
[3:06:17.360 --> 3:06:21.560]  The globalist deep state eugenicist, the social engineers have decided they want to post human
[3:06:21.560 --> 3:06:22.560]  future.
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:28.720]  Dr. Nick Begat is a leading not futurist, but he is a futurist, but at the same time reverse
[3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:32.080]  engineering from their own documents, their own patents, their own admissions, the master
[3:06:32.080 --> 3:06:33.080]  plan.
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:36.760]  So we're trying to get a nationalist beach head, we're trying to have free market that
[3:06:36.760 --> 3:06:40.520]  gives us some choice, we're just trying to get basic things turned back on.
[3:06:40.520 --> 3:06:42.440]  But what's at the bottom of the swamp?
[3:06:42.440 --> 3:06:45.120]  What's behind the swamp?
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:48.560]  Those will be an intriguing 54 minutes we have left.
[3:06:48.560 --> 3:06:50.520]  Dr. Nick Begat, please take over.
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:51.520]  Thanks for being with us.
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:53.040]  Thanks for having me.
[3:06:53.040 --> 3:06:59.600]  You know it's great to be substituting a little bit here and there and stepping in for Alex
[3:06:59.600 --> 3:07:06.760]  and there are so many issues that we can get into and I want to talk about because today
[3:07:06.760 --> 3:07:11.840]  we get the jobs report, we've got some of the best economic news ever and I want to
[3:07:11.840 --> 3:07:16.800]  talk a little bit about what's going on in Alaska from the standpoint of resources and
[3:07:16.800 --> 3:07:20.400]  what it means for the country right now.
[3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:28.920]  You know Alaska represents 18% of all of the land in the United States, 18% and yet we
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:34.600]  have here about three quarters of a million people scattered over that landscape.
[3:07:34.600 --> 3:07:41.000]  Most of it's inaccessible and yet we are in fact the treasure house of the nation and
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:45.360]  I want to get into that a little bit today to put some of this in perspective against
[3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:48.280]  the backdrop of multinationals.
[3:07:48.280 --> 3:07:54.960]  What's happening right now with China's look at Alaska as a resource, really colony if
[3:07:54.960 --> 3:08:00.000]  you will, in the way we've been treated both in the United States and elsewhere.
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:03.560]  When you look at the coastline of Alaska, which is up on the screen right now, you can
[3:08:03.560 --> 3:08:11.880]  see Alaska's coastline is bigger than the east, west and Gulf Coast of the continental
[3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:13.720]  United States combined.
[3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:19.720]  We stretch almost all the way to Japan and almost touching Russia, if you can see it.
[3:08:19.720 --> 3:08:24.800]  At one point we're only 40 miles apart when you get up into the straits.
[3:08:24.800 --> 3:08:31.960]  So you've got a 2,000 mile long Aleutian chain going from Anchorage to Southeast Alaska.
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:37.880]  You have almost 1,500 miles and from Anchorage to the top of the state, 700 miles.
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:40.920]  So huge, huge areas.
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:46.000]  When you think of the coastal areas of Alaska as a resource, again, bigger than the east,
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:54.440]  west and Gulf Coast of the United States combined is Alaska with a 200 mile economic limit for
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:58.480]  the federal government and a three mile economic limit for the state of Alaska.
[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:02.800]  Now what does that mean when you think about resources?
[3:09:02.800 --> 3:09:08.640]  Alaska has half of the known coal resources in the world.
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:18.640]  We have a huge hydrocarbon base, both in natural gas and oil on the north slope of Alaska.
[3:09:18.640 --> 3:09:24.360]  In fact, the northern region of Alaska above the Brooks Range stretching out into the ocean
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:30.240]  almost all the way to the north pole is one of the last great oil and gas basins in the
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:31.240]  world.
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:36.720]  In the last couple of years, major discoveries have been made and are being made on the north
[3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:37.800]  slope of Alaska.
[3:09:37.800 --> 3:09:44.800]  That will add even greater to the ability of the US to be a net exporter of oil and gas,
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:48.360]  which we currently are quickly approaching.
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:52.720]  That changes the dynamic of everything when you're looking into the rest of the world.
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:09:58.560]  Do you know in Alaska, we have no gas line yet built after 40 years of operating an oil
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:09:59.560]  pipeline.
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:04.160]  We have no gas line to bring gas from the north slope of Alaska into the Pacific Rim,
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:08.200]  the biggest, most expanding markets in the world.
[3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:14.880]  Natural resources in our state comprise the biggest base left in the country.
[3:10:14.880 --> 3:10:20.840]  We have every strategic mineral in minable quantities here and some of the biggest mines
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:26.480]  operating in the world here, and most Americans don't even know it.
[3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:31.800]  When you look at the natural resource base, and I want to get into the history of that,
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:36.560]  because that's what led to the very beginnings of our state.
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:42.080]  When you go back in time to the very first fur traders, the Russian fur traders that
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:47.440]  came into the Aleutian chain, they enslaved the indigenous there and turned them into
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:48.920]  trappers.
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:55.160]  All of that that was essentially wiped out was shipped into China and in Asia back in
[3:10:55.160 --> 3:11:02.000]  the 17 and early 1800s until the Russians theoretically exhausted what was here.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:09.680]  In the late, in middle 1800s, the United States was moving west, and we were taking up the
[3:11:09.680 --> 3:11:11.520]  western states.
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:17.840]  In Canada was competing for Alaska, Russia had a foothold here, but the czar was weak,
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:22.120]  and at that time they made a deal with the United States, it was called the Treaty of
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:28.160]  Secession, 1867 we took possession of the state of Alaska, two cents an acre, a little
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:29.960]  over seven million bucks.
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:32.080]  We bought the whole program here.
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:36.880]  Now there's a lot of dispute about that, we're not going to get into that today, maybe another
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:39.280]  time we'll get into some of that history.
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:47.200]  But to talk about the next stage, sort of what happened after 1867, it was in 1898 that
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:55.840]  gold was beginning to be discovered in the Klondike, it led to a huge rush into Alaska.
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:12:02.400]  Shortly thereafter, again in the late 1800s, right in that same time frame, copper was
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:09.400]  discovered in the McCarthy region of Alaska, which attracted the attention then of one
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:15.400]  of the big globalists operating at that time, the Guggenheim family, and they came here
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:22.400]  essentially to develop copper resources while the gold rush moved through Alaska, lasting
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:25.440]  into really the 19, late 1930s.
[3:12:25.440 --> 3:12:31.040]  And Dr. just briefly throwing this in, this is part of the economic sabotage of America
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:35.400]  that we have this giant area using the false left and fake environmentalists to not let
[3:12:35.400 --> 3:12:38.240]  us have access to it as part of the strategic plan.
[3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:39.880]  They admit that, please continue.
[3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:41.880]  Yeah, that is exactly correct.
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:46.440]  In fact, I want to get into the politics of this because this is a fundamental sort of
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:49.960]  framework to bring this all into focus.
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:55.240]  So coming out of that period, eventually we reached a point in the 1950s where there was
[3:12:55.240 --> 3:12:58.280]  a huge push for statehood.
[3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:04.560]  I was actually born in the territory of Alaska just prior to statehood.
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:09.000]  And when looking at sort of what was happening then, there was a lot of unresolved issues.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:13.480]  The indigenous issue had not been solved, land titles had not been solved.
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:17.080]  I mean, Alaska was a mess in the late 50s.
[3:13:17.080 --> 3:13:22.440]  At that time, the Congress agreed that Alaska and Hawaii would come in at the same time.
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:26.560]  And the reason for that is they wanted to maintain a balance in the U.S. Senate.
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:28.600]  At that time, Hawaii was conservative.
[3:13:28.600 --> 3:13:33.200]  I mean, they believed they would elect Republican U.S. senators.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:38.200]  The Alaska was on the Democratic side, and they knew we would elect Democratic senators,
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:42.800]  which is exactly what in fact happened, and we became a state.
[3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:47.840]  From that point forward, and what led to that was the discovery of oil and gas and cook
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:51.080]  in the region I live in today.
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:56.760]  What happened then is the battle began for settling the indigenous issues.
[3:13:56.760 --> 3:14:05.640]  And in trying to settle those indigenous issues here in Alaska, that just was lawsuits, everything
[3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:11.040]  was happening, and then they discovered oil in Prudeau Bay, the biggest oil discovery
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:14.880]  in modern history in terms of the United States.
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:20.600]  And that set the stage, because without a clear title to the pipeline corridor, it would
[3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:27.160]  never get financed, it would never get built, and that's the stage that was set for my father's
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:30.760]  move from the state Senate into the United States Congress.
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:33.480]  And that was back in the early 1970s.
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:41.080]  My dad was elected to the 92nd Congress, which was in fact the Congress that settled the
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:45.960]  Native Land Claims Settlement Act, the biggest settlement for Native peoples in the history
[3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:54.080]  of the United States, over 44 million acres and over just under a billion dollars in cash,
[3:14:54.080 --> 3:14:57.680]  which in 1971 was an incredible amount of money.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:02.400]  Now those regional, what they set up is a regional corporation structure with Native
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:09.120]  villages under it, and they got priority selection of the lands throughout the state based on
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:11.400]  the historical use of the land.
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:16.000]  And this included the surface estate, the air rights, the timber rights, the mineral
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  rights, and the energy rights.
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:25.440]  And this really transferred a tremendous, the biggest private transfer of wealth back
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:30.240]  to an indigenous population on a new platform of possibilities.
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:34.760]  The multinationals really didn't like this idea and hooked into this.
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:40.360]  My dad's freshman year in the Congress, he overrode the chairman and setting the stage
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:44.760]  for what would happen next in the hack up of Alaska's resources.
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:45.760]  We're headed for break.
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:53.520]  This is Dr. Nick Beggage standing in for Alex Jones.

[3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:05.160]  government ever.
[3:16:05.160 --> 3:16:10.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:11.000]  a shadow government.

[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:58.800]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:18:58.800 --> 3:19:03.520]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:05.040]  to detoxify the body.
[3:19:05.040 --> 3:19:09.920]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:11.440]  It's made in the USA.
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:16.360]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:18.200]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.

[3:19:20.440 --> 3:19:24.960]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:29.600]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:30.600]  get.

[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:44.080]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:19:44.080 --> 3:19:46.840]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[3:19:50.120 --> 3:20:15.520]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:19.960]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:19.960 --> 3:20:28.760]  Welcome back InfoWars.
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:33.720]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm standing in for Alex Jones for the last hour of the show
[3:20:33.720 --> 3:20:39.800]  today and we're talking about natural resources as they relate to the nation and what's happening
[3:20:39.800 --> 3:20:45.760]  here in Alaska because it's really so far removed from so much of the country that much
[3:20:45.760 --> 3:20:48.520]  of what we're doing here is being missed.
[3:20:48.520 --> 3:20:53.800]  Where we left off just before the break was my dad's legislation when he was in the Congress,
[3:20:53.800 --> 3:20:55.360]  the Native Land Claims Settlement Act.
[3:20:55.360 --> 3:21:01.520]  Now as a freshman, my dad went around to every single congressional office and convinced
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:05.840]  his colleagues that this was an important issue and one that needed to be resolved in
[3:21:05.840 --> 3:21:07.840]  the national interest.
[3:21:07.840 --> 3:21:12.680]  Settling the Native Land Claims allowed for a quarter to be established for the Trans
[3:21:12.680 --> 3:21:19.120]  Alaska Pipeline, one of the significant resource developments in the nation's history.
[3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:24.520]  What also happened is they were going into the resources, resources was chaired by Mo
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:31.320]  Udall and Mo Udall was opposed actually to getting this thing through and my dad was
[3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:36.160]  able to get the committee to override the chairman and get this thing out to the floor
[3:21:36.160 --> 3:21:41.880]  to be voted on at a certain point but in that compromise what happened is a section was added
[3:21:41.880 --> 3:21:48.440]  called Section D2 and D2 established parks, preserves, wilderness areas, all this kind
[3:21:48.440 --> 3:21:53.160]  of stuff as supposedly the final deal.
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:59.000]  This was going to be the final taking and yet we've seen historically since this time
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  we've continually been picked our pockets and the nation's pockets picked the last
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:08.960]  being Obama in his last attempt to shut down chunks of our state.
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:16.480]  Now why is this important to Alaska is because in the Statehood Act 1958 when the act passed
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:24.120]  it gave Alaska 90% of the rents and royalties under federal land was to come to this state
[3:22:24.120 --> 3:22:30.720]  and in exchange for that we gave up the majority of our land to the federal government.
[3:22:30.720 --> 3:22:36.000]  When the Constitution at the national level says military installations, post offices,
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:40.800]  the basic operations of government and the rest was to remain with states, well we didn't
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:41.960]  get that deal.
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:46.520]  The deal we got here in Alaska was we wouldn't get the land titles but we'd get some of
[3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:52.360]  the resource value under it and then we found out when this was challenged during the time
[3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:57.760]  of Ted Stevens and after my father's tenure they actually challenged this all the way
[3:22:57.760 --> 3:23:04.120]  up to the US Supreme Court when there was an argument over opening up ANWAR, an area
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:10.360]  of the North Slope that's been the National Naval Petroleum Reserve since the 1950s.
[3:23:10.360 --> 3:23:15.960]  This has been untapped known oil and gas reserves that have been locked up on the North Slope
[3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:21.440]  of Alaska to the objection of most Alaskans and if the nation knew everybody else around
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:27.680]  here because what this did is they fought for it, they got a little bit of it open but
[3:23:27.680 --> 3:23:32.000]  the federal government said oh we're not going to give you 90%, we're only going to
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:38.400]  give you half, well we find out when we went to the US Supreme Court that you know what
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:45.480]  a statehood act is worth about the same thing as an 1880s Native American treaty because
[3:23:45.480 --> 3:23:50.800]  essentially the will of Congress can change that act at any time that has no validity
[3:23:50.800 --> 3:23:53.240]  any more than the next act of Congress.
[3:23:53.240 --> 3:24:00.360]  So we were stripped again of resources intended to go to people that live here and we understand
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:06.120]  how the game is played, those are the rules unfortunately, tribal governments and the
[3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:10.520]  tribes have a different standing, they're actually recognized as domestic nations and
[3:24:10.520 --> 3:24:17.280]  this can't happen to them, at least not at this point in our history which is I think
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:18.800]  a good thing.
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:24.760]  But looking again at what's going on within this context, D2 set up these parks and preserves
[3:24:24.760 --> 3:24:30.280]  and I was one of the last, in fact I was the last hard-rack miner in a place called Cantitional
[3:24:30.280 --> 3:24:35.200]  Alaska which is just north of what used to be known as Mount McKinley and is now recognized
[3:24:35.200 --> 3:24:41.440]  as Mount Denali and the northern part of what is now the park was one of the richest mineral
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:48.880]  deposits in the history of Alaska and one of the only known commercially viable projects
[3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:54.720]  for an ore called anemone but it also produced lead, silver, anemone, gold and a number of
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:24:58.600]  other metals and rare earth minerals.
[3:24:58.600 --> 3:25:04.840]  This district was completely shut down in 1983 was the last year, that was the last
[3:25:04.840 --> 3:25:10.760]  year that I was able to operate out there and when it was shut down the land was confiscated
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:17.720]  over the valuation by independent contractors was 130 million minimum just to buy the estates
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:24.160]  and the federal government settled with these guys for 3 million, spurring one of the longest
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:32.160]  bankruptcies in U.S. history, 22 years by the owners of the Gold King mine in Glen Creek
[3:25:32.160 --> 3:25:37.720]  of Cantitional but all of this then again what was really going on, you know the Rockefeller
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:43.200]  Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation fueled this environmental push to lock up these
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:47.800]  lands and everyone was going, gee you know the industrialists have changed their minds,
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:54.120]  no they didn't, all of that public land was open for mineral location by any American
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:59.120]  citizen, anyone listening to this broadcast that resides as a citizen of the United States
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:06.000]  could come up here, make a discovery and stake that land and lay claim to it under the mining
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:13.480]  acts of the late 1800s and moving into this last century, this was the law of the land
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:19.760]  but by locking it up in parks and preserves they essentially said, nope this is a safety
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:25.600]  deposit box of multinationals because I can tell you when the rest of the world throws
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:31.360]  the countries, our country out in terms of producing or in the case of rare earth minerals
[3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:37.000]  which we'll get into after the next break, these are strategic right now and this has
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:43.400]  become the safety deposit box for multinationals and how they operate in Alaska because what
[3:26:43.400 --> 3:26:47.760]  will eventually occur is there will be a national emergency, they will suspend the
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:52.480]  environmental regulations in these parks and preserves and they will invite the biggest
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:26:57.560]  companies in the world to bid because they'll be on the quick speed, save the nation calendar
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:03.640]  and all these guys will be brought in to exploit what the small miner once owned in this state
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:11.120]  was taken from them, this is a repeat formula around the world, lock it up, set it aside
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:14.640]  and then go exploit the markets that are a little easier, the ones that are already
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:20.120]  so corrupted that you can go and exploit the resources for nothing until those countries
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:25.200]  throw them out and then you have the safety deposit box set up and buried in the native
[3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:32.160]  land claims and later the D2 legislation of the early 19 or actually the 1976 going into
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:39.000]  1980 which came out of the Carter administration which was part of this same scheme to lock
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:44.920]  up the nation's resources in favor of multinational companies at some future date.
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:50.960]  Now we have a different president, a different way of going at the resources and what resources
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:56.280]  we hold in common, most people do not know that the treasury of the nation is here,
[3:27:56.280 --> 3:28:02.560]  we have enough natural resources in Alaska if we were developing them to retire the national
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:08.960]  debt not on the backs of the American taxpayer but by looking at the balance sheet, the resources
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:15.280]  that we hold in common that are not being developed that are being sidestepped in favor
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:20.920]  of strategies that are not national strategies but are strategies for multinational companies
[3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:26.280]  looking to steal the resources as has been the history in Alaska for over a hundred
[3:28:26.280 --> 3:28:30.280]  years going back even further to the time of the Russians.
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:35.920]  This is the time we need a railroad, a transportation system that will support it and after the
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:40.560]  break I want to get into some of the rare earths and some of the impedances to progress
[3:28:40.560 --> 3:28:43.360]  that would bring minerals back into the Midwest.
[3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:47.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and standing in for Alex today, I'm Dr. Nick

[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:09.440]  Some of them are 50% off, some 25% off, but take a look at the site, support Alex Jones
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:14.920]  and the work that he does and we're doing together to get the word out on the very important
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:18.280]  issues that affect the nation and in fact affect the world.
[3:34:18.280 --> 3:34:21.520]  We're sitting in the best economy ever.
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:25.640]  You know, we have opportunities to do some things and, you know, health products are
[3:34:25.640 --> 3:34:31.320]  a big part of the network now and an important way to support Alex and support yourself.
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:37.560]  Strong bodies, strong minds and the next revolution is the revolution that we carry out in changing
[3:34:37.560 --> 3:34:45.320]  the face of the country with Infowars.com, support Alex in every way that you can.
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:50.920]  Moving back into the meat of the story, okay, so D2, the section of law finally in the Carter
[3:34:50.920 --> 3:34:54.520]  administration gets passed.
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:35:02.440]  It moves forward, 1980, the land selections begin and the robbery starts.
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:05.520]  All of these resources that were locked up, look at the areas.
[3:35:05.520 --> 3:35:11.720]  I have an inholding by way of disclosure in one of the biggest, in fact, the biggest national
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:17.720]  park in the United States, Wrangles St. Elias National Park sits on the Canadian border.
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:21.680]  In the middle of that, I have an inholding and it's a minerals inholding that was originally
[3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:25.560]  staked in 1898 and subsequently patented.
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:30.000]  So I own a surface estate, a mineral rights, water rights, all the rights that run with
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  that land.
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:35.640]  Now, when you look at where that's situated, it's in the Kennecott mineral belt.
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:41.680]  Many people know the name Kennecott as one of the biggest copper producers in the world.
[3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:46.800]  Kennecott started in Alaska as a Guggenheim project.
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:50.760]  The Guggenheims originally came to the United States from Europe.
[3:35:50.760 --> 3:35:53.080]  They were originally in New York.
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:57.960]  They sold something called a black polish that they used on stovepipes.
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:36:03.080]  If you think about stovepipes from wood stoves back in those days, they later invested in
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:09.160]  lead and silver and copper deposits in Colorado, made their fortune there and came to Alaska
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:17.600]  and bought what turned into the richest copper mine ever in Alaska.
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:24.360]  In fact, they built the railroad and before the railroad ever reached this deposit, they
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:28.920]  had enough ore stockpile where the first train loadout paid for the program.
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:29.920]  It was unbelievable.
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:31.920]  It went on to be developed.
[3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:34.920]  Eventually, the Guggenheims left Alaska.
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:39.680]  They had not very many people living here, no labor force, and they discovered copper
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:40.680]  and chili.
[3:36:40.680 --> 3:36:44.800]  They literally pulled up the railroad track and took it with them so nobody else would
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:48.560]  develop copper in the Wrangles St. Elias region.
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:55.160]  Now, in that region are also major cobalt deposits, gold deposits.
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:57.960]  Many of the rare earths are found there.
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:02.200]  Bolvers of cobalt right now is $40 a pound.
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:07.160]  Bolvers the size of cars laying on the ground was not uncommon.
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:14.160]  We found not only the turn of the century in the 1800s, but also as late as the 1980s
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:17.600]  and 90s when this land was being locked up.
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:19.880]  So new discoveries are not allowed.
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:22.280]  Their new staking is not allowed there.
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:27.120]  Most of the historic properties have been acquired by the park as they choked off the
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:30.920]  possibilities of economic development in many of these areas.
[3:37:30.920 --> 3:37:37.160]  But again, what happened here were fights over natural resources behind the small miner.
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:42.040]  The kind of guys you see on these TV programs they have on the air now, there were hundreds
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:43.040]  of miners.
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:49.360]  I was growing up in the last era of the small miner where a person with the backbone to
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:53.800]  get up and walk into the wilderness still had a chance to make a valuable discovery
[3:37:53.800 --> 3:37:55.000]  and do something with it.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:56.240]  And that still exists today.
[3:37:56.240 --> 3:38:01.200]  I mean, if you have the courage of it and the strength, the character to do it, there
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:05.720]  are federal lands and state lands where you can still are open to mineral location within
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:06.720]  our region.
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:09.800]  But let's talk about what's been discovered here.
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:16.360]  In Southeast Alaska, Heklamining discovered what's called Greens Creek.
[3:38:16.360 --> 3:38:21.520]  And Greens Creek is the 10th largest silver producer in the world.
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:27.920]  It operates on Tidewater at Tidewater, it's got another 10 to 15 years in ore body that
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:35.040]  has been identified there, substantial project that's been operating for decades.
[3:38:35.040 --> 3:38:41.560]  If you take a look near Nome, Alaska, this is closer to the Russian side of our world.
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:50.280]  If you look up at Nome, Alaska, you'll see an area in the mine run by Tech Kaminko called
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:51.280]  Red Dog.
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:55.640]  So Red Dog is a lead zinc mine, primarily zinc.
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:02.040]  It's responsible for providing 6% of the zinc concentrates in the world.
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:09.600]  And this port that they built to facilitate Red Dog is a port that you can't even use
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:17.360]  six months a year because the ocean is frozen, literally frozen, but they still produce 6%
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:21.440]  in a half a year shipping season of the world's zinc.
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:25.960]  Now surrounding that area, and if you look at the holdings of Tech Kaminko in the area,
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:31.320]  a major portion of that flows through the native corporation, going back to the native
[3:39:31.320 --> 3:39:38.440]  land claims that my dad enacted, in fact, $74 million of their last year's revenue went
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:42.440]  to native organizations and the state in the form of corporate taxes.
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:48.240]  The corporate tax was about 9% and the most of it, a royalty of, I believe it's now 25,
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:54.040]  it might even be 30% is going to the native organization that has control of the surface
[3:39:54.040 --> 3:39:57.120]  of state and the mineral rights to the Red Dog mine.
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:01.880]  And with that, it just doesn't support that one indigenous group and the people of the
[3:40:01.880 --> 3:40:03.360]  state of Alaska.
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:07.480]  This place generates federal taxes that also flow through.
[3:40:07.480 --> 3:40:10.120]  Now there's some things in the federal tax code.
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:14.120]  We don't have time to get into today in a future broadcast, and I'm going to be standing
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:20.560]  in again next Friday on the same hour for Alex, we'll get into some of the tax consequences
[3:40:20.560 --> 3:40:25.360]  and why the mineral industry is so excited about what's going on here.
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:29.980]  But I also mentioned just before the break, I wanted to get into the choke hold, if you
[3:40:29.980 --> 3:40:32.100]  will, is shipping.
[3:40:32.100 --> 3:40:37.280]  If you look at a roadmap of Alaska, you're going to find out really quickly, there are
[3:40:37.280 --> 3:40:46.960]  no roads, there are no roads in Alaska, there's very limited railroads in Alaska and as a consequence,
[3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:50.120]  we literally cannot get anywhere.
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:55.880]  And here's the situation that has happened in our neighbor to the south, Canada and British
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:58.760]  Columbia and the Northwest Territories.
[3:40:58.760 --> 3:41:03.500]  What they have done is gradually punch the railroad further and further north as their
[3:41:03.500 --> 3:41:06.040]  developmental footprint has moved north.
[3:41:06.040 --> 3:41:10.800]  If you look environmentally on how they balance both the development of the northern regions
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:17.680]  of British Columbia and the Northwest Territories, you will see a harmonic balance between the
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:23.120]  environment, fish and game resources, the indigenous populations that weigh in on these
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:28.720]  issues in a meaningful way in Canada, and you see the railroad moving north.
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:34.920]  We need that railroad to connect with the existing Alaska railroad to move resources,
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:40.520]  riches, railroads to riches, is what this nation needs to move those resources out of
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:46.160]  Alaska through Canada into the industrial rust belt of the United States.
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:50.820]  What you see on the map in front of you is the pipeline quarter, which is a road straight
[3:41:50.820 --> 3:41:54.960]  to the north slope, and that's the end of the railroad and railroad matrix coming out
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:41:55.960]  of Alaska.
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:42:02.440]  If you look at western Alaska, empty space, a treasure house that you can't even reach.
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:07.480]  One of the big mines going in that's in its advanced state of programming will be in one
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:09.920]  of those big, empty spaces.
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:11.680]  It's called the Donlan Mine.
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:16.760]  It's going to be a five and a half billion dollar private sector investment, which will
[3:42:16.760 --> 3:42:23.480]  include a 350 mile railroad and gas pipeline from the Cook Inlet headed into interior
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:29.520]  Alaska to open up what will become one of the biggest gold mines owned both by private
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:34.560]  companies and native organizations that are developing these resources in the nation's
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:35.560]  interests.
[3:42:35.560 --> 3:42:36.560]  Think about this.
[3:42:36.560 --> 3:42:40.520]  After the break, we're going to get back into the resource issues and the robbery of
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:46.120]  the country and how to get that wealth moved into jobs and into building an industry at
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:50.080]  a time when we are seeing America become great again.
[3:42:50.080 --> 3:42:53.640]  Our resource, our treasuries are on our fingertips.
[3:42:53.640 --> 3:42:57.440]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[3:42:57.440 --> 3:43:02.000]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:07.400]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:12.800]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:14.320]  to unhealthy levels.
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:20.840]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:24.840]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:26.240]  in the rainwater.
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:31.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:37.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[3:43:37.600 --> 3:43:43.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[3:43:43.240 --> 3:43:48.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:53.520]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:59.360]  InfowarsLife and InfowarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:03.120]  Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.

[3:45:58.280 --> 3:46:03.240]  Years ago, InfowarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[3:46:03.240 --> 3:46:04.240]  yeast.
[3:46:04.240 --> 3:46:07.800]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[3:46:07.800 --> 3:46:11.640]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:16.840]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[3:46:16.840 --> 3:46:20.440]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[3:46:48.880 --> 3:47:16.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:16.720 --> 3:47:22.880]  Welcome back, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and this is Dr. Nick Begich.
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:27.720]  I'm standing in for Alex today, we're talking about mineral issues in Alaska, why it's important
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:28.720]  for the nation.
[3:47:28.720 --> 3:47:34.160]  Again, I want to go back to a couple of points I mentioned earlier, 18% of the land in the
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:36.120]  United States is in Alaska.
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:42.160]  We have about 750,000 people that live here scattered across all that land.
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:47.280]  We have a bigger coastline than the Gulf Coast, West Coast, and East Coast of the rest of
[3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:49.680]  the United States combined.
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:54.760]  This area as a treasury, and we covered last segment a little bit about sort of the choke
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:59.880]  points in terms of transporting things out, and when we left on to the break, I was talking
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:02.840]  about the Donlan mine, which is a gold prospect.
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:11.440]  It's going to be a $5.5 billion investment, a 350-mile gas pipeline from Cook Inlet with
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:16.920]  a parallel road alongside of it, and all of the villages currently fueled by diesel will
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:23.320]  have access for the first time to economic, valuable energy resources produced in our
[3:48:23.320 --> 3:48:24.680]  region of the state.
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:29.600]  Now, Donlan Creek as a mine has a tremendous need for energy.
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:36.160]  It's going to require 125 megawatts of power to run it.
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:42.280]  Now think about 125 megawatts from Alaska's perspective, that's as much power as our
[3:48:42.280 --> 3:48:48.200]  second largest city, Fairbanks, uses at the peak of the season in the winter.
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:54.800]  So one mine is going to require that kind of energy, and Alaska has the energy available.
[3:48:54.800 --> 3:48:59.600]  In fact, next time we're on, I'll try and get the map together that was used during
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:05.080]  the D2 debate to show you the oil and gas basins within the state.
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:11.440]  It will blow you away at how much of this state has been locked up, and yet has the
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:18.200]  potential for generating energy useful right on the spot for minerals development, again
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:20.520]  within the nation's interest.
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:24.880]  One of the big issues too with native lands that are scattered around the state now are
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:29.840]  trespass, where people come in and exploit their resources without permission.
[3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:34.040]  And I can tell you, Native Americans in Alaska and the rest of the nation are a little bit
[3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:35.600]  tired of that.
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:38.920]  We have settlements that need to be honored and respected.
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:42.000]  And roads are not the right answer for Alaska.
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:47.160]  Railroads, that's how you develop things, and you also control those quarters.
[3:49:47.160 --> 3:49:52.480]  So you don't have every Winnebago trespassing on private land, but rail, bringing people
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:53.480]  through.
[3:49:53.480 --> 3:49:55.560]  People say, well, rail is so much more expensive.
[3:49:55.560 --> 3:50:02.840]  Yeah, but railroads, people at least offset some of that public expense by paying fees
[3:50:02.840 --> 3:50:06.640]  for riding and moving across those rail lines.
[3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:09.400]  Now the rail system here used to be owned by the federal government.
[3:50:09.400 --> 3:50:12.000]  They actually turned it over to the state of Alaska.
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:16.040]  We own the railroad that is here now and the quarters.
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:22.160]  But to expand that as the underlying infrastructure, as in the national interest today, should
[3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:24.040]  be a national issue.
[3:50:24.040 --> 3:50:28.800]  We should be bringing that railroad into these areas that have the minerals potential.
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:33.320]  And then linking it with the Canadian rail system, we could begin to move these resources
[3:50:33.320 --> 3:50:39.720]  directly into the rust belt of the nation and reactivate these refineries, the mills,
[3:50:39.720 --> 3:50:45.880]  the production, the industrial capacity with not imported natural resources, but with our
[3:50:45.880 --> 3:50:47.120]  own.
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:53.640]  Having a significant effect on trade balances for the nation, again boosting the U.S. side
[3:50:53.640 --> 3:50:54.640]  of the economy.
[3:50:54.640 --> 3:51:01.080]  And we can be a net exporter, in fact, Alaska exports tremendous amount in the Pacific Rim
[3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:08.520]  in terms of fish, timber, and natural resources, most of which are headed into China and Asia.
[3:51:08.520 --> 3:51:14.640]  And if you look again on the map of the world, you know, the closest places when you look
[3:51:14.640 --> 3:51:17.880]  at transport routes moving to the Pacific.
[3:51:17.880 --> 3:51:23.960]  And then as the Arctic opens up, because the fact is climate is changing, it's not going
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:29.120]  to change any differently the other way, if models are correct.
[3:51:29.120 --> 3:51:34.640]  We will have ice-free ports on the north slope of Alaska for a large portion of the year,
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:40.680]  allowing us to ship resources from Alaska directly over the poles into the European
[3:51:40.680 --> 3:51:42.400]  markets as well.
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:48.000]  So Alaska sits at the crossroads of the world, and you know the two biggest air freight carriers
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:52.040]  in the world realized it, and most people don't know this.
[3:51:52.040 --> 3:51:57.480]  Fairbanks, Alaska is the international air hub for UPS.
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:52:04.720]  Now, when you look at Anchorage, it is the international air hub for Federal Express.
[3:52:04.720 --> 3:52:09.280]  Anchorage Airport, International Airport is one of the busiest cargo ports in the world
[3:52:09.280 --> 3:52:14.440]  because if you put Alaska on the top of the globe and then look at the populations of
[3:52:14.440 --> 3:52:21.040]  Asia and Europe surrounding us, we are in the ideal place for equal transport distances
[3:52:21.040 --> 3:52:25.920]  to all the key markets on the planet except our own.
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:32.880]  We need a railroad to take us into the Midwest, to take us into the Rust Belt, to change the
[3:52:32.880 --> 3:52:36.440]  dimension of what we can do with our own raw resources.
[3:52:36.440 --> 3:52:42.520]  We need a gas line that moves from the north slope of Alaska to tide water to bring liquefied
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:48.440]  natural gas products over into Asia, into the west coast of the United States.
[3:52:48.440 --> 3:52:52.280]  The fuel of the future is going to be natural gas.
[3:52:52.280 --> 3:52:53.960]  It's the transitional fuel.
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:53:01.680]  We have huge, huge trillions and trillions and trillions with a T cubic feet of natural
[3:53:01.680 --> 3:53:03.960]  gas on the north slope of Alaska.
[3:53:03.960 --> 3:53:09.720]  The pipeline itself is running at one quarter of its capacity, and yet we have oil fields
[3:53:09.720 --> 3:53:14.520]  coming online that will bring that up, and I predict, and you've heard it here, within
[3:53:14.520 --> 3:53:19.120]  five years, you're going to see that pipeline double its productive capacity based on what's
[3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:22.560]  been discovered in the last five years on the north slope.
[3:53:22.560 --> 3:53:27.560]  We need a progressive, aggressive view of developing resources.
[3:53:27.560 --> 3:53:33.000]  Alaska has the tightest restrictions in terms of environmental safeguards at the state and
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.760]  certainly then at the national level.
[3:53:35.760 --> 3:53:39.480]  My younger brother, Tom, is in the state, sent it here.
[3:53:39.480 --> 3:53:43.360]  I can tell you he's on the total level side of the equation.
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:48.640]  We're so opposite on so many levels, but when it comes to developmental issues, this is
[3:53:48.640 --> 3:53:54.120]  a place where Democrats and Republicans, at least in my state, come together because it
[3:53:54.120 --> 3:53:59.560]  is so important, and on the screen now is a Donlan mind in the environmental studies
[3:53:59.560 --> 3:54:00.760]  from that.
[3:54:00.760 --> 3:54:06.160]  This is going to transfer again, huge wealth into the state, to the native corporations
[3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:13.240]  that gets redistributed, 30% of the resources that minerals develop, and oil and gas develops
[3:54:13.240 --> 3:54:19.640]  for natives, stays with that native group, and the rest is spread, the other 70% over
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:24.360]  the native organizations across the state, to sort of balance, it was part of the native
[3:54:24.360 --> 3:54:29.640]  land claim settlement, to balance the value of wealth where one group maybe had a huge
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:31.640]  advantage over some other group.
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:39.040]  This gave a way to distribute it fairly among the original populations of Alaska, and most
[3:54:39.040 --> 3:54:42.400]  people don't even consider the native populations here.
[3:54:42.400 --> 3:54:51.920]  You know, in the United States, there's 458 native recognized domestic tribal nations.
[3:54:51.920 --> 3:54:59.440]  Half are in Alaska, half of the tribal nations are in my state, and yet most Americans don't
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:02.880]  have a clue, and these weren't people that we warred against.
[3:55:02.880 --> 3:55:05.400]  These are people who weren't conquered, in most cases.
[3:55:05.400 --> 3:55:10.720]  There weren't even forts developed to lay claim to these regions, which is why we've
[3:55:10.720 --> 3:55:16.760]  had such disputes over the issue of native sovereignty and native issues in Alaska.
[3:55:16.760 --> 3:55:21.360]  I've been in the middle of that, I'm the second generation, my son will be the third generation
[3:55:21.360 --> 3:55:26.520]  of this, and these are important issues the nation should know about.
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:34.560]  We have such opportunity knocking at the door if we would just recognize, you know, the
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:39.760]  same kind of energy that went into building the transcontinental railroad needs to happen
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:44.280]  to hit the last frontier area of our country.
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:49.520]  And there are incredible parks and preserves that has already been taken into consideration
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:55.040]  and does not need to be anymore, and it's a violation of the nation to lock anymore
[3:55:55.040 --> 3:55:56.040]  up.
[3:55:56.040 --> 3:56:01.640]  Now is the time to work together, you know, the native corporations that my dad helped
[3:56:01.640 --> 3:56:08.720]  form back in 1971, they got a billion dollars in taxpayer money at that time as part of
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:14.960]  the settlement, and you know that several of those corporations today generate several
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:18.880]  billion dollars a year in domestic revenue.
[3:56:18.880 --> 3:56:24.440]  I mean, this is fantastic transfer that in large part did work.
[3:56:24.440 --> 3:56:29.120]  There's still some problems and today's not the day to get into them, but we will.
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:33.560]  I've worked as a tribal administrator in this state, I've worked for native corporations
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:39.160]  and tribal governments here, I've got a personal history in that that at a future show we'll
[3:56:39.160 --> 3:56:45.680]  explore together to talk about how that plays in to making America great again.
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:49.600]  Because Alaska should be a key part of that in terms of opportunity.
[3:56:49.600 --> 3:56:54.480]  When you think about our trade imbalance with China, right now China is talking to the Trump
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:55.480]  administration.
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:57:00.280]  One of the things that's on the agenda through the Trump administration is the idea of building
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:06.640]  a gas line here so we can start exporting natural gas and getting the Chinese to underwrite
[3:57:06.640 --> 3:57:08.440]  it and be that market.
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:13.760]  We have an opportunity to start sending things the other direction, and I think we have the
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:16.000]  right administration to see Alaska open.
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:17.480]  We're headed into the break.
[3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:21.040]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, I'm sitting in for Alex Jones.
[3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:26.960]  This is infowars.com, come on back after the break, we'll finish up talking about Alaska
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:43.680]  minerals industry and what's happening in the robbing of our nation's wealth.
[3:57:43.680 --> 3:57:48.960]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending
[3:57:48.960 --> 3:57:51.080]  down over the UK.
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:57.320]  We're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six
[3:57:57.320 --> 3:57:58.920]  months in prison.
[3:57:58.920 --> 3:58:02.680]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[3:58:02.680 --> 3:58:07.480]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[3:58:07.480 --> 3:58:13.120]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people
[3:58:13.120 --> 3:58:18.040]  against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[3:58:18.040 --> 3:58:19.320]  what we have to say.
[3:58:19.320 --> 3:58:22.320]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.
[3:58:22.320 --> 3:58:27.960]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com or slash newsletter and sign up for the free
[3:58:27.960 --> 3:58:32.880]  newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in
[3:58:32.880 --> 3:58:38.560]  and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical
[3:58:38.560 --> 3:58:39.560]  to this fight.
[3:58:39.560 --> 3:58:44.680]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[3:58:44.680 --> 3:58:48.960]  You know if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an info
[3:58:48.960 --> 3:58:49.960]  wars life.
[3:58:49.960 --> 3:58:50.960]  It takes hours.
[3:58:50.960 --> 3:58:56.320]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price, it's stronger, it's the other equation in probiotics,
[3:58:56.320 --> 3:59:00.680]  it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[3:59:00.680 --> 3:59:05.160]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months, it's got the preglinone that's the
[3:59:05.160 --> 3:59:09.040]  precursor to all the natural hormones in your body, then it's got all the minerals and the
[3:59:09.040 --> 3:59:11.680]  vitamins and amino acids so you can upload it.
[3:59:11.680 --> 3:59:16.720]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified
[3:59:16.720 --> 3:59:22.400]  toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle that's a spray you do, you can also swallow
[3:59:22.400 --> 3:59:23.400]  it.
[3:59:23.400 --> 3:59:28.560]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[3:59:28.560 --> 3:59:29.720]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[3:59:29.720 --> 3:59:35.480]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[3:59:35.480 --> 3:59:39.160]  already awake but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the
[3:59:39.160 --> 3:59:40.160]  word.
[3:59:40.160 --> 3:59:52.040]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
