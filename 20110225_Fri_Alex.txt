[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:29.960]  welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Friday February 25th edition of the Alex Jones show
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.360]  live I'm Paul Joseph Watson I'll be filling in just for the first couple of segments of today's
[00:36.360 --> 00:45.120]  show as Alex does live interviews and Alex will be back at about 20 past the hour as you know
[00:45.120 --> 00:53.960]  the unfolding escalating crisis in Libya and the Middle East North African region continues to
[00:53.960 --> 01:02.600]  rage the Obama administration and the Pentagon are now preparing to launch a multi lateral
[01:02.600 --> 01:10.640]  invasion of Libya with the complicity of the United Nations and NATO serious discussions now
[01:10.640 --> 01:18.920]  on the table for that eventuality and of course it's all going to be on humanitarian grounds
[01:18.920 --> 01:25.960]  nothing to do with the fact that the US military industrial complex failed to overthrow Gaddafi
[01:25.960 --> 01:32.240]  in the 80s and they want a second bite at the cherry and of course I'm sure it's nothing to do
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.400]  with the fact that Libya has the largest supply of oil reserves in the whole continent of Africa
[01:38.400 --> 01:46.160]  complete coincidence I'm sure and now the same US military industrial complex that has killed
[01:46.160 --> 01:54.000]  well over a million innocent people in the last 10 years including several hundreds a year annually
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.520]  with the predator drone bombings deaths of innocent people has now suddenly found a conscience
[02:00.520 --> 02:07.920]  and is concerning itself with the humanitarian plight of the people of Libya and this is the
[02:07.920 --> 02:14.880]  excuse now being forwarded as the pretext for a military assault on the country with the
[02:14.880 --> 02:23.280]  acquiescence of NATO and the United Nations CNN analysts more Libyan bloodshed could prompt US
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.640]  NATO intervention if the US military were to intervene in an increasingly chaotic Libya it
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.640]  would most likely be part of a NATO action in which Libyan bloodshed has reached a humanitarian
[02:36.640 --> 02:45.360]  crisis analysts said Thursday military intervention quote is something which I hope doesn't happen
[02:45.360 --> 02:50.960]  but it looks as though at some point that it should happen said Simon Henderson senior fellow
[02:50.960 --> 02:57.360]  at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy so now we've got all these big globalist NGOs
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.600]  coming out laying the groundwork for this military invasion of Libya as the crisis escalates we've
[03:03.600 --> 03:10.880]  got the entire global corporate establishment media in cahoots aggressively pushing Gaddafi as
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.800]  this horrible dictator which he is but he is a horrible dictator with the aid of British made
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.920]  weapons which he's now being which are now being used to subjugate his own population and of course
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.680]  they have to portray Gaddafi as the monster who kills his own people just as they did with
[03:27.680 --> 03:35.120]  Saddam Hussein who they also sold the weapon to do so to create that pretext for quote humanitarian
[03:35.120 --> 03:42.480]  military intervention and now you have two of the most odious and self-serving lawmakers in the
[03:42.480 --> 03:48.640]  history of the United States Lieberman and McCain saying that Obama should arm the rebels
[03:49.440 --> 03:54.560]  there in Libya which of course the whole rebel campaign is being run out of Washington DC as
[03:54.560 --> 04:03.840]  we documented and basically bankroll an insurgency war against Gaddafi with US taxpayers money even
[04:03.840 --> 04:10.880]  as Americans struggle to afford their own grocery bill so while you're going to be made to cut back
[04:10.880 --> 04:16.480]  while people are getting their welfare sliced in half while people are being forced to double their
[04:16.480 --> 04:22.560]  pension and health care contributions that money's all going to be spent on a nice little
[04:22.560 --> 04:30.400]  military intervention in the oil rich african country of Libya bloomberg Gaddafi cracks down
[04:30.400 --> 04:36.160]  on Tripoli as Sarkozy calls for departure Momar Gaddafi tried to tighten his grip on Tripoli
[04:36.160 --> 04:41.200]  as french president Nicholas Sarkozy called on him to resign amid reports that worshipers were
[04:41.200 --> 04:47.360]  being shot as they left mosques after friday prayers so the entire vanguard of the new world

[08:14.800 --> 08:21.120]  gadafi militia opens fire on libya protesters militia's loyal to momar gadafi opened fire
[08:21.120 --> 08:26.800]  friday on protesters streaming out of mosques and marching across the libyan capital to demand
[08:26.800 --> 08:33.200]  the regime's ouster witnesses said reporting at least four killed in rebellious cities in the east
[08:33.200 --> 08:40.160]  tens of thousands held rallies in support of the first triply protests in days and now we have
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.320]  reuters reporting that rebels now control the oil fields in the east of the country libyan rebels
[08:46.320 --> 08:53.440]  say control oil fields honor deals rebels in eastern libya said on friday they now controlled
[08:53.440 --> 08:59.200]  most of the oil fields east of the town of raslanoof and said they would honor oil deals
[08:59.200 --> 09:04.080]  as long as they were in the interests of the people now that's interesting because we posted
[09:04.080 --> 09:12.000]  another reuters story this morning on prisonplanet.com which said that oil supplies and oil plants are
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.400]  completely unaffected by this so either somebody's exaggerating or there have been some dramatic
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.480]  developments in the past few hours another reuters story libya oil production to shut down
[09:24.480 --> 09:32.000]  completely bank of america reuters oil production in libya is expected to shut down completely
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.360]  and could be lost for a prolonged period of time bank of america meryl lynch said on thursday
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.440]  quote we expect libyan production to be shut down completely we might lose sweet crude from libya
[09:45.440 --> 09:53.360]  for a prolonged period of time bank of america meryl lynch analyst sabine shells told reuters so
[09:55.200 --> 10:01.040]  there was a rumor of gadafi being shot yesterday that jacked up oil prices last time i looked
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.680]  today they were either flat or slightly down so all this is working towards the benefit of the
[10:07.680 --> 10:14.400]  crowd the globalist the post industrial revolutionaries who want to push oil up to at least 200
[10:15.040 --> 10:20.080]  dollars a barrel we had the report a couple of days ago from the big investment firm that said
[10:20.640 --> 10:28.080]  if this continues to escalate expect oil to shoot up to 220 dollars a barrel in no time and of course
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.720]  you know precisely what that does to gas prices which are already so high
[10:32.720 --> 10:41.760]  high so i see in the groundwork now being laid for a us nato un led humanitarian war on libya
[10:41.760 --> 10:49.680]  which will of course garner the enthusiastic backing of an army of leftist interventionists who
[10:49.680 --> 10:57.520]  so vehemently opposed george borsch for launching such wars even though they were only slightly
[10:57.520 --> 11:04.320]  different in the fact that they were launched under a different pretext and isn't it interesting that
[11:04.320 --> 11:11.680]  myself and alex predicted that the obama administration would do precisely what we now
[11:11.680 --> 11:22.080]  see unfolding namely launch new wars on tricked up and contrived humanitarian grounds in an article
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.720]  we wrote which you can google search it's entitled the more things change the more they stay the same
[11:30.080 --> 11:37.200]  this was an article we wrote in november 2008 you know nearly three and a half years ago before
[11:37.200 --> 11:44.160]  obama even took office um and in that piece we warned that obama was even more dangerous than
[11:44.160 --> 11:52.320]  bush in many ways um because he could launch his wars with the aid of left cover and not have to deal
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.240]  with the same level of vitriol that bush did uh when he launched his invasions of afghanistan
[11:58.800 --> 12:05.760]  and iraq and this is the exact quote from the article again written nearly three and a half
[12:05.760 --> 12:13.200]  years ago by myself and alex jones before obama even took office quote obama may eventually
[12:13.200 --> 12:19.600]  withdraw a portion of troops from iraq and that's exactly what happened they withdrew a token amount
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.200]  replace them with contractors continuing quote but mark our words they won't be home long before they
[12:27.200 --> 12:35.520]  are sent off to bomb another broken backed third world country this time in the name of a united
[12:35.520 --> 12:45.120]  nations backed humanitarian war just as bill clinton presided over in somalia and syria with the full
[12:45.120 --> 12:52.800]  support of the establishment political left lo and behold this so-called revolution now sweeping
[12:52.800 --> 13:02.080]  the region gives the globalists and their stooge obama the exact pretext to do just that so what
[13:02.080 --> 13:08.400]  we predicted nearly three and a half years ago that obama would be the man just as clinton was
[13:08.400 --> 13:16.960]  to launch humanitarian wars is now unfolding before our very eyes and uh you know we're not
[13:16.960 --> 13:23.200]  boasting about it it's easy to tell what these people are going to do because they pull the same
[13:23.760 --> 13:31.680]  political and geopolitical tricks over and over again with their you know wwe style republican
[13:31.680 --> 13:40.080]  democrat tag team offensive which the american people fall for every time under a republican you
[13:40.080 --> 13:47.120]  you get an aggressive preemptive war if not more than one which is supported by conservatives
[13:47.120 --> 13:55.520]  and under a democrat you have a quote humanitarian war which is supported by liberals so either way
[13:55.520 --> 14:06.480]  it's war and either way the u.s uh uk eu israeli industrial complex reaps the windfall as well
[14:06.480 --> 14:15.280]  as the uh geopolitical leverage over the region and uh you know remember joe biden the vice president's
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.640]  promise that obama would be faced with an international crisis that you would have to deal
[14:20.640 --> 14:27.920]  with and make unpopular decisions and it seems like libya could now well be that crisis and we
[14:27.920 --> 14:35.040]  called it three and a half years ago uh in this article in which we said that obama was the perfect
[14:35.040 --> 14:46.240]  man to front so-called humanitarian wars so now we see the same global corporate establishment
[14:46.240 --> 14:53.680]  media that of course uh bit its collective tongue is nearly a million iraqis were slaughtered it's
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.640]  the same establishment media that brushes over the deaths of hundreds of innocent people killed by
[15:00.640 --> 15:08.080]  predator drones in pakistan and afghanistan every year but now they've suddenly found their conscience
[15:08.800 --> 15:15.760]  and just by a miraculous coincidence they've managed to discover that conscience uh just as
[15:15.760 --> 15:23.600]  the new world order launches a series of color revolutions to reshape the middle east in their
[15:23.600 --> 15:31.600]  image and of course north africa as well so let's just not mention the fact that the weapons
[15:31.600 --> 15:38.320]  gadafi is using to slaughter his own people uh were mostly purchased from britain uh you know
[15:38.320 --> 15:43.040]  companies like lockheed martin which are now conducting the census in britain to steal and
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.800]  track all our information put us all in terror databases because of our religion or our beliefs
[15:49.920 --> 15:56.480]  let's not mention the fact that david cameron uh in the past few days has been on a tour of the
[15:56.480 --> 16:01.520]  region just by coincidence it happened to have been occurring uh after the overthrow of hozny
[16:01.520 --> 16:11.600]  mubarak um accompanied by no less than eight count them eight representatives from defense firms
[16:11.600 --> 16:21.760]  selling weapons and bombs oh very convenient timing there so you've got cameron swooping in
[16:21.760 --> 16:26.320]  to sell them all the weapons these post-revolutionary governments which of course at the moment in
[16:26.320 --> 16:33.360]  egypt is nothing more than a military dictatorship simultaneously you have the u.s government and the
[16:33.360 --> 16:39.840]  you and the european union preparing a new marshal plan for the middle east they call it
[16:39.840 --> 16:46.160]  preparing to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money uh again even as they tell
[16:46.160 --> 16:53.040]  taxpayers to tighten their belts basically buying off these post-revolutionary governments
[16:53.040 --> 17:00.480]  as a means of hijacking manipulating and steering the the entire revol and i wrote
[17:00.480 --> 17:07.680]  an article on prismplanet.com a couple of days ago um speaking to this fact that the u.s and the
[17:07.680 --> 17:13.040]  eu are now swooping in and buying off all these governments uh a report out of the australian
[17:13.040 --> 17:20.400]  quote in the u.s bill richardson former governor of new mexico a leading democrat foreign policy
[17:20.400 --> 17:26.560]  thinker and a confidant of president obama told the times quote western governments need to think
[17:26.560 --> 17:32.880]  of this as a marshal plan type moment and a dramatic change in the world's security order
[17:32.880 --> 17:40.160]  here's another quote a senior official from the eu u.s japan and australia prepared for an emergency
[17:40.160 --> 17:46.160]  summit on the middle east in brussels this week mr richardson added quote we have to find a way
[17:46.160 --> 17:51.440]  to get on the right side of these democracy movements that are going to explode and continue
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.560]  to explode right so they're going to have to find a way to get on the right side of them
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.720]  in other words they have to find the people who are going to emerge as the strong men
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.960]  which eventually happens and they're going to buy them off just as they have bought off
[18:06.960 --> 18:13.440]  hosney boom barric before that um just as the u.s embassy according to the london telegraph report
[18:14.240 --> 18:20.560]  had become aware of the fact that boom barric was going to be overthrown in 2011 uh nearly
[18:20.560 --> 18:26.240]  three years before it happened which gave them the perfect opportunity to put their men in
[18:26.240 --> 18:33.520]  to steer the revolution and now with those new dictator puppets about to take power
[18:33.520 --> 18:39.200]  certainly in egypt and of course tunisia as well now we're talking about Bahrain and libya
[18:39.920 --> 18:46.400]  they're going to be plenty of tasty little lucrative contracts and weapons deals to be done
[18:46.400 --> 18:50.000]  which is why cameron is in the region right now doing exactly that
[18:50.000 --> 18:58.240]  so in other words as i wrote in the article you know taxpayers are now laboring under the
[18:58.240 --> 19:05.600]  harshest economic conditions for at least two generations but now they're going to use the
[19:05.600 --> 19:13.120]  money that we're supposed to pay them in higher taxes and cutbacks on public services to buy off
[19:13.120 --> 19:22.000]  whoever takes charge of these globalist controlled um faux color revolutions and on top of that uh
[19:22.000 --> 19:31.040]  the obama white house is preparing a four billion dollar subsidy program uh which is aimed at keeping
[19:31.040 --> 19:39.120]  food prices low in egypt oh how about keeping food prices low in america you know record millions of
[19:39.120 --> 19:46.400]  americans on food stamps in the united states uh hypocrisy there to be sure uh that's it for me
[19:46.400 --> 19:51.920]  alex is going to be back after the break to talk about a myriad of issues including libya oil and
[19:51.920 --> 19:57.600]  the global unrest sweeping the planet i've been paul joseph watson stay tuned for the alex jones show

[25:09.280 --> 25:18.080]  we're going to be going over all of that today later in the next hour because i still want to
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.880]  collect my thoughts on this because i have a lot of mixed feelings on it i'm going to obviously
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.560]  talk about the biggest story right now in the united states and in europe there is no doubt it
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.600]  is the biggest story right now quite frankly the biggest story in the world should be what's
[25:33.600 --> 25:40.160]  happening in the middle east in north africa and with the economy and with dollar devaluation going
[25:40.160 --> 25:49.920]  into high gear going ballistic but it's not the biggest story right now in the media is charlie
[25:49.920 --> 25:54.880]  sheen's radio interview here yesterday and the canceling of the rest of the season for the number
[25:54.880 --> 26:00.480]  one tv show on television two and a half men not the number one sitcom the number one tv show
[26:00.480 --> 26:09.280]  and i did not know that charlie was going to come on air and cover those topics
[26:10.640 --> 26:18.080]  but i respect the fact that he wanted to come on and discuss it i mean i think really
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.280]  just during the interview during a break he started talking about it and then we came back
[26:23.280 --> 26:33.440]  on air and he began to discuss chuck lorry who is the creator of two and a half men who in the
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.320]  last three weeks has been putting out vanity cards at the end of two and a half men and two other
[26:38.320 --> 26:45.600]  hit shows he has calling charlie solis uh saying he's going to outlive charlie and then leaking
[26:45.600 --> 26:50.640]  things reportedly to the media to basically blame everything on charlie when there wouldn't be a two
[26:50.640 --> 26:56.080]  and a half men show without both chuck lorry and charlie sheen without the creator and then the main
[26:56.080 --> 27:01.200]  engine pulling the whole thing but i wanted to get charlie on because i spent time with him and
[27:01.200 --> 27:06.960]  he was completely clean and is still reportedly and just to talk about a lot of things the media
[27:06.960 --> 27:12.960]  that were exaggerated or not true but i think we got charlie on a day when he was fed up and very
[27:12.960 --> 27:22.880]  angry and a lot of the things he was doing was joking charlie loves thomas jefferson
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.400]  sometimes he gets into this kind of satirical dark humor
[27:30.080 --> 27:35.280]  you know he's seeing websites making fun of him claiming he's a vatican assassin so he made that
[27:35.280 --> 27:43.280]  joke we're saying he's a warlock so he made that joke uh he is um obviously not a ninja when he said
[27:43.280 --> 27:49.520]  that uh i'm obviously not a ninja or any of those other things uh but the media of course picked it
[27:49.520 --> 27:56.000]  up like he was being serious and taking it out of context when he was laughing uh but he is high on
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.080]  life and when i've quit tobacco many times off and on in my life that's had a lot of struggles
[28:02.080 --> 28:07.600]  with it only substance i've really had problems with i've well coffee i've quit it before but boy
[28:07.600 --> 28:15.520]  do i love it and that's a serious drug when i've gone off nicotine and coffee for a week after
[28:15.520 --> 28:20.400]  about a week of feeling terrible i get crazy with energy the whole office has pointed it out they're
[28:20.400 --> 28:26.000]  kind of like you're a nicer guy alex when you're uh chewing tobacco or smoking cigarettes yes folks
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.040]  i chew tobacco i'm from texas okay i'm a redneck let's just get down to it i'll put a big whole
[28:31.040 --> 28:41.760]  wad of red man right here and i swallow the juice i got a spittoon and i've quit that for a long time
[28:41.760 --> 28:49.680]  at least a few months um i think it's better than cigarettes torching my lungs but uh it it sedates
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.240]  me really and of course it's been scientifically proven that that that nicotine does calm um
[28:56.240 --> 29:02.160]  when you see the wild crazy rants and you see me lose weight when i'm working out a lot uh and
[29:02.160 --> 29:06.400]  then i tend to gain it back you know that's when there'll be months of just craziness on the show
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.800]  because i'm so alive it and i think that's basically what was happening with sheen
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.680]  and i you know he stands by the things he said uh and i talked to him a lot last night
[29:19.680 --> 29:28.480]  uh you know i'm gonna talk about it later i'm gonna talk about it later uh but uh i know charlie's
[29:28.480 --> 29:33.840]  a good man at heart and uh i do apologize to listeners that were offended by some of the
[29:33.840 --> 29:38.320]  rough language we did delay it some of it out uh but at the same time you know charlie's all about
[29:38.320 --> 29:44.720]  being real and at the same time having somebody like charlie on it also then gets mainline tv heads
[29:44.720 --> 29:53.520]  to tune into this radio show and find out about reality we're on the march the empires on the run

[30:04.640 --> 30:08.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[30:08.960 --> 30:14.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.600]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[30:19.600 --> 30:24.720]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[30:24.720 --> 30:30.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.480]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[30:34.480 --> 30:39.840]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[30:39.840 --> 30:43.680]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[33:27.360 --> 33:36.480]  two and a half men uh season cancellation controversy i um you know charlie's sticking
[33:36.480 --> 33:42.160]  by his guns and has wanted to not do the show for a long time privately he's got a lot of other
[33:42.160 --> 33:50.880]  offers i mentioned it yesterday you know things like hbo uh other tv networks and he's just
[33:50.880 --> 33:57.120]  you know tired of it and then when chuck lorry put out all those vanity cards and then continued
[33:57.120 --> 34:04.000]  to attack charlie i think he controlled his rage and then it just exploded on my show and um
[34:04.000 --> 34:12.640]  um in the riled up state charlie was in on fire how do you say that in spanish in fuego
[34:14.800 --> 34:22.320]  that uh it was it was a train wreck but a very interesting one and you know god turns
[34:22.880 --> 34:31.360]  you know wild things like that into something good um because certainly the tens of millions
[34:31.360 --> 34:38.720]  of people an hour hearing that interview now as it's aired in europe in japan on every network
[34:38.720 --> 34:44.240]  here every radio station this morning i was hearing from staff and crew who listened to
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.720]  different local stations they were all talking about it they were all talking about info wars
[34:48.720 --> 34:54.880]  dot com where folks could hear the whole interview i was just on msnbc that's why paul sat in in the
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.800]  first 20 minutes and i was able to plug info wars dot com several times and so basically all
[35:00.800 --> 35:06.880]  the mind-numbed mainline tv watchers uh the fluoride heads charlie calls them that aren't awake
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.800]  they will now be able to tune into this radio show and find this broadcast and if you are a new
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.480]  listener uh to this show you need to know that there is poison being put in the water it's called
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.520]  sodium fluoride and more and more cities are removing it in class action suits have been filed
[35:23.520 --> 35:28.880]  and top epa scientists are on record documenting that it causes a seven fold increase in cancer
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.840]  in men a three fold in increase in bone cancer alone just in that one area there's many other
[35:33.840 --> 35:41.760]  cancers and increases in women you need to know that there is a global government forming that
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.200]  has engineered this financial collapse to create a post industrial world where you're so bankrupt
[35:47.200 --> 35:52.960]  and so broke that you can go under social engineering government control you need to know
[35:52.960 --> 35:58.560]  that the entire middle eastern situation was triggered by the globalist by the george soros
[35:58.560 --> 36:04.640]  type crowd uh to destabilize the middle east and then the rest of the world and use that as a smoke
[36:04.640 --> 36:12.240]  screen to blame the crises that are happening uh in the banking system on what's happening in the
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.760]  middle east when what's in happening in the middle east the main foundation of it is dollar
[36:17.760 --> 36:26.640]  devaluation the world uses dollars to buy oil to buy fuel uh the currencies are all based
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.840]  uh on the dollar even though you have you know the euro you have other currencies still uh
[36:32.480 --> 36:38.320]  they're all pegged to the dollar and we're moving towards a point where the dollar will no longer
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.880]  be the world reserve currency and we've been deindustrialized we've had our economy shut down
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.920]  we've had intrusive regulations put in place where we can't compete with china and india and
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.840]  mexico and scores of other third world nations and that's why your standard of living is dropping
[36:53.840 --> 37:00.000]  and um where it's fine to watch a football game or two and a half men but you really should sometimes
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.880]  try turning off the television and reading a book or researching history uh and getting
[37:04.880 --> 37:13.200]  involved in reality as i said last sunday uh there is no rest when you're involved in reality
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.680]  and we are so focused on reality and what's really happening in the real world but sometimes
[37:19.680 --> 37:26.080]  we go into the matrix and by going into the matrix into the mainstream system we're able to reach
[37:26.080 --> 37:34.320]  new people and overall i just hope that everything turns out well for charlie and that he stays clean
[37:34.320 --> 37:41.360]  and that everybody prays for him because you know i know him as a multifaceted person a very loving
[37:41.360 --> 37:51.520]  person uh and i was not expecting uh just the the over the top unleashed uh situation we saw
[37:51.520 --> 37:55.840]  yesterday and certainly it was very interesting and certainly it's the biggest news story uh right
[37:55.840 --> 38:04.480]  now uh in the country and in much of the world showing where people's focus is it's on television
[38:04.480 --> 38:12.160]  shows and uh but by this show being the place where that was discussed can you see how now people
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.080]  will tune into this broadcast and they'll understand that things like abortion aren't some wonderful
[38:18.080 --> 38:24.640]  civil right but that it's part of a eugenics program uh to reduce population and that our own
[38:24.640 --> 38:32.960]  government has been funding china and others enforced abortions and in fantasy and i mean i'm
[38:32.960 --> 38:38.720]  almost tempted but i'm exhausted from from last night this morning all the countless radio tv
[38:38.720 --> 38:46.400]  newspaper interviews i've done um two of this morning be able to codify a lot of the important
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.600]  bedrock issues that we cover here every single day but because we have a lot of mainstream tv
[38:51.600 --> 38:58.080]  watchers guys i meant to cover it monday i meant to cover it yesterday will you pull me the mainstream
[38:58.080 --> 39:05.680]  news article about the new light bulbs that uh are going to have computer signals going through them
[39:05.680 --> 39:10.800]  basically programming and interfacing with your computer and the other patent number article
[39:11.600 --> 39:17.360]  dealing with the admission that not only does the flicker rate on tv put you into a mesmerized
[39:17.360 --> 39:23.360]  hypnotized highly suggestible state but that not only propaganda messages can be on what's
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.160]  being said on tv that's one level of propaganda and the flicker rate puts you in that in that
[39:28.160 --> 39:37.200]  suggestible state but that the that actual data uh that that that they can put signals in the flicker
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.720]  that can make you sick make you angry make you happy this is mind control you know a hundred
[39:42.720 --> 39:50.400]  years ago how would a uh hypnotist um hypnotize you you know they do it by having you watch a
[39:50.400 --> 39:59.280]  flashing light or a watch well this is 21st century versions of that watch the watch listen to me
[39:59.280 --> 40:05.440]  do what i say you know for those of you out there tuning in for the first time who are hearing this
[40:05.440 --> 40:11.280]  and laughing at what i'm saying let me just give you a few examples of what i'm talking about then
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.120]  i'll get into what's happening in north africa and the middle east and what's happening with the
[40:15.120 --> 40:25.440]  economy uh here is yeah this is good but there's there's one other there's the actual article
[40:25.440 --> 40:31.920]  on this patent uh there's one more article i need guys uh the yeah thank you the actual
[40:31.920 --> 40:39.280]  article about the patent uh but uh here's the patent it's patent six dash five zero six
[40:39.280 --> 40:48.160]  dash one four eight and it's at the u.s patent office uh current u.s class current international
[40:48.160 --> 40:57.040]  class and it's got its coded uh larger number there u.s patent document uh this is uh from
[40:57.040 --> 41:04.480]  january 14th 2003 and this is just one of countless patent documents uh that are out there dealing
[41:04.480 --> 41:10.480]  with this and it's titled nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.560]  from monitors psychological effects have been observed in human subjects in response to stimulation
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.680]  of the skin with weak magnetic fields that are pulsed with a certain frequency near the one and
[41:21.680 --> 41:28.000]  a half hertz of 2.4 hertz such as to excite a sensory resonance many computer monitors and tv
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.080]  tubes when displaying pulsed images emit pulse electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes
[41:34.080 --> 41:40.720]  to cause such excitation it is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject
[41:40.720 --> 41:48.400]  by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or tv set for the ladder the image pulsing
[41:48.400 --> 41:54.400]  may be embedded in the program material did you hear that on the actual video that they're feeding
[41:54.400 --> 42:00.160]  into it you know the original signal or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream either with
[42:00.160 --> 42:05.760]  an rf signal or as a video signal the image displayed on the computer monitor may be pulsed
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.920]  effectively by a simple computer program for certain monitors pulse electromagnetic fields
[42:11.920 --> 42:18.640]  capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the display
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.920]  images are pulsed with a subliminal intensity that means you don't know about it or notice it
[42:23.920 --> 42:29.680]  and here's an article about it uh patent nervous system manipulation from tv monitors now we've
[42:29.680 --> 42:35.520]  had dr nick baggots whose brother is also u.s senator his father a former congressman who was
[42:35.520 --> 42:42.880]  murdered uh but uh side issue um dr nick baggots has always tried to explain to me alex yes they
[42:42.880 --> 42:46.720]  admit they want to put lithium in the water to calm us and now that's mainstream news even fox
[42:46.720 --> 42:50.160]  news reports how great it's going to be to have lithium in our water and how japan's living to
[42:50.160 --> 42:56.000]  do it and how sodium fluoride also brain damages you and calms you and makes you servile and lowers
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.400]  your IQ but he said that's child's play compared to the thousands of patents most of them u.s government
[43:03.440 --> 43:12.800]  dealing with electromagnetics through cell towers through tv towers uh through uh cell phones
[43:12.800 --> 43:19.840]  where they can modulate and make you throw up make you become giddy make you have an aphrodisiac
[43:19.840 --> 43:26.800]  make you die make you have a heart attack and i remember close to 10 years ago the boltamore sun
[43:26.800 --> 43:32.080]  somebody ought to research it and pull up i forget the exact headline but it was darpa looking at ways
[43:32.080 --> 43:36.960]  to calm the public during riots they're not just looking at sound cannons or microwave guns now
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.960]  those are rolled out at the tea party as you've seen i was kooky to cover it 10 years ago now
[43:40.960 --> 43:44.880]  it's mainstream news and it's being used against us but they said they're also getting ready to
[43:44.880 --> 43:51.040]  deploy towers that put off a magnetic resonance that will calm people during emergencies
[43:52.240 --> 44:00.480]  so we're here 2011 now you read this patent and i spent an hour or so trying to read just one
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.880]  of these patents where they describe how it's all been tested and how it works
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.400]  and you better believe uh shopping malls that's come out in the news there's so much proof it's
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.920]  like an ocean of proof you've seen the news reports about how shopping malls put out quote
[44:15.920 --> 44:23.120]  subliminal audio at such a low level your conscious brain doesn't you know really the conscious part
[44:23.120 --> 44:29.440]  of your mind doesn't pick it up but it's soothing statements and soothing frequencies and and and
[44:29.440 --> 44:37.200]  suit you know to make and to make you feel good and want to buy more junk it's it's it's famous
[44:37.200 --> 44:45.120]  for the casinos giving people free drinks and pumping in oxygen and keeping it it it it cold so
[44:45.120 --> 44:50.160]  you don't get sleepy you've been in a warm room it it makes you get sleepy i mean that that stuff
[44:50.160 --> 44:55.520]  the gangsters were doing 50 60 years ago or if you go back to the 1940s others they teach this in
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.320]  you know rtf in your first course about subliminal messaging and you tell the public there's
[45:00.320 --> 45:03.440]  subliminal messaging they laugh at you because they've been told it doesn't exist but then
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.880]  you go take rtf they admit it some of the first were in the 40s where they would show a desert
[45:10.320 --> 45:17.680]  scene before the moving and then just flash subliminal quick images of a coca-cola with
[45:17.680 --> 45:27.040]  water dripping down at ice cold or hot dogs and and and and popcorn and saying you're hungry
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.680]  you're hungry because if you're not really hungry and you consciously see an ad for popcorn you may
[45:33.680 --> 45:41.440]  not want it but your bestial kind of you know lower brain centers of breathing and procreation
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.400]  and eating and things like that it's like i'm always hungry like a dog will eat and eat until
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.360]  it throws up and then it'll go after the throw up so it's kind of hitting that lower area well
[45:51.360 --> 45:57.520]  hungry you're not really hungry but hungry i'm hungry then they put additives in the food uh
[45:57.520 --> 46:02.640]  which uh i mean they admit msg does that it blocks the area of the brain knowing that you've already
[46:02.640 --> 46:06.400]  gotten enough food it blocks the brain picking up on how much insulin is there
[46:06.400 --> 46:12.480]  so you go eat more more more more more aspartame does that never seen how many super obese people
[46:12.480 --> 46:17.280]  always have a diet coke in their hand or a diet Pepsi and it's also very toxic and addicting so
[46:17.280 --> 46:23.840]  this is all pharmacia designed and hidden but now they're moving to the pulsing lights now
[46:23.840 --> 46:31.840]  you know we've seen continuity of agenda australia england the e u many arab nations
[46:32.800 --> 46:39.200]  many eastern european nations latin america nations under international push from the un
[46:39.840 --> 46:43.920]  first they do something that sounds reasonable oh let's start banning smoking outdoors worldwide
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.520]  then they have cities counties states do it but it's all really you in run it's called agenda 21
[46:49.520 --> 46:56.000]  now let's have a global move in all these countries to ban high flush toilets so they set the precedent
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.840]  that they set the rules because they have the moral authority then oh you've got to put in these
[46:59.840 --> 47:08.720]  expensive light bulbs that if one breaks or cracks uh that you've got to call a hazmat team open the
[47:08.720 --> 47:15.840]  windows and and leave your house for three days and that's admitted and then we start seeing all
[47:15.840 --> 47:20.400]  these major medical reports about people getting headaches people getting sick people young people
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.920]  starting to have strokes you've seen that in the news just all the uh uh in uh in japan six seven
[47:25.920 --> 47:30.080]  years ago they had a pokemon episode and tens of thousands of children went into convulsions
[47:30.080 --> 47:35.760]  and they admitted yes we did a test with the flashing on the screen uh sorry we've removed it
[47:35.760 --> 47:43.360]  it tens of thousands of kids one episode all over japan flopping around uh foaming at the mouth i mean
[47:43.360 --> 47:48.000]  full on some of them broke bones some of them dislocated because i mean they were having violent
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.280]  seizures now now this is all on record everything i've said you can go look up and pull up now
[47:54.240 --> 48:00.880]  remember a few months ago we started covering this my bright idea light bulbs can be used to
[48:00.880 --> 48:06.880]  transmit data with a device you can buy at any high street uh professor herald haas is perfecting
[48:06.880 --> 48:12.000]  a revolutionary method of controlling digital information with the flick of a switch now um
[48:14.480 --> 48:21.360]  this article came out last year now since then i have another article that just came out a few
[48:22.400 --> 48:29.840]  months ago and this is out of the associated press ceiling lights in minnesota send coded
[48:29.840 --> 48:36.000]  internet data where are they testing it in state government buildings now again by law
[48:36.720 --> 48:40.400]  within a year and a half you're not going to be able to buy phosphorescence it's already phasing
[48:40.400 --> 48:46.320]  in with the higher wattage bulbs this year can't have the phosphorescent that good yellow
[48:47.120 --> 48:52.880]  white light that mimics the sun that mimics firelight candlelight that our eyes are designed for
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.160]  no you've got to have the fluorescent and i've got the articles here about all the sicknesses
[48:58.160 --> 49:03.200]  they're causing it's now confirmed five six years ago all your conspiracy theorists shut up it's good
[49:03.200 --> 49:09.600]  for you all the people complaining doctors doing studies saying something's going on here now the
[49:09.600 --> 49:15.200]  federal government's coming in with grants at the police stations and all over the nation not just
[49:15.200 --> 49:22.320]  minnesota oh we have special fluorescent light bulbs that are going to communicate wirelessly
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.720]  with your computer so they can now wirelessly program the computer how they want but that's only
[49:26.720 --> 49:32.720]  one issue they're flashing and when you read the patents on these flashing lights that transmit data
[49:33.600 --> 49:35.200]  it's actually a cover story
[49:38.240 --> 49:44.080]  just like the globalists in the telecommunications act of 96 said by 2001 october first 2001 all
[49:44.080 --> 49:48.800]  cell phones must have a safety tracker chip in them where we can turn your phone on an emergency
[49:48.800 --> 49:55.360]  to save you now we learn it's to spy on us so it's always dual use and it turns out that these
[49:55.360 --> 50:03.040]  light bulbs are at the same frequency modulation as these patents on mind control so they're putting
[50:03.040 --> 50:08.320]  in mind control flashing lights this is a fact all over the country in the first place is the
[50:08.320 --> 50:14.560]  government workers police social workers health department people you're going to let them do
[50:14.560 --> 50:18.720]  this and and they're going to put you in a trance and they're going to have the big
[50:18.720 --> 50:22.880]  homeland security telescreens everywhere telling you to watch your neighbors even if you try to
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.800]  turn the tv off they're not going to let you get get away they're going to have their hypnotism
[50:26.800 --> 50:32.400]  machines beaming get guaranteed they've already been caught testing and over and over again
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.000]  janet apolitano you ever watch your kids watch tv and they're drooling you can't even get their
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.360]  attention hey talk to me i'm talking to you imagine people at walmart checkout lines and
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.480]  at shopping malls and town squares big jumbo screens going in not just with a message of spy
[50:48.480 --> 50:53.200]  on your neighbor but through the message through the video through the light they can do it three ways
[50:53.200 --> 50:58.000]  pumping you with stuff that they can kill you they can make you have a heart attack with this if
[50:58.000 --> 51:06.720]  they want they're putting in kill screens this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells
[51:06.720 --> 51:11.520]  are on a staggering pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious
[51:11.520 --> 51:17.520]  criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them now a new book reveals powerful secrets

[52:08.720 --> 52:14.080]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[52:14.080 --> 52:19.680]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[52:19.680 --> 52:26.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies
[52:26.720 --> 52:32.560]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[52:32.560 --> 52:37.520]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[52:37.520 --> 52:42.240]  asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like

[54:06.960 --> 54:15.600]  because there's a war on for your mind if you are a new listener i'm begging you to not believe a
[54:15.600 --> 54:24.480]  word i'm saying there are subliminal messages all over mainstream television there are subliminal
[54:24.480 --> 54:30.160]  messages but there's not just messages when you're watching a cop drama and the bad guy is always
[54:30.160 --> 54:35.200]  some patriot who loves the constitution and bill of rights and on the side he's trying to nerve
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.560]  gas people or homeschoolers are abusing their children how many fictional shows do you see
[54:40.560 --> 54:48.240]  where they demonize gun owners that's the overt propaganda and conditioning but now the system
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.080]  and there are literally thousands of patents i just read to you one of these
[54:52.080 --> 54:59.840]  days where they admit that the flickering through light bulbs the the the fluorescent light bulbs
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.400]  the flickering through the television screens especially the high def tv can have overlaid
[55:06.400 --> 55:16.400]  in the audio video signal three different ways i just read earlier to literally cause physiological
[55:16.400 --> 55:22.320]  responses here's an abc news article on the similar area shell phones increase brain activity
[55:22.320 --> 55:28.720]  stirs fears and then new evidence shell phone cancer debate persist february 22nd 2011 i mean
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.840]  this is just a few days ago i mean i see this stuff every day without looking i read the medical
[55:33.840 --> 55:42.320]  journals and after a few minutes of using a cell phone in the area uh through your skull the brain
[55:42.320 --> 55:49.120]  goes up by one degree your it actually heats your brain up now there's an urban legend where they
[55:49.120 --> 55:56.880]  claim it can you know basically boil a egg a hard boiled egg that's that's not true so see then
[55:56.880 --> 56:02.240]  there's hoaxes out there that discredit the fact that it does do that research used
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.520]  pet scans to measure brain activity and 47 participants when they had cell phones held
[56:07.520 --> 56:14.560]  to their ears in both off and on but muted positions and found that exposure to in use cell phone for
[56:14.560 --> 56:19.600]  more than 50 minutes increased brain activity by about seven percent in the regions close to the
[56:19.600 --> 56:27.120]  antenna and it goes on that the wavelength it's a microwave it's a microwave relay system that
[56:27.120 --> 56:36.080]  that the microwave signal actually vibrates at a frequency that breaks your dna and that's why
[56:36.080 --> 56:41.840]  there's so much evidence linking cell phones to brain cancer but still i use them because it's so
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.800]  incredibly convenient for years i almost never used them but in emergencies i would keep one
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.520]  locked in my car in my desk and when i needed it or on a trip when i absolutely had to have it i did
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.640]  now i've just completely succumbed to it i don't watch a lot of television in the mind control
[56:56.640 --> 57:01.760]  system there i mean i'm not on a high horse here i know how they just it's kind of like animals if
[57:01.760 --> 57:09.680]  you went and poisoned a well went and poisoned a a a water trough that cows and deer you know stock
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.480]  tank uh the cows wouldn't know there's a lot of poisons that you know you don't even taste
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.520]  and they would just come up and drink it and the deer would come up and drink it and the foxes
[57:19.520 --> 57:24.160]  would come up and drink it and they'd all go off and die and they're stupid animals so even though
[57:24.160 --> 57:31.520]  you know uh they would see other animals dying around them and they would still go and drink
[57:31.520 --> 57:38.000]  from it and in a way i guess i'm a dumb animal i mean that's the point i'm making here is that
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.800]  we know this is going on but it's been just introduced to us like it's in the environment
[57:42.800 --> 57:46.560]  because humans are designed to go pick a strawberry and eat it or go pick a banana and eat it or
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.880]  you know go uh we were the bow and arrow and you know shoot shoot a deer to eat it and we just
[57:52.880 --> 57:57.440]  trust that this is our environment and we're we're sold the cell phones uh in fact i got one of my
[57:57.440 --> 58:02.080]  pocket right here shouldn't be it's receiving and transmitting all the time getting pinged
[58:02.880 --> 58:06.720]  you ever had a cell phone sitting by electronic equipment you heard me because that's because
[58:06.720 --> 58:12.560]  it's the towers pinging it with this gps governments keeping tabs on you tracking you but i use this
[58:12.560 --> 58:16.960]  device to go into the matrix and try to reach people we have an iphone app knowing people are
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.920]  going to be on these regardless of what we do or say and so we reach into the matrix through the
[58:21.920 --> 58:26.480]  iphone app just like we reach into the matrix through charlie sheen to the general public
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.200]  to try to wake them up to what's happening so i'm going to be covering this a lot more in the future
[58:31.200 --> 58:37.040]  because uh they're rolling out uh these signals on television through the light bulbs that's why
[58:37.040 --> 58:47.040]  they're making it the law you got to take these new light bulbs this is gcn the genesis communications

[59:58.480 --> 01:00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:28.560]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.160]  we're now into hour number two our once a week visit with bob chatman's coming up in the
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:41.920]  third hour i will try to address i got so many different conflicting thoughts in my mind that
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:50.560]  wild off the charts off the rails uh over the top interview with charlie sheen yesterday
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.840]  that is the biggest news story in the united states and i'm exhausted i did a whole bunch of tv radio
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.800]  newspaper interviews last night i've already been on msnbc today and i'm on a whole bunch of stuff
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:11.600]  uh coming up uh tonight uh and uh obviously we'll be able to inject info wars dot com into the
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.680]  discussion when i'm on those broadcast and people will come here and find the larger
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:21.040]  picture it's kind of the red pill thanks to charlie sheen i was going to get charlie on to
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:29.120]  talk about how great it is that he's off drugs and to talk about you know his passion for life
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.080]  and he did get into some other issues uh and i think the key point here is chuck lory's the one
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.680]  that started attacking him first and so uh there's been some developments there in fact chuck lory
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:47.760]  has now said that he is not going to do vanity cards anymore the ones that he's been putting at
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.920]  the end of the show attacking charlie sheen that that's just incredible with charlie keeping his
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.440]  mouth shut while chuck did that and so in fact i sent it to you guys but i didn't see it in the
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.560]  stack where you just searched the term chuck lory will is suspending vanity cards because when i
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.400]  people like what does what does that matter with the world collapsing and the whole new world order
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.480]  situation taking place well we're covering that uh but when you have a situation where you've got
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:18.560]  the number one story in the country um and they're going to try to bring charlie down with this
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.000]  we should point out that chuck lory started uh the uh attack on him and ask why he did that
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.760]  that i don't know chuck lory i don't like it in the middle of it i didn't know we were going
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.080]  to go that direction in the interview i want charlie show to continue um we're talking about
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.600]  over a billion dollars in syndication just left in this season and next season that that he's
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.080]  scheduled to do i mean that show's already made like three billion dollars folks uh so we're talking
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:51.280]  about a big situation here uh and um i was just excited to get charlie on to say hey great job
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.520]  not using drugs great job being clean and some of the things the media had said about him that
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.440]  weren't true and by the time i got him on to do the interview he's just like i know we talked
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.000]  about that but let's kind of cover these areas and i was like okay but i don't that all i'm saying
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.680]  is i care about charlie and he has a lot of passion and uh i just think he was trying to be
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.080]  absolutely off the chart yesterday to let folks know i don't care what you think about me
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:25.120]  and he feels like he's come out of a cult you know talking about a a and um i don't really know a
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:31.520]  lot about a a i know that some of the spinoff groups have it and and some of the uh drug addiction
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.960]  groups out there over the years do end up you know uh basically being called cults i mean what
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.520]  people say about Scientology he made the Scientologist comment about how they're the church of the
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:48.960]  Martian uh and uh man i tell you i mean he just he he just went wild uh and of course i talked to
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:57.280]  him last night that was a joke about thomas jefferson i mean i i uh you know i admire thomas jefferson
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.280]  immensely and our other founders and i know charlie's into the constitution the bill of
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.960]  rights i i think we happen to catch charlie at a particularly explosive point and um i just want
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:24.480]  all this to end well um but it is it is very strange to be involved in something that is as big
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.480]  as oj simpson at the height of that hysteria i mean this is that big i've been talking on
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.160]  national media and they say this is probably one of the biggest things to ever happen in the whole
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.520]  tabloid world and we're sitting here right in the middle of it no weapon form against us will
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:48.880]  prosper and we're gonna now be able to lead people to all this information about the globalist so i
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:56.480]  guess god's working some way through all of this i just want charlie to survive and prosper and for
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.560]  everybody else too as well but it was it was wild hello friends this is alex jones you've heard me

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:23.280]  all right i'm going to get into the geopolitical news also another runaway general army deploys
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.120]  scyops on u.s senators that's rolling stone we're going to get into what's happening with
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.480]  the one in stock exchange hit by a technical glitch yeah technical manipulation like that
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:42.080]  thousand point drop we saw in the new york stock exchange last year that little that little
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:53.680]  inside job operation that we saw last year but just briefly saying something else about the
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.840]  charlie sheen situation that exploded internationally on this broadcast yesterday
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:06.800]  um it was explosive it was uh out of the blue i didn't know we were going to get into some of
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.480]  those areas charlie was pretty wound up but i talked to him last night he's totally clean
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.400]  and i think he's just completely high on life can you imagine coming off seven months of
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.760]  intense drinking and other destructive things i mean the guy is is
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.200]  the guy is in a very interesting place and i appreciate listeners praying for him but
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.680]  it's almost like the drudge report was put on the map we've already on the map big time
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:40.800]  but he was put on the map when he broke the monica lawinsky story and uh people could say well what
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.800]  does it matter what bill clinton's doing you know the point is something that big can take a media
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:52.560]  operation and send it to a whole other level and that clearly is happening right now uh so i think
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.720]  a lot of good is going to come out of this i hope charlie doesn't lose this show though i know for
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.800]  years he hasn't wanted to continue it and has a lot of other big offers i just want him to stay
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:07.040]  clean get himself completely together he and he and he's together right now but on fire and wild
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:13.760]  and over the top on the show which i haven't seen him be like that in person uh and i just think
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.800]  he threw the gauntlet down to the world um and feels like he's breaking out of a gilded cage
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:24.800]  i think is the best way to put it but i do uh for some that were offended by some of the things he
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.840]  said uh obviously i apologize for that because we and charlie's been on the show probably 10 times
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:38.880]  i haven't counted it but close to 10 uh previously and and never had any of that happen uh but uh
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:45.440]  you know at the same time it's it's live dynamic radio with a guy who has um
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.320]  been through a lot you wouldn't believe his text messaging me over here they're just
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.040]  just just pouring in it's completely wild what's going on and and and you know the problem with
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.800]  having a gut instinct that i knew it'd be big getting charlie on and i thought we'd talk about
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:09.440]  hey he's clean and he's living life and major league three and uh let him dispel some of the
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:15.120]  false things that have been said and it just went a completely different direction and it freaks me
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:22.800]  out um i don't want that show to be canceled for the year canceled period but i mean charlie is the
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:31.200]  guy that makes the show so it's his life and i understand why he's mad at chuck lory um putting
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.560]  out vanity cards text essays at the end of the show attacking him when charlie was not saying
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.120]  anything about chuck lory and i think that's the biggest issue in the media that's wrong
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.560]  and it shows how hollywood always makes it about the stars being wrong and not the behind the scene
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.200]  stuff that goes on i think that's where the rage you saw came from but i said i'm getting that later
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:58.000]  in the hour um it's just obviously right now i'm almost shell shocked by all this because i i know i
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:08.000]  i don't even know what to say i mean i'm i'm just well speechless i was speechless during
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.280]  the interview it was it was off the charts um and it's really almost creepy to be getting this much
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.480]  attention right now i mean there's tv and radio networks all over the world tune into this broadcast
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.920]  right now and i'm here saying wow what should i be covering that's important for people to know about
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.600]  and that's why i got into all the mind control that's on record through the television set
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.720]  and through these new light bulbs that are that they admit are designed to flicker to put you
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.080]  into a mesmerized state or even physically have physical effects on you i mean i think that's
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.960]  pretty important for folks that are tuning in saying what is this show you know really all about
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:55.280]  well it's about serious issues happening in our world how many years if you're a long time listener
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.720]  or if you're a new listener you can just search the term you know pentagon spying on us citizens
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:06.960]  pentagon spying on congress mi six special air services spying on british parliament
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.760]  the parliament's the real british government should be the people's government the congress
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.440]  is the government how does homeland security tell them we're not going to let you have these
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.080]  documents or those documents in the intelligence committee or we're not going to give you the
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.240]  full text of george bush's executive order dealing with marshal law or we're not going to give you
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.360]  the full text of obama's executive order what does it mean when you see this going on
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:38.640]  on and what does it mean when we see headlines like this out of rolling stone it was rolling
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:44.960]  stone that brought down mccrystal last year probably one of the most influential magazines
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:51.360]  out there i know it's in the top three maybe vanity fairs is big and it's another runaway
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:14:00.400]  general army deploys psyops on senators and it goes on to basically say that
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.560]  lieutenant general william cadwell
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:14.480]  ordered mccrystal to engage in psychological warfare operations against congress and they
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:23.680]  certainly do this but when you read it this is standard operating procedure where the defense
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.120]  contractors deploy psyops on the generals to get them to lobby for the weapon systems they want
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.480]  the generals go and lobby and try to put on a show
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:42.400]  for the congress people i mean that's that's what they do i'm not saying it's a good thing
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.520]  but instead of getting into the confirmed reports of the total information awareness network
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:53.280]  the nsa google tracking politicians and people and collecting that dirt to then be put out
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.720]  through wiki leaks and others instead of them focusing on the real stuff that's going on
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.360]  they basically go after this lieutenant general william cadwell for things called well for things
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:16.160]  for things that aren't really what you call a real psyop see what i'm saying so very very suspicious
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:24.880]  on that front and i'm not one to shy away from the arena i get an opportunity to interview the
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.880]  former head of pakistani intelligence we get them on i have the opportunity to interview charlton
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.720]  heston we got him on i have the opportunity to interview charlie sheen uh during the biggest
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:43.360]  tabloid cycle ever seen with him or anybody else that matter i get him on uh and when rolling stone
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.800]  came here and interviewed me i stepped up and did it and i don't know when it's coming out or if
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.560]  it's going to come out or exactly what's going to happen but uh with that but i'll tell you i'm
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:59.040]  creeped out by the reporter seem nice enough but um if the reporter lied to me he's one of the best
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:04.400]  liars i've ever seen because you can just tell when somebody's lying to you but sometimes people
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.560]  are delusional they think they're right and so when they're telling you something you know it's
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.720]  it's you know kind of a spin or a riddle when they say oh it's going to be fair oh no i'm going to
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.880]  really show your side of things uh so we're going to find out though if and when that comes out uh
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.920]  but the u.s army legally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in psychological operations
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.960]  to manipulate visiting american senators into providing more troops and funding for the war
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.360]  rolling stone has learned and when an officer tried to stop the operation he was well-roaded by
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.640]  military investigators the orders came from command of lieutenant general william called wells
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.760]  calling cadwell sorry a three-star general in charge of training afghan troops the linchpin of
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:48.800]  u.s strategy in the war over a four month period last year a military cell devoted to what is known
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.800]  as information operations well those are admittedly run in the u.s when you see pro military pro war
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.960]  messages in movies it's paid for that's public but they don't report on that at camp eagles in
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.080]  cobble was repeatedly pressured to target visiting senators and other vip's who met with
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.640]  called well when the unit resisted the order arguing that it violated us laws for hitting
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.880]  the use of propaganda against american citizens it was subjected to a campaign of retaliation
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:26.560]  really really again this guy may be horrible but for all i know he's not playing ball they're just
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:34.960]  burning him continuing my job in scyops is to play with people's heads to get the enemy to behave
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.560]  the way we want them to behave said lieutenant colonel michael holmes the leader of the i o unit
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:46.960]  who received an official reprimand after bucking orders i'm prohibited from doing that to our
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:52.640]  own people when you ask me to try to use these skills on senators and congressmen you've crossed
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:59.280]  the line the list of targeted visitors was long according to interviews with members of the i o team
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.280]  and internal documents obtained by rolling stones those uh singled out in the campaign
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.560]  included senators john mccain joe Lieberman jack reid al frank and carl levin representative steve
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:13.920]  israel of the house of appropriations committee admiral mike mullen of the joint chiefs of staff
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:19.120]  so that's them targeting their own officers uh the check ambassador to afghanistan the german
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:26.240]  interior minister and a host of influential think tank analyst how is it scyops i mean i mean it's
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:33.200]  scyops that prepares whether it's white scyops or black scyops that that that prepares the briefing
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.600]  for what they believe needs to be done i mean when they make a power point to show a senator
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:44.240]  is that a scyop it's only a black scyop if there's lies in it and i read this whole article
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.760]  and it isn't clear where the lies are they're just saying it was their view of what they wanted
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:55.840]  so what do you expect frontline commanding generals to do and usually their best brains are in
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.280]  scyops who's gonna write the reports who's gonna sell whatever they want to do i'm not i want to
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.400]  leave right now i've had countless military officers on um anthony schaefer colonel schaefer
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:16.160]  others saying get out of there i end it now but the point is to say that generals are doing something
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:22.480]  big and nasty and dirty because they were trying to prepare their pitch for what they wanted i mean
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.400]  what do you think frontline generals do when the bosses come they go and tell them what they think
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:41.200]  should be done i mean it's crazy i don't know very looks like rolling stones being used
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.360]  like rude out generals the globalists aren't happy with but they have written an article
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.800]  attacking fox fallon they used what was a gq or vanity fair to bring him down because fallon
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.080]  wouldn't launch a preemptive attack on iran well come back get into what's happening in libya the

[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.840]  protesters libyans hold mass protests and push to house leader military forces
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:46.640]  organized in cities captured by the rebels are now beginning to mass to march on tripply
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.400]  where the dictator is still dug in oil production to shut down completely rebels say they have seized
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.320]  control of oil fields qaddafi orders four hundred dollars which doesn't sound like a lot here but
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  it is there that's more than a lot of them making a month per family as rebels closed in on tripply
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:10.400]  u.s paper reports u.s government characterized boat too small to rescue stranded americans

[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:50.080]  going more into libya analyst just a cnn more libyan bloodshed could prompt us nato intervention
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:56.560]  if the u.s military were to intervene in an increasingly chaotic libya it would most likely
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:02.000]  be part of a nato action what i say two days ago in which libyan bloodshed has reached a
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.400]  humanitarian crisis analyst said last night as reports emerge thursday about deadly clashes
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.000]  between leader muammar qaddafi's forces and anti-government protesters in the town of zawiya
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.240]  near tunisia analyst highlighted how qaddafi has already pledged to fight a rebellion to martyrdom
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.800]  and his top ministers are saying he will commit suicide like quote hitler did
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:30.960]  said continuing military intervention is something which i hope doesn't happen but it
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.920]  looks as though at some point that it should happen said simon hinderson senior fellow
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.760]  at the washington institute on neary's policy what's an acceptable number of civilian deaths
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.320]  i don't know you killed a million on in iraq globalist did i don't know choose your figure
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:53.840]  hinderson said at the very least instead of having a casualty list certainly in the hundreds
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.360]  possibly of the thousands we don't want a casualty list numbering in the tens of thousands or
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.400]  hundreds of thousands or so well the u n didn't care when hundreds of thousands were being hacked
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:11.840]  up and murdered in rwanda back in 94 they don't care about the what from two thousand from from
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:21.520]  1990 to 2003 the hundreds of thousands that died on record from the sanctions the lands
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.880]  that what said a couple years ago was over a million iraqis that have died because of the
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:31.280]  war since then so i mean how many years from 1990 in the middle of desert shield their
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:39.680]  desert storm in 91 uh into uh the whole situation uh with the invasion in 2003 how many years is
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:51.360]  that how many years we're talking about uh 20 years 1990 2011 almost almost 21 years uh that
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.160]  we're dealing with there i mean the same hypocrisy i'm talking about here and i'm not sinking off
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.920]  he's good good people overthrow him great but the globals are on record stimming uh rebellions
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:08.240]  against their tyranny and countries they control but then helping to overthrow nations not to bring
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.880]  stability not to let the people actually have self-determination but to basically destabilize
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.840]  things and then they say oh how horrible it is that he's reportedly strafing uh people trying to
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.120]  take over the capital and overrun military bases when the people running our country have over a
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:30.080]  thousand drones operating in iraq pakistan and afghanistan and they they called it acceptable
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:36.560]  to kill hundreds of innocent people in apartment buildings at weddings at at at markets outdoor
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:44.960]  markets to kill one supposed bad guy but then it's good when the globalists do it in our name
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:52.640]  but then it's bad when somebody else does it no it's bad when qaddafi does it and it's bad when
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.280]  the people running our country do it it's just that simple ladies and gentlemen this is twisted
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:04.720]  thinking uh that we're being sold here uh but we saw obama two nights ago what wednesday night uh or
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:10.160]  was it uh now time's flying was it was it tuesday night say for days we've been preparing a response
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:15.360]  into libya and and now we're seeing more and more reports that they're planning to send nato in there
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:23.040]  and qaddafi has been buying a lot of weapons for a long time and we've already seen oil prices go to
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:31.120]  the record since 2008 uh and other commodities just going parabolic ballistic straight up like a rocket
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:38.080]  uh we're gonna come back and get into libyan oil production to shut down completely b of a says
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.760]  libyans hold mass protests to push to alson leader covert us military support for libyan

[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.120]  on record that overthrew pristina and then when the serbs rolled into their own territory
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:36.560]  they uh the nato invaded it was u.s. backed muja hadin slash al qaeda that attacked the russians
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:42.080]  in 79 to elicit their invasion a year later that's rosinski wrote a book bragging about it how he
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:47.280]  engineered it all not saying the russians were little angel cakes i'm not saying qaddafi's a good
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:55.280]  guy i'm saying what they did the true story of what happened and you like the oil prices going up
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:00.800]  you like the fact that the media is saying oh middle east turmoil is going to cause the
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:06.720]  recession to come back they're going to blame the depression on it just as we told you we understand
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:15.440]  their game plan we see what they're doing covert u.s. military support for libyan opposition
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.200]  great report up on prison planet dot com
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:30.640]  also you can find it at land destroyer website it says covert u.s. military support for libyan
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:36.560]  opposition libyus qaddafi stands between the united states in their campaign of destabilization
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:42.400]  regime change across the oil laden region not only does this stall the anglo-american agenda
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.920]  it also sets a precedence of defiance of other sovereign nations may duplicate under similar
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:54.320]  u.s. backed instability and i wouldn't say u.s. backed occupied u.s. backed instability while all
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:02.000]  options are on the table the u.s. most likely has already provided libyus uh ibrahim sahad's men
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:09.840]  with military support well that's actually in the washington post they had already done so in 1984
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:16.000]  there is no doubt that the unrest in tunisia egypt and now libya is us backed libyan opposition
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  leader ibrahim sahad or sahid from pronouncing that right of the nationals front of the salvation
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.680]  of libya is literally sitting in front of the white house in washington dc giving interviews and he
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.960]  has links to those repeating verbatim the talking points covered by propaganda outfits like bbc
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:39.520]  cnn fox news now to zero meanwhile a myriad of us organizations are working in tandem uh with his
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:48.000]  calls for un e u u s and nato intervention it'll be nato with a un umbrella over it what form my
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.040]  intervention take and is there a possibility that the u.s. military support is already underway
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:00.400]  according to brookings institute reports says which path to persia it is very possible military
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.360]  operations and support were planned well ahead of time well we know they were uh in the case of
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:11.520]  egypt in regards to sparking a revolution in iran brookings concludes that iran will most
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.320]  assuredly crush it at any cost ensuring the revolution's failure you know they stood up
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:21.600]  against the iraqis that were given high-tech weapons and advisors from the u.s the iranians
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.480]  don't play games folks boy i tell you they try to have us invade that man that's going to be our
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.640]  waterloo and i know the globalists are running it but it will be our waterloo because they're
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.840]  dragging us with them into hades considering this brookings insists certain measures must be taken
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:42.000]  to diminish iran's ability to crush a revolution consequently the united states is to pursue this
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.800]  policy washington must take this possibility into consideration it adds some very important
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.680]  requirements to the list either the policy must include ways to weaken the iranian military or
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.880]  weaken its willingness of the regime's leaders to call on the military or else the united states
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.200]  may be ready to intervene to defeat it it's something we're seeing in libya one of the
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:07.040]  authors which path to persia globalist rand policy wonk and 911 commission whitewasher
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.520]  daniel byman has been quite vocal lately regarding libya and a piece written for slate
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:20.480]  titled things could get a lot worse in libya byman concludes by saying a massive invasion of libya
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.360]  is not going to happen rather he suggests the u.s organize the opposition to qaddafi
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.480]  encouraging a broad political front and urging military leaders to declare their support by us
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.480]  yeah the threat to invade just could could be a way to undermine qaddafi and make him look weak
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.560]  it turns out according to the library of congress federal research division archives that
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:52.160]  uh the u.s backed uh group under the control of sahad's nfs l had admittedly attempted to
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.240]  violently overthrow qaddafi in 84 the library of congress document goes on to explain that
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.600]  according to various sources the united states central intelligence agency cia trained and
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.200]  supported the nfs l before and after the failed coup with this backstory it is highly unlikely the
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:15.040]  u.s uh strategist naively expected a velvet revolution in libya and most likely modified
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.800]  their 1984 plan to overthrow qaddafi with armed rebels while president obama shamelessly lies
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.560]  of the world about us hands being clean of interference with libya sovereignty it appears
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:32.480]  that the nfs l has a long history of being supported and directed by the u.s most apparent
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:38.640]  was the nfs l's leaders currently operating out of washington dc it also appears that the nfs l
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.360]  is already armed to the teeth and waging a military campaign against qaddafi and then when qaddafi
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.760]  fights back against it it's called attacking civilians i would add uh and that's just a dishonest
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:51.760]  thing by the media i mean you can all be for doing this if you think it's good for america
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.320]  out there clearly it's not uh it's not good for our liberties good for our freedoms uh good for
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:04.480]  oil prices but um just don't lie to yourself that that this organically happened uh on the back of
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.640]  a u.s stoked regional instability even qaddafi himself is accusing the west of arming the nfs l
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.840]  in the latest round of living in unrest and the article goes on it's excellent excellent excellent
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:25.360]  research um from tony cartel luci of prisonplanet.com great job that guy's writing some really
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:31.200]  expert well researched articles for us on multiple time basis per day so i want to salute
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:38.000]  uh his work okay uh curtain demo has another article basically getting into this but detailing
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.840]  some other facets media demonizes qaddafi as pentagon prepares attack that's very important
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:48.720]  i mean we're talking about a new war how many more afghanistan pakistan iraq uh incursions into
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:54.880]  many other countries uh there's a big undeclared war been going on for years uh in columbia with
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:43:01.280]  us forces uh down there i mean it just goes on and on and on and on
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:11.120]  now shifting gears into charlie sheen with all this important world news going on
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:22.560]  we are forced to talk about this because we are in the middle of it i mean i've got
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:30.400]  every few minutes radio tv some of the biggest shows in the country wanting to fly me places
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:38.640]  satellite interviews lined up perpetually uh and at one level i'm not happy about it
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.720]  but uh at another level i know that we're going to be able to inject real issues
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:49.840]  while i'm on those programs i was able to plug info wars dot com repeatedly on msnbc today
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.000]  and on some other stations as well and i've been again invited to some of the biggest
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.880]  sit-down interview shows in the country and i i i don't want to go i don't want to face the tsa
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.360]  i don't want to uh i don't want to do it some of these shows you know demand that you be in studio
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:13.920]  with them um but i'll probably do it because it's a way to get the word out and charlie who's
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:20.160]  obviously gone through a lot and was in a very fired up angry mode yesterday the angriest i've
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:27.600]  ever seen him we kind of spun the wheel of fortune and when he came on it it rolled you know to a
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:37.200]  number that spelled explosion that's what happened and i've already several times because of some
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.600]  of the course language and things that we did did delay out but some on the internet heard it
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.640]  uh and apologized for that but i can't apologize for charlie he's who he is he's obviously feels
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:52.000]  like he's breaking out of a gilded cage uh and that a was a cult and then he's off alcohol and
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.600]  things by himself and he doesn't want to be basically oppressed by them and most of the
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.000]  people in his life were a people all the times i stated his house that's basically who was there
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.080]  was a this a that i'd ever seen him drink never seen him use drugs never seen him running around
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:13.680]  with women other than you know his wife uh in the many times i stated his house because when i'd be
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:18.960]  out there for a tv show or out there for conspiracy theory or out there doing research uh you know
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:25.360]  i'd stay at charlie's house i've stayed there for a week before and uh let me tell you the guy
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:30.800]  wasn't on drugs now seven eight months ago he started partying and it kind of led to what you saw
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.480]  he really did have the hernia problem i've seen his hernia the surgery had four years ago failed
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.880]  he has to go back and have surgery that is why he went to the hospital and i was going to get him
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:46.080]  on to explain that and that most of it wasn't uh true that that he didn't have blood spraying out
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:51.520]  of his nose uh that he never met these big list of women they said he was with in las vegas never
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.480]  met him the tattooed lady bombshell magie and the rest of it and that's what we were going to get
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.440]  him on about but then he just kind of shifted gears into other areas and it's because chuck lori
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:12.320]  um continued on and on and on and on to do vanity cards you know vanity cards are at the front and
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:21.360]  start of productions the mgm lion roaring uh is a vanity card at the front uh you'll see vanity
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:28.960]  cards at the end of some shows where it'll be a you know a robot laughing or an f-16 flying by uh
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.920]  or the vanity card with the production company at the end of conspiracy theory with jesse minterra
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.640]  is a b2 bomber swooping by for you know two seconds with the name of the production company
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:46.240]  you've seen our quote vanity cards it's really just logoing uh where you see an info wars dot com
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:55.600]  logo at the start and the end of our youtube videos um but they're called vanity cards this
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:01.760]  guy would do these big essays and then put them on the web and i don't know chuck lori um all i've
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.160]  heard about him is that he's treated charlie meanly over the years and blames everything on him when
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:12.960]  let's face it it's charlie is the show you know other folks support it and make it up uh but you
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:20.320]  know charlie said look it's my hernia okay i won't drink i shouldn't do this stuff i'm done but don't
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:25.120]  sit there and come out and leak stuff in the news this is what i privately heard charlie talk about
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.040]  now he's publicly talked about it and i'm saw him on the phone you know and they're with him talking
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:35.040]  to his manager i'm not going to get into you know much of that but the point is chuck would put stuff
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.920]  out or reportedly he would through the media that oh the the production team's mad at him now we're
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:45.040]  not going to have you know four of the episodes of the eight that are left which is you know paying
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.640]  people's paychecks there you know on the big crew because of charlie oh charlie's like look i had a
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.840]  problem and and i'm better now and i want to come back don't don't say i can't come back now
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.160]  and then sit there and blame me and then put out vanity cards not just on two and a half men
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.680]  i challenged the mainstream media to go look at the vanity cards on his other two hit shows he
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.880]  launched out of two and a half men where he basically says charlie is soulless and unhappy
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.640]  well that's what he thinks go help him go hug him be nice to him the guys made you hundreds of
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.640]  millions of dollars reportedly it's about 500 million charlie's made the guy makes like double what charlie
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:30.160]  does and on that one show and charlie's done things like give up part of his money uh to
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.600]  some of the lower paid people on the crew uh and his co-host not the kid but the other
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:44.720]  man what's his name john crier i mean this is charlie's given some of his money to the crew
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:53.120]  given it to to to crier and i heard charlie complained that then uh that uh lori uh doesn't
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.960]  doesn't do that and you know charlie it really looks down on people who are super wealthy
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:04.480]  and who don't give to charity like charlie does to breast cancer research and AIDS research
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:08.240]  he was a lot of his money to that that's on record he didn't brag about it but it's there
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.440]  and you know he just talks about lori uh you know they're at a premiere event or something and
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.160]  he watches lori not give the person at the bar when he gets a club soda a tip
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.920]  and this is a guy who's made 500 million dollars or more off the show and that's why charlie
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:30.640]  just just more and more gets angry at him and then charlie has to sit there and be blamed for
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:35.040]  everything when the show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for him he says okay i'm ready to come back
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:42.080]  right now and they say no and then they start putting vanity cards out saying i'm chuck lori
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.520]  i'm gonna live longer than charlie sheen you know i'm not a drug addict pathetic person i mean
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:53.520]  in fact guys i didn't print them will you print me chuck lori vanity cards attack charlie sheen
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.160]  i said let me just paraphrasing them there's a whole bunch of them chuck lori vanity cards
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:04.640]  attack charlie sheen i mean i mean it's incredible it's four or five of them i know and charlie
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.960]  would sit there and you know and talk to his manager people go i'm i've been told that if i
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:14.240]  criticize chuck lori and even say hey i'm ready to come back to work and don't blame things on me
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.520]  that that that that that that the show's gonna be canceled or i want to be fired and then he's
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:26.080]  he's attacking me at the end of the show i'm in and he said fine he laughed about it we're like hey
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:31.680]  charlie it's all right you know why don't you try to be friends with lori and he's like all right
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:36.320]  and then there's more stuff said about him and so basically i guess he was angry about that when
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:43.120]  he happened to come on my show and then it just exploded so i know the real charlie sheen the loving
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:48.720]  compassionate good guy he's angry he's tired of being lied about and if you walk a mile in his shoes

[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:29.200]  huge stars off the hook and they love to see big stars fall on their face
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:33.760]  that's how they're trying to spin it because they like to see somebody big in trouble makes
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:39.920]  people feel good some people out there but i just want to point out again that chuck lory the
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:46.320]  creator and the head of two and a half men just continued to attack charlie while using
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.880]  management pressure to keep charlie from responding and i just think that that is
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:59.440]  very regrettable and i mean what do you call it when you tie somebody's hands
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.920]  and then sit there and punch them in the nose don't say anything or the show's over
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.840]  see chuck's got two other hit shows now maybe you didn't want to run three shows
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:16.640]  sometimes charlie thinks that might be what's going on i mean chuck needs to respond to this
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:24.880]  now it is being reported in fact here's the headline out of the associated content chuck lory
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:31.600]  vanity card suspended along with men so obviously somebody in management said look chuck and by
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:35.840]  the way i went all over national tv last night and pointed this out i said okay you can sit there
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:41.680]  and try to judge charlie all day but what about chuck lory what about him what about him doing
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:47.760]  this what is he doing i don't know him from the man the moon i don't have any beef with chuck lory
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.160]  i didn't know all this was going to happen on air but come on chuck i mean you sit there and you
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.640]  attack somebody while the management of cbs is telling charlie sheen to sit there and take it
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:06.560]  and you can go to chuck lory dot com and read the hundreds of these and uh where he just says
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:16.560]  incredibly horrible things about charlie sheen and talks about emptiness and soleness of charlie
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:25.280]  sheen and how he's going to outlive charlie sheen or he'll be mad if he doesn't and it's just hard
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.960]  to even repeat all this stuff here on air and i don't know how the media could try to spend this
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:38.560]  and i understand that charlie has rage and is angry about this when chuck lory is the one that started
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:48.400]  it i mean even in law they they call it a a crime of passion well charlie hasn't committed any crime
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.440]  here but but but the point is if you go up and insult somebody or if a man comes in and finds
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:57.120]  his wife with another man a lot of times the husband doesn't even get in trouble for what he
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:03.200]  does because people understand it's a crime of passion well this isn't a crime but it's it's
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:09.600]  it's it's being spun like it is almost by the media i mean here's a chuck lory productions
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:14.320]  number three two nine i exercise regularly i eat moderate amounts of healthy food i make sure to
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.520]  get plenty of rest i see my doctor once a year and my dentist twice a year i floss every night
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:26.400]  i've had checksets raised cardio stress tests ekgs and colonoscopies i see a psychologist and
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:31.440]  have a variety of hobbies to reduce stress i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do drugs i don't have
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  crazy reckless sex with strangers if charlie she not lives me i'm going to really be and he says
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:42.960]  a little profanity there but the point is that that's not even one of the bad ones i mean you
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:47.520]  know he talks about charlie being soulless and all this stuff no charlie's got a soul we all do
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:51.760]  and it's a it's a it's a soul under a lot of pressure and a lot of torment he's a guy who
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:56.640]  had the courage to come out for 911 truth he's a real guy and that's why i care about him and
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:03.040]  it is scary to see what's going on and i was blown away by what happened it came out of the blue
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:08.720]  for me and you and it's now a giant international news story and i just want to see charlie back on
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:15.040]  a show or back to a new show or whatever he wants but happy with his family and it's just he's in the
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:21.680]  middle of los angeles in all of that globalism and craziness and uh i went out there to try to
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:29.200]  you know support him and uh i just wish i could you know be be around him more to try to help him
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:34.160]  because uh everybody around me said look at you're really a good quote influence on him uh

[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:15.200]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.480]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous

[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:33.600]  jones okay what i want to do is get into the economy the bizarre glitch on the london stock exchange
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:38.000]  like one we saw last year with a thousand point drop clear manipulation going on there
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.480]  i want to get into everything that's happening in libya i want to get into some good news virginia
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.800]  okay's bill that will close most abortion clinics moving in the right direction there
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:55.440]  thank god and for all your prayers and action i've got a lot to talk about uh here but since
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.600]  we were just ending with it maybe in the short segment talk about it bob Chapman have you seen
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:07.760]  the charlie sheen firestorm i've heard about it and i haven't read your i heard your tape yet
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:12.720]  because i've been so buried but i do have it and then i will listen to it well bottom line
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.520]  anyway you slice it it's bringing ultra massive attention to this radio broadcast and what's
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:23.040]  going on in the new world order uh and so um hopefully good will end up coming out of it
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.600]  i'm just worried about charlie what do you think of his uh the crater two and a half men with the
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:32.960]  vanity cards putting out public essays on tv at the end of the show calling charlie sheen
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.080]  horrible names and then behind the scenes charlie being told not to respond or he'd be fired
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.520]  well i've heard about that and um from what i understood this morning
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:53.440]  that they had terminated the show yes and um well not terminated next season yet
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:02:03.360]  that he said four episodes left yeah um as sort of seems like the network is uh biting off its own
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:13.520]  tongue uh i guess to get back at charlie um i i can't understand why they would make such
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:20.720]  a foolish business decision uh maybe they want to try to destroy him i don't know but
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:28.080]  uh i don't think they're gonna be able to do that um he's had you know a lot of problems all of his
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.120]  life uh it's not easy being famous how you lived out in that area don't you know them
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.880]  well i know his father fairly well because we used to go to church all the time together
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:46.720]  and uh we'd often talk before and after and let me tell you i know martin sheen pretty darn good
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:55.760]  that is a super real centered classy guy well he's he's very devout and uh and i think i'm just
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:02.880]  guessing uh i think that when he had the heart attack i think it was either during or after
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:11.520]  the filming of a couplets now that i i think it changed him dramatically and um
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:20.640]  um and you know his thought processes and everything else and you know we lived in malibu for years
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:30.560]  and it's really the fast lane believe me and i had two children that i brought up there
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:38.800]  and it was very very very difficult and i coached everything i knew all the families and the kids and
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:48.480]  and many many many famous people and um so i know how difficult it was and even with all the efforts
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:55.680]  that i made and trying to protect the children uh sometimes even from their parents uh because in
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:02.560]  those days uh during the 70s and 80s there was a lot of drugs going on and uh but i did a pretty
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:10.880]  good job of it and very few of the kids getting involved in it and uh but it was quite an experience
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:17.360]  and you know i didn't really realize that that's what you know was going to get into when i when i
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:25.360]  went there in fact as it turns out all together i coached for about 35 years with children in
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:33.520]  different sports particularly uh soccer which i i enjoyed very much and it was much easier to coach
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:40.880]  than some of the other ones but uh uh getting back to the network absolutely stay there let's
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.160]  finish up with this then get into what's happening geopolitically uh all over the world uh on the

[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:49.040]  melio estvez charlie sheen obviously the biggest story in the country isn't libya though we're
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.360]  been covering that mainly or is it the oil prices going up or any of the stuff happening it's
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:09:00.000]  charlie sheen's interview yesterday where he was just not even trying to be as shocking as possible
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:10.320]  i mean he was just uh just just like completely wild uh and angry at chuck lorry uh and uh making
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:14.560]  a lot of jokes and most of it you know he was being that's how he deals with it is the humor i
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:21.360]  know the humor side of charlie uh but um he'd also had some shenanigans go on the first night he
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:25.840]  got to the bahamas that i'm not going to get into so and uh he'd taken a nap right before we got him
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:35.840]  on air and it was just it was it was it was wild uh and uh i don't know where it's going to go from
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.760]  here but uh one goodbye product is it is that info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and the
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:47.760]  syndicated radio broadcast that covers absolutely vital information for mainline fluoride tv heads
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:53.360]  they're now finding this information they're now tuning in here right now uh you you got cut off by
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:57.040]  the break bob we're going to move into the other things happening in the world and we've set our
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.880]  peace on what's happened with charlie we all want to pray for him and his family and uh that he
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.840]  continued to be clean and that the show get back or whatever he wants happens you know dealing with
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:10.960]  that it's his life but you were trying to finish up with the network allowing chuck lorry the creator
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.800]  to put these vanity cards most people have like a little logo at the end of the show he has an
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:21.920]  assay there saying charlie's soulless and basically garbage saying that he's gonna outlive charlie
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.880]  and then charlie's told behind the scenes you don't respond or will cancel the show that just sounds
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:33.120]  like a bunch of hollywood people on power trips thinking they can push him around and i guess
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:37.760]  because he suppressed it in the last month his anger at it uh that it exploded on this show
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.960]  uh and you were trying to finish up dealing with the network and your view on that bob Chapman
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:48.000]  oh i think they're just trying to get back at him and it's going to cost him a lot of money
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:57.200]  and uh it's foolish willful and uh charlie is with the lit is and they know that and incidently
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:04.800]  he was a great baseball player when he was a kid and uh and i think uh they made a bad mistake
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:11.840]  uh everybody makes mistakes and they should have said well clean your act up and come back and
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:16.080]  we'll get over this but no they took an aggressive position and they shouldn't have done that
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:24.880]  you know not everybody in life goes through life without having problems and i don't think
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:31.680]  people can understand the tremendous pat pressure people in the movie industry are in
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:38.480]  in some other industries as well and you have to take that uh into account i mean every way you
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:46.320]  go they say oh there's charlie can i talk to you charlie whatever and that's pressure believe me
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:54.000]  and their life isn't even their own and and so i think people should be easy on them
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:01.200]  you know we all have the potential of making mistakes and i'll leave it at that
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:08.240]  that's a good place to leave it uh let he without sin cast the first stone um i i was gauging it
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:13.520]  yesterday and at a certain point i knew that we were getting into dangerous territory but i could
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:20.720]  either shut the interview down uh because there wasn't going to be any any um any stopping charlie
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:25.360]  from what he was saying and i and i didn't really know even what the outcome would be it may be a
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:31.360]  good outcome uh you know that he is basically he's told me privately in on air he said i'm tired everybody
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:36.400]  told me what to do everybody suppressing me the media exaggerating what i do me always giving
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:40.960]  giving giving giving giving and then being lied about and and he was outraged by lori being able
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:49.040]  to do this and so basically uh he just blew up on my show uh and i mean haven't we all blown up
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  privately at home or at work ourselves and done some things he just happened to do it here and you
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:59.520]  have to ask you know is it justified for him to be angry at lori and he's going through all this
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.160]  stress and it's now detoxed you imagine after a seven month party you know he's been clean now
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:11.200]  for just about a month what he feels like right now bob oh emotionally it's extremely difficult
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:17.120]  to handle because you gotta consider what got him into the situation he was in in the first place
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:22.640]  and i saw lots of that you know going through life uh particularly during the 60s 70s 80s when
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:31.120]  uh drugs were degreger or alcohol or whatever and we still see a hangover from it uh there was
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:38.800]  tremendous a loss of of great people because of those episodes and so you know cut the guy a little
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:48.880]  slack now shifting gears into the wider world uh what's happening with commodities gold silver
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:54.880]  the weird glitch on the london uh stock exchange suffered a second embarrassing system glitch that's
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.720]  when they're manipulating things we'll talk about that thousand point drop from last year we visit
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:04.400]  that to tie it in in a week on friday when uk share trading failed to start on time angering
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.440]  clients keen on trades because of attention in libya and that's because they're doing manipulation
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:15.440]  behind the scenes before they launch it give us your take on that also cnbc reporting you
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:21.760]  must be the world's third largest economy from number one uh what's happening you know in libya
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:29.760]  mediev the president of russia saying this could go on for years and could drive up oil prices
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:39.200]  nato openly talking about now uh in a un us nato led invasion of libya uh and the type of weapons
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:43.360]  that muammar qaddafi has bob chavin you've got the floor for the next six minutes before you
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:49.600]  got a break give us your geo political view on all of this well i think in libya you've got
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:56.240]  you're right back to a tribal situation and you know most people overlook this uh uh but you got
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:03.040]  it all over the world not only in africa and and but you got it in europe uh and and places other
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:11.520]  places in the world and um these are probably animosities that have been uh these below the
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.000]  surface for many years and now uh mr qaddafi is under pressure to get out and they're taking
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:23.520]  advantage of it um the russians they have a reason to to gloat over this because if oil prices are
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.880]  high they make lots more money and so you can understand in part where they might be coming
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:36.480]  from and uh no i don't think that's going to go on for years and years i think the changes will
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:42.000]  will come about over the next couple of years in all of those countries whatever is going to happen
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:53.680]  and uh uh having the nato or un or whoever it is go into settle things in in libya i really
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:16:02.800]  don't think that's a good idea um if you know if people are trapped in there that that are americans
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:09.280]  or british or whatever and they can't get out sending people in you know your military in
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:17.920]  might be a good idea um sometimes he hesitates is lost and i think you know it's something that's
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:25.040]  on the table and uh i'm sure that in washington and the pentagon they're talking a great deal about it
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:32.880]  and um you know qaddafi wants to stay he wants to increase wages 150 percent and uh
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:39.760]  which would be uh four hundred dollars a family or something like that but this is x post facto
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:46.000]  the damage has been done he's bombing and strafing his own people i mean these are not
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:53.280]  people who are engaged in warfare against them these are people like you and i and our kids and
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:17:00.720]  grandkids and he should have never done that the guy's got to go and uh spending the money that
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:06.800]  belongs to them to shut them up it's not the right thing i mean he's been there 42 years my issue is
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:12.320]  how do we have a thousand drones bombing people and saying they can kill 200 to get one one bad guy
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:16.960]  and that's acceptable but then sit there and moralize i mean we can moralize on it because we're
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:21.600]  not doing it but you know the globalist moralize about qaddafi strafing people when that's exactly
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:28.160]  what the globalists do well you're right about that and it's a it's a very good point to bring up
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:32.240]  it just shows you that the globalists are every bad as a bit as bad as qaddafi is
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:40.080]  let that sink in everybody bob where do you expect it to go in libyum oh i think uh you're
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:48.560]  going to see outside forces go in probably the united states and uh i think that part of this whole
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:57.040]  thing that has happened throughout the area region we'll call it is to keep things in political and
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:03.760]  social turmoil and the reason for that is that sooner or later the people behind the scenes
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:10.080]  will have the united states and perhaps probably israel move against iran and they don't want any
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:18.400]  competition and you can use neutralize competition by having everybody upset with a new government
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:25.920]  or a new compromise government or a government in each country that's been cobbled together
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:35.440]  and they're not going to be in a position even if they're pro- iranian or anti to act in relation
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:46.240]  to something that happens in iran and the u.s hasn't given up nor israel they've not given up the
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:54.800]  hope that they can go in there and neutralize iran it's obvious that that's what they want to do and
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:02.000]  this could be a stepping stone by having all of this unrulyness going on where no one can go
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:10.640]  and aid iran and you know there are states that the iranians don't like such as saudi arabia and
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:19.600]  um and that into it into it as well but i think it's going to go on for a while
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:25.280]  several months probably uh but i don't think it's going to last for years i think the russians are
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:32.160]  wrong uh although they're pretty good at counterintelligence i know i worked against them
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:39.200]  but but bob the globalist program according to brazilian others is to have this go on for years
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:44.320]  that's what lindsay williams is saying is planned with a domino effect but you're saying you don't
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:48.400]  see that happen i want to throw out at you a few of the things that lindsay williams said that his
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:54.400]  sources told him uh earlier this week and and get your view on that they don't want to talk about

[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:41.440]  bob uh getting into what's happening in the stock markets the merger or the takeover by the germans
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:48.160]  in the e-u of the new york stock exchange max keiser says so that's so they can engage in more
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:54.640]  behind the scenes fraud and manipulation and not get caught london stock exchange hit by technical
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:25:02.000]  glitch what's your view on all this going on well i think max uh first of all is uh uh right about
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:09.840]  that uh they were after the the germans were after the uh derivatives business because uh quite
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:15.280]  frankly i think they they want to control it but i think they want to clean it up as well
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.760]  it's something that could bring down the whole financial system very easily
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:28.400]  also i see the merging of these different exchanges as a ultimate move toward one
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:36.800]  eventual major exchange and so i think that's where they headed with this the new york stock
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:45.280]  exchange because of electronic trading had become anachronistic and uh the best part of it was the
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:52.800]  derivatives and that's what they were after uh as far as these non openings your take is right they
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:26:00.000]  probably were making sure that they protected themselves before they opened the market up
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.440]  market players in england are much closer to one another than they are in the united states uh that
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:14.800]  that's more of a fraternity than a competing situation i did a lot of business in london
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:20.880]  over the years when i was a broker in fact it was one of the main places i did business for
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:32.400]  about 15 years uh until uh they had the suato riots in uh south africa in uh august of 75 i
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.400]  i knew from then on out there was going to be real trouble in south africa and so i switched over
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:46.560]  mostly to north america mining stocks but the point is that yes those things happen they do what
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:53.600]  they want to do i mean it's unbelievable and you know you you see the uh uh the regulatory
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:27:03.520]  agencies do things from time to time but they always seem to miss the big episodes the things
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:09.920]  that happen that shouldn't happen among the major firms both in england and frankflett
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:15.440]  but more in the united states let me just back up he is totally unresponsive let me just back up
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:25.120]  something you said earlier we forget that merkel went absolutely ape um just last year and said
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.640]  it's the big private central banks they are criminal we've got to do something about them or
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:35.360]  they're going to bring down the entire financial system so there's even infighting and that really
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:40.480]  backs up what you're saying the germans have not been engaged in in as much as this is the us
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:45.920]  britain and others and uh you know the germans actually want to build an economy they actually
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.720]  want to have factories they want to have jobs why is germany followed a different path though
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:56.240]  they are the heart of the e u uh than the deindustrialization campaign in england and the us
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:05.680]  well i think the major reason is that it's a complex that they received after having been
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:12.800]  in world war two and i lived in germany for a long time and i speak german and not as
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:21.600]  as good as i used to and um i really understand deeply the people in germany as an outsider
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:27.920]  and i lived all over germany and uh i think merkel may have put her foot in the mouth when
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:34.560]  she said that and then just recently she said well germany is going to save the euro no matter what
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:40.720]  and then a couple of days later the chinese came in and bought some bonds from uh greece portugal
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:50.480]  in spain and then the germans have uh devoted the largest part of the amount of money which is
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:55.200]  about a trillion dollars to bail out the six countries that got problems well they knew
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:00.240]  from the very beginning and i wrote about it that the bill is going to be three to five trillion
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:07.440]  and so she says well we're gonna we're gonna save the eurozone well they just had an election
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:14.480]  last weekend and her constituency originally in the hamburg area the wealthiest area of germany
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:21.840]  that state had their elections and the cdu which is the christian democratic union
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:28.480]  which is her party had bombed why did they get bombed they don't want to give any more money
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:36.160]  to these people who they think lead a profligate life in those countries that are all in financial
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:41.120]  trouble and bob and we've got to go to break but you've been predicting the fall of the euro let's

[02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:14.560]  thank you
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:30.000]  we're here talking about the state of the world obviously things are heating up and getting
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:35.280]  crazier and crazier by the minute looking at gold looking at silver looking at other commodities
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:41.600]  looking at mortgage gate that is continuing to explode there's no doubt this debt black hole
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:46.560]  that the globalists have created is impossible to pay back we don't owe it break down where we
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:53.040]  are currently in the economy and then looking forward your forecast for the euro for the dollar
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:59.360]  these moves towards dollar devaluation commodities prices going up food prices going up spurring
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:04.400]  more rebellion worldwide bob you've got the floor give us an analysis break it down for us
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:11.680]  well i think uh the dollar with the usdx which is uh six of the major currencies versus the dollar
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:17.280]  and one of those is the euro i think you're going to see the dollar go up and down
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:25.760]  um up when the stock market's up or when things are going relatively good at least for a short
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:32.160]  period of time and then all of a sudden you'll have a problem uh perhaps with the grease or
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:38.480]  island or portugal or whatever and then the the the euro will go to go back down again
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:43.920]  and that that is the most heavily weighted in the usdx it's around 57 percent of the total
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:52.080]  and so it's going to be a up and down wobbly year uh although i think the dollar will tend to
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:59.360]  to be lower than it is and has been recently um as far as the the us economy's concern
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:05.360]  um i was looking for two to two and a quarter percent ghost growth this year they just come
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:12.240]  out with new figures the last year today they said the economy grew 2.8 percent and that included
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:20.400]  2.5 trillion dollars combination of stimulus and what the fed reserve made up out of thin air
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:27.440]  which is 1.7 trillion of that we're going through the same thing again only i call it the law of
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:33.520]  diminishing returns you throw money at things and it works but the next time you do it it
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:40.560]  doesn't work as well and so we're going for 2.8 percent growth with all that stimulus of one
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:48.000]  form another down to two to two and a quarter but we now have oil selling at much higher prices
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:54.640]  than it was previously when i made that estimate oil was selling for around 70 dollars and so
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:02.240]  if we're going to persistently have problems in the middle east and let's say that oil for the
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:09.360]  next six months stays at 100 dollars a barrel or even for a year it's going to cost the american
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:20.720]  taxpayer the consumer about 150 billion dollars which cannot go into buying things in the american
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:28.720]  economy the money is going to go out to others who we buy 65 percent of our oil from and so that's
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.720]  going to be a drag in the economy so my figures might have to be adjusted back to one and a quarter
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:40.720]  to one and a half or one and three quarters percent somewhere in that vicinity and that's not very
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:49.840]  good that means if we have the persistence of higher oil prices in particular and i didn't
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:55.600]  even mention higher food prices which i think we're going to have much higher food prices
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:02.640]  going up for the next one to two years then the economy is not going to grow as well it might
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:11.040]  the figures might even be lower and we have some unknowns out there so i think that the american
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:17.040]  economy is going to flounder last may in this program i said we're going to have qe2 and qe3
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:25.920]  and maybe more and i think qe3 is uh going to be on people's lips in washington and wall street
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:33.600]  probably starting in july or august like it did last year and i think we're going to get it and the
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:43.600]  reason why is because of the relative failure of the economy because of perhaps outside influences
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:52.320]  such as higher prices and petroleum products and food and they'll be justified in doing it at least
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:58.480]  the public will think that they are one in fact they really aren't but that's another whole area
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:04.320]  to get into and so in order to keep the system going they got to keep interest rates where they are
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:15.760]  officially and they have to have qe3 and they're also going to have to deal with the domestic
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:24.880]  problem of the municipalities and the states i mean in california and jerry brown went to his
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:32.400]  fellow democrats and said well let's clean this mess up and he said no so and now he's going to
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:37.360]  so and now he's going to have to take unilateral action this is the kind of thing that people
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:46.000]  in government are running into and you see it in wisconsin and indiana and i ohio and you'll see
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:52.640]  more of it people don't want to give anything up but the bills have to be paid and something's
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:58.480]  got to be done and so you have this internal problem and it's going to learn to lean toward
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:04.880]  layoffs and that means that employment can't really get a whole lot better if at all
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:13.120]  so you may have a sideways movement in the economy but it made me what they used to call
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:19.120]  profitless prosperity and that's where i think the economy is leading and we're going to have
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.840]  real inflation this year especially the second half of the year well we're already seeing that
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:32.560]  and you'd forecasted that years ago you called 2011 is when we'd really see it ramp up but i mean
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:39.120]  where does this lead well it could lead to hyperinflation because i'm looking for an increase
[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:45.840]  of seven percent from seven percent where we're at in real inflation right now and that's a middling
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:52.960]  figure from private economists some of them are like john williams's got two figures one is five
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:58.800]  and three quarters the other's nine and a quarter and we're going to 14 percent this year and if
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.520]  they have qe three and the same thing that they've been doing before you're not going to have hardly
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:09.520]  any growth at all and at the same time you're going to have stagflation which is stagnation
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:15.920]  with inflation and what will it be could be 20 percent could be 25 we don't know until we get there
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:23.840]  there now i want to get into lindsay williams and his predictions not even predictions what
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:30.160]  ken from told him and then what the other living former oil ceo told him just earlier this week
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:35.040]  he broke that news here he did say four months ago in october look for the middle east to be
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:41.360]  destabilized and blow up look for oil prices to go to 150 200 a barrel within six months to a year
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:47.600]  here and basically look for the death of the dollar at the end of 2012 is what his source
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:52.800]  is told him doesn't mean his sources or omnipresent have all the answers just because they're in
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:41:00.800]  higher globalist circles but what's your view on the statements he made well i think that
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:07.280]  it's possible particularly if we have a war with arant i mean it's a given we don't know
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:14.720]  what's going to happen in between like the russians and in lindsay say well we're going
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:21.920]  to have continual boiling social and political problems maybe even military problems in the
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:27.920]  middle east for some time to come um i don't i don't know that that is going to continue that
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:37.920]  badly i mean these people they want to eat uh they're not generally interested in warfare and so
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:44.960]  i would think they'll all try to get their acts together and to varying degrees six months to a
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:52.880]  year things could calm down which leaves one to believe of i'm right maybe this coming summer
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:59.760]  or might be the time the united states decides that they want to curtail what arant's doing
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:08.560]  i always in the back of my mind think of what's happened in the past and every time
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.720]  governments get in trouble they have a war and that's how i was able to predict something
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:20.720]  like 9 11 and the invasions of iraq and afghanistan and there's a good chance
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:27.600]  that finally after everybody's been talking about it for a long time we may have the united
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:37.360]  states go into iran and that certainly could make oil go to 120 150 maybe even 200 a barrel we don't
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:44.240]  know the possibility exists it could be a very volatile region because the united states wants
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:51.680]  it to be and how about all the countries that are trying to change government we don't know how long
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:59.440]  it will take and so there's big question marks there but the possibility of higher oil prices
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:07.600]  are very good the probability we can't say it i want to shift gears now specifically in the
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:12.880]  gold and silver i mean if you look at the 11 10 year graph it's only going straight out in fact
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:17.760]  let's put the 11 or 10 year graph up on screen for prison planet dot tv viewers radio listeners
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:24.320]  just search the term 10 year or now it's been 11 11 year uh gold graph and it's going straight up
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:30.000]  but on the way up there's little dips and the general public's been put in this weekly or
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  monthly view that every time gold or silver drops a little before racing back up always getting new
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.080]  heights they're saying it's over it's over for gold and silver but then you look at all the
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:45.200]  fundamentals gold and silver should only go up with global currency devaluations led by the dollar
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:50.480]  and you know now we've seen a giant explosion you can give us the actual numbers in the last
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:56.880]  what week or two in gold and silver and and all the other major commodities rocketing oil grain
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:01.840]  you name it but you know the globalists are hoarding gold but they sell the public on
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:06.560]  i mean every time gold goes down 20 bucks or something or silver two dollars i got emails
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:12.160]  six c you've been wrong and i'm like i've been wrong for 11 years uh silver was five dollars
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:18.240]  gold was 260 when i started recommending it and people i mean it's like you're right and then
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:23.520]  you're wrong because you're you're right because i guess people don't want to admit they were wrong
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:31.120]  to not buy gold and silver bob you capsized it and you know i've been doing the gold and silver
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:38.480]  genre for over 50 years and as you pointed out earlier i was the top stockbroker in gold and
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:47.920]  silver shares for 28 years almost 29 years and bull markets always climb a wall of worry
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:56.320]  and anybody can have their own opinion and that's okay whether it's on the street corner talking to
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:04.960]  somebody or on a program on radio but there's very few people who come on who are real professionals
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:14.400]  in this field and i am and i know and i knew in 2000 where this was headed and the subscribers of
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:22.960]  the forecaster have been long gold and silver since silver was 380 and gold was 252 dollars
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:31.040]  announced and they've kept their assets together they've been protected and they probably some of
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:36.080]  them made an enormous amount of money already and i got people out of the surreal estate market as
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:41.520]  well i got them out of the stock market twice before they went down precipitously and that's
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:49.840]  why the globalists have persecuted you well they've been persecuted me since 1967 you get used to it
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:55.040]  but uh and i don't worry about that because uh i'm too old to worry about it well bob i
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:59.280]  where do you see gold and silver going because i want to bring i want to bring ted anerson in
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:05.520]  right now ted 30 plus years in gold and silver business uh ted where do you see it going well i
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:09.920]  can tell you right now i'm watching this market i mean we're looking right now at a high of 33
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:17.520]  dollars and 23 cents announced today in silver 14 1280 and gold uh the market is hot elix i'm
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:23.920]  looking at the gas prices here in minnesota now we're at about 332 per gallon i mean come on
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:31.440]  it it's just you know then you have this middle east thing cracking down like it is i mean i would
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:37.440]  not be surprised to see gold over 1600 dollars an ounce and it certainly wouldn't surprise me to see
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:43.680]  silver over 40 dollars an ounce i mean i you know it wouldn't take but just a little bit of a week
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:50.400]  long movement to be look at 39 dollar an ounce silver it's just that that's the way it is now
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:57.120]  i mean it's building momentum and yes indeed there's a lot of pressure from you know the powers above
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:02.560]  government that are trying to can suppress the prices because their game is to keep people in
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:07.920]  paper money they want to support this thing but my you know like you say if it's like holding a
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:12.880]  beach ball underwater eventually it gets out of their hands and it comes popping up even further
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:17.840]  and that's what's going on the value of the dollars falling the value of silver and gold is rising
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:24.000]  i mean that the people i i'm just excited to know and that we have sold as many of your videos with
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:28.800]  the silver dollar deal that we have i mean it's just you know that's getting the information in
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:33.120]  the people's hands it's also getting silver dollars in the yeah i mean i have to say support the
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:37.760]  network support mitis that's that's just you know sister to it but quite frankly ted i know that
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:44.000]  you're actually losing money on the silver deal and this was the deal you came up with but i mean
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.120]  when i say on air that ted does this as a loss leader so that you'll get introduced to silver and
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:59.040]  gold you get three silver dollars for ninety seven dollars and that's basically at spot or even below
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:04.400]  it uh correct me if i'm wrong and then you get free shipping a six or seven dollar value i guess
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:09.920]  for that after handling it's about a ten dollar value and then three of my films obama deception
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:15.280]  fall the republic in game three separate dvds you know cover case everything that's over a seventy
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:22.960]  dollar value free and getting a smoking deal on silver coins what type of silver coins are they
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:27.920]  ted well these are the old silver dollars that were commissioned by the united states government
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:34.560]  back in seventeen seventy six to be used as money here in the united states it's the last issue they
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:40.880]  call it the peace the peace dollar series which came out right after world war one to commemorate
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:48.000]  the the end of all wars and to have the peacetime obviously a big joke but nonetheless this is
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.880]  constitutional money these are the real silver dollars dollars that were used here in the united
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:57.760]  states for money so they correct me if i'm wrong they do you wouldn't call them fully numismatic but
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:01.840]  don't they have a collector value they sure do okay so that's even better bob chavin let me just
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:09.200]  ask you how good of a deal is that the ted just offered it's excellent it's very good and uh it
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:16.400]  it's one of the ways to invest in silver and everybody out there knows what a silver dollar is
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:23.280]  and so if someday you have to spend it rather than turn it into a dealer and get cash for it to
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:28.640]  go buy something if you're forced to use it for barter everybody knows what it is and the same
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:36.000]  thing is true with the uh pre sixty four ninety percent dimes quarters and halves the same situation
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.440]  everybody knows what they are and let's give folks the numbers gold is up six dollars and ninety
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:48.080]  cents fourteen hundred and nine dollars zero zero cents uh we're silver today uh silver right now
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:52.560]  presently just let me uh look at it real quick here thirty three dollars twenty two cents seen a
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.280]  high today of thirty three twenty three so so so more than ninety nine dollars for you to buy those
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:02.000]  coins at spot and you can't do that pretty much anywhere ted bought these when they were a little
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  bit lower that's how he can give you this deal but there's is there any profit in fact ted there's
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.320]  no profit in this deal for you is there no no we're losing money as a matter of fact my traders
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:17.760]  are telling me that i'm nuts uh i'm going to just carry this deal through monday if i still have
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:22.960]  silver at thirty three dollars plus an ounce i'm not going to be over all right folks and they'll

[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:41.120]  get we'll be back this sunday four to six p.m. we're dwelling on monday as well i've got a bunch
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:47.200]  of national media wanting to fly me out to different events to be in studio i don't normally do that
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:51.280]  some of these shows are so big though they don't have satellite interviews there are only a few
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:56.000]  of them probably put your put your minds together and figure that out i don't even want to do it
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:03.360]  but i'll probably end up doing it because i like to step up to the plate just like bob
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:09.360]  chatman's done for 45 years fighting the new world order bob in summation how do you think things
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:16.800]  are going for the globalist these days well i think it's mixed um i i think that things have
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:22.480]  happened in the middle east that they didn't want to happen but that goes with the territory but
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:26.000]  there's evidence of them triggering a lot of it i mean you really don't think they're involved no
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:32.880]  no i that's that's the that's the initial take that i had on the whole thing and weps the tarply is
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.800]  as far as i know is the only other one who took it almost exactly the same way i did a distraction
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:45.200]  from the financial and economic problems in in europe and the united states and then getting rid of
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:55.360]  mubarak who did not want the united states to evade invader ran and then the social political
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:56:04.320]  problems that went on and to get thrown in there a contract cia employee killed a few people in
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:11.680]  pakistan and they pulled him out of there and uh that didn't go down well with anybody and so that
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:18.240]  certainly is hurt their ambitions um i think it's a mixed bag and they're going to have to take a
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:23.520]  while to put it back together again and that's why we're going to have social and political
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:31.200]  changes in turmoil if you may i think the qaddafi thing will end rather quickly uh they just keep
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:36.640]  the keep on doing what they're doing there because he's going to lose uh as far as the
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:42.240]  the world economy i think i covered that with the united states and the rest of the world
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:52.320]  in in varying degrees is going to follow uh to quote ted anderson uh 1600 i'm looking for 1650
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:57:02.320]  uh intermediate weeks days months and i think we got a shot at 2000 maybe even 2400
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:10.720]  before the year is out and um that means that the coins and the bars and the shares are all
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:17.040]  going to move up and uh people should be in there if you're not your foolish of course you got to
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:22.880]  have your food and your filter and your methods of defending your family and first but after that
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:30.000]  you go for the coins uh and uh and upward and so that's generally where i see things going
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:37.120]  again it's hard to put a timeline on the price of oil and what's going to happen in the middle east
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:44.560]  but bottom line you we can feel the acceleration down the hill sliding into all of the bad fruits
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:50.720]  of globalism we're now experiencing nafta and gatt in the north american union and imperialism
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:57.200]  and neocolonialism of the bankers trying to diminish and destroy the nation state uh and
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:03.280]  basically tie us all to the giant derivatives debts they've created as their slaves and it's
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:09.520]  either us or the bankers it's either us or the new world order i said that 51 years ago and i'll
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:15.200]  say it again today you're absolutely correct and they're well in their way to trying to accomplish
[02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:21.920]  what they want and we're well in our way to stopping them and i promise you we will stop them no matter
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:26.640]  what the price absolutely there's so many people in the world who know what's going on now bob we're
