[00:00.000 --> 00:27.320]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I've got to tell you, my head is just absolutely spinning.
[00:27.320 --> 00:41.720]  With the amount of news today, but I'm particularly intrigued by this phenomenon now of the American
[00:41.720 --> 00:52.040]  Left, specifically the liberals in the media, not really sure how to respond, well to the
[00:52.040 --> 00:58.080]  fact that they've been wrong about everything, but specifically on the issue of COVID-19
[00:58.080 --> 01:07.040]  originating in a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan, the Wundan Institute of Virology, and watching
[01:07.040 --> 01:16.640]  them cope with this is truly a fascinating psychological observation to behold today.
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.520]  And I've got two examples, one Jimmy Kimmel and then another from The View, but it's
[01:23.520 --> 01:33.400]  everywhere, it's CNN, it's MSNBC, it's mainstream news publications, print, press on the internet,
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.040]  and it's really just an amazing thing to behold.
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.000]  Remember let's not forget, it was the New York Times a couple weeks ago with the headline,
[01:44.000 --> 01:53.920]  and I believe it was the New York Times, with the headline of masks didn't work, what lessons
[01:53.920 --> 02:00.640]  were learned, something along those lines basically admitting that the masks never worked, and
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.400]  the entire story was how none of the COVID protocols worked, the shutdowns, any of it,
[02:05.400 --> 02:10.960]  we have the science, we have the data, and of course anybody with a logical mind would
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.480]  have told you that this response to COVID is going to be an absolute disaster, as like
[02:15.480 --> 02:23.640]  we did and many others, but watching them cope with this now, oh the masks don't work,
[02:23.640 --> 02:26.800]  what lessons were learned, well none, if you're still asking the questions you haven't learned
[02:26.800 --> 02:29.560]  the lessons, you're wrong about everything.
[02:29.560 --> 02:37.960]  So it's just incredible, here's Jimmy Kimmel last night, this is part of their coping with
[02:37.960 --> 02:42.040]  everything, being wrong about everything, you're wrong about the war in Ukraine, that's
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.840]  the next lesson they'll learn, you're wrong about that, but you won't learn that until
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.520]  it's too late too I suppose, so here's Kimmel last night trying to cover up for the fact
[02:51.520 --> 02:55.920]  he was wrong, and everyone else was wrong about the COVID lab leak.
[02:55.920 --> 03:06.600]  Speaking of diarrhea, Tucker Carlson of Fox News yesterday, we learned that the Department
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.400]  of Energy probably know about this, believes with what they described as low confidence
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.960]  that COVID may have leaked from a lab in China, eight federal agencies now have weighed in
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.720]  with their assessments, four believe COVID came from natural transmission, two say it
[03:20.720 --> 03:26.080]  was a lab leak, and two are still on the side, in other words, we don't know, but the dingbats
[03:26.080 --> 03:28.480]  now see this as some kind of proof that they were right.
[03:28.480 --> 03:40.440]  Oh guys, now we don't know, oh that's amazing Jimmy, that's amazing little Jimmy, oh now
[03:40.440 --> 03:49.680]  we don't know guys, we don't know, but see when they told you it came from the Bapsoup,
[03:49.680 --> 03:58.720]  when they told you it came from a wet market, they knew, they knew, right, and you can't
[03:58.720 --> 04:04.400]  say anything else, because they know it came from the Bapsoup, they know it came from the
[04:04.400 --> 04:11.640]  wet market, but now it's, oh but we don't know, that oh I see, now that you've been
[04:11.640 --> 04:16.720]  proven wrong, now it's we don't know, gotcha Jimmy, continue.
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.640]  He's leaked a laboratory, which by the way, it might have the point is we didn't know
[04:20.640 --> 04:25.280]  then, we still don't know now, oh we didn't know is that Trump and his buddies blaming
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.160]  the Chinese resulted in a great deal of anti-Asian American sentiment, and even violence in this
[04:30.160 --> 04:31.160]  country.
[04:31.160 --> 04:37.160]  Oh pause it, oh okay, oh now we want to talk about anti-Asian violence, that's funny you
[04:37.160 --> 04:42.000]  guys remember that stop Asian hate, remember that big trend, and then it turned out it
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.600]  was all black people beating up Asians in the streets, and that trend stopped immediately,
[04:47.600 --> 04:55.920]  I mean these people, these liberals, these Democrats, you are insufferable, you are,
[04:55.920 --> 05:01.680]  you are truly deranged.
[05:01.680 --> 05:07.440]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.240]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[05:11.240 --> 05:13.320]  and your body, and keep us on air.
[05:13.320 --> 05:18.600]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.880]  you for years, and never gone to info or store.com.
[05:21.880 --> 05:27.360]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you, never actually go to info or store.com
[05:27.360 --> 05:30.200]  and never experience these great products, and never find the operation.
[05:30.200 --> 05:34.080]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[05:34.080 --> 05:35.080]  and I thank you.
[05:35.080 --> 05:39.200]  But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.240]  for people like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric
[05:43.240 --> 05:47.280]  oxide, and our real red pill plus, all of these are really great products, they keep
[05:47.280 --> 05:49.720]  us on air, plus you're missing out on having these products.
[05:49.720 --> 05:55.000]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to infoorstore.com right
[05:55.000 --> 06:10.800]  now, and get these great info or products at infoorstore.com.
[06:10.800 --> 06:15.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:15.520 --> 06:17.240]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:17.240 --> 06:24.000]  Well so does he, live from the infoorce.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.720]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:27.720 --> 06:37.760]  Yep, haven't even had my caffeine yet, and I'm already just popping off, looking at all
[06:37.760 --> 06:38.760]  this news.
[06:38.760 --> 06:44.200]  I just don't even know how you respond to this anymore.
[06:44.200 --> 06:51.320]  Jimmy Kimmel, the view, look, just admit you were wrong, like what, just admit you
[06:51.320 --> 06:53.000]  were wrong.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.840]  You were wrong about the masks.
[06:54.840 --> 06:56.920]  You were wrong about the vaccines.
[06:56.920 --> 06:59.880]  You were wrong about the Wuhan lab leak theory.
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.000]  Just admit you were wrong about everything.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.400]  But you'll never do it, because you want to be the authority.
[07:08.400 --> 07:13.400]  And you know nobody would ever invest in your authority when you're wrong about everything.
[07:13.400 --> 07:20.440]  So excuse me, let's just take a second here to tell you, this is the Alex Jones show.
[07:20.440 --> 07:32.120]  The legendary Alex Jones show, still live, despite all the tyrants and fascists and commies
[07:32.120 --> 07:38.600]  that want us shut down off the air, like Robert Forthreich bragging about their next plan
[07:38.600 --> 07:44.680]  to silence conservatives, and silence Christians, and silence Americans, because they hate free
[07:44.680 --> 07:45.680]  speech.
[07:45.680 --> 07:47.280]  They're going to sue us all into oblivion.
[07:47.280 --> 07:52.360]  Yeah, well, he told you, you know, Info Wars is basically the canary in the coal mine.
[07:52.360 --> 07:57.040]  What they do to us, they're going to do to you next.
[07:57.040 --> 08:06.640]  So yeah, this is the legendary, the epic, the all timer Alex Jones show here live on
[08:06.640 --> 08:11.240]  this Thursday, March 2nd, Owen Shroyer filling in for Alex.
[08:11.240 --> 08:17.400]  And I just, I've got tons of news.
[08:17.400 --> 08:24.960]  We've got developments on the situation in Ukraine nearly every day now.
[08:24.960 --> 08:38.400]  The speed, the velocity at which the militant LGBTQ movement is aggressively going after
[08:38.400 --> 08:48.800]  children is reaching levels of absurdity and filth, which is getting topped almost every
[08:48.800 --> 08:50.480]  day now.
[08:50.480 --> 09:01.480]  And yesterday, we showed you a, I'm not exaggerating here, a drag queen stripper time sex tease
[09:01.480 --> 09:05.680]  show for children.
[09:05.680 --> 09:09.640]  Really, I can't sensationalize this.
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.640]  I can, I mean, I don't even want to show you the video, but it's imagine a strip club
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.200]  except men pretending to be women gyrating naked in leather gimp suits right in front
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.800]  of a room of children.
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.840]  And the event is promoted for children under two.
[09:27.840 --> 09:36.080]  Now the group had to come out and make a statement saying, oh, this is for visionary reasons.
[09:36.080 --> 09:38.040]  It's a sensory thing for children.
[09:38.040 --> 09:40.720]  Oh yeah, it's a sensor.
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.280]  Like you know, like my dad used to take me to basketball games as a kid and I'd, he'd
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.120]  get me a little toy basketball and I'd play with the basketball and I'd dribble it and
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.720]  I'd, that's a sensory thing and the crowd and the people and the, and the smells and
[09:54.720 --> 09:57.520]  the sights and the sounds.
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.800]  Or you take your kid to a musical or an ice skating thing.
[10:01.800 --> 10:05.280]  Oh, that's a sensory thing or the playground or the park.
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.560]  Oh no, I'm taking little Johnny to the strip club.
[10:09.560 --> 10:11.480]  It's a sensory thing.
[10:11.480 --> 10:14.560]  I'm going to have a man in a, in a tutu.
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.680]  I'm going to have a 300 pound hairy man in a leotard gyrating in front of my two year
[10:19.680 --> 10:20.680]  old.
[10:20.680 --> 10:21.680]  It's a sensory thing.
[10:21.680 --> 10:23.680]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[10:23.680 --> 10:24.680]  Yeah.
[10:24.680 --> 10:25.680]  Yeah.
[10:25.680 --> 10:31.400]  Oh, and, and, and so you're thinking, well, this has to be it.
[10:31.400 --> 10:33.200]  This, this is the end of this, right?
[10:33.200 --> 10:40.280]  I mean, men in thongs doing sex tease show shows for children, that's, that's the end
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.280]  of this.
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.680]  Certainly this is where it doesn't get much worse than this, right?
[10:45.680 --> 10:56.640]  So wrongo, now we're finding new videos of essentially what is the same thing, but they
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.360]  ratchet it up and say, well, how can they ratchet that up?
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.840]  Well, I guess they could, you know, turn the lights off and crank some sexual music.
[11:04.840 --> 11:14.640]  And I mean, really just turn it on and they did it for children.
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.360]  So I've got a whole stack of that news today.
[11:18.360 --> 11:23.560]  But really what I'm looking at in absolute amazement, really what I'm looking at in,
[11:23.560 --> 11:31.040]  in just a stunned manner here is the liberal media, the mainstream media, the Democrats
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.480]  on television coping with the fact that really they're, they're learning they've been wrong
[11:36.480 --> 11:39.880]  about everything.
[11:39.880 --> 11:49.280]  But specifically with the Wuhan lab leak theory, and so this has been quite a spectacle to
[11:49.280 --> 11:57.280]  watch them coping with this on their late night shows and on their daytime shows.
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.400]  Everything these people tell you is wrong.
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.960]  And so it's kind of reaching this point where it's, it's such a spectacle, it's such a phenomenon.
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.280]  But what, what can you even do or say at this point?
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.800]  If you don't realize that the people on the view are at the, at best ignorant, at worst
[12:19.800 --> 12:25.680]  consciously lying to you, if you don't realize that Jimmy Kimmel is at the best ignorant at
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.440]  the most lying to you, if you don't realize that, that same paradigm applies to ABC News,
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.480]  CNN, MSNBC, you name it.
[12:34.480 --> 12:38.360]  And if you haven't realized this, that you're getting played, you're wasting your time with
[12:38.360 --> 12:43.160]  these people, then you don't really care.
[12:43.160 --> 12:48.280]  You like it, you like being tricked, you like being bamboozled, you like being suckered,
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.800]  you like being victimized, you like falling for lies, you like falling for propaganda,
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.120]  you like it, you're into it at this point.
[12:55.120 --> 12:58.680]  I don't see how there's any other debate here.
[12:58.680 --> 13:04.840]  You're into being lied to, you're into being deceived and deceiving others.
[13:04.840 --> 13:07.320]  So I'm going to come back and I'm going to play the Jimmy Kimmel clip and I'm going to
[13:07.320 --> 13:18.680]  play the view clip, but I just, I don't know what to say at this point.
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.520]  We know the news has been propaganda for a while, we understand the, we understand the
[13:23.520 --> 13:34.520]  paradigm of fake news, but this is just, have you no souls?
[13:34.520 --> 13:36.040]  Have you no, have you no conscious?
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.040]  Have you no moral compass?
[13:37.040 --> 13:40.520]  I mean, have you lost your humanity entirely?
[13:40.520 --> 13:42.520]  Like do you just not care?
[13:42.520 --> 13:48.520]  World burns down around you and you dance on the ashes?
[13:48.520 --> 13:49.520]  It's amazing.
[13:49.520 --> 14:00.880]  I mean, does it get more ridiculous than a Hollywood burnout, Sean Penn going on CNN
[14:00.880 --> 14:09.120]  to promote a war wearing a hat that says killer on it?
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.280]  This is how ridiculous it's become now.
[14:13.280 --> 14:15.480]  So I mean, do you even respond to it?
[14:15.480 --> 14:16.680]  Do we even play it?
[14:16.680 --> 14:18.240]  Do we even cover it?
[14:18.240 --> 14:24.600]  Well, we're going to, but really it's so alien at this point.
[14:24.600 --> 14:26.200]  It's so unhuman at this point.
[14:26.200 --> 14:32.360]  It's not, it's almost not even real and of course, what do they do?
[14:32.360 --> 14:36.600]  They're blaming Trump, they're blaming racism.
[14:36.600 --> 14:38.120]  Just admit you were wrong.
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.280]  You know, I mean, admit you were wrong, admit you got fooled, admit you fell for the government
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.040]  propaganda and just admit it.
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.240]  But no, you can't admit it, can you?
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.960]  You got to go on TV when you realize you were wrong about the Wuhan lab leak and you got
[14:53.960 --> 14:59.040]  to blame Tucker Carlson and you got to blame Donald Trump and you got to blame racism.
[14:59.040 --> 15:00.240]  I'm not even kidding you.
[15:00.240 --> 15:02.160]  I'm going to play the clips coming up.
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.320]  You can't even believe it, but this is how they've spent their time.
[15:06.320 --> 15:12.800]  So first they lie to you, then they cover up the truth and then when it all comes out,
[15:12.800 --> 15:21.280]  they blame you truly, truly next level.
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.600]  And when you realize how dangerous these people are, this is why the idea of the national
[15:26.600 --> 15:34.320]  divorce from the left has taken such momentum on because these are dangerous people, people
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.440]  that will lie to you, people that will cover up crimes and then do it again and again and
[15:38.440 --> 15:39.440]  again.
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.360]  And even when they get caught, they blame you.
[15:43.360 --> 15:50.560]  This is how authoritarian regimes get power, stay in power and assert full control over
[15:50.560 --> 15:57.560]  the people that almost every time results in hundreds of millions dead.
[15:57.560 --> 16:04.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic
[16:04.120 --> 16:08.440]  book that documents the global to their own words, planned for our future, that is the
[16:08.440 --> 16:09.440]  hellish future.
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.200]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.160]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores,
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.480]  Amazon or infooresport.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[16:21.480 --> 16:24.760]  book after the signed copies we got run out.
[16:24.760 --> 16:27.320]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[16:27.320 --> 16:32.720]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at infooresport.com.
[16:32.720 --> 16:36.640]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.440]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[16:40.440 --> 16:42.080]  you help keep infoores on the air.
[16:42.080 --> 16:45.720]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.680]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infooresport.com
[16:50.680 --> 16:55.360]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give
[16:55.360 --> 16:56.800]  them to the local school.
[16:56.800 --> 16:59.800]  This is an info war I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.

[19:11.200 --> 19:16.880]  at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been
[19:16.880 --> 19:22.040]  the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen stroyer and the hard work they
[19:22.040 --> 19:28.640]  engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself

[19:33.080 --> 19:38.280]  that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us I know you spread the word
[19:38.280 --> 19:42.600]  I know you pray for us that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never
[19:42.600 --> 19:46.680]  go to info wars store.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your
[19:46.680 --> 19:51.120]  life all at the same time give us on air I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.880]  actually go by products info wars.com if just one percent more of you took action and went
[19:55.880 --> 20:01.520]  to info wars.com our funding problems will be over please take action now.
[20:01.520 --> 20:17.120]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.120 --> 20:26.040]  You know I don't want a national divorce but you know what I don't want even more to be
[20:26.040 --> 20:32.920]  forced to wear a mask to be forced to take a vaccine to be told by the World Health Organization
[20:32.920 --> 20:38.520]  I have to shut my business now down and stay inside I don't want to see children being
[20:38.520 --> 20:46.440]  subjected to pornography and pedophilia and I'm sick of getting taxed out the wazoo just
[20:46.440 --> 20:57.760]  because I work so you know I don't really want a national divorce no not really but I think
[20:57.760 --> 21:04.160]  I'd rather have that than what's being proposed by the left right now but you know they could
[21:04.160 --> 21:07.760]  never have a national divorce because without you who are they gonna tell how to live their
[21:07.760 --> 21:10.920]  life without you who are they gonna boss around without you who are they gonna politically
[21:10.920 --> 21:17.520]  persecute without you who are they gonna subject to their tyranny so they need us you can't
[21:17.520 --> 21:26.400]  have a national divorce with the left their totalitarians and that of course is the issue
[21:26.400 --> 21:31.920]  but these people are truly sick when they're wrong about everything and they can't admit
[21:31.920 --> 21:36.880]  it and instead of admitting it they blame Donald Trump they blame Tucker Carlson they
[21:36.880 --> 21:45.080]  blame racism here's some of the headlines and I'm gonna show you the left wing media
[21:45.080 --> 21:51.320]  coping with being wrong about the Wuhan lab leak theory Rand Paul COVID lab leak one of
[21:51.320 --> 21:59.760]  the greatest cover-ups in modern medical history I agree Rand and I like Rand Paul but it's
[21:59.760 --> 22:07.480]  like can we do something about this please can we arrest some criminals already please
[22:07.480 --> 22:12.600]  forget about the Democrats they're gone they're commies they're sold out they aren't playing
[22:12.600 --> 22:22.080]  for us anymore it's time to move on without them it's time for the adults to take back
[22:22.080 --> 22:30.480]  the wheel of the car the helm of the ship the control of our destiny forget about the
[22:30.480 --> 22:37.680]  Democrats forget about the liberals they're not interested Ted Cruz blast media for labeling
[22:37.680 --> 22:45.920]  COVID lab leak as misinformation and conspiracy theory oh but what are the Democrats saying
[22:45.920 --> 22:52.080]  they want this stopped Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer demands Rupert Murdoch silence Tucker
[22:52.080 --> 23:02.080]  Carlson for spreading the big lie even though he was right you're the liar Chuck so the
[23:02.080 --> 23:06.480]  liars want to silence the truth tellers go figure the truth tellers want to debate the
[23:06.480 --> 23:13.880]  liars to show how their liars the liars want to silence the truth tellers because they
[23:13.880 --> 23:18.960]  don't want to be exposed State Department funded censorship group punished conservative
[23:18.960 --> 23:25.280]  websites for circulating lab leak theory oh the US State Department funded global disinformation
[23:25.280 --> 23:30.600]  index put it punished conservative websites by throttling their advertising revenue if
[23:30.600 --> 23:38.920]  they gave credence to the COVID-19 lab leak theory now remember this you had the group
[23:38.920 --> 23:49.440]  set up by the Democrats we found out from whistleblowers and internal documents from
[23:49.440 --> 23:57.640]  Twitter that yes the United States government yes the Democrat Party was in direct communication
[23:57.640 --> 24:04.120]  with big tech platforms to censor conservatives but if you don't even want to look at it from
[24:04.120 --> 24:11.640]  a political angle to censor the truth you talk about COVID-19 coming out of a lab in
[24:11.640 --> 24:21.040]  Wuhan China you get censored all brought to you by Democrats so here's a Democrat on
[24:21.040 --> 24:26.160]  television last night blaming everybody but himself for being wrong about the Wuhan lab
[24:26.160 --> 24:32.280]  leak theory and it's funny that Jimmy Kimmel will admit that we don't know so wait Jimmy
[24:32.280 --> 24:38.800]  if we don't know then why are you telling us we know if we don't know Jimmy then why
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.440]  are you saying we're wrong if it if we report it came out of Wuhan lab if you say we don't
[24:43.440 --> 24:48.840]  know then why are you claiming to know and why did you claim to know three years ago
[24:48.840 --> 24:54.080]  when now you're admitting you didn't know anything here's Kimmel last night blaming everybody
[24:54.080 --> 25:08.840]  but himself for being wrong you know Tucker Carlson who has the highest rated show on
[25:08.840 --> 25:17.120]  television Tucker Carlson who's gone from not having anything even on the ratings four
[25:17.120 --> 25:24.280]  years ago to now having the number one show on television and then there's Jimmy Kimmel
[25:24.280 --> 25:30.360]  who really made himself famous because he did a TV show with big breasted women jumping
[25:30.360 --> 25:38.520]  up and down on trampolines and now he has the network late night show that everybody
[25:38.520 --> 25:44.400]  can watch and still loses to Tucker Carlson but but okay Jimmy you're you're a big tough
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.480]  guy you're you're much more powerful than Tucker Carlson you do Democrat Party propaganda
[25:49.480 --> 25:54.160]  for a living Tucker Carlson host the number one show on TV so so here's again Jimmy Kimmel
[25:54.160 --> 25:57.040]  blaming everybody but himself for being wrong.
[25:57.040 --> 26:05.640]  Fox News yesterday we learned that the the Department of Energy probably know about this
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.400]  believes with what they described as low confidence that COVID may have leaked from a lab in China
[26:11.400 --> 26:16.000]  eight federal agencies now have weighed in with their assessments for believe COVID came
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.440]  from natural transmission to say it was a lab leak and two are still on the side in
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.640]  other words we don't know but the dingbats now see this as some kind of proof that they
[26:25.640 --> 26:30.120]  were right that the virus came from a Chinese leak at a laboratory which by the way it might
[26:30.120 --> 26:37.840]  have the point is we didn't know then we still don't know now oh I love this oh we don't know
[26:37.840 --> 26:45.320]  we didn't know then we don't know now oh you didn't know then that's funny you say you
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.280]  didn't know then because you censored people that said it came out of the Wuhan lab but
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.480]  if you didn't know why did they get censored and if you still don't know why are you saying
[26:54.480 --> 27:03.440]  that they're dingbats and wrong if you don't know and you know look I get it Jimmy you
[27:03.440 --> 27:16.920]  do a late night talk show you do comedy but you know this isn't really funny a virus made
[27:16.920 --> 27:22.720]  in a lab leaked out killed millions of people destroyed the economy and people were trying
[27:22.720 --> 27:26.920]  to report on the truth and they got censored and you think that that's funny you think
[27:26.920 --> 27:31.800]  it's a funny thing to make fun of them and make a joke of it all well I guess that's
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.800]  convenient for a Democrat who covered up the truth and bought into Anthony Fauci's lies
[27:37.800 --> 27:40.960]  and propaganda and he's going to be the big criminal when it's all said and done let's
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.320]  go back to the clip don't know now what we did know is that Trump and his buddies blaming
[27:46.320 --> 27:53.240]  the Chinese resulted in a great deal of anti-Asian American center oh pause it pause it oh and
[27:53.240 --> 28:01.400]  Trump oh and it's Trump and oh the anti oh the anti-Asian hate crimes I remember that
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.240]  I remember the hashtag stop Asian hate phenomenon right after this do you guys remember that
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.640]  I remember that and I remember how quickly it went away when all the perpetrators of
[28:10.640 --> 28:17.080]  the violence were black yeah yeah I remember that I remember the stop Asian hate trend
[28:17.080 --> 28:23.560]  with Asian people getting savagely beaten on the streets elderly Asian people women yeah
[28:23.560 --> 28:29.880]  California New York the two main places that happened Democrat cities but boy oh boy that
[28:29.880 --> 28:35.040]  hashtag disappeared quickly didn't it when it turned out it was black people savagely
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.480]  beating Asians in the streets and maybe that just has something to do with the larger crime
[28:39.480 --> 28:43.640]  statistics and it wasn't even about them being Asian but you guys wanted to make it about
[28:43.640 --> 28:48.280]  the Asian victim hood but then as soon as you found out that the bigger victims in your
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.040]  minds black people were the ones beating the Asians you didn't want to talk about it anymore
[28:53.040 --> 29:02.720]  but now here's Kimmel saying well Trump blamed Asians so he must be wrong right now I'm
[29:02.720 --> 29:07.680]  not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone info or store.com and gotten the

[33:32.200 --> 33:43.520]  move on and it's fair criticism I'm laughing with them but I can't I'm stunned I'm genuinely
[33:43.520 --> 33:51.600]  just completely enamored by this psychological phenomenon we're witnessing and how they can
[33:51.600 --> 33:57.280]  just sit there and be wrong about everything I didn't think they can cover it up with the
[33:57.280 --> 34:04.640]  hey blame Trump blame racism blame Fox News I mean what is wrong with you people oh it's
[34:04.640 --> 34:12.200]  all a joke oh it's just a joke haha it's just a joke I see it's just a joke they make viruses

[34:34.240 --> 34:39.240]  admitting that they know nothing about the origins of COVID-19 but you're definitely wrong
[34:39.240 --> 34:43.720]  about it and no matter what the truth is Trump is the one to blame obviously it's his fault
[34:43.720 --> 34:48.680]  here's Kimmel still don't know now what we did know is that Trump and his buddies blaming
[34:48.680 --> 34:53.560]  the Chinese is also a great deal is by anti-Asian American sentiment and even violence in this
[34:53.560 --> 34:57.920]  country and that's why it was irresponsible for the president his buddies guys I pause
[34:57.920 --> 35:03.560]  it sorry I can't do it I can't pause it Trump Trump and his buddies guys hahaha Trump and
[35:03.560 --> 35:12.600]  his buddies like virologists from China that worked in the lab that Trump's buddies Dr.
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.960]  Lee Min Yang I think was her name she was on Tucker Carlson this week that's I mean that's
[35:16.960 --> 35:20.840]  just Trump's buddies obviously they're taught her and Trump are talking all the time probably
[35:20.840 --> 35:24.800]  regular regular conversations going out to dinner you know what have you they're just
[35:24.800 --> 35:29.280]  regular buddies Trump and his buddies making it up it's their fault that there was a COVID-19
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.120]  for the lab that made it and released it that's not their fault that's Trump's fault
[35:33.120 --> 35:39.400]  he's the one to blame him and his buddies continue early disagrees this plague should
[35:39.400 --> 35:45.240]  never have happened it could have been stopped but people chose not to stop it what people
[35:45.240 --> 35:52.520]  tomorrow who blame the Spanish flu on Antonio Banderas yeah imagine if you're a comedian
[35:52.520 --> 35:56.440]  all of a sudden your cue card has all kinds of talking points from politicians and foreign
[35:56.440 --> 36:02.400]  governments on it don't read it you degrade yourself and you become complicit in the greatest
[36:02.400 --> 36:08.800]  crime in history isn't that beautiful I mean the idea that this man would accuse that I
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.840]  would be accused of reading talking points from foreign governments if it weren't so
[36:12.840 --> 36:20.080]  brazen it would almost be funny coming from this loathsome un-American Moscow mule oh
[36:20.080 --> 36:29.720]  we're on American we're on the worthy un-American ones and you know look I get it okay I get
[36:29.720 --> 36:37.000]  it I've been in media enough I get it Jimmy you do a late night comic show and at the
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.120]  end of the day you really don't give a rat's ass I get it you're like most Americans you
[36:42.120 --> 36:48.720]  don't give a rat's ass you don't give a damn you go on television and read jokes written
[36:48.720 --> 36:52.760]  by somebody else and read teleprompters and Democrat Party propaganda written by somebody
[36:52.760 --> 36:57.280]  else and you go home with your tens of millions of dollars and that's fine you that's great
[36:57.280 --> 37:05.920]  Jimmy I get it I get it Jimmy but you know what not everybody's like you not everybody
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.000]  doesn't give a damn about the world burning down around them not everybody doesn't give
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.600]  a damn about America getting sold out and collapsing you know Jimmy not everybody can
[37:17.600 --> 37:25.000]  afford to not give a damn like you so good for you Jimmy I get it good for you you've
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.800]  got tens of millions of dollars you're rich and famous you have a low effort job and so
[37:30.800 --> 37:38.400]  it's all fun and games life is great for Jimmy Kimmel congratulations Jimmy I get it but
[37:38.400 --> 37:46.000]  you do realize that for most Americans it's not like that and for the people you refer
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.360]  to as un-American we're the ones that actually care about the country and the future but
[37:53.360 --> 37:59.920]  let's let's let's move on now to probably even worse because again where Jimmy Kimmel
[37:59.920 --> 38:05.720]  comes from I get it Jimmy you're a rich famous late night talk to a host you genuinely don't
[38:05.720 --> 38:11.480]  give a damn it's all funny to you so so fine Jimmy you don't care you just do propaganda
[38:11.480 --> 38:17.960]  on TV for a living what's the big deal fine but then there's the view and the deception
[38:17.960 --> 38:23.320]  that they engage in and this this might be even more pathetic than Jimmy Kimmel because
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.040]  I actually believe Jimmy Kimmel doesn't give a crap I believe that Jimmy Kimmel at the
[38:28.040 --> 38:35.120]  end of the day doesn't give a crap so fine and he doesn't pretend to these hosts on the
[38:35.120 --> 38:41.320]  view act like they're all righteous and they really care now listen to how they cope with
[38:41.320 --> 38:47.880]  the facts that they were wrong about COVID and its origin this is unbelievable stuff
[38:47.880 --> 38:55.160]  truly next level denial next level Stockholm syndrome next level derangement here from
[38:55.160 --> 39:02.360]  the view listen to this Trump unleashed this xenophobia he's he's stopped allowing Chinese
[39:02.360 --> 39:11.040]  people to come to the country he then started calling it but don't even say he kept on saying
[39:11.040 --> 39:18.880]  China China and doing this thing where I was concerned now imagine this the whole topic
[39:18.880 --> 39:26.760]  of discussion is that we now know or it's it's you know the the general consensus now
[39:26.760 --> 39:34.320]  is it came from a lab in Wuhan China so that's what stirs this whole conversation and it's
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.840]  their people saying this it's Biden's people it's the Democrats now saying this so it's
[39:37.840 --> 39:42.000]  their propaganda agents that tell them how to think and so they're a little confused
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.960]  actually because all they do is take their orders from the Democrat Party the the upper
[39:46.960 --> 39:50.960]  echelons of the Democrat Party so they're actually confused now and there's a there's
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.400]  actually a tiny little fragment of a soul left there's a tiny little fragment of humanity
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.320]  left in these people and so that's why they're confused they're like wait a second you told
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.000]  me it didn't come out of the lab now you're telling me it did how do I cope with the fact
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  that you lie to me and I believe it all the time oh I know I'll blame Trump so the whole
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.800]  starter for this conversation is that it came out of a Wuhan lab and they denied it so let's
[40:17.800 --> 40:22.000]  start from the beginning actually and just add it with a little context understand the
[40:22.000 --> 40:29.720]  whole conversation begins with COVID-19 came out of a Wuhan lab and we lied about it and
[40:29.720 --> 40:35.800]  so here's how the view hosts respond to learning they they lied about it they got lied to about
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.120]  it they misinformed you about it it did come out of the Wuhan lab here's how they cope
[40:40.120 --> 40:47.600]  with learning that Trump unleashed this xenophobia he he stopped allowing Chinese people to come
[40:47.600 --> 40:54.280]  to the country he then started okay a virus starts in China and you want to stop travel
[40:54.280 --> 41:00.600]  from China wow yeah oh who would have thought of that idea that's wow okay continue um don't
[41:00.600 --> 41:06.760]  even say it don't even say it don't even say it don't even say it don't even say oh my
[41:06.760 --> 41:19.600]  god don't even say it don't even say it and then she goes on to say China where I was
[41:19.600 --> 41:25.880]  even concerned as someone who had lost family members right for many to even bring it up
[41:25.880 --> 41:32.360]  and that is really sad the last wow oh my god pause it again that's even more incredible
[41:32.360 --> 41:37.280]  she knows people that died from the virus and she'll still cover up that it came from
[41:37.280 --> 41:43.080]  a Wuhan lab I mean like oh I found out who killed my family but I don't want to I don't
[41:43.080 --> 41:49.840]  want to be mad at them because I like them I want to blame Trump oh Anthony Fauci the
[41:49.840 --> 41:58.120]  guy I love and admire so much funded the research that caused the pandemic but I love Fauci
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.320]  and the fact that I might have to admit he helped kill my family I don't want to do that
[42:02.320 --> 42:11.000]  I want to blame Trump that's more comfortable for me and I'm a little confused because my
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.320]  propaganda agents told me that it didn't come out of Wuhan lab and now they're telling me
[42:15.320 --> 42:18.880]  it did come out of a Wuhan lab and I don't know how to cope with the fact that I've been
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.160]  lied to and I've lied to all my audience members now and so I'm just gonna blame Trump I'm
[42:24.160 --> 42:28.520]  just gonna blame Trump and I'm gonna blame racism and Trump called it the well I don't
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.400]  even want to say what he called it I mean oh the words the words Chinese virus are so
[42:34.400 --> 42:42.640]  bad oh oh my gosh don't even say Chinese virus but Anthony Fauci gain a function research
[42:42.640 --> 42:50.160]  Wuhan Institute of Virology deadly vaccines that's all good baby yeah that's all fine
[42:50.160 --> 43:01.440]  and good but don't you dare say Chinese virus oh my god

[45:10.840 --> 45:16.800]  care that's not his job he's not the president of the United States he's a puppet operating
[45:16.800 --> 45:25.240]  for the globalists appetites of the autocrack cannot be appeased they must be opposed and

[47:31.000 --> 47:37.720]  witness this I've always been enamored by human psychology it's why I studied it in college
[47:37.720 --> 47:45.960]  and this to me is just this is a magnificent display of coping mechanisms in the American
[47:45.960 --> 47:54.840]  left media that you can only witness to understand so we're gonna we're gonna finish this clip
[47:54.840 --> 47:59.240]  and I promise you we're gonna move on but but don't worry guys don't worry because you
[47:59.240 --> 48:05.720]  know we're moving on to next grown men doing strip T shows for kids yeah that's gonna be
[48:05.720 --> 48:12.000]  a lot better isn't it aren't you looking forward to that for an hour what would you rather
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.420]  see left-wing coping in the media that they're wrong about everything or left-wing sexualization
[48:17.420 --> 48:22.520]  of kids I mean take your pick guys you know that's what you get or maybe you want to talk
[48:22.520 --> 48:29.400]  about the war left-wingers starting a war huh it's a nice grab bag of American leftism
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.760]  what do you like being wrong about everything in line to you grooming children sexually
[48:34.760 --> 48:41.240]  no hello world war three maybe what do you like what do you what do you want so here
[48:41.240 --> 48:47.280]  you go I promise I'll just maybe the cruel just shut my mic off but here you go we're
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.000]  gonna conclude the clip from the view they get COVID wrong they get the COVID story wrong
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.240]  they blame Donald Trump they blame you they blame racism unbelievable coping mechanisms
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.680]  here this is this is a great lesson in human psychology Stockholm syndrome mass mental
[49:06.680 --> 49:15.520]  illness and defense coping mechanisms on the view the last guy before Biden said anything
[49:15.520 --> 49:23.840]  about Asian people and I'm sure John Stuart didn't realize that that's what was happening
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.400]  because I'm sure he didn't know what was going on all over the country with Asian folks getting
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.800]  smacked and hit and people saying stuff and this one again positive about this is unbelievable
[49:34.800 --> 49:41.160]  this is the exact same place that Jimmy Kimmel took it is somebody writing this stuff for
[49:41.160 --> 49:47.040]  them or are they really just that synced up in their mental illness that's a genuine question
[49:47.040 --> 49:56.440]  I would I would go with the latter in this case so they so Kimmel and the view both blame
[49:56.440 --> 50:03.320]  Tucker Carlson Donald Trump and racism because they've now found out the COVID-19 came out
[50:03.320 --> 50:11.360]  of a Wuhan lab and they told you it didn't and somehow that's Tucker Carlson Donald Trump
[50:11.360 --> 50:23.560]  and racism's fault I mean we need to haul these people into a lab and do clinical testing
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.720]  of what is wrong with their brains so that we can avoid this mass mental illness into
[50:28.720 --> 50:36.480]  the future because this is how Nazism starts this is how radical authoritarian totalitarian
[50:36.480 --> 50:42.560]  groups start they have to be able to fall for the lie and then they have to be able
[50:42.560 --> 50:50.440]  to defend the lie even though it comes out as a lie you're witnessing this you are witnessing
[50:50.440 --> 50:57.600]  this that's why it's such an incredible story to me that's why I'm spending an hour on it
[50:57.600 --> 51:01.760]  you don't understand how dangerous this psychology is if you don't understand how dangerous this
[51:01.760 --> 51:07.360]  mind is if you don't understand this mass mental illness this derangement this brainwashing
[51:07.360 --> 51:14.640]  and the power and the threat it represents then you just don't get anything they wouldn't
[51:14.640 --> 51:22.320]  be doing this if it was irrelevant they know when their lives collapse all around them
[51:22.320 --> 51:29.440]  they have to prop them up or they lose power so I mean what are the odds Jimmy Kimmel whoopie
[51:29.440 --> 51:33.720]  Goldberg and the rest of the view staff do the exact same thing when they find out it
[51:33.720 --> 51:38.680]  came out of a Wuhan lab blame Trump blame Tucker Carlson and blame racism and again I only
[51:38.680 --> 51:42.000]  want to say it again because I'm sick of this race baiting crap but okay you want to bring
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.280]  race into it again whoopie Goldberg she wants to bring race into it again because she hates
[51:48.280 --> 51:57.960]  white people whoopie why didn't you stop using the hashtag stop Asian hate why whoopie what
[51:57.960 --> 52:08.160]  happened to the stop Asian hate hashtag whoopie what did all of the videos from hashtag stop
[52:08.160 --> 52:13.640]  Asian hate show us whoopie I notice you're not showing any of those videos on the view
[52:13.640 --> 52:23.360]  by the way I don't have to say it you know why I know why whoopie Goldberg knows why
[52:23.360 --> 52:31.960]  but she is in a defense coping mechanism because she's a proven liar a known liar caught lying
[52:31.960 --> 52:36.720]  and so she tries to deflect from the fact she's been caught lying she's been caught
[52:36.720 --> 52:43.160]  being wrong so she tries to deflect and blame racism even though if you actually dig into
[52:43.160 --> 52:49.440]  the story that she's reporting is racism it turns out it's not accurate either so it's
[52:49.440 --> 52:57.040]  just lie on top of lie with the view continue the disease I mean this was this was what
[52:57.040 --> 53:02.520]  was happening and if you know who had not started it with that had he not made it about
[53:02.520 --> 53:08.400]  that had he said listen this might have come out of a lab it probably would have been listened
[53:08.400 --> 53:21.680]  to a lot different so in other words Trump told the truth and Trump was right but because
[53:21.680 --> 53:27.160]  we hate Donald Trump so much we didn't want to listen to him so he shouldn't have told
[53:27.160 --> 53:31.520]  the truth somebody else should have told the truth oh but see that's the problem whoopie
[53:31.520 --> 53:40.560]  who would the someone else be you you still won't tell the truth so it's Trump's fault
[53:40.560 --> 53:52.200]  because he told the truth wow wow it's Trump's fault because he told the truth so oh it came
[53:52.200 --> 53:57.720]  out of the Wuhan lab just like Trump said but it's Trump's fault that nobody believed
[53:57.720 --> 54:03.480]  it because he said it because we lie about him all the time and misrepresent what he
[54:03.480 --> 54:11.200]  says all the time and we hate him so it's his fault but see this is this here's the
[54:11.200 --> 54:17.040]  larger issue that I'm gonna I'm gonna put a bookend on this now see what will be Goldberg
[54:17.040 --> 54:22.840]  just did was she she has put on display the psychology normally that you would witness
[54:22.840 --> 54:30.640]  in about a five-year-old that hasn't matured where they get caught doing something and
[54:30.640 --> 54:38.880]  they blame somebody else so like I'm sitting at the I'm a kid sitting at the dinner table
[54:38.880 --> 54:44.520]  with my younger sister and somebody knocks over a glass of milk and milk gets everywhere
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.320]  and the glass breaks on the ground and I say she did it my sister did that she kicked the
[54:49.320 --> 55:03.920]  table she did it it was her that's what be Goldberg except at the ripe age of 60 so because
[55:03.920 --> 55:14.280]  she hates Donald Trump so much even when Donald Trump tells the truth he's still wrong and
[55:14.280 --> 55:20.840]  if you understand how that psychology being applied at a large level at a mass level this
[55:20.840 --> 55:24.320]  is why it's mass mental illness folks this is why we're dealing with this mass mental
[55:24.320 --> 55:40.000]  illness they can't even I just they're blinded by their hate their hate controls them and
[55:40.000 --> 55:46.600]  so they don't care if they're wrong they don't care if they lie to you it's all driven by
[55:46.600 --> 55:52.680]  hatred and so it's justified because they hate Donald Trump so much or they hate you
[55:52.680 --> 55:58.400]  so much so it's justified in their head to lie to you and even when they get caught lying
[55:58.400 --> 56:10.560]  still blame the person they hate so much who told them the truth and this psychology put
[56:10.560 --> 56:16.880]  on display by whoopie Goldberg posting the view is the mass mental illness that sadly
[56:16.880 --> 56:29.520]  grips the minds of the average modern-day American leftist and sadly I don't think there's enough
[56:29.520 --> 56:35.200]  brain force plus or brain force ultra in the world to cure these people of their mass mental
[56:35.200 --> 56:42.400]  illness but we can try it we can try it maybe this is what we need to do maybe you need
[56:42.400 --> 56:49.200]  to go to infowarstore.com get a hundred bottles of brain force ultra and send it to the views
[56:49.200 --> 56:56.320]  staff on air maybe they can think again maybe we can maybe we can defog their vision of
[56:56.320 --> 57:03.480]  all the hate that clouds it but somehow I think they're just too far gone and if the
[57:03.480 --> 57:13.280]  response to the COVID lab leak coming out isn't enough to show you maybe the next hour
[57:13.280 --> 57:17.320]  where they're doing stripper shows for kids will be but everything we do here is listener

[59:52.760 --> 01:00:11.600]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:22.240]  modern day american liberalism progressive democrat ideology
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:30.440]  you just saw it on display from jimmy kimmel you just saw it on display from the view
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:36.320]  and what was really sad about this is as these people have their downfall they're taking
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.600]  the rest of us with them that's what's so sad that's what's so dangerous that's why
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:46.520]  we try to stop it but they seem to be all in they want to drag us down to the depths
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:54.720]  to drown with them and so here's joe biden and and you may have seen or heard about
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:03.160]  this the other day earlier this week there was a woman who testified to congress on the
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:10.640]  fentanyl crisis who lost two young sons to fentanyl overdoses and so she gave an emotional
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:16.440]  testimony trying to highlight the issues that we have with the open southern border by the
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:23.120]  way border patrol just had another massive fentanyl seizure it's just it's just crazy
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:32.280]  how much is coming in and so she gave her emotional testimony to congress losing two
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:39.920]  kids to fentanyl and it wasn't a political stance she didn't make any political statements
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:49.800]  she was there to testify on the fentanyl deaths from losing two sons to fentanyl no political
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.600]  statements may just hey this is what's happening it's coming across the southern border i lost
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:02.360]  two sons because of it this is why we need to protect the border and so joe biden though
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.920]  decides to make it political but but what's incredible the incredible takeaway that i've
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.680]  noticed nobody's really pointing out and that's why i'm going to cover it here of what joe
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:20.120]  biden did it wasn't just that he laughed at a mom who lost her two young sons to fentanyl
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.000]  it's that they don't want to talk about the issue so let me play the video and then explain
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.840]  the phenomenon here here's biden laughing at a mother because two of her sons died from
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.760]  a fentanyl overdose in clip 16 she was very specific recently saying that a mom or poor
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:42.560]  mother lost two kids to fentanyl that that i killed her sons she didn't say that well
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:53.200]  the interesting thing is that fentanyl they took came during the last administration
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.480]  now she didn't say joe biden killed her sons that's just an outright lie that's just an
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.880]  outright lie but what he'd what what did he say he said the fentanyl came across the border
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:19.120]  when trump was president okay so what so what i how is that an argument
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.280]  explain to me how that is an argument to keep the border open explain to me how that is
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.960]  an argument that fentanyl deaths aren't real and that fentanyl deaths aren't a problem
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:35.400]  so because the one woman who lost two sons to fentanyl lost them in 2020 therefore the
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.440]  issue doesn't exist therefore the fentanyl deaths aren't real therefore her testimony
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:50.920]  doesn't count what kind of logic is that but oh they want to play what about ism what about
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.860]  obama with the kids in cages what about the kids in cages under joe biden oh no no no only
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:01.280]  when donald trump has the kids in cages oh you guys want to play that game oh yeah yeah
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:09.960]  you want to play that game do you so imagine that though not only do they clearly not give
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:16.640]  a damn about the border being open and the crime increasing and the fentanyl deaths
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.640]  increasing they deflect blame donald trump and therefore there's nothing to be done at
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:34.920]  the southern border i mean that is unbelievable so because the witness testimony of a mom
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.560]  who lost two sons to a fentanyl death happened in 2020 therefore it's not an issue and joe
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.680]  biden doesn't have to do anything about it even though the issue is a hundred times
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:52.680]  worse under biden and they just blame trump folks these people's brains are broke they
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.960]  belong in mental institutions and instead they're running the country now we have an open air
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:03.400]  mental institution ladies and gentlemen this book the great reset and worth of the world
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.320]  is a historic book that documents the globals and their own words plan for our future that
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.480]  is a hellish future now you'll be always while they still allow books i guess they're starting
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.400]  to ban them be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset and worth of the world
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.520]  at bookstores amazon or info or short i come but you will never be able to get another
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.760]  signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.280]  left of them right now so get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.400]  a signed copy and info or short i come and there is a markup there because this is a
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.280]  fundraiser to keep us on the air so you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.080]  book you'll also know that you help keep info or is on the air i'm going to thank those
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.080]  of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies i want to encourage
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.200]  all of you who haven't yet to go to info or short i come and get a signed copy and buy
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.720]  a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:17.720]  this is an info war i'm counting on you and thank you for your support
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:28.120]  i got to tell you i'd much rather listen to josh clinghofer rip up a guitar like that
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:36.560]  and shred i think we all would then discuss what we're about to discuss now here in the
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:43.600]  second hour boy you thought the first hour was tough here you're about to watch grown
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:50.760]  men do strip t shows for kids about a nice warm cup of pedophilia for you in hour two
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:07:00.400]  of the alex joneshell brought to you by democrats i just let me start it with the news headlines
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.960]  since we've been video centric here let's start with the news headlines before we get
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:15.360]  to the videos here okay now i want to comment on another phenomenon shya ride chick is the
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.000]  creator of libs of tiktok and and her attitude and response to the hate filled leftist that
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.640]  want her dead is perfect and so here's one of these deranged leftists attacking shya
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:37.080]  and he puts out an article from vice because you have to understand they want her dead folks
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.920]  they want to dox her they want people to know where she lives they want her to live in fear
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:48.000]  this is what fascists do this is what authoritarians do is what tyrants do this is what democrats
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.960]  do so he puts out the statement since shya ray chick was outed as libs of tiktok a year
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:02.720]  ago her attacks on the lgbt community have increased now attacking them is is showing
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.360]  you their footage so imagine that putting a mirror in front of somebody is attacking
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:13.600]  them now interesting as a result she's got millions of new followers dined with donald
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.440]  trump earned money on sub stack wrote a book and now she's speaking at c-pack she might
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:24.600]  even be speaking today i think it's going on but and so then they publish these articles
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.400]  and they and they dox her because they want her to live in fear they want her to get
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:44.440]  attacked they want her killed and what's her response lol go cry about it yes this is exactly
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:52.080]  how it's done this is exactly how it needs to be done folks if you're at the grocery
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.600]  store and you're checking out let's say you're you're you're a mom you're at the grocery
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:05.560]  store you're checking out and your five-year-old son wants a king size snickers bar as you're
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:13.160]  walking through the checkout and you say no little johnny you can't have a king size
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:19.400]  snickers bar you'll spoil your dinner and so little johnny decides he's going to throw
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.160]  a temper tantrum and he's threatening to throw all the candy on the ground and all
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:32.040]  this stuff well what do you do in that moment do you give in to your child throwing a temper
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.800]  tantrum do you say oh okay you're the boss you're right why don't you get the king size
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:47.160]  snickers or do you say no little johnny get in the car we're going home this is the attitude
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:52.200]  we have to have towards the american left their children their petulant children they're throwing
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:58.160]  temper tantrums they're mentally disturbed deranged and immature and it's time to just
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:02.080]  discount everything they do everything they say and we've just got to move on without
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.600]  them folks they're not coming along for this they're they're not they want to drag they
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.280]  want to drag us into the depths of hell they want to drag us into the depths of tyranny
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.680]  and it's we just have to say no no thank you we're going to move on and when they call
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.160]  you a racist and when they threaten to kill you and when they docks you and when they
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.040]  run all their smear campaigns and everything else you just have to ignore it and you just
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:34.480]  have to move right along right along it's the only way to do this you've got two ways
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.640]  to deal with a bully punch the bully in the mouth or ignore the bully and so shy array
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.800]  chick decides she's going to ignore the bully but why do they hate her so much because she
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:51.160]  shows them she shows the world who they are all all she does is take their own videos
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:58.440]  and repost them that's it that's all she does she reposts their own videos and they want
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:12.400]  her dead for it so I give big ups to lives of tiktok shy right chick very powerful keep
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:19.400]  going keep going the more you anger them the better you're doing and the more you ignore
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:26.400]  them and keep going with your mission the more their heads will explode now this is
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:33.880]  wild this is this is modern-day feminism is men or women I'd love to hear a feminist
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.280]  or a libtard explain this one big businesses like kitchen aid display hatred for women
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:45.320]  by hiring men in costume for ads and so this is the new phenomenon and actually we do have
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:55.720]  a guy's let's let's go quickly here to clip 26 this is her she chocolate not like you
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:04.560]  normally think her she pronoun chocolate so for women's history month I guess March is
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:10.200]  women's history month but men are women now so what is even a woman and so here is your
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:21.180]  new her she chocolate ad for women's history month featuring a man in drag my name is
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:36.640]  page on stone we can create a world where everyone is able to live in public space as they're
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:51.700]  a woman promoting living is your honest self you're living a lie telling people not to
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.700]  live a lie incredible but this is what they're doing now is they're hiring men to promote
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:13:01.220]  feminine products and they're hiring men for women's history month but if men can be women
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:06.860]  then what is women's history if men can be women then what is a woman's sports league
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:17.620]  it's not it's men now oh I can't wait I know it's going to happen eventually and I'm going
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:21.620]  to dive I'm going to dive right into this as soon as it happens but I know someday I'll
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:28.660]  be out on the streets and some libtard will be offended at how I'm anti-woman or something
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:33.220]  or I'm misogynist and I'll say oh really what do you think about men pretending to be women
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.300]  what do you think about men getting paid to promote feminine products what do you think
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:42.100]  about men getting promoted for women's history month how does that make you feel well those
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:49.620]  are women they identify as women okay well then I identify as a woman oh checkmate bitch
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:14:01.580]  that's how it works right or not are you pro women or can men be women international women's
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:09.660]  day means a man pretending to be a woman and then they take it next level with stuff like
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:22.500]  this from vice is it possible to be straight and want to have sex with a guy I mean I I'm
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:28.380]  a straight man but I fancy my guy friend what's happening and you gotta understand this whole
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:35.180]  thing is really just weird straight liberal men or well gay liberal men just confused
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:41.460]  in their own sexuality but really the argument they're trying to make and you see this popping
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:46.300]  up all over now is that if you're a man and you won't have sex with a trans woman then
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:53.380]  you're a homophobe or a transphobe I don't really get it but that's what they're really
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:15:00.660]  trying to say so let me give you the gruesome details of what they're telling you so you
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.260]  may not want to listen to this but I'm just going to tell you and I'm sorry to do this
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:11.380]  to you but this is what it is the liberals the radical American left believe that if
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:20.820]  a man slices up his penis and genitalia and then folds it into a wound a self inflicted
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:26.980]  whole in their body literally chopping up slicing up their penis and turning it into
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:33.500]  a hole in their body and if you don't want to have sex with that as a man you're a transphobe
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:42.060]  let me make something perfectly clear if you're a man that doesn't want to stick your penis
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:49.380]  in another man's chopped up diced up penis hole that does not make you a transphobe or
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:16:02.500]  a homophobe or anything else quite frankly that makes you sane right now I'm not talking
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.980]  to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com and gotten the great

[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:20.700]  dildos but we're not grooming your children that all goes on by the way everything I just
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:28.900]  said goes on here's the latest the video is at info wars dot com in fact I may even have
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:35.460]  it on my list here I've got so many of these videos we'll play this video to 11 year old
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:42.460]  confronts officials by reading shocking gay porn book found in school library it's another
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:48.180]  day and there is another case of graphic gay pornography being found inside a school library
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.860]  but this time it isn't one of the parents exposing it rather one of the school children
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:58.700]  read aloud extracts of the book to shocked board officials this doesn't exist it's not
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.700]  real and then you show it to them and they say how dare you you bigot here's the video
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:10.980]  hi my name's knock say jack I'm 11 years old and I go to middle school I'm a sixth grader
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:17.900]  I was no library and this book was on a stand I'd like to read you a page my back over my
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:23.700]  hips as I asked if we should take off take our clothes off and he's saying yes before
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:29.420]  I finish my sentence he's pulling off my t-shirt laughing when I can't undo his shirt buttons
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.660]  he's undoing my belt I'm reaching into his bedside drawer for a condom we're kissing
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:38.700]  again we're rolling over obviously you can see where this is going I don't know if it's
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:44.820]  because we're feeling especially emotional or just tired or these past couple of weeks
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:49.540]  have been too much but this reminds me so much of the first time we had sex we were
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:54.220]  both fucking terrified and the whole thing was kind of terrible because we didn't know
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:23:01.580]  what we were doing but it was good too so good because we were a mess of emotions and
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:06.900]  we were scared and excited and everything felt new so this sort of thing this sort of
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:13.020]  feels like that Nick touches me like he's scared that any minute now this book was at
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:18.780]  my middle school and it was on a stand when I rented it out to show my dad it the librarian
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:35.540]  asked if I wanted more and if I wanted a graphic novel version wow oh boy so I'm that kid's
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:40.740]  father okay good I was asking for you yeah I'll take another three minutes so that I'd
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:45.820]  like to know the name of the librarian that 11 years old and went to his library and found
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:54.700]  that by the entry door of our library this is the smut that he is finding alright I don't
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:02.460]  care whether it's gay straight bisexual whatever the terms are for all this stuff doesn't need
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:08.380]  to be at our school doesn't need to be at my 11 year old's library and then as far as
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:15.780]  genderqueer I've got a son in the high school as well and this is bullshit we know it alright
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:22.860]  we do not need to be having literature that's showing boys how to suck dick alright this
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:29.380]  is a very very frustrated about it okay and you may think that schools know the best for
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:35.220]  our children you know who know the best for our children the parents how do you how do
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:42.700]  you even rationalize this how do you even explain this but you know what needs to be
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:50.900]  happening is that the librarians or the teachers or whoever it is that brings the books that
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:54.900]  that brings this content into libraries and classrooms they need to be put on stands and
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:25:00.460]  question and explain at what what it is that's motivating this that's that's what's lacking
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:08.220]  here so we've exposed how they show kids pornography we've exposed how they're grooming children
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:15.900]  we've exposed it all now the people doing it need to answer some questions as to why
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:23.180]  I'd like to hear the explanation from whoever put a gay porn book in a elementary school
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:34.020]  library I'd love to hear their reason why let's really get them to explain that you
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:42.060]  need to be open-minded and tolerant of LGBTQ ideologies you didn't answer my question why
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:53.020]  did you put a gay porn book in an elementary school library but they hate you trans game
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.780]  developer launches first-person shooter where players kill anti trans villains including
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:09.060]  priests creator Sandra mowen claimed making the bloody game helped heal her from trauma
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:16.700]  as a trans person they hate you they want your kid to be a sexual deviant and they want
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:25.300]  you dead and by the way they're all mentally disturbed we've got a new video this is an
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:31.540]  older story woman who set herself on fire in Portland Park remembered as a brilliant
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:37.780]  and tortured artists and this is a far left liberal confused in her own sexuality she
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:44.340]  couldn't decide if she was trans or not let herself on fire but she's brilliant she's
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:55.140]  so brilliant and now it's happened again here this is at UC Berkeley another individual
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:17.140]  Baptist activist lights himself on fire here in clip 17 you know and are you listening
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:24.260]  to when what do we do are we supposed to call someone like what is this oh my god and look
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:31.580]  I mean obviously that's a pretty wild situation to walk in on but it's just like the videos
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.020]  we see this all the time like the video where the guy sitting there loading his gun at jams
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:38.900]  he takes a minute then he shoots a guy execution style in the streets it's like people are
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:44.860]  so out of touch with humanity they're so out of touch with the world we live in you're
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:51.820]  sitting there watching a guy self emulate and you say what do I do do I call somebody like
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:28:01.420]  oh my gosh like everybody's making fun of this girl her video goes viral because she
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:09.420]  in a in a two minute in a two minute segment on a podcast she says like about 50 times
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:18.820]  and I mean really she's just a reflection of generations raised by leftist liberal educators
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:23.220]  and so you're not supposed to learn things you're not supposed to be eloquent you're
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:30.220]  not supposed to be successful you're supposed to be a virtue signaling social justice warrior
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:35.460]  and that's how you get ahead in life not being smart not reading not learning not building
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:41.420]  just being a victim and that's why they convince these people hey go light yourself on fire
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.860]  you're doing a good thing for the cause now luckily that individual survived with second
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:53.140]  and third degree burns but just get used to it until the modern day mental illness of
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:29:22.140]  liberalism is addressed and stopped this is just going to be normal activity now.

[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:23.100]  calls in response to the two main subjects of discussion which is the coping mechanisms
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:33.900]  the defense mechanisms of the mentally impaired liberals who were wrong about COVID-19 and
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:37.580]  instead of saying okay you know we got it wrong or we got bad information here's the
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.740]  real story they blame Donald Trump they blame Tucker Carlson and they blame racism it's
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:48.780]  their this is their psychological coping mechanism defense mechanism is what happens when you
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:54.780]  have a mental disability and you can't deal with the world in a rational way and these
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:58.940]  people belong in mental institutions but they're on television they're in government and they're
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:04.180]  destroying our country we now live in an open air mental institution it's called the United
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:11.420]  States and then of course just everything we're watching with the open grooming sexual grooming
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:23.340]  of children now like this this is so sick lawsuit alleges New York teacher forced fifth
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:30.180]  grader to become transgender causing suicidal thoughts a New York teacher forced a prepubescent
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:35.740]  girl to become transgender without her parents knowledge and now the child was contemplating
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:45.740]  suicide a lawsuit filed against Brookhaven Coswogue school district alleges teacher Deborah
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:50.580]  Rosenquist manipulated a nine-year-old female student at Terryville road elementary school
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:55.580]  into becoming transgender by calling her Leo and using male pronouns to address her during
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:37:07.220]  the twenty twenty one twenty two school year I just can't even believe we're dealing with
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:19.460]  this how deranged is that how evil is that how sick how psychotic and you know that's
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:31.940]  not the only case Southern California teacher arrested for secretly recording students in
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:47.820]  all gender bathroom I'm just gonna I just can't even trans activists arrested after
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:52.580]  attacking Oklahoma State congressmen and police officer are getting more deranged as the days
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:57.540]  go by they're attacking people they're grooming children they're lighting themselves on fire
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:15.160]  they need to be protected from themselves folks just like discipline works might not
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:22.140]  work perfectly every time it might not work every time but discipline works and you know
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:28.620]  I'm glad I got disciplined when I was a kid and I'm glad I got disciplined when I was
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:37.580]  a young adult but when I would act up and what I would misbehave as a kid and I would
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:45.500]  get punished I mean you know I took a few I took a few belt weapons I took a few wooden
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:51.260]  spoon weapons did my parents do that to me because they hated me or did my parents do
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:39:01.020]  that to me because they loved me no they did that to me because they loved me and so I
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:08.520]  come from a place of love when I'm saying these people need to be disciplined if you're
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.920]  targeting children with your sexual agenda you need to be disciplined you need to be
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:23.660]  you need to be disciplined I'm just gonna leave it that but it's just it's only gonna
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.860]  get worse folks that's the problem it's I mean seriously like does a kid have to get
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:35.380]  raped in a bathroom I mean how bad does it have to get that won't even do it that'll
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:40.860]  happen and that won't even stop this oh that's right it already did happen and what did the
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:45.540]  school board do they covered it up and what did the FBI do they investigated the parents
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:49.980]  as terrorists because they were upset that a little girl got raped in the bathroom by
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:56.540]  a trans boy or a trans girl and so they covered it up because we don't want to hurt the trans
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:01.980]  agenda we don't want to hurt the LGBTQ agenda we don't want to hurt the pedophile agenda
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:09.580]  so let's just cover that up Canadian pastor gets violently removed from a child's drag
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:23.380]  queen story hour I've got these videos folks this is this is this is going to be some of
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:31.180]  the most disturbing stuff you've ever seen in your life but we're gonna air it right
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:41.260]  now and we showed you yesterday we had founders of gays against groomers on the war room yesterday
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:47.060]  Jamie Mitchell and we covered this with her and now new videos are servicing and I think
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:55.220]  what's going on here now is these events are happening and they've what they've learned
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:00.860]  what the what the pedophiles have learned is hey we can't promote these events anymore
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:05.860]  because we're getting caught so now they're doing more of kind of the underground style
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:11.460]  events where they have groups and email chains that they know it's safe to talk about how
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.340]  they want to sexualize and groom kids and so they send out their little flyers and they
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.340]  send out their little notices and they rent back rooms and they rent basements and they
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:27.060]  rent rent these facilities and it's all of these adults bringing their kids and it's
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:33.020]  it's toddlers it's infants again we played the one video yesterday but they've learned
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:38.260]  they can't promote this publicly anymore because they get shut down they get exposed a lot of
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:43.820]  the drag queen story readers are convicted pedophiles and child abusers and then they
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:47.100]  just change their names so you can't do a background check and now they're groping kids
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:55.980]  into school so we'll come back and we'll play maybe the most disgusting video definitely
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:04.420]  you'll see all day but maybe all time but this is what they've done now they've taken
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:07.940]  it from there we're going to post drag queen story hour all over the place we're going
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.940]  to market it on the internet we're going to market it on the streets too okay we can't
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:16.140]  do that anymore it's showing what our real intentions are and we're getting shut down
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:24.780]  so now they want to go underground but all that's caused is these events to be even worse
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:34.220]  so when I tell you that we have grown men dressing up like women in sexual outfits gimp
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:44.260]  outfits leather daddy outfits fake penises for toddlers and infants you wouldn't even
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:51.380]  believe me I'm going to show you the videos of this on the other side and it's new videos
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:43:05.380]  of this exact thing now every day ladies and gentlemen info wars has proven itself in the
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:29.380]  biggest effect out there against those tires and we fund our operation and we fund our
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:56.820]  operation.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.820]  Watch your life and keep us on air in FullerStore.com.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.820]  It was almost as if it were a plan in both India and Pakistan.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:33.820]  We need to go into the capital!
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.820]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:38.820]  They are nothing but distract.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:41.820]  You guys censored Harvard education doctors.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:43.820]  You silenced those voices.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:46.820]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but...
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:56.820]  As soon as we start exposing the great preset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:24.820]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week,
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.820]  it's really just incredible.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:30.820]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:36.820]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:39.820]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:43.820]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.820]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:48.820]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:52.820]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:57.820]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:58.820]  Please take action now.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.820]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:06.820]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:11.820]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.820]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:22.820]  and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:24.820]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:28.820]  They get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset, The War for the World.

[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:09.820]  And I thank you.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:27.820]  All right, you know, we should probably even pull in the videos from yesterday too.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:38.820]  I mean, it's like, okay, we cover it, we move on, but maybe it's time we start compiling this stuff and putting it into files so we can just overwhelm
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:45.820]  the senses with this degeneracy, overwhelm the senses with this filth.
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:49.820]  So here you go, this is new video.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:51.820]  You're saying you covered this video yesterday.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:56.820]  That was a separate video from a separate event.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:02.820]  But no, we did cover the video yesterday of...
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:04.820]  I don't even know what they call it.
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.820]  I forget what they call it.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:13.820]  Strip tees for children, strip tees for toddlers, and they market it as a sexual event for kids under two years old.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:28.820]  And it's grown men in thongs and leather gimp suits that you see on the screen doing sex teases for infants with fake penises and fake breasts and the whole thing.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:34.820]  That was yesterday.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.820]  So here's the new one today.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:43.820]  Like, you can't even properly respond and discipline what's going on from this video before the next one comes out.
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:49.820]  And so here it is, drag queen sexy time for kids and infants.
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.820]  This video has just surfaced.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:49:06.820]  Yeah!
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:22.820]  I mean, what is that?
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:51.820]  How do you even explain that? How do you justify that?
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:55.820]  And this is just utter madness.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:57.820]  This is just utter degeneracy.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:59.820]  This is just utter sickness.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:09.820]  Child abuse.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:12.820]  Now, let's just remember how we got here.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:16.820]  Shall we call it the slippery slope?
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:20.820]  But let's remember how we got to this point.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:28.820]  They introduced drag queen story time for kids about five years ago.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:32.820]  And it was nationwide and it was international.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:43.820]  And at that time they would actually take the sexual perverts, many of which had prior arrest records of child abuse, child porn, sex abuse, prostitution.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:45.820]  We busted them in Texas.
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:51.820]  They caught multiple ones in Texas reading to kids, getting access to kids, libraries, schools, you name it.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:54.820]  They got caught.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:51:00.820]  And so they kind of backed off a little bit and then there were a bunch of protests and they canceled a lot of events.
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:08.820]  And so they kind of backed off and now they've brought it back with increased velocity and aggression.
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:12.820]  Oh, it's just drag queen story time for kids.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:17.820]  They've grown men that want to dress as women and read to children.
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:25.820]  And how quickly that became drag queen sex stripper sex tease for kids.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:36.820]  Am I not describing what you're seeing on the screen accurately here?
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:40.820]  But you know, maybe that's why they love Zalinsky so much.
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.820]  Put the b-roll of clip 19 on the screen.
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:56.820]  And I was thinking about doing a whole push because there's so much of this Zalinsky content out there of him doing porn jokes and doing penis jokes.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.820]  And it's like that was his whole bit.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:02.820]  You know, he was a TV comedian before he became the president.
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:12.820]  And his main bit was gay jokes and penis jokes and flashing his genitalia for the audience on television. That was his main joke.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:16.820]  Now he's the president. Maybe that's why they like Zalinsky so much.
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:20.820]  So I was thinking maybe we should just find it because there's dozens of these.
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:30.820]  Someone does need to put together a master compilation of all the different gay kink videos that Zalinsky did before he became president.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:35.820]  Because it really just puts the whole thing into perspective.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:37.820]  It really just puts the whole thing into perspective.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:41.820]  They want you to think Zalinsky is a serious guy. He's a serious diplomat.
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:44.820]  He's a serious leader of Ukraine in this war.
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:57.820]  No, he's a gay kink comedian who is now going to be the president of Ukraine when it falls.
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:01.820]  And that's my fault if I don't want to send all my money to Ukraine.
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:07.820]  That's my fault if I don't want men and women from America to die in Ukraine.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.820]  You know, I'm just curious. We've sent all the money to Ukraine.
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:13.820]  We got a bit of a situation in East Palestine.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:17.820]  And I have a story on that today.
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:27.820]  Scientists slams EPA for not testing for cancer-causing chemical in East Palestine and then the EPA was actually there yesterday and they put out a video saying,
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.820]  I wouldn't put my kids anywhere near the water.
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:33.820]  Ho! That's funny you say that three weeks later.
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.820]  But I'm just curious.
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:41.820]  Is Ukraine going to send some money to the people in East Palestine to help them clean up?
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:47.820]  I mean, certainly with all the help we've given Ukraine, it's going to be paid back, right? I mean, Ukraine owes us, right?
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.820]  They're going to help us out, right?
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:53.820]  No. No, it's a one-way street, isn't it?
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:57.820]  And that just proves capitalism has failed.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.820]  America has failed.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:03.820]  Really? That we can just fund every war across the planet?
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:07.820]  Because we have so much money and wealth?
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:09.820]  I guess that's a failure.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:17.820]  How are you going to support the war in Ukraine if we don't have any money or wealth or power that the left wants to take from us?
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:24.820]  But I'm sure Ukraine is going to pay it back, right? And I'm sure if America ever had a disaster, Ukraine would come to our aid.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:32.820]  And I'm sure since we're being invaded now, the Ukrainians will come to support our southern border that's being invaded, right?
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.820]  That's how this works, right?
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:36.820]  Hmm.
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:38.820]  Hmm.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:41.820]  Perhaps not, actually.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:43.820]  Perhaps not.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:54.820]  So here's what I want to do. I've got a bunch of other news, but for the third hour today, I want to take your calls in response to the two main stories.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:04.820]  And that's the left-wing defense coping mechanisms of blaming Trump and Tucker Carlson and racism because they got the COVID-19 story wrong.
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:13.820]  Or you can call in on this blatant, direct child abuse, sexual grooming of children that we've put on display.
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:25.820]  Now, to be clear, though, there is a bunch of other news that I'm just going to cover on the war room, like the developments in Ukraine and some other news.
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:30.820]  But I really want to flesh these two subjects out with the audience today.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:40.820]  And just let's just, I mean, how do we deal with this? How do we respond to this? How do we, how do we survive this?
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:47.820]  How do we survive the American media lying to us, conning us, deceiving us?
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.820]  And then when they get caught, they blame you.
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:56:06.820]  How do we explain, how do we survive adult men pretending to be women and doing striptease sex shows for kids?
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:10.820]  How do you deal with that? How do you survive that as a culture?
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:20.820]  I want to take calls on this for the entire third hour. 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:25.820]  And then I'm going to get to the rest of the news on the war room later today.
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:31.820]  But I mean, seriously, how do you deal with and survive an American media that consciously lies to you?
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:48.820]  And then when they get caught, they blame you. How do you survive a cultural phenomenon of sexualizing and abusing children with things like drag queen, strippy, sexy time for kids?
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:56.820]  How do you deal with these issues? How do you survive these issues? 877-789-2539. Let's keep it on those two topics, please.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:03.820]  So we conclude the second hour of the Alex Jones show today, entering the third hour with your phone calls.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:11.820]  But again, you know, part of what makes info war so special, it's not just me talking all day or Alex Jones or Harrison Smith covering the news.
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:25.820]  It's the human intelligence and you in the audience and using this mothership of communication to source out human intelligence as well as bringing the news next year's news today,
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:31.820]  next decade's news today as info wars has been doing for 25 years. That's why they want us off the air.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:34.820]  But we're listener supported. That's why we got to keep it on air.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:48.820]  So shop at infowarstore.com. Keep this mothership of communication against worldwide tyranny in orbit.
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:55.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words,
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:02.820]  planned for our future, that is the hellish future. Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:08.820]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or infowarstore.com.
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:16.820]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:21.820]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:25.820]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:31.820]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air.
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:35.820]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:42.820]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:46.820]  and donate it to the library or give it to the local school. This is an info war.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:48.820]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:57.820]  I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:58:59.820]  That's the good news. They're amazing.
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:07.820]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to infowarstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:15.820]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:23.820]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com and got some of these amazing products.
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:29.820]  I would recommend turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects.
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:31.820]  So you reorder and see how great it is.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:40.820]  Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[01:59:40.820 --> 02:00:07.820]  For a real Red Bull Plus, just go try the product, fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler together infowarstore.com.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:16.820]  Alright, we're collecting the phone calls right now on the two main subjects of discussion.
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:20.820]  By the way, Joe Biden just promised to ban assault weapons and take your guns.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.820]  So, you know, that's what tyrants do.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:27.820]  These people complain about Hitler all day long and then they do exactly what Hitler did.
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:34.820]  Sensor their political opposition, launch false flags to blame their political opposition and take your firearms. Amazing.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:38.820]  You guys hate Hitler so much. You do everything he did.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:39.820]  Incredible stuff.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:50.820]  But we're collecting your calls on the two main subject of discussion today, which is the American media getting caught lying to you, covering up the truth,
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:57.820]  but then blaming you for it, blaming Trump for it, Tucker Carlson for it, racism for it, everything, but looking internally at themselves.
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:17.820]  They're the problem. It's them and then this unspeakable, unbelievable, unfathomable phenomenon of child sex drag queen shows that we witness every day.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:19.820]  And don't tell me it's anything but that.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:20.820]  I don't want to hear that.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:22.820]  Don't tell me that's not what this is.
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:34.820]  When you've got grown men pretending to be women dancing around in thongs and doing sexual strip teases on sex toy leather straps,
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:37.820]  like they're strippers at a club for adults.
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:41.820]  Don't tell me that's not what this is.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:51.820]  No, I'm not going to sit here and have you lie to my face while you sexualize children.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.820]  All right.
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:02:06.820]  Now, before we do that, Chip Roy is one of the good guys in Congress and he's getting sick of the lack of action from the Republican Party.
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:13.820]  And he's wondering what gives and he went off during general speak speech time in Congress.
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:15.820]  And it sounded like this.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:22.820]  And what is this side of the aisle doing about it? Not a damned thing.
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:26.820]  What is this side of the aisle doing about open borders?
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.820]  Nothing.
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:30.820]  Nothing.
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:38.820]  What is this side of the aisle doing about an ATF rule about to make felons out of 10 million Americans or more?
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:41.820]  Nothing.
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:47.820]  What is this side of the aisle going to do about spending? Lip service.
[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:53.820]  We have a debt ceiling approaching or running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.820]  We should say something right now.
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:03:02.820]  We should pass a bill off this floor saying that we will raise the debt ceiling.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:11.820]  Only, only if you end the disastrous student loans that are going to cost $400 billion and drive up the cost of higher ed.
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.820]  Only if you rescind the $91 billion of unobligated COVID money.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:27.820]  Only if you go rescind the $80 billion designed to increase the IRS to go after taxpayers.
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.820]  He's not wrong.
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:32.820]  He's not wrong.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:38.820]  And by the way, where's Kevin McCarthy been?
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.820]  What's Kevin McCarthy up to?
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.820]  Kevin.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:44.820]  Kevin.
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:47.820]  You doing anything for us, bud?
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:52.820]  Where's that January 6 footage you promised would be released?
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:56.820]  By the way, some footage is leaking, I think out of these court cases.
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:58.820]  We'll cover this later today.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:04.820]  But Kevin McCarthy now, we're about two months into your time as speaker.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:11.820]  And overall, you're doing nothing.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.820]  So that's really too bad.
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:18.820]  You built yourself up like you'd be the Republican Speaker of the House that we needed.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:26.820]  You built yourself up like you'd be the Republican Speaker of the House that we so desperately need to take action
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:31.820]  against the corruption, against the crimes, against the Democrat Party, against the Biden crime family.
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:36.820]  And yet here we are and you're basically nothing.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.820]  You've had some good speeches.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:40.820]  You've had some good made for TV moments.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:42.820]  You've said you're going to do some good things.
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:45.820]  But yet here we are and what have you done?
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:51.820]  What promise has Kevin McCarthy followed up on since he became the Speaker of the House?
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.820]  Nada.
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:54.820]  Zero.
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.820]  Goose egg.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:59.820]  Nothing.
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:05.820]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infowarstore.com
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:10.820]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body.
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:11.820]  And keep us on air.
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:17.820]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:19.820]  and never gone to infowarstore.com.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:25.820]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarstore.com
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:28.820]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:29.820]  Sure, you share a link.
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:30.820]  You share an article.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:31.820]  You tell folks about the show.
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:32.820]  That's great.
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:33.820]  And I thank you.
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:34.820]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:38.820]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:43.820]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:44.820]  All of these are really great products.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:45.820]  They keep us on air.
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:47.820]  Plus, you're missing out on these products.
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.820]  So get off the bench.
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:50.820]  Get in the game.
[02:05:50.820 --> 02:06:18.820]  Go to infowarstore.com right now.
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:22.820]  And I gave out the two subjects for discussion.
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:27.820]  The American media lying to us, get caught lying to us and then blame you.
[02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:33.820]  Or this phenomenon of drag queen sexy time for kids.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:41.820]  And the lines filled up quickly and almost every caller is on the drag queen for kids subject here.
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:49.820]  And I think that's fitting because at the end of the day, if we can't protect the innocence of the youth,
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:58.820]  if we can't protect the children, then forget about what happens when adults lie to us and when adults deceive us
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:02.820]  and propagandize us and then blame us for what they've done.
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:10.820]  If we can't even protect innocent children from sexual deviance and perverts, then why am I sitting here talking about fake news?
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:14.820]  When there's damn child abuse happening right down the street.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:17.820]  So almost every caller called in on this.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:23.820]  So I'm imagining this is going to be the main topic of discussion here this hour.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:31.820]  But how could you not be stunned and shocked and horrified at what we've seen from these events for kids?
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:44.820]  Stuff it's like you're at a strip club and they call up the stripper to the stage and that's the special performance they do at the adult strip club except it's for kids.
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:53.820]  So a lot of callers on this and we start in Florida with Cynthia.
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:56.820]  Cynthia, you're on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:59.820]  Hi, Ellen. Thanks for talking to me.
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:07.820]  I have a question and this is the question I always have when I see these these video clips.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:24.820]  And I wonder is there any clip of has anyone been able to get an interview with the parents that are bringing these children to these events just to have a serious conversation?
[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:28.820]  I am a parent. I have a child. She's grown. Thank God.
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:39.820]  I don't know what I'd do if I had a small child right now, but has anyone tried to get a rational answer from these people as to why?
[02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:45.820]  Why in the world would you bring your child to a demonstration of that nature?
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:50.820]  What are you trying to gain? What are you trying to prove? What's going on here?
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:57.820]  You know, I don't think I have seen that. I don't think I have seen a parent try to explain that or break that down.
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:00.820]  That's pretty funny, don't you think?
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:05.820]  Well, you know, I think you do have a little bit of an outside-the-box thought here because when I've gone to these events,
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:12.820]  the direction I've always gone is I either interview the hosts or try to get comments from the hosts,
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:17.820]  whether it's at a library, a school, or a church. That's where they all seem to go.
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:23.820]  Now they do it in, they rent secret basements and stuff because they got a little too public exposure.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:27.820]  You know, people don't like seeing child sex abuse, so they have to hide it.
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:32.820]  But yeah, I always try to either get comment from the performers or from the hosts.
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:39.820]  So I, from my best recollection, I don't recall parents ever explaining why they would involve their kids in this.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.820]  No, I don't think I've seen that, actually.
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:50.820]  Well, you know what? They are participating and, you know, if I bring my child to an event like that,
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:56.820]  yeah, some of the blame is on me. It's just like when you see something objectionable,
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:10:01.820]  whether it's on TV, on the radio, whatever, it's like, well, you know, you could always turn the channel.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:03.820]  Well, you know, you don't have to show up.
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:08.820]  Well, why are you exposing your children to something like this?
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:13.820]  I mean, would you try to get brownie points with somebody? I don't get it.
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:19.820]  Yeah, that's a fair point, fair question, not really getting addressed.
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:23.820]  Well, somebody needs to find a subtle way to talk to these people,
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:28.820]  because I sure would be very interested just to hear what their aspect is.
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:36.820]  I'm sorry, I'm laughing because you say subtle and it's like, how do I, how do you subtly ask a parent
[02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:39.820]  why you brought your kid to the strip club?
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:43.820]  Like, how do you subtly ask, how do you subtly ask a parent, hey, why do you like,
[02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:45.820]  why are you sexually grooming your child?
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:51.820]  Like, how do you subtly, I don't know, how do you breach that so subtly?
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:54.820]  Well, there's something for us to work on then.
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:57.820]  It's a fair question what these parents are thinking.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:04.820]  Now, the one aspect that we're seeing, and perhaps it's more innocent than the worst of it,
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:12.820]  where parents will dress their little boy up like a girl and then post videos of that happening on social media
[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:18.820]  for clicks, for likes, because they do it for the social media phenomenon, for the social phenomenon.
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:27.820]  But that's, even that's a lesser evil of what we're seeing in these strip tease sexy events for kids.
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:30.820]  But great point Cynthia, great point.
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:32.820]  Thanks honey, thanks for bringing this out.
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.820]  I really appreciate you and Alex and everyone, God bless you.
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:41.820]  Well, you know, look, it makes me nauseous having to look at this stuff as it does everybody.
[02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:43.820]  But how are we going to stop it?
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:47.820]  How are we going to address this evil if we don't admit it's going on?
[02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:49.820]  Let's go to Nick in Tennessee.
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:52.820]  Nick, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:56.820]  Hey Owen, this is Nick Anonymous I called last night.
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:58.820]  Right on.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:06.820]  I just want to say I cannot, this is degeneracy to the extreme and depravity to the maximum.
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:15.820]  There is nothing worse than watching men shake their money makers in front of babies in libraries.
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:17.820]  And that's literally what it is.
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:19.820]  Like you just explained exactly what it is.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:21.820]  You might hear that and say that's not happening.
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:25.820]  You just explained exactly what we played videos of for the last hour and a half.
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:33.820]  I can't even let my daughter, my four-year-old daughter, watch Infowars, watch your show,
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:44.820]  report on this on other parents letting their children watch grown men show their bung holes in libraries.
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:47.820]  I mean, and my daughter likes to watch Infowars.
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:52.820]  She likes to watch the down and out ad and the Chinese drag.
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:54.820]  And we say, oh, I call you later.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.820]  America, I have to hurt you.
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:06.820]  Well, yeah, we've had this phenomenon of not just, you know, people will call and say, hey, can you not show that?
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:12.820]  And I mean, yeah, I mean, I could not show what they're doing to kids, but they're doing it to kids.
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:16.820]  And so it's like, if I don't cover it, if I don't show it, then you don't even realize that this is going on.
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:18.820]  You don't even realize this evil is out here.
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:24.820]  We've had situations where we play some of this, you know, drag queen sexy time for kids events that the left loves.
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:32.820]  And some of our affiliates and some of the people that syndicate us on TV send us measures like, hey, you can't put that on TV.
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:33.820]  Hey, I can't put that on TV.
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:40.820]  So it's not considered appropriate for television, but it's promoted for children.
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:42.820]  Gotcha.
[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:43.820]  Right.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:46.820]  And everyone is just so sick of seeing this.
[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:49.820]  You know, and as a father, I can't even stomach to watch.
[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:55.820]  Well, I would say this and I, you know, this is me kind of being a little, a little obstinate, maybe, but I would say this.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:58.820]  I understand where you're coming from, but I would just say this.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:00.820]  Yeah, believe me, I'm sick of seeing it too.
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:05.820]  And so if you're sick of seeing this crap, we need to put an end to it.
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:06.820]  That's the point, Nick.
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:07.820]  Thank you for the call.
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:09.820]  Let's go to David in New Jersey.
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:11.820]  David, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:12.820]  Go ahead.
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:14.820]  Hey, thank you for taking my call.
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:20.820]  Yeah, about the Drag Queen storytime, I want to piggyback off of what Cynthia was saying in Florida health.
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:28.820]  It's the women, but if you look at the women, they're all the same demographic, white women, kind of like the yoga pants, Starbucks customer moms.
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:30.820]  Yeah, white women.
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:31.820]  Right.
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.820]  There's no fathers there.
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:35.820]  They're all working or you're paying alimony to these poor things.
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.820]  But like, where are these men, these fathers?
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:39.820]  Nobody's stepping up and saying anything.
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:41.820]  I wouldn't let my kid go to one of these things.
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:43.820]  And my wife wouldn't do it.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:47.820]  Well, and I just, to be fair here, it's not 100% all women.
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.820]  I mean, I've seen videos and there are some of the men there.
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:51.820]  Maybe they got their own little things going on.
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:53.820]  But there will be two father type situations.
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:56.820]  They're not like, you know, a guy that works in construction, they're not cops and firemen.
[02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:57.820]  Sure, sure.
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:01.820]  I get the point you're making.
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:07.820]  Well, no, there's no doubt the common thread here is leftism, liberalism, progressivism, Democrat voters.
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:12.820]  That's the common thread in all these Drag Queen for kids events.
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:16.820]  You know, the kids also seem very disinterested.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:21.820]  Like the one clip you showed, the two kids have their back to the, to the, to the Titanic pedophile game and dancing.
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:23.820]  And they're playing with like balls on the floor or toys.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:24.820]  Yeah.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:30.820]  And it seems like it's more for the parents, but it's a virtual, virtual signaling event for themselves to make themselves feel great.
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:31.820]  Yeah.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:32.820]  And the kids are just, just, just hotter.
[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:33.820]  That's pretty much it.
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:40.820]  Or I mean, look, you know, like, you know, my, my dad would take me to sporting events as a kid because he liked sports.
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:44.820]  So, okay. And then now I like sports, but this is like, are they just into porn?
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:46.820]  Are they just into sex?
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:50.820]  So they're like, oh, I'm going to take my kid to a porn sex event because I like that.
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:51.820]  And I want them to like it too.
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:16:18.820]  Is that what's going on here?
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:34.820]  Okay, I haven't actually gone to infowarestore.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life, but again, will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:46.820]  So whether it's real Red Pill Plus or super high quality CBD oil, whether 50% off or a great Physiomanezium product, or whether it's down and out of a sleep phase that's back in stock, it's all there.
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:49.500]  are turmeric, 95% humanoid, strongest out there,
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:52.980]  turmeric 95, it's all available at infoworkstore.com
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:53.940]  and it keeps it on the air.
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:56.140]  So make the decision to enrich your life
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:57.780]  and keep us on air, infoworkstore.com.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.380]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:03.300]  exposing the cartels and coming under fire
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:05.220]  or you're on the streets of some American city
[02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:07.180]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.980]  and now you've gone to ground zero
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:10.460]  of a massive chemical spill.
[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:12.220]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:14.380]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:17.180]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:18.900]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:21.420]  And again, I have info words to thank for that.
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:22.460]  Looking back on the day,
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:25.620]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:29.140]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained
[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.460]  under Alex Jones and under the info words team
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.900]  and I really do credit that
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:36.500]  as to why I'm able to get these types of clips
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:39.140]  because Alex's whole mentality was,
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:40.460]  go where the story is,
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:43.060]  go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:45.260]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:47.060]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:48.740]  and helping the American people.
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:50.340]  And I really do credit Alex
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:53.420]  for really instilling that within me early on in my career.

[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.020]  In the last month, I got a little busy
[02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:51.940]  so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:54.460]  But now I signed the last books and get them right down.
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.300]  Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:02.020]  It's hard to believe that we're already going
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:04.540]  into March, 2023.
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:06.340]  And the world is an insane place.
[02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:08.060]  World War III has already started.
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:10.420]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:11.540]  There's mass censorship.
[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:13.780]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.

[02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:17.340]  But the good things that are happening
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:20.700]  is humanity is really accelerating, it's away.
[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:22.100]  But those of us on the forefront
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:24.620]  are under more attack by the establishment than ever.

[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:01.260]  Leading a frontal assault
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:04.140]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:11.140]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:17.740]  To the town of our free road,
[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:21.620]  a stranger one fine day.
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:23.860]  Hardly spoke to folks around him,
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:27.820]  didn't have too much to say.
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:29.900]  No one said to ask his business,
[02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:30.900]  no one said to ask his business,
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:31.900]  no one said to ask his business,
[02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:32.900]  no one said to ask his business,
[02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:35.500]  I'd say, it's a normal functioning civilization
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:38.900]  and a prosperous and free United States of America.
[02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:42.900]  But until we admit what the modern day left has become,
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:46.420]  and until we accept that it must be removed
[02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:50.740]  like a cancerous tumor from our body,
[02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:53.300]  immediately if we want to survive,
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:55.060]  then we're going to have to continue to deal with stuff
[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:56.580]  like we see in these videos
[02:20:56.580 --> 02:21:00.740]  of what is just outright sexual grooming
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:02.420]  and abuse of children.
[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:08.540]  And so, a lot of callers on this today, we go back to the phone lines to Jennifer, calling
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:09.540]  in from Maryland.
[02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:11.260]  Jennifer, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:12.260]  Go ahead.
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:13.260]  Hi, Owen.
[02:21:13.260 --> 02:21:15.420]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:21.260]  I just have a question that just keeps ringing in my head every time I see this stuff is,
[02:21:21.260 --> 02:21:25.740]  how come people aren't calling CPS when these parents, because what they're doing to the
[02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:29.420]  kids is abuse, it's a form of abuse.
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:33.420]  So how come they are not having their children taken from them?
[02:21:33.420 --> 02:21:40.940]  Well, I think there is an answer to that, which would be the left runs everything and
[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:45.340]  it's considered politically correct now to sexually groom children.
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:51.100]  So CPS isn't concerned about what liberalism is doing to kids, that's politically correct
[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:54.820]  as long as you call it liberal or LGBTQ plus.
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:22:03.420]  Now, what you're asking though, I don't know if it's ever actually been stress tested.
[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:06.020]  So I think we're really just left to assume.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:09.380]  I don't believe CPS has ever been called to one of these events.
[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:14.060]  I don't believe CPS has ever been called to parents that subject their children to this.
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:19.340]  I mean, my guess is, if you were taking your young son or daughter and infant to the strip
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:22.420]  club, you'd probably get a visit from CPS.
[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:23.420]  Exactly.
[02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:26.940]  If it's LGBTQ plus and liberal, then it's okay.
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:31.660]  So I don't know if it's really been stress tested, but it's the same old why.
[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:36.180]  As long as you have the facade of LGBTQ plus or liberalism, you can get away with whatever
[02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:39.940]  the hell you want and that's the overall answer to your question.
[02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:44.020]  But directly, I don't know if this has ever been stress tested.
[02:22:44.020 --> 02:22:49.940]  So maybe that's what needs to happen is 100 calls need to go to a local CPS.
[02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:55.380]  And next time one of these events is in your town, you should get a group of people, forget
[02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:59.300]  about protesting it, forget about showing up and protesting it anymore, get a group
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:03.780]  of people and have everybody call the police and everybody call CPS and say, hey, there's
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:06.540]  child abuse happening here.
[02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:11.220]  There's a adult entertainment event happening with children being subjected to it.
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:12.500]  And then let's stress test it.
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:13.500]  Let's see what happens.
[02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:15.740]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:17.180]  I think that's what needs to be done.
[02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:20.660]  I'm not one to like niche on people for things that's that and the other.
[02:23:20.660 --> 02:23:23.780]  But what they're doing is despicable and disgusting.
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:26.020]  It makes me sick to my stomach.
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:27.020]  And let's do it.
[02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.020]  Let's force the issue.
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:33.100]  If CPS says it's okay to sexually groom kids as long as you're a gay liberal, then okay,
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:35.980]  let's have them mark their line in the sand.
[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:39.980]  Let's have them make their stance on this known so we know who's going to protect children
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:40.980]  and who's not.
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:41.980]  Yeah.
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:42.980]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:48.460]  We already know because police actually police have been called to such events and the police,
[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:49.860]  there's not much they can really do.
[02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:53.540]  So at least as far as that's concerned, we know the police aren't going to do anything
[02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:54.540]  about this.
[02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:58.060]  But maybe CPS, maybe that is the next stress test.
[02:23:58.060 --> 02:24:01.660]  I think that's the best way to go with it because like you said, the police aren't going
[02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:02.660]  to do anything.
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:06.900]  CPS comes out for if your kid misses more than 12 days of school.
[02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:11.220]  If they're missing 12 days of school, they're getting called out for stupid stuff like that.
[02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:15.500]  They're not getting called out for the grooming and being around pedophiles and everything
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:16.500]  else.
[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:21.500]  You know, and I'm thinking more about this now too, how we can practically apply this
[02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:24.020]  stress test successfully.
[02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:28.980]  And there's some kind of basic questions that I would have to understand first like, I mean,
[02:24:28.980 --> 02:24:30.220]  how does CPS even work?
[02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:31.220]  Is it a national?
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:33.220]  Like if I was going to call CPS, do they have local hotlines?
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:34.700]  Is it a national hotline?
[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:35.700]  Is there local groups?
[02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:38.540]  I don't know if you know the answer to this stuff.
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:42.060]  I'm not exactly sure because I've never had to call CPS.
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:49.220]  I've had family members had CPS come out to their house for like numerous stupid reasons,
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:52.300]  but never with something like this, you know.
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:58.300]  I'll tell you what, you know what, I think you, this is why I opened up the lines today
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:00.340]  because this is good stuff here.
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:02.820]  This is good feedback.
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:06.460]  The issue of the parents that bring their kids to this and now the issue of is CPS going
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:11.060]  to be interested in protecting these kids, maybe we can even do a bit of a stress test
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:12.300]  here on air.
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:16.580]  I think guys, I think we're going to do a stress test here on air.
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:18.860]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:22.180]  And we'll see if we can, we'll see if this can happen.
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:28.780]  Guys, in the next segment, get me, see if there's a national CPS line and let's do it
[02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:36.340]  live on air and I'm going to call the national CPS line and I'm just going to ask if a parent
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:39.660]  brings their kid to a strip club, an adult entertainment club.
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:41.660]  Is that something you would investigate?
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:45.780]  And then if they say yes, say, okay, well, this is happening all across the nation with
[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:46.780]  these groups.
[02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:50.740]  I'm sure you're aware, drag queen, dance time for kids.
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:54.220]  Does CPS consider that to be the same level of child abuse as taking them to a strip
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:55.220]  club?
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:56.220]  If not, what's the difference?
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:58.780]  I will do that live on air in the next segment.
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:00.020]  How about that, Jennifer?
[02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:01.940]  That would be awesome.
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:03.540]  Thank you so much, Owen.
[02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:08.740]  Like, thank you so much, like you and Alex, I love you guys, keep doing what you're doing
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:13.340]  because you're opening a lot of people's eyes to everything that's going on in this world.
[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:14.980]  Well, and that's it too.
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:16.140]  And I thank you for that.
[02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:21.180]  Folks, you've got to understand, I mean, I don't want to spend too much time on this,
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:26.460]  but most people still just aren't aware of anything.
[02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:28.060]  I'm not trying to be rude.
[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:29.060]  You know what I'm saying.
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:30.460]  Most people walk around completely ignorant.
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:31.460]  They're living their own lives.
[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:32.460]  They're raising their own families.
[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:34.220]  They don't know about any of this stuff.
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:37.900]  And when you introduce it to them, or maybe they kind of see it in their peripheral, but
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:41.580]  they don't really have the full vision and then you can focus their eyes, it's like,
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:43.580]  whoa, this is crazy.
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:47.500]  So that's why we have to stay on air and that's why we have to continue to put this information
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:50.820]  out there on blast because that's the only way people are going to wake up and catch
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:52.300]  up to this.
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:55.300]  Let's go to Wayne in Texas.
[02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:56.980]  Wayne, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:26:57.980]  Go ahead.
[02:26:57.980 --> 02:27:04.860]  Hello, and I wanted to say that the big problem that we have in society and why we're accepting
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:14.340]  these people is because we either fear the persons of these degenerates or we respect
[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:15.340]  their persons.
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:23.860]  And the thing is, this is a reactionary behavioral issue with them where nobody honored and respected
[02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:27.420]  their own image, their own word, their own person.
[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:32.500]  And so what they did is they asked the devil in and he possesses them and he says, my body,
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:33.500]  my choice.
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:37.900]  And he starts telling them to put on a different clown suit to see how it's going to work
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:42.420]  and they can get what they want out of people to basically fall down and build an effigy
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:46.220]  and worship them every day of the week if that's what it takes.
[02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:51.620]  And it's not until people quit honoring and respecting their persons or letting them be
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:54.860]  their fear and their dread that we're going to be able to move on from this.
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:59.340]  And I'd like to read a quote if I may real quick.
[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:03.220]  The quote's from the seam Nicholas to lead and it's the author of the Black Swan and
[02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:08.460]  he says in it, he says, it is my great hope someday to see science and decision makers
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:15.140]  rediscover what the ancients have always known, namely that our highest currency is respect.
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:19.100]  That's not the respecting honoring of our own persons, you know, or desiring that as
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:21.540]  we grow our own kingdoms at God's expense.
[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:27.340]  It's literally the fear in the dread of God's word, himself alone.
[02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:32.660]  And people, it's time to stand up because they're going to keep fragmenting society
[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:38.940]  into whatever alter ego or imaginary friend they want to spin up and whatever fairy tale
[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:41.100]  that they can use to piggyback also.
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:42.980]  Well, see, but that's what it is right there.
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:45.980]  They are lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:50.620]  They don't live in reality and they want to drag us all into their world that doesn't
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:53.140]  exist where men or women and can get pregnant.
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:55.700]  And we say no, we live in reality.
[02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:58.940]  They want to destroy it.
[02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:04.740]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infoorstore.com
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:08.500]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system

[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:48.740]  going to sign any more after that are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:51.740]  In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books we didn't have them
[02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:58.060]  for sale but now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[02:30:58.060 --> 02:31:00.140]  I've got some good news.
[02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:07.100]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:08.100]  That's the good news.
[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:09.100]  They're amazing.
[02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:14.060]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go
[02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:17.180]  to infowarstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:20.700]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:25.620]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:31.100]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com
[02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:33.020]  and got some of these amazing products.
[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:38.020]  I would recommend 20095 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest
[02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:40.980]  effects so you reorder and see how great it is.

[02:31:58.020 --> 02:31:59.020]  Tomorrow's news.

[02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:07.900]  So yeah you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:09.700]  He doesn't care.
[02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:10.900]  That's not his job.
[02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:12.660]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:32:12.660 --> 02:32:16.980]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:20.980]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:21.980]  They must be opposed.
[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:22.980]  And that's who we are.
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:26.420]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:27.420]  No.
[02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:28.420]  No.
[02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:29.420]  No.
[02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.420]  Exactly.
[02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:32.380]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:33.380]  We will not take my vaccine.
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:36.480]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:38.980]  We say no to you taking our firearms.

[02:32:47.660 --> 02:32:48.660]  You're right.
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:59.940]  We stand against autocrats like you Joe Biden and we say no and we say no to your war.
[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:07.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.

[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:20.540]  as a baby it's like a whole it's a whole kink thing that they do is they dress up like toddlers
[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:24.740]  and I okay they wear diapers and everything it's but at least those are adults I mean
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:32.780]  as depraved as that might be unbelievable all right that's all I had to say because I found
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:40.220]  that really really ridiculous and and those people like man man if I it takes a lot to

[02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:53.660]  for doing this but well it's kind of like there's a natural instinct that you have and
[02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:58.580]  men have where and sometimes you know you can control it sometimes you can't but you
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:02.220]  know if you're out and about and you see a woman getting abused or something or a woman
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:06.660]  getting beaten up you want to step in and do something about that cuz that's the right
[02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:13.580]  thing well the same thing goes for what you're seeing with these kids unbelievable man all

[02:41:54.660 --> 02:42:03.820]  they get older yes you believe it will absolutely because if you look at it if you look at it

[02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:13.340]  thing like oh it's a good thing and then you got the phenomenon of only fans and yeah absolutely

[02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:10.340]  the possession of the army there is a bulletin from CVS news resident Kennedy has been shot
[02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:17.860]  this is a different kind of war the USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:23.060]  torpedoes the CIA could manipulate the news in the United States they took the babies
[02:44:23.060 --> 02:44:30.060]  and left the children to die on a cold spot it was almost as if it were a plan in full
[02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:36.860]  you need to go into the capital you will always have conspiracy theories they are nothing
[02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:43.100]  but distract you guys censored Harvard educated doctors you silence those voices what we want
[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:49.740]  to do in Davos is push to reset but as soon as we start exposing the great reset the
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:45:02.820]  world will start going to prison it's hard to believe that we're already going into March
[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:09.380]  2023 and the world is an insane place World War three has already started Biden is a puppet

[02:47:09.780 --> 02:47:16.660]  Wondering if you can provide a public comment as far as your stance on some issues are concerned
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:23.820]  with children being subjected to pornography or subjected towards adult entertainment
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:29.060]  and I was just trying to get a clear statement from CPS as far as a story I'm following.
[02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:34.160]  I can't get a statement about that sir.
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.940]  So if I have a kid that's being subjected to pornographic material is that something
[02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:39.940]  that I would report?
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:49.340]  Yes this is a line that you report if you're subjected to abuse of parents or children.
[02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:58.440]  And if I was aware of adults showing children adult entertainment like at a strip club is
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:01.100]  that something I would report here as well?
[02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:05.060]  All concerns this is where you report it sir yes.
[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:10.300]  Okay well I actually do have some reports then and this is why I'm trying to get a clear
[02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:17.180]  statement from CPS because I'm wondering why I've got multiple reports from multiple schools
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:22.580]  here in Texas where children are being subjected to pornographic material in the classroom
[02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:30.060]  books teaching them how to engage in oral sex and anal sex and then you have adult performers
[02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:32.700]  coming to areas as well.
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:39.020]  It's happened at libraries and other venues where it's adults doing adult entertainment
[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:45.780]  strip teases, stripper pole dances for children sitting right there watching this.
[02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:48.620]  Has this been brought to your attention?
[02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:54.020]  Okay sir so just what I'm understanding so this is the line that you report abuse and
[02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:57.980]  neglect are we making a report today on a specific family?
[02:48:57.980 --> 02:49:02.540]  No not a specific one just generally speaking I don't know the names of these individuals
[02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:08.020]  of the families or the children but I see it happening all the time.
[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:15.980]  Okay so we're not calling about I don't so what I do here if I don't I don't assess
[02:49:15.980 --> 02:49:21.460]  for multiple situations I assess for one situation at a time and are we not reporting
[02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:26.580]  a specific family or a specific incident I can't give a general statement on any of
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:29.380]  the issues that you're asking me about.
[02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:35.140]  But generally okay okay I understand but generally speaking if a child is being subjected to
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:40.540]  pornography that's something CPS would take action on?
[02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:45.020]  Here we assess every situation by what the information we're given by the reporters
[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:49.460]  and we assess the situation and see if they need to be recommended for referral.
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:55.220]  So like if an adult gave a book to a child a minor that taught them how to have anal
[02:49:55.220 --> 02:50:00.620]  sex or oral sex would that count?
[02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:06.540]  I piece information by what I'm given sir I don't have a specific answer.
[02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:11.420]  I mean that's the information though if I show you an adult telling a kid how to have
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:20.220]  anal sex or oral sex is that an actionable offense?
[02:50:20.220 --> 02:50:25.060]  Sir I don't give exact scenarios I need you to tell me what's going on I don't I'm not
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:29.860]  giving like a general statement so I'm not really sure what you're trying to do here
[02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:38.740]  but are we not calling about a specific incident a specific family person of interest I don't
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:41.540]  give a reporter statement that's not what I'm asking.
[02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:47.020]  Well I'm asking you if I know of an individual who is subjecting a child to pornographic
[02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:51.180]  material is that something you guys want to hear about is that an actionable offense?
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:58.100]  You can tell me about it yes so do we have a name on these people who have their information
[02:50:58.100 --> 02:50:59.780]  are you able to tell me?
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:05.700]  I don't have any specific names I could potentially get that information I'm just trying to find
[02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:13.060]  out what CPS what would CPS consider an actionable offense so I'm not wasting time bringing you
[02:51:13.060 --> 02:51:18.780]  any of this information so like for example if there's an adult that gives a child a book
[02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:23.940]  that teaches them about anal or oral sex is that an offense that I would report to you
[02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:25.580]  that would be considered actionable?
[02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:29.620]  We'd like to hear all concerns yes.
[02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:38.180]  Okay so same thing if I know of a venue that does a striptease show adult entertainment
[02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:43.100]  and children are brought to that show is that something that I would report to you being
[02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:46.660]  considered an actionable offense?
[02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:51.500]  We assess all situations sir any concerns that you have will assess the situation and
[02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:55.540]  you will let you know how it will proceed before we end the phone call.
[02:51:55.540 --> 02:52:01.700]  So I understand you can't get into generalities as far as you know you're looking for more
[02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:08.300]  individual information is there a number I can call to get a better understanding of
[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:15.620]  what CPS's stances are just as a general public stance towards these incidents not asking
[02:52:15.620 --> 02:52:20.820]  me for specific names or anything but just a general stance for the public to understand?
[02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:27.340]  This would be the only number you would be able to call to speak to someone so it wouldn't
[02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:31.820]  be able to speak to someone a direct investigator so that wouldn't be possible.
[02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:38.300]  You can try to go to a local office and we're more than welcome to visit our website.
[02:52:38.300 --> 02:52:40.700]  Okay so this is the only number to call then?
[02:52:40.700 --> 02:52:46.420]  Yes this is the number that you call and we assess every situation if you're going to
[02:52:46.420 --> 02:52:52.060]  recommend it for investigations for child protection services or adult protection services.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:59.540]  So that's why I'm just trying to get an understanding here of what you guys would consider an actionable
[02:52:59.540 --> 02:53:04.500]  offense or what I need to know do I need to report this to CPS?
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:07.300]  Is this something you guys would consider taking action on?
[02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:12.020]  So that's why I'm looking for a general stance and I don't have any specifics now I'm trying
[02:53:12.020 --> 02:53:16.260]  to figure out if I do want to get into specifics is this an actual offense?
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.180]  So that's why I'm looking for kind of a general approach and I think you've basically answered
[02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:27.340]  the question but so if an adult is presenting materials to children teaching them how to
[02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:33.540]  engage in anal or oral sex minors that is something if I reported to you you'd consider
[02:53:33.540 --> 02:53:35.540]  an actionable offense.
[02:53:35.540 --> 02:53:43.660]  We hear all situations and if a situation is made within our jurisdiction we will send
[02:53:43.660 --> 02:53:46.820]  it to the appropriate department.
[02:53:46.820 --> 02:53:51.540]  So the same thing like for example if somebody took a child if you if you found out that there
[02:53:51.540 --> 02:53:56.900]  were minors at an adult entertainment facility like a strip club would you consider that
[02:53:56.900 --> 02:54:00.140]  an actionable offense?
[02:54:00.140 --> 02:54:08.660]  Sir again every situation is assessed by the information that we're provided and we will
[02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:13.700]  recommend a referral to whichever department we see fit at the time of information that
[02:54:13.700 --> 02:54:14.700]  were provided.
[02:54:14.700 --> 02:54:19.820]  Okay well I'll go ahead and provide you some information and maybe you've heard about this
[02:54:19.820 --> 02:54:27.100]  maybe you haven't but there's a phenomenon that is being considered inaccurately drag
[02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:32.380]  queen story time for kids and I happen to have evidence that they're presenting materials
[02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:39.780]  to children minors that teach them how to have anal and oral sex and they also do adult
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:45.900]  entertainment for them using things like stripper poles and ropes.
[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:48.620]  Okay sir I'll catch you up right there so let me tell you how the interview is going
[02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:49.620]  to go.
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:51.340]  Let me tell you how our interview issues will go.
[02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:57.060]  When people call to this line I get all of their information, their name, address, phone
[02:54:57.060 --> 02:55:02.100]  number, they tell me if they're calling by a child or an adult then I ask them as much
[02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:07.380]  information as they can provide of everyone involved in the situation unless they give
[02:55:07.380 --> 02:55:11.820]  me everyone involved in the situation and then they tell me what's going on.
[02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:16.660]  After they tell me what's going on I assist the situation, I speak to a supervisor regarding
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:20.700]  it, I come back on the line and I'll let you know if they're going to recommend it for
[02:55:20.700 --> 02:55:27.540]  referral for adult protective services, child protective services or if this is a law enforcement
[02:55:27.540 --> 02:55:29.540]  issue we'll recommend it to law enforcement.
[02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:31.340]  This is how the interview goes.
[02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:38.460]  So you're speaking in general, I really can't answer a general statement of what you're
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:44.860]  asking if we're not talking about a specific family, specific children, specific adults,
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:51.660]  I can't take this in general of an issue that's going on if that makes sense.
[02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:52.660]  Sure, sure.
[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:55.180]  Has this ever been brought to your attention though?
[02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:58.980]  Have you ever heard of this before?
[02:55:58.980 --> 02:56:04.420]  I take calls here, sir, and whatever the caller reports to me is what I assist.
[02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:07.660]  I assist what I'm given at the time.
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:12.820]  So if I called you with a venue that was engaged in this activity that's something that you
[02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:14.820]  could follow up on.
[02:56:14.820 --> 02:56:22.340]  If we assess the situation and if it meets within our jurisdiction.
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:26.580]  But generally speaking if you hear about parents subjecting or adults subjecting children
[02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:32.580]  to pornographic material or adult entertainment, you would consider that an actionable offense.
[02:56:32.580 --> 02:56:41.700]  With the information provided, sir, I would see what department we would recommend.
[02:56:41.700 --> 02:56:47.940]  Okay, but have you ever, do you know if anybody's ever heard of this before a drag queen time
[02:56:47.940 --> 02:56:53.580]  for kids or you know sexual dances for kids and pornographic material being presented
[02:56:53.580 --> 02:56:54.580]  to kids?
[02:56:54.580 --> 02:56:55.580]  Do you know if this has ever been reported?
[02:56:55.580 --> 02:56:59.540]  Have you heard about this before?
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:02.620]  I don't have a comment on that, sir.
[02:57:02.620 --> 02:57:03.620]  No comment.
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:04.620]  Okay.
[02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:11.300]  But, but you, but it is fair to say sharing adult material, sexual material and adult
[02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:18.700]  entertainment with children, CPS generally speaking would consider interest in that.
[02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:27.380]  Again, sir, we assess every situation by whatever the rep is providing us.
[02:57:27.380 --> 02:57:28.380]  Okay.
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:30.140]  So you will assess every situation.
[02:57:30.140 --> 02:57:35.180]  So if I bring evidence of this to CPS, you will assess it.
[02:57:35.180 --> 02:57:38.340]  We assess every call.
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:39.340]  Okay.
[02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.340]  All right.
[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:41.740]  I will follow up with that.
[02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:42.740]  Thank you very much.
[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:43.740]  Thank you.
[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:52.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the World of the World is a historic
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:56.780]  book that documents the globalists and their own words planned for our future that is a
[02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:57.780]  hellish future.
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:01.580]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:05.460]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the World of the World at bookstores,
[02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:07.500]  Amazon or info or short.com.
[02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:11.620]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:15.620]  we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:20.100]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at info or
[02:58:20.100 --> 02:58:21.100]  short.com.
[02:58:21.100 --> 02:58:24.940]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:58:24.940 --> 02:58:28.540]  So you won't just have this historic momento and this powerful book, you'll also know
[02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:30.540]  that you help keep info words on the air.
[02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:34.060]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:35.060]  copies.
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:39.620]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info or short.com and get a signed
[02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:44.100]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[02:58:44.100 --> 02:58:45.100]  local school.
[02:58:45.100 --> 02:58:47.940]  This is an info war I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:50.020]  I've got some good news.
[02:58:50.020 --> 02:58:56.980]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:58:56.980 --> 02:58:57.980]  That's the good news.
[02:58:57.980 --> 02:58:58.980]  They're amazing.
[02:58:58.980 --> 02:59:03.940]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go
[02:59:03.940 --> 02:59:07.060]  to info or short.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:10.580]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[02:59:10.580 --> 02:59:15.500]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:20.980]  Think of what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com
[02:59:20.980 --> 02:59:22.900]  and got some of these amazing products.
[02:59:22.900 --> 02:59:27.540]  I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the
[02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:30.860]  biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is.
[02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:35.780]  Also we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good if you're
[02:59:35.780 --> 02:59:41.220]  in a logical system, your brain, your joints, your bones as well or real Red Bull Plus.
[02:59:41.220 --> 02:59:47.220]  Just go try the product, fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler together infowarstore.com.
[02:59:47.220 --> 02:59:56.220]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:56.220 --> 03:00:08.220]  All right ladies and gentlemen so it just happened, you just saw it in the last segment.
[03:00:08.220 --> 03:00:12.220]  I called Texas CPS and I was just looking for a general statement.
[03:00:12.220 --> 03:00:19.860]  She didn't want to commit and I think she probably got an idea about where it was going
[03:00:19.860 --> 03:00:25.260]  and didn't want to make a commitment on record and my guess is they've probably received
[03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:30.860]  some calls maybe not many but some calls enough that they have an internal policy that if
[03:00:30.860 --> 03:00:35.140]  somebody calls and complains about a drag queen story time or pornographic material
[03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:40.340]  at a public school library that they kind of have a scripted response and they don't
[03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:42.900]  want to commit to anything for obvious reasons.
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:46.020]  You got to protect the liberal agenda, you got to protect the democrat agenda.
[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:52.300]  It's more important than protecting kids obviously at this point but I mean I think it's fair
[03:00:52.300 --> 03:01:02.900]  to say even through the wish washy non-committal conjecture there that yes if an adult is sharing
[03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:08.700]  pornographic material teaching minors how to have anal or oral sex that is an offense
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:15.780]  that CPS would consider actionable and if there is an adult entertainment situation
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:21.780]  this is why you want to go to the strip club you got to show an ID to get in.
[03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:27.740]  I mean hell even just at a bar you got to show your ID to get in.
[03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:33.260]  So yeah you're taking a minor out to the bar you're taking a minor out to the strip club
[03:01:33.260 --> 03:01:40.740]  that's an offense so even though she didn't want to be committal she was wavering right
[03:01:40.740 --> 03:01:46.780]  because you're with CPS I asked you if you'd consider it an actionable offense if an adult
[03:01:46.780 --> 03:01:53.180]  was sharing pornography with a kid how do you not say of course we would do that unless
[03:01:53.180 --> 03:01:57.700]  you know the situation you have enough awareness of the situation that there's a political
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:05.740]  movement that's somehow protected by the rainbow flag shield that showing pornographic material
[03:02:05.740 --> 03:02:14.100]  and sexual activity to children is acceptable under the guise of LGBTQ activism but she
[03:02:14.100 --> 03:02:21.540]  said on the phone you heard her if you can provide a specific incident that then they
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:31.700]  could follow up so I guess the next stress test would be either sharing information about
[03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:38.700]  one of these drag queen dance time for kids events that happened in Texas and send them
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:47.260]  video of this and see what they do that would be the next step and I mean if you really
[03:02:47.260 --> 03:02:52.460]  wanted to go personal and this would be you'd need to handle this right but you could go
[03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:58.620]  to one of these events find the parents that take their children to these inappropriate
[03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:07.500]  events and say and just ask them do you think it's appropriate to show minors pornographic
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:15.020]  material do you think it's appropriate to take a minor to an adult entertainment venue
[03:03:15.020 --> 03:03:22.260]  and get their response to that and then say well do you do you think that's what you've
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:27.780]  done here today do you think CPS should be a made aware that that's exactly what you've
[03:03:27.780 --> 03:03:34.660]  done today so again this is just follow up a caller was like has anybody called CPS has
[03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:38.300]  anybody investigated and I said you know what let's do a stress test live on air and let's
[03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:45.860]  call CPS and see and so I would say the stress test revealed that to me they're at least
[03:03:45.860 --> 03:03:52.580]  generally aware of these events going on they've probably been called on it before and that's
[03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:57.620]  why she was noncommittal in some of the responses seeing where it was going and I think she even
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:05.460]  said that on the fall she's like I see where this is going so CPS most likely at this point
[03:04:05.460 --> 03:04:11.900]  my guess is is not interested in investigating this stuff and is not interested in following
[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:20.220]  up on men dressing up as women and dancing for children in a thong I mean I mean where
[03:04:20.220 --> 03:04:27.980]  is law enforcement I mean forget CPS how is this man in a thong doing sexual dancing
[03:04:27.980 --> 03:04:35.580]  for children not getting arrested but there's your first stress test of child protective
[03:04:35.580 --> 03:04:40.940]  services and we can all follow up with this folks we can go to that website they shared
[03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:45.820]  on the phone you can send the videos you can say the venues and see if CPS is interested
[03:04:45.820 --> 03:04:50.620]  my guess is probably no because they're controlled by the government which is controlled by the
[03:04:50.620 --> 03:04:55.980]  LGBTQ plus mafia but let's stress test it you just had stress test number one what did
[03:04:55.980 --> 03:05:01.420]  you think about that there is a war for the future happening right now there is a war
[03:05:01.420 --> 03:05:06.820]  that will control my destiny your destiny our children's destiny and that war is something
[03:05:06.820 --> 03:05:11.820]  that we can win but it takes dedication it takes commitment that's why I ask listeners

[03:06:18.940 --> 03:06:28.940]  from the summit.me studios in the united kingdom you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:28.940 --> 03:06:35.700]  Live in Summit News Hour March the 2nd 2023 and well more information is coming to light
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:43.420]  here in the UK over the decisions the authoritarian crackdown that was initiated with the first
[03:06:43.420 --> 03:06:50.140]  lockdown back in March 2020 with the release of these what they're calling the lockdown
[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:56.540]  files by the London Telegraph now much of it is a limited hangout but some more information
[03:06:56.540 --> 03:07:02.620]  has come out about the zealous overbearing totalitarianism that was swirling through
[03:07:02.620 --> 03:07:08.620]  the halls of government during that time during the first lockdown one of which was this which
[03:07:08.620 --> 03:07:15.660]  I wrote about this morning actually UK considered mandating killing of all pet cats to stop
[03:07:15.660 --> 03:07:24.420]  Covid not the poor pussycat surely can you imagine if in America the government had
[03:07:24.420 --> 03:07:29.180]  come out at the start of the first Covid outbreak and said we're going to make Americans kill
[03:07:29.180 --> 03:07:37.300]  all their pet dogs what what you'd have civil war maybe you'd have civil war in the UK because
[03:07:37.300 --> 03:07:42.740]  people a lot of people in the UK care more about cats than they do dogs but UK health
[03:07:42.740 --> 03:07:47.340]  authorities considered ordering the euthanization of all pet cats in the country during the
[03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:54.060]  first Covid outbreak this was revealed by ex-deputy health minister Lord James Bethel
[03:07:54.060 --> 03:07:57.620]  who made the admission while trying to argue that governments were caught unaware in how
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:08:01.740]  to respond to the virus of course we know that's a lie because the WHO had its plans
[03:08:01.740 --> 03:08:07.820]  well in place before that they saw how China had responded we had professor pants down
[03:08:07.820 --> 03:08:15.300]  professor lockdown Neil Ferguson admit before the first lockdown that they learned from
[03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:19.780]  the authoritarian brutalism that was going on in China they thought they couldn't get
[03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:25.420]  away with it in Europe but then Italy did it in his own words and then we did it so
[03:08:25.420 --> 03:08:29.660]  they knew what they were going to do exactly they were going to go hard and they were going
[03:08:29.660 --> 03:08:35.260]  to go fast you went on to say there was a moment when we were very unclear about whether
[03:08:35.260 --> 03:08:40.380]  domestic pets could transmit the disease of course now we know with the rest of these
[03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:45.300]  revelations much of the advice was on the fly some of it was ignored some of it was
[03:08:45.300 --> 03:08:52.140]  taken for political reasons basically what happened is a Siamese cat became the first
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:57.940]  in Britain to contract Covid-19 they thought that it would jump from the cat to humans
[03:08:57.940 --> 03:09:05.500]  for some reason and so they were considering exterminating all pet cats in Britain remember
[03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:10.900]  the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak which many sources suggest came from the port and down
[03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:18.100]  by a weapons facility led to the mandatory slaughter millions and millions of cattle
[03:09:18.100 --> 03:09:24.020]  farmers up and down the country were completely put out of business burning pyres of cattle
[03:09:24.020 --> 03:09:29.700]  for weeks on end an absolutely harrowing memory for the farming community and they were considering
[03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:36.340]  doing a similar thing with pet cats cat owners were told not to kiss their pets and to observe
[03:09:36.340 --> 03:09:40.100]  basically social distancing with their pets they wouldn't let them out the house they
[03:09:40.100 --> 03:09:44.140]  were told not to let them out the house if someone in the family had caught Covid again
[03:09:44.140 --> 03:09:49.860]  despite the fact there was no evidence Covid could jump from cats to humans they just considered
[03:09:49.860 --> 03:09:57.380]  doing it anyway as I point out in the article they even considered abducting kids from their
[03:09:57.380 --> 03:10:04.140]  parents and putting them in quarantine camps again against their will possibly if they
[03:10:04.140 --> 03:10:08.500]  were infected with the virus they wanted to kidnap people's children and put them in
[03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:16.020]  literal camps as part of this authoritarian brutal lockdown and we kind of laugh about
[03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:21.820]  it now and say oh those were crazy you have to remind yourself how crazy they were in
[03:10:21.820 --> 03:10:28.180]  fact I saw an article earlier today where the police this was the same police Derbyshire
[03:10:28.180 --> 03:10:35.260]  police that had released a video where they surveilled people with drones taking their
[03:10:35.260 --> 03:10:41.060]  dogs for a walk in remote rural countryside locations far away from anyone even if you
[03:10:41.060 --> 03:10:46.500]  believed all the propaganda about social distancing publicly shaming people on the internet for
[03:10:46.500 --> 03:10:52.860]  taking their pets for a walk in their remote countryside they even went to a beauty spot
[03:10:52.860 --> 03:10:57.180]  known as the blue lagoon in the police in the peak district which is a rural area as
[03:10:57.180 --> 03:11:06.140]  I said popular with hikers bikers they injected this lagoon with black dye the police did
[03:11:06.140 --> 03:11:13.620]  to prevent sightseers walkers going and visiting this blue lagoon again you were you were allowed
[03:11:13.620 --> 03:11:18.940]  even under our own rules you're allowed outside your house for exercise they literally potentially
[03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:24.500]  poisoned lagoons to try and prevent people going outside now we learn that they were
[03:11:24.500 --> 03:11:29.740]  considering making people kill all their cats because we've got this avian flu outbreak
[03:11:29.740 --> 03:11:36.340]  going on in the background they're saying they're making all the preparations for it
[03:11:36.340 --> 03:11:41.660]  to jump to be transmissible from animals to humans and then humans to humans of course
[03:11:41.660 --> 03:11:46.180]  so if you think this is all gone away while it may have gone away for covid they've got
[03:11:46.180 --> 03:11:51.740]  this bird flu pandemic hovering in the background just waiting to reinforce these powers once
[03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:58.420]  again daily skeptic reports get heavy with police to enforce lockdown Matt Hancock told
[03:11:58.420 --> 03:12:05.140]  ministers this was the UK's health secretary during the covid outbreak countries most senior
[03:12:05.140 --> 03:12:09.300]  civil servant discussed how they needed to get heavy with the police to crack down on
[03:12:09.300 --> 03:12:15.660]  the public during the covid pandemic and you saw what happened people going for a walk
[03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:21.540]  and buying a coffee being hit with fines I had friends they got knocks on their doors
[03:12:21.540 --> 03:12:26.580]  because they thought they were having a party in their flat in London bear in mind that
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:31.140]  we've had record rising crime now for the past three years it's just hit a new record
[03:12:31.140 --> 03:12:38.260]  in the UK the police since 2015 have been telling the British public they don't have
[03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:43.180]  the resources to respond to burglaries there are plenty of resources during those early
[03:12:43.180 --> 03:12:49.100]  days of the lockdown to literally case out people's apartments if they heard music if
[03:12:49.100 --> 03:12:54.580]  they heard voices to go and knock on their door and try and issue them with fines basically
[03:12:54.580 --> 03:13:00.660]  the vast majority of these fines got overturned in court basically all of them I think because
[03:13:00.660 --> 03:13:08.140]  again they were completely unlawful here's another one telegraph reports can we lock
[03:13:08.140 --> 03:13:13.220]  up pub hooligan Nigel Farage asked Hancock's team again this is the health minister at
[03:13:13.220 --> 03:13:20.420]  the time they wanted to arrest Nigel Farage because he tweeted a picture of himself enjoying
[03:13:20.420 --> 03:13:31.020]  a pint of bitter in a pub 14 days or 13 days after he'd returned from America the authoritarian
[03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:36.820]  rules at the time where you had to stay in your home for two weeks if you came back from
[03:13:36.820 --> 03:13:43.540]  travelling anywhere abroad Matt Hancock's team asked if they could lock up Nigel Farage
[03:13:43.540 --> 03:13:48.340]  after he tweeted a video of himself at a pub in Kent what's that messages have revealed
[03:13:48.340 --> 03:13:56.700]  so again making an example out of someone as a weaponized tool of intimidation to browbeat
[03:13:56.700 --> 03:14:01.820]  the rest of the public into unquestioning compliance we know from all the documents
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:09.380]  that have come out this was deliberate totalitarianism they used behavioral psychology to deliberately
[03:14:09.380 --> 03:14:17.180]  exaggerate the threat beyond all reason to force people into complying with these totalitarian
[03:14:17.180 --> 03:14:22.300]  mandates July for the leader of the brexit party shared a video of himself drinking his
[03:14:22.300 --> 03:14:28.500]  first proper pint in 103 days the Queen's head pub in down village Ken fortnight earlier
[03:14:28.500 --> 03:14:35.620]  forage was filmed attending Donald Trump's rally in Tussler Oklahoma so again because
[03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:40.980]  he was within that 14 day period the one of the main priorities of our health secretary
[03:14:40.980 --> 03:14:45.740]  at the time with this big outbreak was to think about arresting Nigel Farage and making
[03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:50.780]  an example out of it meanwhile the people also coming back from holiday and being forced
[03:14:50.780 --> 03:14:58.580]  to be locked up basically in what were prisons they called them quarantine hotels those people
[03:14:58.580 --> 03:15:03.020]  were being laughed at by our government top Mandarin mocked holiday makers locked up in
[03:15:03.020 --> 03:15:08.380]  covid quarantine hotel rooms I was unlucky enough to be caught up in Britain's pandemic
[03:15:08.380 --> 03:15:12.260]  era hotel quarantine policy like in it to being held prisoner and exactly that's what
[03:15:12.260 --> 03:15:17.300]  it was messages seen by the telegraph show ministers and officials shared the sentiment
[03:15:17.300 --> 03:15:23.420]  and joked about passengers being locked up in shoebox rooms they all thought it was really
[03:15:23.420 --> 03:15:29.580]  funny meanwhile again Matt Hancock stage rear guard action to close schools after education
[03:15:29.580 --> 03:15:34.380]  secretary one argument to keep them open they wanted some of the people within government
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:39.780]  to reopen the schools in June before the summer holiday summer recess health secretary said
[03:15:39.780 --> 03:15:43.780]  now of course we know the massive damage that's caused to education which will last for a
[03:15:43.780 --> 03:15:49.780]  generation again the face masks in schools they got that wrong now they've been caught
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:54.300]  it's all coming out the rats are fleeing the sinking ship of the lockdown narrative will
[03:15:54.300 --> 03:16:19.500]  be back some of the news now go ahead and we look at Harrison Smith and the hard work

[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:30.940]  I'm gonna get more into the covid-19 fallout a bit later on with this lab leak development
[03:20:30.940 --> 03:20:35.820]  over the course of the last week but let's get into the latest migration news now because
[03:20:35.820 --> 03:20:41.100]  of course we had a poll last week showing that even a majority of people in the UK who
[03:20:41.100 --> 03:20:48.300]  support left wing parties whose leaders support keeping the borders open opening them even
[03:20:48.300 --> 03:20:53.660]  wider the supporters of those parties the majority of them are at least a plurality
[03:20:53.660 --> 03:21:00.060]  of them think immigration to the UK is too high we have the census results about a month
[03:21:00.060 --> 03:21:07.900]  ago which show again major cities across the UK are now minority white british including
[03:21:07.900 --> 03:21:13.340]  not just London but places like Birmingham and Manchester you see a similar phenomenon
[03:21:13.340 --> 03:21:22.980]  unfolding in Germany this is out of Breitbart via AP 23% of German population now migrants
[03:21:22.980 --> 03:21:30.460]  or children of migrants of course this is after they open their borders in 2015 2016
[03:21:30.460 --> 03:21:37.740]  to all the syrian afghan iranian asylum seekers and really they've never stopped coming in
[03:21:37.740 --> 03:21:43.620]  it's never been a trickle it's always been a deluge and they've got a similar problem
[03:21:43.620 --> 03:21:49.980]  to what we've got in the UK so some 18.9 million people 23% of Germany's population either
[03:21:49.980 --> 03:21:56.260]  immigrated to the country since 1950 or other children of immigrants you import people from
[03:21:56.260 --> 03:22:01.420]  all these different countries Germany is no longer Germany especially when these people
[03:22:01.420 --> 03:22:08.540]  which the majority of them do refuse to assimilate the first time the statistics officers analyse
[03:22:08.540 --> 03:22:13.460]  the country's population based on migration figures not just on citizenship is a more
[03:22:13.460 --> 03:22:17.340]  vague concept since many immigrants special children of immigrants have taken on German
[03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:22.420]  citizenship in recent years and that's exactly how they absorb them into the figures and
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:27.980]  therefore hide this demographic change that's been taking place across Europe now rapidly
[03:22:27.980 --> 03:22:32.340]  that don't accelerate a place at pace for the past 10 years there's when it comes to
[03:22:32.340 --> 03:22:36.820]  the 17.3% of a first generation immigrants Germany ranks above the European Union average
[03:22:36.820 --> 03:22:44.340]  of 10.6% in addition another 3.7 million or 4.5% the population had one parent who immigrated
[03:22:44.340 --> 03:22:50.300]  and one ethnic German parent and what impact is that having in major cities in Germany
[03:22:50.300 --> 03:22:56.380]  well we only need to look to Berlin to the answer to that question remix news reports
[03:22:56.380 --> 03:23:03.220]  shock and astonishment 110 nursing home seniors evicted by Christian organisation to make
[03:23:03.220 --> 03:23:09.060]  room for refugees in Berlin and again you have to make the point over and over again
[03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:15.260]  even according to the UN's massaged figures the vast majority of them are not refugees
[03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:20.420]  they're young men looking for free handouts looking for free healthcare looking for free
[03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:27.100]  accommodation again I don't even blame them for wanting to escape some of those countries
[03:23:27.100 --> 03:23:33.380]  but again you can't import Afghanistan you can't import Libya you can't import Iran
[03:23:33.380 --> 03:23:38.580]  and not have European countries increasingly become similar to those countries that they
[03:23:38.580 --> 03:23:45.140]  fled from in the first place as many elderly nursing home residents were left in tears
[03:23:45.140 --> 03:23:49.620]  as they were evicted to make room for migrants in Berlin imagine that some of these people
[03:23:49.620 --> 03:23:56.100]  have been there for years and years vulnerable elderly people they get used to this nursing
[03:23:56.100 --> 03:24:02.340]  home they get used to the staff the local environment suddenly they're told sorry 22
[03:24:02.340 --> 03:24:08.940]  year old Abdul from Afghanistan needs a place to stay get the hell out imagine that imagine
[03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:18.260]  paying into the German system 75 80 90 years old paying into the system being part of your
[03:24:18.260 --> 03:24:24.060]  country the decades and decades suddenly I told you basically worthless you're getting
[03:24:24.060 --> 03:24:30.660]  it kicked out of your nursing home accommodation because some 21 year old guy just arrived
[03:24:30.660 --> 03:24:37.220]  on a boat and claims to be a refugee as adding to the scandal is that the owners of the building
[03:24:37.220 --> 03:24:41.220]  and operators of the nursing home are Christian non-profit institutions that belong to the
[03:24:41.220 --> 03:24:46.820]  Berlin Diakoni and again the reason they're turfing them out is because the government
[03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:52.940]  gives them more kickbacks for housing quote refugees than it does for housing Germany's
[03:24:52.940 --> 03:24:57.460]  vulnerable elderly population the building located on Wall Street was meant to house
[03:24:57.460 --> 03:25:03.460]  elderly residents for at least another 10 years goes on to say the nursing home was
[03:25:03.460 --> 03:25:09.380]  run by the Paul Gerhard Foundation with an option to extend but that plan has been terminated
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:13.980]  early and instead the building is shifted to housing refugees we've seen this in numerous
[03:25:13.980 --> 03:25:19.420]  countries across Europe a similar thing as during the evictions tears flowed amount among
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:24.500]  those affected containers stood in front of the building for days the furniture was simply
[03:25:24.500 --> 03:25:28.740]  thrown away so not only are they being turfed out all their possessions are being turfed
[03:25:28.740 --> 03:25:35.500]  out as well presumably let's go to this first video now though because again similar situation
[03:25:35.500 --> 03:25:40.980]  occurring in the UK vast numbers of illegal boat migrants coming in the taxpayer is paying
[03:25:40.980 --> 03:25:48.220]  for the government to put them up in in some cases five star hotels in prime tourist areas
[03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:52.660]  people are booking these hotels a year in advance for their wedding they get a phone
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:58.380]  call to say sorry your wedding's cancelled we're allowing this group of Afghan migrants
[03:25:58.380 --> 03:26:03.420]  to move into the hotel meanwhile let's take a look at what's happening with the homeless
[03:26:03.420 --> 03:26:08.900]  population the native homeless population in the United Kingdom this video is called
[03:26:08.900 --> 03:26:13.780]  the forgotten people let's roll it the number of homeless people sleeping on the streets
[03:26:13.780 --> 03:26:18.700]  of Britain has soared by over a quarter in just a single year according to figures released
[03:26:18.700 --> 03:26:24.300]  by the government were 3069 people sleeping rough on the streets last year compared to
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:30.700]  2443 in 2021 representing a 25.6% increase in London the number of rough sleepers rose
[03:26:30.700 --> 03:26:36.980]  even more an increase of 34% on last year the stats show that despite rapidly accelerated
[03:26:36.980 --> 03:26:42.900]  levels of immigration the majority of homeless were British born 64% according to the Salvation
[03:26:42.900 --> 03:26:47.260]  Army the cost of living crisis has exacerbated the problem the chief executive of the charity
[03:26:47.260 --> 03:26:51.740]  homeless link Rick Henderson described the increase as a massive collective failure adding
[03:26:51.740 --> 03:26:56.060]  the cost of living crisis has exacerbated long-standing drivers of homelessness such
[03:26:56.060 --> 03:27:00.660]  as a shortage of affordable housing and often punitive welfare system and increasingly stretched
[03:27:00.660 --> 03:27:05.180]  health services you know who's not struggling with homelessness or a cost of living crisis
[03:27:05.180 --> 03:27:11.540]  of 40,000 illegal migrants being put up in hotels up and down the country at taxpayer
[03:27:11.540 --> 03:27:17.460]  expense yeah while our own people freeze on the streets our government is spending seven
[03:27:17.460 --> 03:27:23.100]  million pounds a day housing illegal migrants most of them working age men in four star
[03:27:23.100 --> 03:27:28.340]  sometimes five star accommodation there's no issue with stretched health care services
[03:27:28.340 --> 03:27:33.020]  for these illegal migrants many of whom get their own dedicated doctors on site maybe
[03:27:33.020 --> 03:27:37.940]  our own homeless population should just get a euro star to France hop on a dingy throw
[03:27:37.940 --> 03:27:42.300]  their passport in the English Channel start calling themselves Abdul and enjoy a free
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:46.860]  coach ride from the government to the nearest available hotel easier still just pretend
[03:27:46.860 --> 03:27:51.380]  you're Albanian and can't speak English and instead of shivering to the bone while sleeping
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:57.220]  on a cardboard box wrapped in bin bags you'll be safe and sound in a nice cozy king size
[03:27:57.220 --> 03:28:04.300]  bed awaiting your free cooked breakfast the next morning meanwhile in Sweden remember
[03:28:04.300 --> 03:28:09.220]  that whole controversy over Trump last night in Sweden while they continue to experience
[03:28:09.220 --> 03:28:15.700]  the same problems with violent crime rampant unrest as it is related to mass migration
[03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:20.380]  Sweden man arrested after 10 year old girl is stabbed in broad daylight in Gothenburg
[03:28:20.380 --> 03:28:26.620]  central square and Sweden increases money offered to migrants to voluntarily go home
[03:28:26.620 --> 03:28:30.500]  of course we've seen what's happening in Denmark where they're trying to basically raise
[03:28:30.500 --> 03:28:35.980]  and demolish some of these migrant ghetto areas well now the right wing Swedish government
[03:28:35.980 --> 03:28:40.220]  elected on a promise to curb immigration is enacting reforms to encourage migrants to
[03:28:40.220 --> 03:28:46.340]  return to their country of origin I would argue as far as Sweden goes given their again rapid
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:57.300]  intake of refugees and asylum seekers is probably too little too late we'll be back summit.news.gov

[03:32:55.060 --> 03:33:14.420]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:33:25.060 --> 03:33:34.580]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom
[03:33:34.580 --> 03:33:41.460]  it's paul joseph watson of course over the weekend we had the department of energy come
[03:33:41.460 --> 03:33:47.700]  out and basically admit that the conspiracy theorists who were publicly humiliated censored
[03:33:47.700 --> 03:33:54.500]  banned from 2020 to 2021 for saying that the coronavirus was likely a lab leak of course the
[03:33:54.500 --> 03:34:02.260]  accidental lab leak is the limited hangout argument the FBI director christopher ray came out shortly
[03:34:02.260 --> 03:34:08.180]  after in an interview with fox news' brett bear that quote the fbis for quite some time now assess
[03:34:08.180 --> 03:34:14.020]  that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in wuhan let's go to this
[03:34:14.020 --> 03:34:17.780]  video now because there's been more developments on this which i want to come back and talk about
[03:34:17.780 --> 03:34:28.420]  after but this video is called the conspiracy theorists were right let's roll it remember that
[03:34:28.420 --> 03:34:33.300]  crazy conspiracy theory about the lab origin of covid remember how anyone who talked about it was
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:39.700]  ridiculed demonized and cancelled he's also pushing us intelligence to find evidence for this theory
[03:34:39.700 --> 03:34:45.620]  that the virus was accidentally released from a lab in wuhan that's his new angle to feed the
[03:34:45.620 --> 03:34:51.140]  wing nuts to treat this virus like it was a conspiracy of some kind no right what kind of
[03:34:51.140 --> 03:34:55.700]  nutcase would even suggest that a lab in wuhan working on coronaviruses would have anything
[03:34:55.700 --> 03:35:00.500]  whatsoever to do with the emergence of a coronavirus that originated in wuhan it should
[03:35:00.500 --> 03:35:06.980]  have never happened this plague should never have happened it could have been stopped but people
[03:35:06.980 --> 03:35:14.020]  chose not to stop it what people tomorrow he'll blame the spanish flu on antonio bandaris thank god
[03:35:14.020 --> 03:35:19.060]  prominent alternative news sites that circulated this insane premise were banned by big tech thank
[03:35:19.060 --> 03:35:23.860]  god facebook for over a year after the outbreak of covid and all content suggesting the virus
[03:35:23.860 --> 03:35:28.980]  was manmade or came from a lab thank god brave mainstream media journalists identified and
[03:35:28.980 --> 03:35:34.340]  targeted shameless conspiracy theorists for pushing these lies thank god dr fouchy moved
[03:35:34.340 --> 03:35:39.300]  to silence any discussion of covid being caused by a lab lead after being told to do so by peter
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:44.100]  dajak the father of gamer function research whose organization has extensive ties to the wuhan lab
[03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:49.140]  thank god our esteemed medical establishment in coordination with silicon valley and big
[03:35:49.140 --> 03:35:56.020]  pharma funded corporate media giants cnn tonight brought to you by phyzer worked so hard and so
[03:35:56.020 --> 03:36:01.620]  diligently to suppress and extinguish the dangerous conspiracy theory that covid 19 came from a lab
[03:36:01.620 --> 03:36:09.540]  leak in china tonight nbc news learning the department of energy has concluded covid 19 likely came
[03:36:09.540 --> 03:36:16.740]  from a lab leak in china oh the u.s. department of energy has concluded that it most likely
[03:36:16.740 --> 03:36:21.220]  came from a lab leak and not from an infected animal the fbi and now the energy department
[03:36:21.220 --> 03:36:28.260]  had both found an accidental lab leak increasingly plausible right so not a crazy conspiracy theory
[03:36:28.260 --> 03:36:33.060]  then at what point does the claim that it had a natural origin become a conspiracy theory no matter
[03:36:33.060 --> 03:36:36.420]  what the energy department says not everyone in the government agrees to see while the department
[03:36:36.420 --> 03:36:41.940]  of energy suspects it was a lab leak for other agencies along with a national intelligence
[03:36:41.940 --> 03:36:46.660]  panel still judged that the pandemic was likely the result of a natural transmission anyway we'll
[03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:51.380]  have more on this story as soon as anyone has anything they can prove i mean if you're that
[03:36:51.380 --> 03:36:56.660]  wedded to a certain narrative sometimes it's really hard to let go this has been a long time
[03:36:56.660 --> 03:37:01.860]  coming i wish you could see the smiles on the faces of my audience and i wish i could too because
[03:37:01.860 --> 03:37:09.140]  they're still wearing masks funny how the u.s. media once called americans conspiracy theorists
[03:37:09.140 --> 03:37:13.540]  for saying it came from a lab now china is calling the u.s. government conspiracy theorists for
[03:37:13.540 --> 03:37:18.660]  saying it came from a lab maybe the real lesson here is staring us in the face stop claiming
[03:37:18.660 --> 03:37:24.180]  everything that deviates slightly from the official story is a baseless conspiracy theory stop
[03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:30.580]  silencing whistleblowers dissidents and investigators by branding them dangerous purveyors of disinformation
[03:37:30.580 --> 03:37:35.780]  stop banning people for engaging in legitimate discussion of contentious issues now forgive
[03:37:35.780 --> 03:37:41.300]  me for dabbling in another dangerous conspiracy theory but it's almost like all the hysteria
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:46.580]  over fake news disinformation and misinformation generated by the powers that be while there is
[03:37:46.580 --> 03:37:51.700]  no doubt some fake news that's outright fabricated isn't primarily designed to protect people from
[03:37:51.700 --> 03:37:57.060]  being misled but is actually designed to shut down discussion of awkward truths and facilitate the
[03:37:57.060 --> 03:38:03.060]  cover-up of genuine matters this all begs the question if this once crazy lab leak conspiracy
[03:38:03.060 --> 03:38:07.380]  theory which you weren't even allowed to talk about without being publicly shamed censored banned
[03:38:07.380 --> 03:38:12.660]  turned out to be likely true what else that was happening during this period that they maligned
[03:38:12.660 --> 03:38:18.900]  as a conspiracy theory was actually true gee i wonder i really do wonder what else is happening
[03:38:18.900 --> 03:38:22.580]  right now that we're not allowed to talk about later on down the line will prove to have been
[03:38:22.580 --> 03:38:28.660]  true all along even if the lab leak theory is finally accepted as complete fact was it really
[03:38:28.660 --> 03:38:34.740]  just an accidental leak whoops just initiated a global pandemic that shut down the world economy
[03:38:34.740 --> 03:38:39.700]  generated recurring mega massive profits for giant pharmaceutical companies brought to you by
[03:38:39.700 --> 03:38:44.660]  fiser normalized de facto medical martial law while justifying authoritarian population control
[03:38:44.660 --> 03:38:50.420]  measures not witness for generations sorry about that my bad appearing on tucker colson last night
[03:38:50.420 --> 03:38:56.180]  a chinese virologist dropped a bombshell i would say based on the evidence and the source i have
[03:38:56.180 --> 03:39:02.740]  ccp government intentionally to let it go all over the world to kill millions of people all over
[03:39:02.740 --> 03:39:08.100]  the world later no doubt that'll be dismissed as just another crazy conspiracy theory as for the
[03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:14.740]  future well uk health experts are now sharing details of their quote covid style plans against bird
[03:39:14.740 --> 03:39:20.260]  flu they're now preparing for the worst case scenario of avian flu becoming transmissible from
[03:39:20.260 --> 03:39:25.380]  humans to humans it's already jumped from birds to mammals now a dozen people in the same province
[03:39:25.380 --> 03:39:31.860]  in cambodia have been infected and an 11 year old girl has died thankfully if h5n1 feels like getting
[03:39:31.860 --> 03:39:38.100]  all pandemicy we're reassured that big former has all the vaccines ready and waiting brought to you by
[03:39:38.100 --> 03:39:44.740]  fiser and one of those covid style plans to stop it lockdowns mask mandates vax mandates well rest
[03:39:44.740 --> 03:39:50.500]  assured because professor lockdown the same guy who's spectacularly wrong modeling greased the skids
[03:39:50.500 --> 03:39:55.860]  for the uk's lockdown the guy who took lockdown so seriously he spent most of it zipping back and
[03:39:55.860 --> 03:40:00.580]  forth across london to shag his married mistress the guy who completely betrayed his own authoritarian
[03:40:00.580 --> 03:40:05.380]  zeal by saying quote china is a communist one party state we said we couldn't get away with
[03:40:05.380 --> 03:40:10.420]  lockdown in europe we thought then italy did it and we realized we could yeah him well at least
[03:40:10.420 --> 03:40:17.620]  he's not in charge of the covid style plans against bird flu right oh he is great how wonderful i
[03:40:17.620 --> 03:40:25.220]  really hope the conspiracy theorists stop being proven right update on this story now ran paul
[03:40:25.220 --> 03:40:31.220]  covid lably one of the greatest cover-ups in modern medical history this was his appearance on fox
[03:40:31.220 --> 03:40:36.260]  news noting that the u.s. government has quote destroyed trust in vaccines and everything
[03:40:36.260 --> 03:40:40.180]  else because they're really telling you stuff that's obviously not true and you shouldn't take it
[03:40:40.740 --> 03:40:44.340]  you went on to say when antony fact you made the decision to fund dangerous gain of function
[03:40:44.340 --> 03:40:50.340]  research in wuhan and again covered it up with peter dajak under the auspices of an authoritarian
[03:40:50.340 --> 03:40:54.420]  government this decision was one of the worst decisions ever made and there's been a cover-up
[03:40:54.420 --> 03:40:59.940]  ever since the beginning senator ted cruise also coming out cruise blast media for labeling
[03:40:59.940 --> 03:41:05.700]  covid lab leakers misinformation and conspiracy theory again on fox news he said the covid virus
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:09.620]  escaped from a chinese government lab and the millions of deaths are a result of that virus
[03:41:09.620 --> 03:41:15.540]  escaping from a chinese government lab state department funded censorship group punished
[03:41:15.540 --> 03:41:22.500]  conservative websites for circulating lab leak theory again underscoring the point all this hysteria
[03:41:22.500 --> 03:41:28.740]  over fake news misinformation disinformation generated by regime media outlets is used to
[03:41:28.740 --> 03:41:34.660]  censor genuine issues intimidate people out of talking about them in the first place
[03:41:34.660 --> 03:41:41.220]  and of course create this precedent that big tech networks can censor ban people on a whim
[03:41:41.220 --> 03:41:47.860]  get out ahead of this to facilitate what was in this instance a cover-up global disinformation
[03:41:47.860 --> 03:41:53.700]  index this weird british based nonprofit group received six hundred six sixty five thousand
[03:41:53.700 --> 03:41:58.660]  dollars from the global engagement national center for endowment again the state department group
[03:41:59.540 --> 03:42:05.940]  that was the group overseeing conspiracy theories about covid-19 that was the group
[03:42:05.940 --> 03:42:11.460]  burying those kind of stories on twitter on facebook claiming that they'd been proved
[03:42:11.460 --> 03:42:17.700]  well fact check and proven untrue they abused their influence to pressure big tech firms
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:23.940]  like google to cut advertising from conservative websites again to try and put those platforms
[03:42:23.940 --> 03:42:31.140]  that were talking about the authenticity of the lab leak in 2020 in 2021 out of business
[03:42:31.140 --> 03:42:36.260]  all together by severing their ad revenue streams of course they've done that on numerous other
[03:42:36.260 --> 03:42:42.340]  issues they did it on this even microsoft had to come out and basically sever its ties with this
[03:42:42.340 --> 03:42:48.580]  weird gdi group because again they were proven to weaponize this hysteria over fake news and

[03:47:04.260 --> 03:47:18.420]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit.news
[03:47:21.220 --> 03:47:26.980]  now we just had figures out of england and wales a couple of weeks ago showing that crime
[03:47:26.980 --> 03:47:33.940]  particularly violent crime is at a record high highest levels ever recorded which brings me
[03:47:33.940 --> 03:47:41.060]  to this new story out of bitebot and again this gets right to the core of how diversity hires is
[03:47:41.060 --> 03:47:46.740]  really crippling the police force and in fact impacting people's safety and genuinely putting
[03:47:46.740 --> 03:47:55.140]  people at risk. uk police claim five foot five neurodiverse don't know what that means mentally
[03:47:55.140 --> 03:48:05.620]  ill i assume female recruit 18 can take down a salons so this autistic neurodiverse five foot
[03:48:05.620 --> 03:48:11.700]  five 18 year old woman who i presume still identifies as a woman that's probably subject to change
[03:48:13.220 --> 03:48:19.780]  they're championing her as this uh crime fighting hero basically england's sx police
[03:48:19.780 --> 03:48:26.100]  force has spotlighted a five foot five female recruit aged 18 described as autistic and dyslexic
[03:48:26.820 --> 03:48:31.460]  assuring the public she can hold her own against a salons yes i'm sure when the
[03:48:32.500 --> 03:48:39.380]  violent criminal on a scooter who pulls up next to you in london and yanks your Rolex off your arm
[03:48:39.380 --> 03:48:45.780]  under threat of killing you with a 12 inch blade i'm sure that when he shows up you can rest assured
[03:48:45.780 --> 03:48:55.540]  that this five foot five autistic dyslexic neurodiverse female is really gonna take him down hard
[03:48:57.060 --> 03:49:01.540]  as people always have this idea of what a police officer should look like uh yeah you're dealing
[03:49:01.540 --> 03:49:08.260]  with violent criminals you should be pretty muscle-bound pretty big pretty healthy pc hooper is
[03:49:08.260 --> 03:49:15.380]  quoted as saying likely in reference to historic minimum height requirements for officers now abolished
[03:49:16.180 --> 03:49:22.020]  well i assure you maybe they'll have midgets taking on six foot five but violent criminals next who
[03:49:22.020 --> 03:49:30.340]  knows maybe they'll have you know transgender individuals with arms like pipe cleaners taking
[03:49:30.340 --> 03:49:35.380]  down terrorists in central london i don't know if it's for diversity and maybe it's a good thing
[03:49:35.380 --> 03:49:41.860]  she said i assure you even as a five foot five woman i can hold my own big doubt this is like in
[03:49:41.860 --> 03:49:47.540]  america when those fire departments started lowering the standards for entry so you're burning
[03:49:47.540 --> 03:49:52.660]  to death in a high-rise building and somebody who hasn't even completed the physical assault
[03:49:52.660 --> 03:49:59.540]  course is coming to save you good luck with that she says people always assume you have to be a six
[03:49:59.540 --> 03:50:03.940]  foot plus man to keep up with the training but i've never struggled yeah because they lower the
[03:50:03.940 --> 03:50:10.100]  standards of the training to make it easy for everyone to pass again this is following
[03:50:11.380 --> 03:50:17.140]  a few weeks ago we had the story of metropolitan police trying to get more
[03:50:17.140 --> 03:50:24.180]  fame black ethnic minority officers in their police force than white officers again because
[03:50:24.180 --> 03:50:30.180]  hashtag diversity despite the fact that many people from these communities don't want to join the
[03:50:30.180 --> 03:50:35.700]  police force they distrust the police they don't want to join it and many of them it said were
[03:50:35.700 --> 03:50:41.700]  criminals so they literally started hiring criminals for diversity now they're hiring five
[03:50:41.700 --> 03:50:48.260]  foot five women to take on violent criminals again because they lowered the standards of training
[03:50:48.260 --> 03:50:54.020]  so she can come out and say well i passed the training yeah because it's easy that's only
[03:50:54.020 --> 03:51:01.860]  going to embolden criminals more big shock that our crime rate is now an all-time record high in the
[03:51:01.860 --> 03:51:08.420]  u.s or in fact i think this is in canada girls basketball team withdraws from state tournament
[03:51:08.420 --> 03:51:15.380]  in protest against transgender player who dominates games this is the girls basketball team from the
[03:51:15.380 --> 03:51:21.060]  vermont division for state tournament withdrawn from it in protest against a transgender player
[03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:27.460]  who's routinely been dominating games well what a surprise a biological male with better physical
[03:51:27.460 --> 03:51:36.740]  attributes is absolutely crushing the competition and these again relatively spindly weak females
[03:51:36.740 --> 03:51:42.500]  in comparison aren't happy about it after finding out their opponents the long trail school mountain
[03:51:42.500 --> 03:51:48.100]  lions had a biological male on their team the mid vermont christian school eagles fortified forfeited
[03:51:48.100 --> 03:51:53.300]  their playoff game we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the
[03:51:53.300 --> 03:51:59.380]  fairness of the game and the safety of our players and then they cite write-ups of reviews of these
[03:51:59.380 --> 03:52:07.780]  basketball games where this individual is absolutely crushing it someone came out and spoke out against
[03:52:07.780 --> 03:52:13.700]  this he said bone mass lean mass cardiac output strength capacity work capacity potential all
[03:52:13.700 --> 03:52:20.660]  heavily advantage males now of course they're transphobic for complaining about it meanwhile
[03:52:20.660 --> 03:52:26.820]  transgender athlete wins four female running competitions in a row transgender athlete who
[03:52:26.820 --> 03:52:31.220]  now identifies as a woman has won four different female running competition so far this year alone
[03:52:31.220 --> 03:52:39.700]  after smashing a women's 5000 meter record last year this is tiffany newell and basically every
[03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:48.340]  single tournament he has entered since the start of january this year he's won at a canter well now
[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:52.900]  the international consortium on women's sport a group demanding the protection of female competitions
[03:52:52.900 --> 03:52:58.340]  another transphobic hate unit reacted to the news by asserting it was blatant example of sex
[03:52:58.340 --> 03:53:06.500]  discrimination and again i go for all the examples of this individual absolutely dominating running
[03:53:06.500 --> 03:53:12.500]  easily to victory in all the competitions that he's entered redux reports despite protests from
[03:53:12.500 --> 03:53:18.100]  trans activists studies have consistently affirmed that trans identify male athletes retain a
[03:53:18.100 --> 03:53:24.900]  significant edge over their female counterparts even after starting hormone therapy now on the
[03:53:24.900 --> 03:53:33.380]  subject of transgenderism and pushing the message her she's has launched a new transgender themed
[03:53:33.380 --> 03:53:41.860]  chocolate bar promoted by a biological male to celebrate international women's day this video

[03:55:04.340 --> 03:55:10.260]  ad campaign my name is fey johnstone you sure this will help us sell more chocolate chocolate now let
[03:55:10.260 --> 03:55:16.580]  me be absolutely clear once about five years ago i was in an airport in america and i made the mistake
[03:55:16.580 --> 03:55:23.300]  of buying a hershey bar it's hands down the most disgusting so-called chocolate bar i've ever tasted
[03:55:23.300 --> 03:55:28.820]  in my life doesn't even taste like chocolate about five years ago although her she denied reports
[03:55:28.820 --> 03:55:34.740]  began circulating that they were adding butric acid to their products as a cheap food preservative
[03:55:34.740 --> 03:55:42.180]  guess what also contains butric acid vomit literal vomit and according to many people including
[03:55:42.180 --> 03:55:48.100]  europeans who are lucky enough to have access to actual milk chocolate that isn't ruined by
[03:55:48.100 --> 03:55:54.580]  weird additives her she's tastes like you guessed it vomit so yeah instead of pandering to the
[03:55:54.580 --> 03:55:59.700]  alphabet mafia maybe her she should spend more time and money on making sure their product
[03:55:59.700 --> 03:56:05.780]  doesn't remind people of puking up in their own mouths get woke go broke i don't know maybe but
[03:56:05.780 --> 03:56:13.700]  when you target market continually increases year by year thanks to people being born that way and
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:19.220]  having nothing to do with insidious social engineering at all who's to say it won't pay off i mean at
[03:56:19.220 --> 03:56:26.500]  the very least for her she's it'll distract from the fact that it tastes like sick now again i
[03:56:26.500 --> 03:56:34.420]  referenced the gallup poll in that video again lgbt people constantly claim no they're born that way
[03:56:34.420 --> 03:56:39.620]  they're born gay they're born transgender it's an innate thing it has nothing whatsoever to do with
[03:56:39.620 --> 03:56:45.940]  indoctrination social engineering activist doctors in the case of transgender experiments and
[03:56:46.500 --> 03:56:57.540]  surgery well of course we find out that generation z 19.7 of them now identify as lgbt and the numbers
[03:56:57.540 --> 03:57:03.060]  amongst millennials have also basically doubled over the course of the last eight years with now
[03:57:03.060 --> 03:57:10.660]  11.2 percent of millennials in america identifying as lgbt what could have caused that a massive
[03:57:10.660 --> 03:57:18.180]  cultural indoctrination social engineering campaign or were they just born that way right bar reports
[03:57:18.180 --> 03:57:22.580]  won't fail her she's hit with backlash boycott polls after casting transgender activists in
[03:57:22.580 --> 03:57:28.980]  international women's day promo get woke go broke i don't know they've got massive amounts of free
[03:57:28.980 --> 03:57:34.100]  advertising as a result of the controversy that they've deliberately generated over this
[03:57:34.100 --> 03:57:39.140]  people are upset about it people calling for a boycott i'm probably just gonna fizzle out like
[03:57:39.140 --> 03:57:43.380]  every other boycott before that i'm just gonna wrap it up war room is next with our intro yes
[03:57:43.380 --> 03:57:51.060]  summit dot news don't go away i've got some good news our high quality supplements really work
[03:57:51.060 --> 03:57:56.980]  and we have about an 80 percent reorder rate with customers that's the good news they're amazing
[03:57:56.980 --> 03:58:02.900]  the bad news is around one percent or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to
[03:58:02.900 --> 03:58:07.860]  infowarstore.com and ever actually buy the products so you're missing out on these products plus it
[03:58:07.860 --> 03:58:13.140]  funds the info war think of what we've done with just one percent of our massive audience actually
