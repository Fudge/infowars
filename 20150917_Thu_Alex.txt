[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
[00:15.760 --> 00:17.840]  What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
[00:17.840 --> 00:21.840]  How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
[00:21.840 --> 00:30.080]  The answer is out there, Neo. It's the question that drives us.
[00:31.520 --> 00:32.480]  What is the matrix?
[00:34.640 --> 00:39.040]  The matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[00:40.240 --> 00:49.680]  True human beings are diseased. You are a cancer of this planet, and we are the cure.
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.120]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers,
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.880]  and when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.560]  The matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. When you're inside, you look around,
[01:10.560 --> 01:17.040]  what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the varying minds of the people we
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.560]  are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.000]  them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged,
[01:28.800 --> 01:34.240]  and many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight
[01:34.240 --> 01:42.160]  to protect it. And our Lord, save you, Barack Obama! Barack Obama!
[01:42.160 --> 01:46.160]  We are trained to deceive if we have to. You shouldn't trust me. I will taint the myth.
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.440]  Our propaganda was beginning to pay off. Genetically modified sounds frank and stylish.
[01:51.440 --> 01:59.600]  Drop resistance sounds really something we want. I am not a dictator. I'm the president.
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.360]  This is a full, dishonorable, scientific mafia warfare takedown.
[02:05.360 --> 02:12.000]  Public policy could itself become the captain of a scientific, technological elite.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.320]  These people are coming for everybody. I'm not going to wait around to be soft killed.
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.560]  I'm not going to wait around to watch my family die around me. I'm going to die fighting.
[02:20.560 --> 02:26.560]  You take the blue pill. The story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to
[02:26.560 --> 02:34.080]  believe. You take the red pill. You stay in Wonderland. And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[02:34.080 --> 02:43.440]  Come on! The Alex Jones show. Because there is a war on. For your mind.
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.440]  Stop being a moron. Stop being dishonorable. Within 15 years they say, CNN, that everyone
[02:53.440 --> 03:00.160]  will be merged with machines. Or will be obsolete. I am not going to sit here and take it anymore.
[03:00.160 --> 03:09.520]  Yeah! Welcome to the real world. Hillary Clinton is the most beautiful woman on the planet.
[03:10.400 --> 03:17.680]  And every man's eye desires to be able to sit in her presence. And of course we call that fantasy
[03:17.680 --> 03:23.760]  land. We call that hell. Welcome to the info war, ladies and gentlemen. We're now 24 hours and three
[03:23.760 --> 03:31.120]  minutes, 25 seconds into this live transmission. And we are now in the final four hours countdown
[03:31.120 --> 03:38.880]  of info wars, money bomb 2015. What I hope will be the final fundraiser, not that it's bad to do
[03:38.880 --> 03:44.400]  fundraisers. The globalists do all sorts of fundraisers and charities and siphon the money off to go
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.800]  after your second amendment. They go after your family rights, go after your property rights,
[03:48.800 --> 03:56.240]  your sovereignty, the list goes on and on. But in this case, this is simply to add to our war
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.400]  chest to secure the fact that we can go up on satellite, get the closed captioning and syndicate
[04:02.400 --> 04:10.000]  this radio slash TV transmission to men and women all over North America. And then the next phase is
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  to Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East. And I have no doubt that if you support
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  us and spread the word, we'll be able to do that. You don't see a lot of American news period being
[04:24.000 --> 04:32.720]  broadcast overseas because people don't trust it anymore. But I have found that information that
[04:32.720 --> 04:38.080]  questions the official narrative is extremely popular overseas as our metrics and numbers show
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.560]  from info wars.com and this radio TV show. And so it's not going to be about targeting those
[04:44.560 --> 04:51.200]  populations to make money because putting news internationally on is not profitable. It is
[04:51.200 --> 04:56.800]  about reaching people with a message against the globalist. Without that, we have no hope. Stay with
[04:56.800 --> 05:04.000]  us. Kid Daniels info wars.com. Do you ever wonder how the current migrant crisis is going to affect
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.320]  Europe and America a decade from now if governments keep handing out welfare? Well, Sweden has been
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.120]  accepting a lot of immigrants for the past 15 years and now 58% of the country's welfare payments
[05:13.120 --> 05:18.000]  go to migrants. The majority of violent crimes in Sweden are committed by first or second generation
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.240]  immigrants. Most of them refuse to assimilate into Sweden's culture. Even more shocking,
[05:22.240 --> 05:26.480]  nearly half the immigrants don't work. And now Sweden has the biggest employment gap in Europe
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.360]  between natives and non natives. In other words, native Swedes are working their butts off to support
[05:31.360 --> 05:36.000]  an immigrant population who won't work and want to assimilate, but will steal, rape and murder.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  Simply put, when the government offers free goodies and welfare to immigrants, the country's only
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  going to attract the worst kinds of people. But what's going on in Sweden is now going to happen
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.080]  in the United States. This is the new America brought to you by Obama and his puppet masters.
[05:48.080 --> 05:52.800]  More decadence, less prosperity and freedom. Keep checking back at info wars.com and prison

[08:10.800 --> 08:16.640]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:16.640 --> 08:25.920]  We are now 24 hours, eight minutes and 25 seconds into this worldwide broadcast.
[08:26.560 --> 08:33.760]  We kicked off the transmission at 11 a.m. central yesterday. It is now Thursday the 17th day of
[08:33.760 --> 08:41.840]  September 2015. We have Larry Klayman who in federal court a few years ago had the illegal
[08:41.840 --> 08:50.800]  NSA bulk spying tossed out as unconstitutional. Years later last week a federal appeals court
[08:53.280 --> 08:55.360]  basically amended that ruling.
[08:58.720 --> 09:03.600]  But there's a lot of legalese involved in this so the constitutional lawyer will be popping in for
[09:03.600 --> 09:10.960]  about 30 minutes in the third hour today. The fourth hour and final hour of the 28 hour broadcast
[09:10.960 --> 09:16.800]  will be hosted by Leigh Ann McAdoo, Anthony Gutiarty and others and they have some special
[09:16.800 --> 09:19.120]  guess and analysis that's coming up as well.
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.560]  While we're all distracted with the Republican reality TV show and the debates which we're going
[09:28.560 --> 09:37.920]  to cover here in a moment and play clips of, the illegal alien Islamic radical invasion of Europe
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.480]  is going into overdrive and high gear and the Hungarian military intelligence head
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.880]  said Muslim refugee crisis endangers Europe and says that quote Europe is in the last hour.
[09:53.360 --> 10:02.080]  There are 800 million Muslims in North Africa and the Middle East and Central Asia.
[10:02.080 --> 10:12.000]  There's another 400 million in Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia and other areas and here's the deal.
[10:12.640 --> 10:18.160]  If they weren't anti-Western before which they've been in some cases invading the West
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.720]  knowing as far West as East Germany and Poland and taking over.
[10:24.720 --> 10:33.200]  They certainly are now after the West went in there, put dictators in,
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.400]  then toppled those people and put radical Islamists in charge.
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.320]  So it's classic problem reaction solution. The globalists want to bring down prosperity in
[10:42.320 --> 10:54.160]  the West. They're doing it. Now continuing here we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.040]  Kurt Nemo has a detailed story at infowars.com that's very important. We have world news,
[10:59.040 --> 11:06.080]  economy news, science news, US news. A lot of very interesting police state news we're going to be
[11:06.080 --> 11:13.840]  breaking down. Everything from NYPD union press Patrick Lynch says only police are qualified to
[11:13.840 --> 11:24.480]  judge the actions of police. It's that type of arrogance and hubris that has made the police the
[11:25.520 --> 11:33.120]  brunt of public discontent with the government. No one is above the law and that is a bizarre
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.640]  statement to say that only the police that is themselves can investigate themselves.
[11:38.640 --> 11:45.680]  And some districts do investigate themselves and do a good job. Still there's always got to be a
[11:45.680 --> 11:51.440]  check and a balance and the police are going too far and many jurisdictions they're going to end up
[11:51.440 --> 11:59.120]  with federal George Soros basically communist boards in Austin. The review boards that oversee
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.680]  the police review board. We're doing an undercover investigation I can now announce because it's
[12:03.680 --> 12:15.040]  basically done that is run by actual Maoists who call for arresting dissenters and ending free
[12:15.040 --> 12:22.080]  speech at board meetings. We just don't want them to know we've been there when they've been shooting
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.080]  their mouths off but we got a bunch of footage to go through shot in the last six months.
[12:26.080 --> 12:36.400]  It's just incredible. So that's why the feds and the globalists have given the police
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.000]  all this rope to hang themselves and the police in many areas are doing a very good job of doing it.
[12:43.280 --> 12:47.040]  In Austin the police have been a model department compared to many departments.
[12:47.040 --> 12:50.640]  They'll say that because I live here it's just a fact I've lived to other places I've
[12:50.640 --> 12:56.480]  traveled a lot. Austin police are a breath of fresh air compared to other major cities that I've
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.120]  been in. I mean I've seen some thug cops I've run into some real criminals I've seen some really
[13:01.120 --> 13:08.320]  bad people and I've lived in Austin for 25 years and I can say as big of a department as it is
[13:08.320 --> 13:15.120]  it's a good department but still they're under a police review board and they've got other boards
[13:15.120 --> 13:22.080]  that oversee that board and it is a collection of people that pull the strings on the Black Lives
[13:22.080 --> 13:29.280]  Matter kill the cops movement and when you go and almost everyone on the stage when you research
[13:29.280 --> 13:35.440]  him is a hardcore communist and then they start shooting their mouths off in front of your camera
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.480]  in front of our investigators cameras.
[13:38.480 --> 13:46.080]  You just can't believe it and we began investigating him because of the communist
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.000]  movements here in Austin that are getting bigger and bigger and the UT professors that are behind
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.200]  it and the Ford Foundation and others and then our demonstrations at pro-life facilities being
[13:55.200 --> 13:59.520]  attacked by communists we tracked these people back and then we're contacted.
[13:59.520 --> 14:10.560]  Let's just say by people inside government who might not like the Black Lives Matter movement
[14:11.360 --> 14:17.360]  saying you might want to look into these people and we did and they're actual revolutionary
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.480]  communists. I mean do you have any idea how much trouble this country's in when the groups oversight
[14:24.480 --> 14:32.400]  running over side of the police want a violent revolution that's why they stir everything up
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.280]  while giving police training and putting police policies in place that will create citizen anger.
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.680]  They are setting everybody up for a fall it's diabolical and the police need to get wise to
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.280]  it right now and not be like the NYPD union president Patrick Lynch. I mean I've been to
[14:51.280 --> 14:57.840]  New York a lot I've seen arrogant police and the New York police as a whole I'm not saying
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.720]  you're bad people a lot of great cops up there a lot of listeners but when it comes to arrogant
[15:02.720 --> 15:10.400]  behavior swapping uniforms smoking cigars and cigarettes while riding people tickets
[15:13.680 --> 15:19.520]  telling tourists they're pieces of crap acting like gang member thugs New York takes the cake
[15:19.520 --> 15:26.560]  but I'm digressing it's shameful it's shameful
[15:30.560 --> 15:31.760]  it's ridiculous
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.240]  continuing school district hires private investigators to catch kids stealing
[15:39.520 --> 15:44.240]  education it's a problem that every school district has if you're a good town
[15:44.240 --> 15:50.320]  that is catching people that don't actually live in the town with the high property taxes
[15:50.320 --> 15:54.800]  or the school district coming in to try to get their child a good education because I hear you
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.600]  you live in a bad neighborhood the school is like a war zone and you don't have the money
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.280]  to live in the fancy area but you want them to go to that good school and if I was one of these
[16:05.280 --> 16:12.800]  people I don't blame them trying to do this and so let's say grandma lives in the good district
[16:12.800 --> 16:21.360]  but you don't and so your daughter you claim lives with grandma they'll go to social services and say
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.480]  why are you living with your grandmother when you're supposed to live with your mother and your
[16:28.480 --> 16:35.280]  father we're just going to take your kid away really nasty but it's all based on a fraud to begin
[16:35.280 --> 16:40.080]  with because why do we have property taxes the last hundred years we had great education before
[16:40.080 --> 16:47.440]  we had property tax that's a huge tax on people that redistributes wealth from folks that don't
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.800]  even have kids to pay for schools in the area and then it becomes a giant boondoggle
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.720]  and the more money you throw at education the more the price of education goes up
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.000]  so that's just miscellaneous uh the type of uh articles there's hundreds of them here
[17:04.000 --> 17:13.520]  that I have today obviously we're in the 25th hour now of the 28 hour broadcast that kicked
[17:13.520 --> 17:21.520]  off yesterday 11 a.m central it's a big deal it's important that info wars and the nightly news and
[17:21.520 --> 17:28.640]  this syndicated radio show slash tv transmission go on u h f v h f and cable stations around the
[17:28.640 --> 17:40.800]  country if we really want to change the world if we really want to have an effect we have to have
[17:42.400 --> 17:49.760]  a nightly news program that goes to all of north america and then down the road to south america
[17:49.760 --> 17:57.920]  to africa to europe to asia to the middle east and we're now on a satellite listed
[17:57.920 --> 18:04.160]  at info wars dot com forward slash affiliates that covers from the bottom of central america
[18:04.880 --> 18:12.800]  all the way up to northern canada every u h f v h f station every cable station we are on the big
[18:12.800 --> 18:19.760]  official king daddy satellite that the most dishes are pointed to so program directors and station
[18:19.760 --> 18:25.760]  owners don't even have to have one of their other dishes aimed to find some weird feed we're on the
[18:25.760 --> 18:37.680]  big enchilada and so we're just fighting as hard as we can it's why we're doing it it cost 400 plus
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.720]  thousand dollars a year for the satellites and the closed captioning and a lot more for the cameras
[18:42.720 --> 18:47.200]  the crew and what's going to take to do this properly we need about a million dollars to be able to
[18:47.200 --> 18:52.640]  not have to flog the advertising and really push things hard to pay for this and five hundred
[18:53.280 --> 18:59.040]  and sixty something thousand dollars they're just about to update the graph there that shows it has
[18:59.040 --> 19:04.000]  come in and the biggest money bomb we ever had brought in about six hundred and fifty thousand
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.640]  dollars so i guess we're going to break our record today uh oh they just updated it's more
[19:08.640 --> 19:14.160]  than i thought five hundred and seventy two thousand dollars one hundred ninety seven dollars
[19:14.160 --> 19:19.840]  five hundred and seventy two thousand one hundred ninety seven dollars and so we've already reached
[19:19.840 --> 19:24.320]  the goal of the satellite the closed captioning and have over a hundred and seventy thousand dollars
[19:24.320 --> 19:30.560]  towards crew towards travel uh towards camera folks towards editing towards research towards
[19:30.560 --> 19:37.200]  reporters so i want to salute and thank everyone who has donated to the 2015 war chest for liberty
[19:37.920 --> 19:44.080]  we want to thank you because nowhere else can you see where supporting a broadcast gets you that much

[26:05.440 --> 26:10.560]  the next segment that's an 18 minute segment i can really play a whole bunch of the clips from it
[26:10.560 --> 26:16.720]  that's coming up senator cruz says plan parenthood a criminal enterprise one of the best statements
[26:16.720 --> 26:23.760]  of the night uh big props to senator cruz bush says 40 years ago he smoked marijuana i admit it
[26:23.760 --> 26:28.400]  ooh big deal you mean 40 years ago your family shipped cocaine in that'd be a bigger admission
[26:28.400 --> 26:38.400]  uh donald trump says rand paul shouldn't be on the stage and he's ugly uh trump you look pretty
[26:38.400 --> 26:45.120]  goofy to me i mean i'll say it rand paul's got curly hair which i don't think looks goofy but
[26:45.120 --> 26:51.440]  i guess you could say it looks goofy from your perspective you look like you have a dead blonde
[26:51.440 --> 26:59.600]  possum on your head and it used to be brown then it was chimpanzee colored and now it's blonde so
[26:59.600 --> 27:06.000]  you get your hair bleached trump to then turn it blonde so if anybody looks like a freak it's you
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.800]  and i'm not up here attacking him but he can't sit there and make comments about how people look
[27:13.360 --> 27:21.280]  and then not expect to have it thrown back at him i mean it's just unbelievable it's unbelievable
[27:21.280 --> 27:22.880]  now then he goes on to say good things
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.200]  where he talks about the fact that this is a country where we speak english not spanish
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.680]  so we're going to play all those clips we got a bunch of them coming up the next segment

[28:01.680 --> 28:06.720]  could easily get in a situation and i don't want to do it so knock on wood where the economy really
[28:06.720 --> 28:13.680]  implodes and things happen where i could have to sell my house to keep this place running three four
[28:13.680 --> 28:20.080]  months where i'd have to do fundraisers every week we're not anywhere near that but the economy is so

[38:32.000 --> 38:38.160]  your neck this is not an assault we're not coming for you because your brain takes that message
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.520]  and starts thinking are they telling the truth instead of acting and defending yourself
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.880]  i'm really sorry this hurts jam a dagger right in the back of your neck
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.120]  i love you i love you have some fluoride have some vaccines we love your kids we want to carry you
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.240]  and it's all a sick joke to them
[39:02.240 --> 39:09.440]  but try to pull that headline up pentagon promises to stop lying because of drudge
[39:10.400 --> 39:15.360]  government promises to stop lying because of drudge report spotlight but then you actually
[39:15.360 --> 39:24.240]  go to the video from the undersecretary of defense the deputy and it's a video where he admits we've
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.120]  been lying the people don't trust us so now we're going to operate domestically with every police
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.000]  department every newspaper every tv station we're going to pay them money and we're going to teach
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  them that we're here to love you and we're going to stop lying and most people the the officers the
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.560]  civilians the non-commissioned officers look completely freaked out they look like they've
[39:44.560 --> 39:50.160]  been put in front of a firing squad they know that this is total open evil that they're launching
[39:50.160 --> 39:55.360]  a domestic takeover saying we promise to tell the truth we come in peace drop your firearms
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.880]  don't shoot we are your friends and then they get some of these pr people up who mean well
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.760]  to ask questions and they start crying and going you mean i'm not going to have to lie anymore
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.280]  because i hate lying they go man sergeant you're done talking now we need someone else up here
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.240]  people are shaking their heads people have tears in their eyes because it's so sick
[40:19.040 --> 40:23.040]  because they're not evil they don't like being part of this they don't like saying we're fighting
[40:23.040 --> 40:27.920]  ices when they've got to resupply c 130s landing delivering them weapons on the hour
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.880]  in battle with russian commandos who are on the right side you think america the actual
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.720]  military likes being clearly on the bad side with al qaeda launching wars and then back home
[40:40.720 --> 40:47.200]  we got to take your rights away because of al qaeda do you think anybody in the government likes
[40:47.200 --> 40:57.200]  being part of that but the people on top do so that all ties together we ought to do a new report
[40:57.200 --> 41:04.400]  about that for the nightly news in the next few days and we're here on the radio looking back
[41:06.480 --> 41:14.800]  to the pentagon promising to stop lying by in getting involved in every local paper in tv station
[41:14.800 --> 41:19.440]  hi we're the pentagon with all these psychiatrists and experts here to help you
[41:21.600 --> 41:26.560]  but it's a pentagon run by offshore banks in the takeover of america just like in europe
[41:26.560 --> 41:33.520]  they've hired the stasi the former east german most hardcore vicious hateful communist you can
[41:33.520 --> 41:41.360]  imagine to get on the news and say if you'll say anything bad about these wonderful migrants if you
[41:41.360 --> 41:46.480]  not call them migrants if you call them invaders we have a have you arrested
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.320]  and the woman commanding and all looks like a female ronald mcdonnell
[41:54.880 --> 41:59.360]  i mean this is the bozo of the clown level garbage and we'll all bow to her we'll do whatever she
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.480]  says this is america this is europe this is the land of cowards we're here to be usurped and i
[42:04.480 --> 42:10.720]  say that so maybe we'll stop being cowards i don't care what any two-bit pentagon propaganda says i
[42:10.720 --> 42:14.720]  don't care what media manner says i don't care what the white house does i don't care what the stasi
[42:14.720 --> 42:21.520]  does we're not shutting up and the real americans are coming because the next thing of next place
[42:21.520 --> 42:28.640]  i'm going to beam our message into when phase one becomes operational we're on right now but it'll
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.680]  be operational when it becomes self-funding in the next six months i intend to blast all of western
[42:33.680 --> 42:38.400]  eastern europe with a free-to-air satellite with five hours of this transmission a day
[42:38.400 --> 42:47.280]  and as soon as we have enough capital we're gonna refeed it 24 hours a day worldwide and then our
[42:47.280 --> 42:52.000]  operatives who don't even work for us but love liberty who are directed by freedom who are
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.160]  directed by truth and justice no communications other than the fact they know what's happening
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.640]  they're going to spread the word and get us on local tv's channels and cable channels in europe
[43:04.640 --> 43:09.200]  that actually aren't controlled the global issues political correctness in europe to get their message
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.160]  saturated but there's a new phenomenon all over the netherlands germany and other places where
[43:14.160 --> 43:21.360]  anti-new world order information is now being aired and we already have the contacts all over europe
[43:21.360 --> 43:27.440]  from france to the netherlands from germany to idly with a lot of folks with u hf v hf pirate
[43:27.440 --> 43:34.240]  that's huge in idly and other areas ready to turn us on we're coming the real voice of america
[43:34.240 --> 43:38.720]  and quite frankly i was going to roll this out till later but we we're going to bill it as the real
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.320]  voice of america you want to hear the voice of america directly from texas the the real deal that
[43:44.320 --> 43:50.640]  the world loved that people stood up for that people admired free market rugged individualism
[43:50.640 --> 43:56.400]  second amendment we're sorry the globalist captured america and used us to enslave you even more
[43:56.400 --> 44:02.800]  but we're coming the the yankees are coming baby we're coming that's what all this is about we're
[44:02.800 --> 44:10.960]  coming nobody will watch american news now in europe it's dead its ratings are over so a lot of foreign
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.640]  transmissions of us news are basically being phased out but that's because they only care about
[44:16.640 --> 44:20.640]  making money or getting their propaganda out so if no one's listening and they're not making money
[44:20.640 --> 44:26.880]  they're ending their transmissions we don't care about the money if we can just pay the bills that's
[44:26.880 --> 44:33.280]  the mission is to transmit into those cities into those countries into that continent and then to
[44:33.280 --> 44:38.720]  hit the middle east and to hit africa and to hit latin america and to hit asia will hit it all
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.640]  but it's up to you we're coming we're not playing games who else is going to put patriot television
[44:44.640 --> 44:48.640]  on worldwide who else is going to fight the new world order who else is going to tell you there's
[44:48.640 --> 44:53.920]  cancer viruses and the vaccines and that they're going to have cia operatives brainwashing the
[44:53.920 --> 45:01.040]  local tv station people into taking over and putting out propaganda we're here to counter that
[45:01.040 --> 45:06.800]  just in case tv station folks u h f v h f and others want to actually put something real on
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.600]  there's nobody calling the shots here but the truth there's nobody calling the shots here but
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.080]  taking action i don't tell my reporters what to report i don't tell my reporters most of the
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.040]  time even were to go they're already there before me because they're americans who love liberty
[45:21.040 --> 45:27.120]  they're humans that love freedom and they're taking action i want to get into the debate
[45:28.080 --> 45:34.320]  and then your phone calls but i do want to just add it takes money to do something like this and

[46:45.040 --> 46:50.320]  willing to do in this time in history when folks ask you when your grandchildren ask you or your
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.520]  children ask you or your neighbors ask you where were you during the takeover what did you do to
[46:55.520 --> 47:04.640]  try to stop it don't lose faith understand that we've forced chris christy to backpedal on vaccines
[47:04.640 --> 47:12.880]  we forced dr carcin to backpedal on vaccines we forced donald trump to backpedal on vaccines
[47:13.440 --> 47:20.240]  we forced many people to backpedal up there trying to push forced inoculations and so last
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.640]  night we heard ran paul saying you know there's some good vaccines out there but i'm all for
[47:24.640 --> 47:30.560]  freedom and the right to say no you had donald trump going further saying hey vaccines are actually
[47:30.560 --> 47:37.600]  hurting people i know that was bold so he's under attack in the washington post today for daring
[47:37.600 --> 47:43.920]  to talk about the elephant in the room so let's go ahead and start off with some of the highlights
[47:43.920 --> 47:46.480]  of the debate with donald trump on vaccines
[47:51.520 --> 47:55.280]  hey let's go to what they're saying right now because donald trump is making an epic statement
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.600]  about the connection of autism and vaccines and i've seen it and i had my children
[47:59.600 --> 48:05.200]  taking care of over a long period of time over two or three year period of time same exact amount
[48:05.200 --> 48:11.200]  but you take this little beautiful baby and you pump i mean it looks just like it's meant for
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.000]  a horse not for a child and we've had so many instances people that worked for me just the
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.960]  other day two years old two and a half years old the child the beautiful child went to have the
[48:20.960 --> 48:27.760]  vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever got very very sick now he's
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.920]  autistic he's doing a great job i only say thank you donald i'm in favor of vaccines i could have
[48:31.920 --> 48:37.520]  said thank you for this over a longer period of time yep same amount thank you just in in little
[48:37.520 --> 48:41.360]  and that's what i said earlier i agree i think you're going to have excellent i think you're going
[48:41.360 --> 48:46.320]  to see a big impact on autism doctor can you nail it you're going to have been cars and jump
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.320]  nailed it good job he didn't backtrack i like that that's right he's an okay doctor
[48:50.320 --> 48:58.240]  oh yeah trust me because i'm a doctor come on i don't want to hear that yeah i don't hear that i
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.520]  can read the stuff myself dr ben karson right read the constitution jerk if you're going to run
[49:03.520 --> 49:09.760]  for president there's no autism associated with vaccinations but it is true that we are
[49:09.760 --> 49:18.160]  proven by our paid off scientists right there now recognize that the full video of our
[49:18.160 --> 49:26.720]  our live commentary over that is that info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but notice car
[49:26.720 --> 49:32.080]  sin then goes on to backtrack more and admits yeah we give him too many at one time but he lies and
[49:32.080 --> 49:38.640]  says there's no link to autism those fake studies have been overturned uh the doctor who did the study
[49:39.200 --> 49:45.600]  with the other doctors has been exonerated in england that his study showing it was linked to
[49:45.600 --> 49:51.120]  autism was indeed true he won a lawsuit over that it was all a fraud they're going to have
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.120]  studies out saying roundups good for you folks we've got hundreds of studies showing it gives you
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.800]  cancer now they're going to tell you a bullet in the head's good next but i got to say as a litmus test
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.720]  donald trump coming out against vaccines and saying i got a lot of friends and family
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.520]  who've got brain damaged kids from this shows that he really cares about people
[50:11.520 --> 50:16.480]  and he knows the system is going to come after him and he understands what's going on and when
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.640]  the rubber meets the road he doesn't want to be involved in brain damaging tens of millions of
[50:20.640 --> 50:27.520]  children it is a fact that vaccines are linked to increased cancer neurological disorders
[50:27.520 --> 50:33.760]  autoimmune disorders it says it on the stinking inserts and ben carcin a medical doctor a brain
[50:33.760 --> 50:42.560]  surgeon not an epidemiologist not a virologist he's just so certain says it's wonderful because
[50:42.560 --> 50:46.640]  he's a good guy as a doctor so he believes everything they're doing must be wonderful
[50:47.840 --> 50:53.920]  carcin they've recalled hundreds of vaccines for killing people before you know that so you really

[54:09.840 --> 54:23.920]  we should have heard more about states rights being the answer last night
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.960]  we should have heard more about it's not the federal government's job to make sure america's
[54:28.960 --> 54:37.600]  quote successful but we did hear some really good points from people like senator rand paul
[54:37.600 --> 54:44.160]  about the fact that with this whole illegal alien immigrant invasion problem why isn't
[54:44.160 --> 54:49.600]  saudi arabia and other arab countries taking a single person when they're the ones destabilizing
[54:49.600 --> 54:57.360]  the whole region and that clips coming up but first senator ted cruise had this to say about
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.200]  planned parenthood being a criminal enterprise and that's what you got to do look i've seen the
[55:03.200 --> 55:09.120]  vaccines hurt kids over and over again it's out of control we're giving them enough for a horse
[55:09.680 --> 55:16.720]  something's wrong and then suddenly you see people like karson start to fold start to back
[55:16.720 --> 55:22.000]  pedal because they know the truth but they've been committed to this lie so long same thing with
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.640]  cruise call them what they are criminals clearly committing crimes clearly selling the body parts
[55:28.640 --> 55:34.400]  open and shut indict them shut them down you start fighting evil folks historically
[55:35.600 --> 55:37.440]  it starts falling like dominoes
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.680]  that's why they always try to act so confident and invincible because they're not
[55:48.240 --> 55:53.280]  let's go to the ted cruise club here it is well let me tell you dan on number one i'm proud to
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.760]  stand for life these planned parenthood videos are horrifying i would encourage every american to
[55:57.760 --> 56:04.320]  watch these videos see senior planned parenthood officials callously heartlessly bartering and
[56:04.320 --> 56:10.400]  selling the body parts of human beings and then ask yourself are these my values these are horrifying
[56:11.040 --> 56:17.200]  on these videos planned parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies it is a felony with
[56:17.200 --> 56:22.640]  10 years jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit that's what these
[56:22.640 --> 56:28.560]  videos show planned parenthood doing absolutely we shouldn't be sending 500 million dollars of
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.520]  taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise and i'll tell you the fact that
[56:33.520 --> 56:39.680]  republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to
[56:39.680 --> 56:46.320]  deborak obama and saying we'll give in because obama threatens a veto you know obama's committed
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.840]  to his principles his liberal principles he will fight for them he says i will veto any budget
[56:51.840 --> 56:57.120]  that doesn't fund planned parenthood and republicans surrender we need to stop surrendering and start
[56:57.120 --> 57:04.960]  standing thank you principal absolutely that's because once they get us to go along with them
[57:04.960 --> 57:12.080]  because if they ever get pushed back in one thing they fall so that he gets more and more outrageous
[57:12.080 --> 57:18.000]  now they're not in trouble for openly selling body parts for decades on a huge scale admitting it's
[57:18.000 --> 57:28.000]  it's a cover-up premeditated fraud organized crime and we can't even go after them that's because
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.720]  if they fall on one point they fall on every point but you start calling them criminals on
[57:34.720 --> 57:40.720]  national tv you start pointing it out you start pointing out the conspiracy it's game over and
[57:40.720 --> 57:45.200]  i looked in ted cruise's eyes right there and i can see there's a good person there overall
[57:45.200 --> 57:50.960]  somebody who wants to do good somebody who wants to do right i know that about rand paul i know that
[57:50.960 --> 57:57.200]  about ted cruise and seeing what i've seen out of donald trump knowing what i know about what he's
[57:57.200 --> 58:02.160]  going to be going through now for saying that and looking at the look in his eye i guarantee
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.760]  a donald trump doesn't like seeing his friends have brain damage kids all around him it's a large
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.360]  portion of people have giggling happy 18 month old baby boys their blood brain barriers not strong
[58:13.360 --> 58:19.280]  as the girls they're going to get that last round of shots billy don't ever talk again that's why a
[58:19.280 --> 58:25.360]  lot of members of congress are against vaccines because you know you were your kid or your grand
[58:25.360 --> 58:32.000]  children take a shot and never talk again that'll that'll wake some people up so i gotta say it uh
[58:32.000 --> 58:38.240]  rand paul ted cruise and donald trump they are the three presidential contenders in my view
[58:38.240 --> 58:43.520]  from a position of liberty and i just can find really no way to criticize them at this point because
[58:44.240 --> 58:45.600]  what they're saying so bombshell
[58:48.800 --> 58:54.480]  when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that

[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:57.280]  on another note i went swimming last memorial day or not memorial day last labor day last
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:04.400]  monday not this money but last monday and a couple days later i thought that i've been
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.080]  grinding my teeth again at night or something or clenching and was it aches so bad on the side of
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.880]  my head i thought it was tmj i've had before when i'm real stressed out i'll clench and grind my
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:20.400]  teeth so it was i wear a mouth splint not do it but it didn't go away in a couple days even though
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.160]  i was wearing the mouth splint and then my what do you call them lymph nodes swell up on this side
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.920]  on my right side and i thought well it'll go away in a few days this is an infection
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.400]  and i drank a bunch of colloidal silver and it kind of did go away but then so i stopped
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.280]  drinking colloidal silver after three days and then i was with the family again out at the lake
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.040]  last weekend fishing and water skiing and stuff with friends that have a boat
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.280]  i got a boat but it's really too old so i was hanging out with friends and all of a sudden i
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.480]  woke up in the morning and it was just blown up everywhere both sides i looked like frankenstein
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.640]  my jaw was so wide i couldn't hear got to the doctor got me on antibiotics and it's it's reduced
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.520]  about about 80 percent but i still feel like i've been run over by a mac truck and the doctor was
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.960]  telling me that a lot of people lose their hearing doing that because the eustacean people get so
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.520]  infected that all that gets pushed back into the inner ear and then you can lose hearing
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.240]  and it was funny the day before i went to the doctor i was talking to a guy uh there was a
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.760]  listener and he said he lost hearing in his ear by bacteria he got in the lake and just don't swim
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.480]  in the lake for at least two weeks after it rains it's been raining for weeks off and on because
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:37.200]  all the dog crap and the rest of it washes in but see i'm not a doctor i just know swimming in a hot
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.720]  lake at the end of a summer it's still hot down here is not a good idea and i'm not doing it anymore
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.720]  and i'm not a rocket scientist but i know almost everybody i know that as a brain damaged child
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.000]  it's a boy and at 18 months they had a third round of shots and sometimes had convulsions
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.880]  right there in the doctor's office and then never talked again or yelled and screamed and banged
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:05.360]  their head in the wall for the rest of their life or a mix of those but then i can go out
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.960]  with medical research and find out why bacteria get in your throat or in your ear and get you
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:16.320]  really sick i can go read the medical literature even though i'm not a doctor about all the hundreds
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:24.080]  of vaccines recalled in the last century there's been more than 20 of them this year recalled around
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.600]  the world killing people because when it's too obvious you know you give a village of 300 people
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:37.360]  the shot and 100 of them die the rest of them get deathly ill you're going to recall that vaccine
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:45.040]  but when it just brain damages you know five or six boys that's okay see because it's meant to do
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.600]  that most people it's just meant to dumb you down and brain damage is shown but sometimes
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.040]  the effect's too intense you get a wrecked brain that doesn't make for a good biological android
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.400]  to work in an apple factory
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:04.240]  kid daniels info wars dot com president obama has ordered the federal government to start
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.280]  conducting behavior experiments on u.s citizens you're at that right the new executive order
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.360]  commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the government wants them to do
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.440]  effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.600]  the fifth they're going to start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage meaning brain
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.960]  wash people to say signing up for obama care or even turning into their guns at a local gun buyback
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.440]  program so basically the obama administration wants to take the freedom of choice away from the
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.840]  individual and give it to the government that doesn't sound like freedom now does it freedom is
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.520]  the right of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their conduct doesn't infringe

[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.480]  there's joe big so that's what we're doing now i'm going to skip this network break because it's
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:06.160]  special 28 hour broadcast so that i can get to a bunch of these clips without too much commentary
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.040]  you'll hear the commentary of my reporters this is from our feed covering it last night and if you
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.160]  wanted to tune into a debate without our interruptions you can we do it mystery science theater
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.480]  to praise it when our folks think it's praiseworthy but to also shout it down when it's a bunch of
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:25.280]  garbage and counter it in real time and here is the clip already played a bunch of clips we
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:31.920]  haven't played are coming up uh of uh senator cruz saying planned parenthood is a criminal
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:37.360]  enterprise uh then we're going to go through uh the other clips but here's senator ted cruz
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:42.000]  saying planned parenthood is a criminal enterprise well let me tell you dan on number one i'm proud
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.480]  to stand for life these planned parenthood videos are horrifying i would encourage every american
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.120]  to watch these videos see senior planned parenthood officials callously heartlessly bartering and
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:59.200]  selling the body parts of human beings and then ask yourself are these my values these are horrifying
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.760]  on these videos planned parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies it is a felony
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.440]  with 10 years jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit that's what these
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.440]  videos show planned parenthood doing absolutely we shouldn't be sending 500 million dollars of
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.400]  taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise and i'll tell you the fact that
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:28.400]  republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:35.200]  to deborak obama and saying we'll give in because obama threatens a veto you know obama's committed
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.720]  to his principles his liberal principles he will fight for them he says i will veto any budget
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:46.000]  that doesn't fund planned parenthood and republicans surrender we need to stop surrendering and start
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.320]  standing for our principles and into that now that that was exciting but it didn't get our
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:57.040]  reporters chomping at the bit this clip uh got them basically start to start celebrating uh because
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:03.440]  it's a big deal in a debate like this with 35 million viewers to talk about vaccines we were
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:09.600]  seeing the saving of untold children to break this membrane of propaganda this confidence game
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.480]  that vaccines aren't killing and brain damaging our children in mass and then carcin the brain surgeon
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.800]  sits there and says you know we are giving the kids too many vaccines but it's not causing
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:27.840]  any problems no autism read the insert folks that's a load of bull let's go ahead and go to this epic
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:35.760]  clip hey let's go to what they're saying right now because donald trump is making an epic statement
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.360]  about the connection of autism and vaccines and i've seen it and i had my children taking care of
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.080]  over a long period of time over two or three year period of time same exact amount but you take this
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.960]  little beautiful baby and you pump i mean it looks just like it's meant for a horse not for a child
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:58.000]  and we've had so many instances people that work for me just the other day two years old two and a
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.080]  half years old the child the beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.760]  got a tremendous fever got very very sick this is great he's doing a great job i only say thank you
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.680]  donald i'm in favor of vaccines i could have said thank you for this over a longer period of time
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.520]  same amount thank you just in in little section and that's what i said earlier i agree on that
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.960]  excellent excellent i think you're going to see a big impact on autism dr carly are you going to
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.200]  nail it pin cars and jump in it nailed it good job he didn't backtrack i like that that's right
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:38.480]  he's an okay doctor oh yeah that's me because i'm yeah back in up 10 seconds back to carson
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.480]  saying oh he's a good doctor as if we can't make our health decisions as if we can't read the inserts
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:52.960]  as if we can't see autism going from one in 30 000 to one in 58 cdc zone numbers they say
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:59.360]  by 2025 it'll be one in three one in 10 and 2025 2030 one in three
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.240]  oh he's a good doctor we should just do what big pharma says with the hundreds of vaccines they
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.440]  want to make mandatory used to be six or seven they push then it was 14 25 35 it's 49 vaccines
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.760]  they're trying to make mandatory right now and the new list they've got's over a hundred
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:26.480]  and they get up there in line say it's the law when it didn't and doctors sit there and nurses
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:32.160]  pressure people and then when you say no they go i actually don't give my kids vaccines either
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:37.040]  then it turns out the elite are getting quote clean vaccines that's lining guardian from special
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:44.080]  labs see the act like we don't know about the technology of of learned immunity of artificial
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:50.720]  immunity even good vaccines have side effects but the crap they're shoveling at us and at the level
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:58.240]  they know in studies it's brain damaging guinea pigs mice rats and monkeys they're doing it on
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:07.920]  purpose they know you give 14 15 shots to a newborn baby in the first day that baby's brain
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.640]  is going to be screwed up for life and then the second round the second round at what eight nine
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:23.280]  months and then nine months later the third round 18 months after birth they're given the coup de
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:32.720]  they're given the crème de la crème a final blow and we've had the nurses registered nurses
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:38.320]  head nurses on and when they're on for two three hours we take calls with the nurses going yeah
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:43.520]  i'm in the ER ward or i'm in the preemie ward and we'll have an eight month old baby doing great
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.320]  and they'll they'll be in there for two three days they'll come in they'll say time to give the shots
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.960]  and we'll say but it brain damages them and they say you're fired if you don't do it
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.040]  so we get the respirators the fibular later's ready we give them the shots and we watch them
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:05.440]  start dying and a lot of times we can't save them oh but donald's not a doctor is he of course donald
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.480]  does the politically correct thing that japan done because the japanese were revolting 20 years ago
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:16.480]  they only do five or six vaccines and they space them out you can't space out 49 or 100 donald
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.560]  and they're dirty because they have liability protection donald imagine if ford or chevy
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.680]  was had liability protection their cars would be blowing up every day but they don't have liability
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:34.800]  i don't have liability protection i got to watch what i say they got to get out of jail free card
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:40.560]  they're crapping all over us and we're sick of it that's why it's being forced as a debate issue
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.680]  let's go ahead and finish the club excuse me i know it's isn't doctor karell you're gonna
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:53.520]  nail it ben carson jump it nailed it pro job he didn't backtrack i like that that's right he's an okay doctor
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.560]  i like carson's oh yeah because i'm a doctor come on i don't want to hear that yeah i don't hear
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.920]  that i can read the stuff myself dr ben carson right read the constitution jerk if you're gonna
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:11.200]  run for president there's no autism associated with vaccinations but it is a document approved by our
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.760]  paid off scientists period of time paid off by big pharma now recognize that and i think
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.480]  are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done and i think that's all
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:28.000]  i'm saying jake that's all i'm saying now they're saying autism is caused by hey let's understand
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.800]  they want to have to be other let's understand we have such a thing called informed notice though
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.960]  we've gone from them saying a few years ago no side effects period safe and effective it's all
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.720]  conspiracy theory to having to admit their serious problems you see that that's how you
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.960]  win folks and we are winning thanks to you spreading the word and thanks to info wars
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:54.560]  being the tip of the spear back during the h1n1 situation six years ago i got called and threatened
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:01.760]  by big pharma with lawsuits i had to get lawyers i said go ahead and sue me i then had the enjoyment
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.440]  of being followed around by pis for no reason just to harass me and then i got some really nasty
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.280]  threats and people trying to break my family up and i've had them run industrial level operations
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.600]  against this this organization for it you think i care you can let me tell the new order something
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.880]  right now i'm not afraid of you dying for a good cause in fact beam me up scotty
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.880]  you think i'm gonna back off because you've threatened me and my family you think i'm gonna
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.960]  back off because you follow me around all you did was ensure that i know i'm right and i'm never
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.880]  stopping you think i'm scared to die so that little kids don't get brain damage by the millions
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.440]  and crap all over themselves until they die at 45 and so their parents go through living hell
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:52.000]  you think i'm scared to die fighting for the innocence i'm no hero but my very dna is for
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.120]  standing up for children and innocents and women and so you just don't get it see that's because
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.680]  you're cowards you've lived your lives as cowards you've always backed down you've always been scared
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.200]  by peer pressure alone i never cared about peer pressure i never cared about anything except just
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.400]  being a human being and so to the vaccine makers and big pharma and all of you i know you're the tip
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.080]  of the pyramid i know you know what you're doing bear pharmaceutical shipping out the blood factor
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.920]  to kill all the kids the hemophiliacs that came out in court you knew dr sock laughing and his
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.880]  apprentice on tape about how they knew the sv 40 was going to kill millions but so what there's too
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:35.120]  many people ha ha ha see their life matters you try to baseball back their head in my gosh you'll
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:41.920]  be a murderer terrorist on tv but they laugh about your mama or your daddy dying of an excruciating
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.400]  cancer that didn't exist before the polio vaccine and it's funny to them my grandmother 90 years old
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:56.560]  had polio since 1954 gone through living hell almost died i don't think it's funny that she
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:03.200]  caught it a week after getting the vaccine and caught the very strain that she took it's all

[01:29:53.200 --> 01:30:04.000]  the gcn radio network the miss america pageant is known for beautiful women who sometimes give
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.920]  rather amusing answers but recently miss south carolina turned the tide when she was asked about
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:17.040]  this do you support a ban on military style assault weapons i don't but i think it's because
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.280]  we need to increase education we have to go back there if we teach people the proper way to use
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:28.480]  the guns then we will reduce the risk of having gun related um a gun related accident it starts
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:33.920]  with education even before she could finish answering her question her response received a
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.120]  massive applause demonstrating strong support for gun rights despite the establishment's
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:45.280]  ongoing gun demonization campaign and yes there have been high-profile slayings with fully automatic
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.560]  rifles but the fbi's own numbers show that you're more likely to be killed by a blunt object such as

[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:18.480]  f a a says american airlines flights grounded and stopped nationwide another glitch just
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.080]  like we saw on 9 11 there were all these glitches that morning for american and united and the
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.600]  stand downs and all the rest of it i'm not saying that's about to happen here we saw massive
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.280]  insider trading on wall street but no investigation of that of course because we can't find out
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.400]  what really happened we just know there's a cover up the Saudis are involved and we blame
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.280]  tsunami same and i was just out there during the break in the break room get the glass of water
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:47.040]  and i actually saw senator lindsey graham on wolf blitzer
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.520]  talking about basically defending the iraq war i just can't handle it anymore we've got a clip of
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.840]  that from the debates we're going to be playing in a moment but i want to go to your phone calls
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:08.800]  folks that have been holding first toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.080]  we're going to go to margaret jameson eileen sue scott and others here in just a moment
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:17.680]  i love it when we get a whole bunch of women calling in usually it's five to one men even
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:23.360]  though our demographic shows about 37 percent of our listeners are women so great to have sue eileen
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:30.720]  margaret and others and now jameson can be male or female we have another lady on there as well
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.360]  so there's a majority women calling in so that's always interesting a lot of times i'll talk about
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.520]  vaccines women call in because they're so upset about watching the brain damage babies they just
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:45.600]  wish they could get the good vaccines and then weigh the benefit versus the problem because
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:51.360]  there's a bunch of vaccines i want to give my kids like tetanus shots but it almost killed one of my
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:58.560]  uncles almost killed one of my cousins the un got caught adding pathogens to it to sterilize women
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.000]  on record i mean it's a dangerous one to get because they know everybody gets it so we're
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.360]  going to go to your calls here in a moment just very briefly we are doing a 28 hour transmission
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:17.120]  that ends at three o'clock central uh in about two and a half hours but we'll also of course be back
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:25.040]  live tomorrow 11 a.m to 2 p.m central standard time in the sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m but we are
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.680]  running free shipping and i'm just going to extend the free shipping throughout today
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.560]  because that makes it simpler but i've been told by the folks in the back that they will end
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:43.200]  today a whole bunch of the other specials like 15 percent off survival shield nason i and i
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.120]  x2 that was sold out but we know a truck's coming so we're going to go ahead and keep it up for sale
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:53.520]  to start shipping it out by monday 30 off all supermail vitality but for the next two hours
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.720]  only that's going to end 20 off rain force 20 off silver bullet 50 off deep cleanse 50
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:06.000]  percent off secret 12 50 off oxy powder but it all ends all these huge discounts end at the end
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.480]  of the broadcast in two and a half hours we'll have some other specials but i mean obviously
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:17.600]  they can't be the best specials ever you had free shipping to 30 percent off supermail vitality
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.880]  there's really not even profit there it's a lost leader but it brings other folks in the store
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.160]  people tend to buy other stuff so that's how we can do this that's why people can sell something
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.360]  at a store at cost or even losing money because you come in there to buy say a battery at cost
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:37.360]  well you end up buying some other stuff in the auto department and look we use all the aboveboard
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:43.920]  tactics of sales to fund this place independently high quality good customer service a large selection
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.640]  things i like things i use we don't have some research demographic department really
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.120]  we have demographics we don't really even look at them much it's just what do i use what do you use
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.400]  what do you like uh what's been the best for you hey this cook stove my dad got me five years ago
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.560]  was really great a little bit of importable it's real cheap well let's call them and become a
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.640]  distributor and sell it for the lowest price that's five years ago we're now the biggest seller
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:11.920]  that particular little cook stove we have an info or store.com that's just how this works
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.200]  i turned down more than 30 firearms manufacturers because they just weren't the highest quality
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:25.280]  and then i approached some of the best names out there and they said no thank you
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.720]  and then head down fell in our lap and they're even better than what i thought was the best
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.800]  so that's why we are supported by hdfirearms.com because i can do it and feel really good
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:41.040]  and you can call it superstition whenever you want if i screw somebody over
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.800]  metaphysically i know it comes back on me but it's not some sociopathic thing where i don't
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.400]  screw people over because i know it comes back on me i was always like that and i bring that up
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:58.160]  a lot because the problem in this world is those of us that are like that don't understand why other
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.680]  people aren't well beyond understanding it it's time to just not be involved with people that
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:09.920]  screw us over it's time to withdraw our consent withdraw our money withdraw being nice to them
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:14.720]  it's time to shun them and they're going to get aggressive with us it's time when they attack
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.120]  us to defend ourselves and not shoot our mouths off about how big and bad we are
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:25.680]  it's time to get ready when they come when they try to come for us when they try to put us in
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.760]  their FEMA camps when they try to have the little communist brigades urinate all over us
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.320]  it's time to give them a surprise and it's time to stop their attempt to start a revolution
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:40.080]  killing cops it's time for us to actually align with justice and that doesn't mean it's with corrupt
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.800]  police departments it's not justice to randomly kill some cop not knowing if they're a good person
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.120]  or a bad person they want a direct revolution in this country is going after random police
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:58.080]  instead if everything goes off going after the actual kingpins and that's not barack obama
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.200]  i don't want anything to happen to barack obama that would turn him into a martyr in fact the
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.720]  globalist i think and i've said this for six years might do something to him a failed suicide
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:19.520]  attempt a failed uh assassination attempt an auto accident something to make him the underdog
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:28.400]  they're all into that that's the last thing we want there are people above barack obama the
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:35.920]  traders that are given our military the orders through obama to put al qaeda and isis in charge
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.480]  to engage in mass murder but the good news is the former head of the defense intelligence agency
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.920]  the former deputy head of the cia who both just left the last few months went public in the last
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.480]  month instead our government runs al qaeda and isis we set up the whole deal we were ordered
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.000]  to do it we put out fake intelligence to the public to cover this up this is a horrible crime
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.240]  congress needs to investigate and where is congress they're there with their tails between
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.360]  their legs because they know there's a mafia run in america they know foreign banks took over
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.720]  and they just want to be part of the takeover and think they're going to be safe in that
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.640]  you know where the bodies are buried congress you know where the bodies are buried fbi director
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:19.600]  you know where the bodies are buried cia director nine times out of ten in history
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.960]  when they bring in a tyranny like this they take out everybody that went along with it
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:35.200]  unless you are a top tier progenitor in on the original conspiracy you will be killed
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.400]  or you will be indicted you will have your money stripped and you'll be thrown out
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:48.800]  that is a standard move the globalist follow standard moves and formulate your idiots getting
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:54.800]  rid of the republic getting rid of checks and balances getting rid of due process getting rid
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:02.560]  of all that you were getting rid of things that were fought for for 800 years under magna

[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.240]  they've really really uh scared them off there's nobody i know i used to have real militias just
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:16.640]  on just to talk to them and then there'd be fbi agents in the parking lot when i walked out from
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:21.200]  the tv studio asked me what i was planning and and then i'd say give me your idea and they'd
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.560]  laugh at me and get their car and drive off and i just can't believe it it's so sick as if the
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.600]  militia's gonna do anything i mean the fbi knows that their own agency blew up Oklahoma city with
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.760]  the atf and german intelligence i mean i know all the names i've talked to all the cops i have the
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:40.800]  witnesses i mean can we just stop pretending i know the average fbi agents a good man or woman
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:46.480]  on average but it doesn't matter your bosses above you eric holder ran the cover-up of okc
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.040]  but margaret i could guess that a lot of women were calling in because i talked about vaccines
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:55.360]  funny you mentioned you've had family damage by it why don't you add your testimony to the
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:01.120]  mountain range of people that have warned folks about what vaccines do i mean my own family is
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:07.520]  riddled with the damage of vaccines go ahead yeah my my son when he was in when he was uh
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:13.920]  two and a half he got this dpt in his leg his leg was gone with his muscle that muscle at your feet
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:19.360]  they told us he had a Lou Gehrig disease then they told us it was mr disease and he never married
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:24.240]  because he thought he had a genetic disease sure mission complete absolutely lou gehrig's
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:29.280]  and hundreds of other new neurological disorders are up multi thousand percentage points now they've
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:35.360]  got headlines by 2030 upwards of half of americans can have neurological disorders and no one asked
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:41.760]  what pediatric cancer didn't exist 60 years ago now they're everywhere and people are always
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:49.040]  want to raise money for a little kid down from leukemia i'm just like um no because that money
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:53.680]  just goes right into the folks that killed him ask yourselves why all the kids are getting cancer
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.800]  god bless you ma'am we don't have time to hear her other vaccine damage story but so what you know
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.120]  their son's leg rotted away hey the government loves you take more shots it's fine god bless
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:11.920]  you man i'm sorry for your son they didn't get his soul though and see i don't know how that
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:18.080]  works when they brain damage a baby and they never obtain full consciousness i guess that
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.360]  soul just ends up when they die going right to god so in a way it's a reprieve i i can't judge
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:28.320]  to the globalists know a lot of this stuff i wonder they wouldn't be killing brain killing
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:33.120]  kids with soft killing them mind killing them if they thought they weren't still getting the soul
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:38.720]  because that's what they really want so maybe they think when they're all brain damaged and get all
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.120]  craze and then get older that they'll get smart enough to get corrupted and maybe possessed i don't
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:47.200]  know i mean i'm trying to figure out why these demons from whatever dementia they come from
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:52.240]  want to brain damage the kids because i know god doesn't damn people to hell that never were conscious
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.080]  i don't know it's just food for thought let's talk to scott nabrasco you're on the air welcome
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:06.560]  yeah yeah this is scott nabrasco basically an army retired retired army officer and i
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:12.800]  got out to the ba and i sitting on the ba one time this guy was a black guy said i used to be
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:19.920]  300 pounds he said they gave me a shot of something out here and now i weigh 120 pounds he said there
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:27.680]  was something in that needle and so the other part of that is i've been waiting seven years for the
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:33.520]  conclusion of my va case you're talking about they're taking property and and so put on your guns
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:40.160]  and stuff well the va had it set up that if i would claim depression uh go talk to a psychiatrist and
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:48.160]  they would uh give me maybe another 30 on top of what i got it could save my house but uh i decided
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.400]  not to do that i decided to hold out it's going to be another two years before i see anything from
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.320]  the va as far as compensation or if uh they decide to compensate me and think about it there's a war
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:04.400]  on vets that's an admitted war and they tell you because i've talked to countless vets on air and
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:10.640]  off air they say okay we'll give you that surgery for your skin cancer or we'll give you that surgery
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.800]  for your heart problems and we're talking about you know sometimes young guys but also whole guys
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:18.880]  but we want you to go to psychiatrists and admit that you want to kill people or that you're mentally
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.120]  ill and they go but what just do it will give you a full disability but i got a job i just can't
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:28.720]  afford the you know the insurance that will cover this will you just give me a heart surgery
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.520]  and they're just like no i mean just think about how evil that is
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.440]  yeah i know they they've been delaying to delaying i fought the county for two years and then i went
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.320]  finally to the state and i said hey this county is wrong and so for two years they basically lied
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:51.280]  and the guy that ran a county mysteriously just retired so i don't know if he had anything to do
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:55.600]  with it but for five years have been fighting these guys and there's something else i wanted to ask
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.840]  you if you knew a lawyer for mk ultra i might need to get into that i won't say why but there's a reason
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.320]  well we know a lot of the experimentation is admitted on the veterans
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:12.800]  and i've even had family that was in admitted experimentation it wasn't mind control but it
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:17.280]  was chemical and they've just done everything to the troops it's so sick that's why they said
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.760]  they love them all day on the news no they hate you the cowards that run things absolutely hate
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.280]  men and women that were willing to put their life on the line they hate honorable people
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.800]  even if some of these wars were dishonorable the people were honorable and that's why they
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.760]  disarmed the troops whenever they're around them because they're total filth um i'd have to look
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.880]  into that but if you research there's been a lot of loose lawsuits over mk ultra mk nami
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:48.880]  i would just google lawyer wins case for secret testing on vets and then you'll see the hundreds
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:54.400]  of lawyers that have won cases for that and generally if you were tested on or messed with
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.960]  you will then find out that there was a whole group of other people that were and that you
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:05.200]  won't have to re-engineer or reverse engineer and investigate what happened to you you can
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.200]  then basically find out you're a cookie cutter that's one major weakness of the globalist
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:14.320]  is they it's one of their strengths too because people ignore it but if you know the weakness it
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:21.520]  can be exploited big time is it's all cookie cutter and they do all this stuff basically
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:27.760]  in set parameters because it's such a large-scale operation and so if you'll simply research
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:35.200]  the specifics and then research other cases like yours it'll be the same names nine times out of 10
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:42.800]  that did it to you but it's their religion to test things on good men and women and to hurt people
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:49.760]  it's their religion to cull the population they get off on it they love going to a shopping mall and
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.880]  seeing dying and sick kids everywhere and you know kids with chemotherapy bags on them and people

[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.160]  we're here monday through friday 11 a.m to 2 p.m central
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:42.080]  coming up the next hour after i continue with calls i'm going to get into something that was
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.920]  announced yesterday that i mentioned some but it should have covered more and it ties into a whole
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:53.600]  bunch of other key news i lost the cover sheet to this this original article out of the washington
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:59.680]  post foreign affairs journal where two years ago they said they were quote legalizing propaganda
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.640]  by the cia domestically against the american people there's the headline the u.s repeals
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.440]  propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans now obama has come out with an
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.320]  executive order saying they're going to have psychiatrists and psych warfare experts target
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.360]  us for our own good now the reason they're doing that is they're having to hide it in plain view
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:25.520]  because it's so illegal it's still illegal in the constitution bill of rights and common sense i
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:30.480]  don't care if they pass a law saying child molestation is legal next week it's still illegal
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:37.680]  because my heart says so common sense says so and their own people don't want to do this so
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:43.040]  they're putting it out in the news try to condition everyone and if you can we we did a news report
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:50.880]  two years ago it's actually in the article um pentagon promises to stop lying because of drugs
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.560]  in that produced piece we have a whole video for the pentagon there but there's a produced piece
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.720]  writers play clips where they promise to quote stop lying by being embedded in every news department
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:07.120]  in the country that's what this psych warfare takeover is i mean this is the next level remember
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:13.520]  in europe they arrest you if you criticize open borders or if you try to protest anything basically
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.680]  there it is drugs forces established establishment to admit culture of lies that video
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:33.600]  ties in to all of this it's a big deal i'm going to go to jameson in virginia and of course uh
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:41.920]  uh i lean in montana and then sue in michigan uh here in just a moment and then also in the
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:45.760]  next hour i haven't gotten to most of the clips from the debate yet but i will do that let's
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:52.080]  hurry on to jameson in virginia thanks for calling you're on the air hey how y'all doing good thank
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:59.760]  you i just wanted to say uh i really appreciate what you said to pierce morgan um i think you
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:06.560]  said what a lot of governors wanted to say 1776 will commence again if they come for our firearms
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:13.600]  and uh that's a beautiful rifle y'all are given uh well self you know rappeling off some uh
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:22.400]  domestic terrorists will love that um no and i i think a lot of people need to start looking
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:28.080]  at ted cruise and uh ran paul they're the only ones who really stand for the second amendment
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:37.520]  uh ben carson has supported a ban on assault rifles and so has um from yeah and uh and he
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:42.560]  does look like he has a possum on his head um but i'm going with ted cruise and ran paul and people
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:48.800]  need to get their heads out of their butts the second amendment is under attack daily and that's
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:54.400]  the most important thing if they get rid of our firearms it won't be america anymore well that's
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.200]  their plan and they're moving to do it but we're actually winning that fight and if we win one
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:02.960]  fight we win them all that's why they're so desperate god bless you believe me they're
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:07.200]  they're getting ready to stage or wind up some crazy to have some massacre then try to tell us
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.600]  collectively it's our guilt as if it's our fault that somebody else did something bad
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:17.200]  and look i'm not attacking trump for looking like he's a orangutan you know with weird red blonde
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:23.200]  hair uh across between an orangutan and one of those troll dolls the reason i say that is he made
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:29.040]  fun of rand paul and said he was goofy looking and ugly and i really don't think donald trump has
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.000]  any talk here i've never called him ugly i think he's goofy looking i don't care what somebody
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.880]  looks like it's how they act so if he wants to get in that sandbox let's talk about it he looks like
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:46.640]  a weirdo he looks like he has gcm he bleeds gray hair then turned it on calm today and he looks
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:54.640]  like a john orangutan for all of recorded history civilizations around the world praised the health

[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:30.000]  water barons and megabanks to take over world's water and this is uh basically humanitarian
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.960]  water rights are being used and they were used in Buenos Aires 1993 where they ushered in
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:43.520]  three times population and immigration russian water rights then they created high inflation
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:49.840]  and the corporate sued to recover costs and then the settlement was done on um them capturing
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:56.880]  water rights and this is why we're set up for qe to create inflation and tpp for the lawsuit to
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:04.000]  commit so humanitarian water rights are you know this is about meters going on houses um
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.440]  on absolutely i mean there's some real water problems there's some real overuse there's
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:15.200]  there's some waste but all that's tertiary that's side issue to the admission of the imf and world
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:21.280]  bank the globalist call it blue gold and they are artificially getting control of it worldwide
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:28.320]  they're turning it into a commodity uh and they are going to be jacking up prices absolutely
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:33.680]  massively uh putting meters on all your wells or even saying england doesn't have enough water yet
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:39.760]  when it's just full of water uh and the epa is making all the announcements it's a grab of resources
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:47.360]  artificially to create scarcity uh to end the industrial world as we know it correct and the
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:52.720]  other thing that they were going to do is um was the water meters but then they're going to create
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:59.440]  these infrastructure banks so they have private property and uh private profits in water and then
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:05.760]  the rest of absolutely they're all exempt they'll be the stewards of the water and then you will

[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:09.360]  conducting behavior experiments on u.s citizens you're at that right the new executive order
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:13.440]  commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the government wants them to do
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:17.520]  effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese

[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:53.440]  to be able to launch this next level we need a million dollars that sounds like a lot the

[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:40.320]  but advertising internet wise and in radios everyone knows is gone the economy is in a
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:44.960]  deep recession going into depression that's why the obama administration tells us it's all great

[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.680]  larry claimant is the guy that got the impeachment of clinton going larry claimant has engaged in
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:13.440]  hundreds of major coups against tyranny and he's one of the most demonized reviled hated people
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.960]  by the authoritarian left and controlled right wing in this country and we have the new headline
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:24.480]  out of the washington times judge allows claimant suit against the nsa to proceed he won a few years
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:30.240]  ago the ban on bulk data collection now we saw the headline that a court had overturned that but
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:37.680]  did they really he's a constitutional lawyer he can walk us through this today but then i want to
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.640]  get into the election what he predicted uh i remember 10 years ago i thought he'd gone a little
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:48.000]  too far i'm just admitting when i'm wrong they want to set up a caliphate to invade europe and the
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.440]  rest of the middle east and put radical islam in charge now we see that happening so larry claimant
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:58.240]  one of the most accurate smartest guys we've ever interviewed joins us to the bottom of the hour
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.560]  someone's trying to shut up and let him go over this latest nsa situation and the two other points
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:08.480]  i raised but it's a key for everyone to go to freedom watch usa.org and to spread the word
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:14.960]  about the website and to support what he's doing he's also a weekly columnist for wnd.com so larry
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:20.960]  thank you for joining us alex and thank you very much for that nice introduction i like your comment
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:26.400]  about the controlled right that's a great phrase you mean the establishment yes sir
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:32.240]  right yeah well there's so right they're wrong in any event uh let me tell you what's happened
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:37.920]  here alex you're absolutely right uh over almost three years ago we filed a lawsuit against the
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:45.040]  national security agency for getting all of our telephonic metadata our communications not just phone
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:52.160]  calls but our location uh every aspect of what we do uh is being monitored by this national security
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:57.280]  agency and of course we know that president obama is ahead of in effect the national security
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.960]  agency is an executive branch agency and that causes concern it would have caused us concern
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:08.080]  even when jurors w bush was doing similar things and i had filed suit way back went on on that too
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:14.240]  and we prevailed in the court we got a very courageous judge named richard j leon of the
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.400]  us district court for the district of columbia who stuck his neck out and there are very few
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:23.120]  judges in this country who will anymore mostly they roll over to the established left and the
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:30.480]  established right and he entered a preliminary injunction on december 16th 2013 against the nsa
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:35.600]  and against everyone that's dealing with it including obama it went up to the appellate court
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.880]  in washington and the justice department of course run by eric holder at the time
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:47.200]  that everything it could to delay the appeal judge leon deferred to the government he stayed
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:51.280]  the preliminary injunction until the appeal would be heard he anticipated it would be over
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:57.680]  in about six months but instead the appellate court sat on this for two years and issued an
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:04.800]  opinion several weeks ago saying that that we hadn't proved standing if this is what courts
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:10.400]  use when they want to try to sidestep issues that i wasn't really injured they didn't rule
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:17.120]  on the constitutional issues judge leon had made an unequivocal finding that what the nsa and obama
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:21.520]  and others were doing violated our fourth amendment they're just claiming you hadn't been harmed so you
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.640]  couldn't bring it in i mean a total cop out cop out because we know that they've gotten everybody's
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:31.520]  records just the very fact that they have them is harm in fact there's case law from the federal
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:35.680]  appellate court itself which says that when you violate the constitution you don't even have to
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:39.520]  prove harm it's well if i take your mail out of your mailbox it's a federal offense because i
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:45.760]  stole your private data right it doesn't even mean you have to open it so in this case uh they sent
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:51.760]  it back to leon and all and leon said to us he said look make a few changes in your original
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:57.920]  complaint they also said that maybe we didn't sue the right Verizon company we did and the
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:02.640]  government has had to admit that since but go ahead and get this other Verizon company Verizon
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:10.400]  business network services which uh the appellate court uses an excuse not to affirm the preliminary
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:15.680]  injunction of judge leon so he went out and we got a plaintiff with Verizon business services
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:20.480]  so we moved it out the whole issue as lawyer said and we're back in front of leon and leon says
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:26.640]  he's wants to move quickly he wants to enter a preliminary injunction he's basically telling
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.560]  the appellate court yeah i'll do what you say but i'm going to enter an injunction because i believe
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:37.760]  that every day there's a constitutional violation of americans rights is one day too much and we
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:43.440]  have an oral argument now set for october 8th just in a few weeks and i'm confident the judge will
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.560]  enter a new preliminary injunction and set a precedent that this kind of thing can't happen
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:54.960]  and what's really important here alex is that our so-called government and i emphasize so called
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:58.320]  because we really don't have a government they they're not our government they're the government
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:06.000]  of themselves of the establishment both republican and democrat that this cannot be permitted and
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:12.000]  this will set a precedent and judge leon will retain jurisdiction to monitor what they're
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.640]  doing he can haul them in anytime he wants to see if they're obeying the fourth amendment
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.760]  because without that court supervision the nsa will continue to do whatever it wants
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:28.160]  and it's not just the nsa they work with the cia and the cia contrary to what they've been telling
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:32.800]  people that they only operate overseas has been operating domestically too they all work together
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:40.480]  so we live in what judge leon found in his quarter of december 16th 2013 in an almost
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:47.280]  Orwellian state a big brother where they gather dirt on any of us and all of us we know that
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:52.560]  they're gathering dirt on judges on congressmen on senators probably have dirt on obama they
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.320]  probably blackmail him too and that's the irony they let obama do his black muslim thing okay he
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:04.880]  can go off and sign these ridiculous agreements that undercut israel in the united states he can
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:10.080]  walk around with his ring that says my only god is alex he can forget about persecution
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:15.200]  towards christians in the far east in the middle east because in fact he's muslim and you know
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:22.320]  tacitly or directly approves of it go do your thing but we're in control we the intelligence
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:27.280]  agencies of this country we call the ultimate shot and we're here for power and probably money
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.920]  and and that's what we face right now and it helps explain why chief justice john robert may have
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:41.840]  flipped on obama care uh because we know that they have his data and perhaps they blackmailed him
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:47.680]  and if they can blackmail him they can blackmail any of us and it keeps us from fighting back so
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:52.880]  this is the kind of world that we live in and that's why i made reference to your uh
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:58.400]  you know the right i forgot the exact phrase that you used is the controlled right i mean
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.440]  that's they're intimidated they're dominated they are lap dogs of the democrats right and
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:07.680]  that's why trump is doing so well because all these people can get up on the stage
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:13.360]  they can say whatever they want but in the end they don't do anything because they're controlled
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:18.400]  and maybe trump's out there maybe he's insulting people i don't approve of that you don't either
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:23.520]  i'm sure but they figure hey what do we have to lose freedom is just another word for nothing
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.480]  left to lose says john that janice joplin it is insane you're a smart constitutional lawyer
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:32.160]  you've operated the highest levels you've gotten the president you in peace in the house not in
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.880]  the senate you've got him indicted in the house i mean it seems like i've studied history people
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:41.600]  didn't used to be this reckless in the power structure i'm not even lionizing them it seems
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:46.320]  like the establishment doesn't realize when they get rid of checks and balances they get rid of their
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:52.960]  own protections they're burning down our own house why would the elite want to bring into
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:59.200]  talitarianism when historically it's the most dangerous for the establishment in the midterm
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:07.200]  that's right here's the irony here is that the left is more in favor of curtailing the nsa
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:15.840]  than the right okay you saw mitch mcconnell you saw lindsey graham you saw john mccain senators
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:22.640]  you see congressman peter king all republicans and others saying the nsa is great best things
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:27.920]  since sliced bread let them spy on all of us because they're protecting us against terrorism well
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:32.560]  you know what judge leon found they hadn't stopped one terrorist attack with their so-called
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:38.160]  surveillance programs look at what's happening in europe right now we're 14 years after 9 11
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:43.360]  and now they admit one out of 20 people is a jihadi they're bragging about it you're a smart
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:49.520]  guy have a lot of contacts what is this uh obama backing isis backing al-qaeda in syria
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:53.840]  50 intelligence operatives have gone public the former head of defense intelligence the general
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:58.560]  goes public says we were ordered to do this the deputy head of the cia comes out says there
[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:03.360]  should be an investigation is that not a good sign that the pentagon does not want to back
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:11.360]  saudi arabia and al-qaeda in their takeover of the middle east i think it's a sign that the pentagon
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:17.760]  and references been made recently to this has bowed down to obama just like obama bowed down
[02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:25.680]  to the saudi king is that regrettably our military in their exception uh is run by yes men that's
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.400]  the way you get to be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of staff you don't ruffle feathers and
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:35.600]  in our history when generals have done that like general macarthur with the korean war when he wanted
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:40.400]  to take care of china or general patin when he wanted to get rid of the sylvia union when we
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:44.880]  had an opportunity after world war two they've been fired they've been shown the door so who
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:50.960]  runs our military yes men so if the president does not have our interest at heart they're not
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:56.400]  going to go against him you know maybe obama is pushing to another point to maybe someday they will
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:01.920]  uh wage a coup in this country i'm not advocating that but i know that some of these retired generals
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:09.200]  and admirals have talked about it i know that it's been in the public domain because obama
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:14.960]  and i'll say it straight up because no one else will you will obama is a muslim through and through
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:22.000]  obama sympathizes with a muslim caliphate obama simplifies simplifies with the mullahs in tehran
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:27.600]  he sympathizes with the radicals in the far east and that's why he never holds any of them
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:33.120]  accountable he doesn't sympathize with christians and jews he sympathizes with his own people and
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:39.280]  that's why these things are happening and it's time that someone called it like it is and that's why
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:42.880]  you know alex a couple years ago i was in front of the world war two memorial and i was
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:49.200]  saying tongue in cheek okay it was it was a satire but it rang true and it ranks
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:54.880]  rang it rings true now more than ever i said president obama get up off your knees put the
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:01.120]  koran down and come out with your hands up he is not for christians and jews he's for muslims
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:06.320]  and that's why you listen to these people on the stage yesterday none of them absolutely none
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:11.600]  will confront this issue he's not incompetent it's not that he doesn't know what he's doing
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:16.880]  it's not that he's weak he is furthering a muslim caliphate those are his people well
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:21.200]  larry i would hear you because you've been on the show for 16 17 18 years i mean i remember
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:26.240]  having you on like a 1996 and stuff when you were really going after the clintons so i guess 20 years
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:30.960]  years but i would hear you and i respected you and i'd hear you on glenbeck six seven years
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:35.440]  ago i would hear you'd come on here you'd go off into caliphates they're going to take over europe
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:39.600]  this plan that and i'd go come on that's his llamaphobic not all the muslims are radical
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:43.760]  and i've had to say on air one of the few things i've been wrong about is when you started saying
[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:48.480]  he was a secret radical muslim and plan this takeover when i look at what he's doing with our
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:53.120]  allies throwing him out in egypt and putting in all the radicals and and and and what's happening
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:57.520]  in syria and everywhere and then his cousin odinga and the funding of the muslim brotherhood
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:03.760]  i look at it none of it's good for american interest none of it's good for anybody's interest
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:10.880]  not even muslim's interest he really is backing head chopping loons and he went and they said when
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:15.840]  he spoke in chiro when he's first in office that the muslims were freaked out he spoke better than a
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:23.120]  name than a a priest you know you know better than a scribe better than um a religious leader
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:29.280]  and i i guess to look at it that might be the case how does he how do you think then since i
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:34.480]  guess you're being proven right what does he want to pull off i mean what's the end game to become
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:40.880]  the mati or something yes not funny uh let me back up a little bit somebody sent me a video
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:47.760]  recently uh muslim about obama in his own words you know both think that he's a muslim it's on
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:55.120]  our website freedomwatchusa.org freedomwatchusa.org they can see about our nsa case and everything
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:01.680]  else there too yes he he wants to bring the united states down to his knees he admired his father
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:06.960]  his father was muslim his father was thrown out of this country because he overstayed his student
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:14.560]  visa much like many muslims are doing these days and others and obama in his heart has disdain
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:20.320]  but he's very smart because he pulled a number overall all of us he defrauded us i don't believe
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.360]  that he's a natural born citizen to be president united states he told everybody's a christian he's
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:33.360]  not and actions speak louder than words and yes i do believe in his heart uh he would like to see
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:38.080]  the world run by muslims because that is what islam teaches okay now not all muslims are bad
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:43.040]  people there's some good muslims they're no longer muslims they quit okay they saw what was wrong
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:51.280]  with it but in my own view is it anybody who practices the tenets of the holy quran as obama
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:58.000]  always calls it never the quran the holy quran anybody who practices that is a danger because
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.200]  islam teaches that you have to get rid of the infidels and who are the infidels christians and
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:08.560]  jews and others hindus others look the indians don't get along with the muslims either because the
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:15.360]  muslims would like to eliminate the hindus as well that's their religion so the holy quran and the
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:23.440]  words of of obama uh he's furthering what a la teaches that's my view well the proofs of the
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:27.440]  pudding it's happening regardless and they're telling german women don't wear short skirts
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:31.520]  it offends the migrants that are invading and running around screaming and then saudi arabia
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:36.800]  won't take one of them uh it's just absolutely insane to see this happening and i wonder what's
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:42.000]  next i mean look at the white house and george soros connected to kill the cop movement they're
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.520]  actually trying to start a shooting revolution in this country larry well absolutely and you know
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:55.040]  who's behind that too lewis farrakhan who is lewis farrakhan a friend of of barak and michelle obama
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:01.840]  from chicago head of the nation of islam someone who has called jews pigs gutter religion
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:09.120]  uh has advocated recently just the last few years ago killing cops and killing white
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:15.120]  and by extension killing jews because farrakhan hates jews okay and there's some jewish cops
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:21.360]  so you can get a twofer if you'd like so this is this is what we're dealing with you know you
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:26.560]  are who you associate with alex and obama has associated with these people and brought them in
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:32.800]  throughout his lifetime but he was smart enough and smooth enough that he could pull the wool over
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:39.520]  the not uh educated american electorate sure well i mean i'll say this i mean i like yeah let me
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.160]  finish this thought i'm not quating him with hitler okay nobody's in that league but that's what hitler
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:50.160]  did in world war two germany was on its knees it was dying economically the germans had a
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:55.760]  predilection for someone like hitler in any event but he convinced them that he could bring them out
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:03.120]  of their situation and obama did the same and now you know six and a half years later uh you know we
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:08.240]  have someone like this who's destroying this country and and the republicans sit there playing
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:13.920]  political games and that's why republicans true republicans are mad at their own people because
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:18.160]  the banners and mcconnells of the world roll over to him obama's won every victory with them
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:23.280]  they're totally defeated they're a bunch of losers and and that's why trump is uh is surging and he'll
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:29.680]  continue to search despite his uh performance last night in the debate do you think trump's for real
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.560]  i don't know if he's for real or not but people are willing to grasp it straws right now like
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:43.680]  they're willing to grasp it hitler because we have no choice i don't think uh i think donald trump is
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:49.120]  a good man i think he's probably uncontrolled in his mouth okay but he's not a traitor to this
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.160]  country i think he wants to make this country great again i believe that and i think he's saying a
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:58.400]  lot of things that's resonating now i tend to agree with you when people are desperate people are
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:02.720]  desperate for someone who actually do something well that's my final statement i don't see how
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:07.600]  the establishment in and obama thinks they're gonna start a civil war with gun owners and veterans
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:11.440]  and people they're gonna kick our butts i mean all the folks want to start some shooting war and kill
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.680]  all the cops and people i got my problems with the police state you're gonna get your butt kicked i
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:20.080]  mean haven't they looked at the numbers of demographics that they're not gonna win this civil war larry
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:27.120]  claiming well they have the nsa so far they have the military so far they have the police an analogy
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:30.640]  i use alex is it i tell you what there's five more minutes with us i know you got to go but
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:34.400]  we're gonna go to break come back finish up your analogy complete this thought yeah complete that
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.800]  thought freedom watch usa.org and again i respect larry claiming i've said every time he's on him
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:43.680]  he's been on for like 19 years i disagree with him on this whole muslim thing and i'm sorry
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:51.120]  it's just all coming true folks i mean it's just crazy we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.800]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:04.000]  kid daniels info wars dot com do you ever wonder how the current migrant crisis is going to affect
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.320]  europe in america a decade from now if government's keeping it at welfare well sweden has been
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:12.720]  accepting a lot of immigrants for the past 15 years and now 58 percent of the country's welfare
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:17.520]  payments go to migrants the majority of violent crimes in sweden are committed by first or second

[02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:44.800]  soros media matters they're all trying to start a race war they're all trying to make every issue
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:53.200]  about the cops using a few bad examples it's just so classically communist so classically gutter
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:59.520]  so classically evil and they're really trying it i mean i and but it seems like
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:03.680]  because they have the media and everything ready they might actually arrest people that
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:08.720]  are against killing cops soon i mean how crazy is this going to get larry claiming well here's
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:13.040]  how bad it is and this was the thought i wanted to finish up and i hope that our friends did
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:19.200]  it right wing watch and people for the american way and the southern poverty law center are listening
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:26.000]  okay because you know here it is guys and you know bend over okay the reality is this is that
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:32.880]  with an nsa and with a cia they can gather all of our information if they had existed and if
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:39.120]  king george the third had had access to them in the days of the revolution our founding fathers
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:44.720]  would have never made it to philadelphia they would have been picked up arrested jailed and
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:49.280]  executed before they got there to sign the declaration of independence and these lefties
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:55.040]  who are now in control of our government know that and they know that and they've intimidated us
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:59.840]  and they're getting people scared so we won't rise up anymore and i don't advocate violence i
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:06.960]  advocate non-violence a la martin luther king a la mahatma gandhi uh but we've got to start
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:11.840]  doing something i had to try to do a rally a few years ago and we only had 300 people show up
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:17.840]  because people are scared uh but we've got to rise up because the country is going down the drain
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:25.200]  no one in washington is able or willing to take on obama he's won every battle and yes the george
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:31.360]  soros is behind obama he is a communist i mean soros is a guy he's jewish he's he turned in his
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:38.480]  his own people at at death camps uh he and his father and profited by it uh and you've got the
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:45.920]  faricons in the world and the and the reverend right and the other anti-semitic anti-white
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:53.600]  christian people out there trying to destroy the world and no one's lifting a hand and the american
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:57.840]  people need to rise up and and that's what we're faced with right now and even the cops the cops
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:03.440]  say and this is pathetic because you know we need to protect everybody whether you're black white
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:08.240]  yellow or whatever the cops are saying hey i'm not going to intervene in these things in the
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:11.840]  ghettos anymore let them kill each other and we'll just clean up afterwards because we're
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:17.920]  going to get blamed for violating civil rights and we're going to get retaliated against we'll lose
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:23.200]  our job our family will be out in the cold so what's the end point is the blacks are killing each other
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.720]  and in in record numbers more than ever and no one can step in that's right crime in um
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.240]  just one area of maryland after that whole event it tripled there in baltimore over a few months
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:40.000]  because the police started slow rolling and it's just it's just unbelievable in closing i'll say
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:47.520]  this is a ray of light and hope yes folks know the nsa is there to track and trace and frame people
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:53.920]  and the rest of it but we also have the internet to use it to organize folks and i see people across
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:59.520]  the board really waking up right now saying no to the tyranny saying no to the intimidation
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.800]  and really understanding what's happening and i think they've jumped the shark uh at the obama
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:09.200]  administration saying the veterans are the number one enemy and they're going to restrict guns of
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:16.960]  social security owners our social security retirees who are gun owners i think there's a
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.320]  point where people get out of fear and then get into fight mode i just hope they fight the right
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:28.960]  way and direct their energy the right way because uh even though the establishment hates the system
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:34.640]  that made this country so great it's very hard to turn off something this vibrant and they've
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:41.040]  tried to do it larry claiming a freedom watch usa.org uh but it's gonna be a lot tougher than they
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:48.640]  think you know there's that off-quoted passage the best laid plans of mice and men often go
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:54.800]  awry or array and i think that's what we see happen you're right alex i frequently say this
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:00.320]  you know i'm a child of this generation of chris christopherson who wrote the songs of janice
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:06.080]  joplin who sung it freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose at this point
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:12.160]  we have nothing left to lose and doesn't that make it stronger that they push us to this point it
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:17.360]  does they push us this point they have but i want to see it done in a nonviolent way and we need to
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:23.360]  rise up in the streets uh ghandi brought india and south africa to its knees martin luther king
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.440]  when you listen to his speeches i mean it's like listening to reagan even though you know he had
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:34.080]  communist leanings he was not a racist uh he respected all people and right now what we've
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:39.760]  got leading the so-called civil rights movement uh are people who don't and frankly the most courageous
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:44.640]  people in this country are the african-american black conservatives people like sheriff david
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:49.760]  clark out there in milwaukee yeah he's a great guy imagine having him as president allen keys
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:54.800]  ben carson i mean they're being blunt okay they're saying it's straight up it's the white people who
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:59.440]  are cowering in in caves right now and they need to come out and we all need to work together
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:03.840]  rather uh because we have to have a country which where everybody's treated equally and
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:08.160]  fairly and we've got to have a country which is based on freedom and capitalism and the ability
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:14.880]  to move ahead uh without getting into a communist state which is what obama and soros and the rest
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:20.480]  of them want uh larry claiming always powerful interview great job of the nsa and the fact that
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:25.280]  your fight continues about another victory the media spun us a defeat uh as they always do to
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:30.400]  take our hope away but we know that hope springs eternal god bless you god bless you alex thank you
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:36.160]  there he goes folks um we live in very epic times and they want to play muslims off against christians
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:41.360]  and vice versa i know that most muslims do not want to have wars you don't want to kill people but
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:47.280]  our government's run by criminals that make money out of crisis and they are funding radical muslims
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.160]  to take over and do horrible things across the middle east north africa and other areas central
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:57.120]  asia and i stand against that and i just want people to live in peace you know i had read
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.560]  about this letter in a time life article when i was a little kid but this weekend i was online
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:08.000]  doing research on some world war two events and i came across the handwritten letter in 1940
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.240]  it's actually mailed in late 1939 to add off hitler seeking peace or someone will quote beat
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:19.600]  you with your own weapon and it's an admitted letter from mahatma ghandi who was not a big
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:26.080]  fan of england uh and a lot of other things you have to understand hitler was seen as a good guy
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:31.920]  he'd been in like you know time magazine at the time but ghandi sent him the letter and i read it
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:41.680]  and he said listen uh you will basically end up losing this and the weapons you're going to use
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:47.360]  will end up being used against you uh and he basically pair in fact scroll down i'll reach
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:53.680]  the whole letter here's the full version of the letter uh which is uh the longer of ghandi's two
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:57.360]  letters to hitler and i've read two of them let me see which one this is they found i told them to
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:08.080]  search for it that i address you as a friend is normality i own no foes my business in life has
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:14.160]  been for the past 33 years to enlist the friendship of the whole of humanity by befriending mankind
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:21.440]  irrespective of race color creed i hope you will have the time and the desire to know how
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:26.880]  good portion of humanity owes a viewing living under the influence of the doctrine of universal
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:34.560]  friendship view your action we have no doubt about your bravery devotion to your fatherland
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:41.280]  nor do we believe that you are the monster described by your opponents but your own writings
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:47.680]  and pronouncements and those of your friends and admirers leave no room for doubt that many of your
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:54.080]  acts are monstrous and unbecoming of humanity and dignity especially estimation of men like me who
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:01.360]  believe in universal friendliness such are your humiliation of the Czechoslovakia the rape of
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:07.040]  poland and the swallowing of denmark this is the second letter the first one is probably even
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:13.280]  the more important one i am aware that your view of life regards such sponsor nations
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:22.160]  as virtuous acts but we have been taught by from childhood to regard them as acts degrading humanity
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:30.000]  hence we cannot possibly wish success to your arms and then it just goes on to warn him that he will
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:37.440]  be defeated in fact i should do a whole video on these and i'll do that but the first letter
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:46.240]  is a lot friendlier before he starts world war two and you look back and you see how hitler got
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:53.440]  20 plus million germans killed and i just want to say to the establishment today
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.960]  you're not going to get away with what you're doing i know you think the whole world's yours
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:03.120]  you've got this possession this drive for global domination it's not going to happen
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:09.680]  people are going to rally against you people are going to fight you people are going to say no
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:15.520]  people are going to resist and no matter how sophisticated or high-tech your systems are
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:23.840]  you will fail now you may succeed in turning the world very evil you may bring in a great
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:30.880]  technocracy but you yourselves the facts have shown and my gut tells me will be destroyed
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:36.880]  you and your children that are creating this world government will never share in the perceived
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:44.480]  benefits that you've been promoting to your own minions and that's my only warning to you is that
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:54.240]  you need to turn back you turn back down we're not offensively attacking anybody we are
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:00.960]  offensively with information trying to stop violence stop war stop oppression stop the
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:07.680]  promotion of racism stop the promotion of civil war stop the promotion of police brutality stop
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:14.560]  the promotion of the full spectrum that the globalists use like a palette of paint to create
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:24.480]  this monstrous masterpiece that they've almost completed yeah they did find the earlier letter
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:29.440]  that i'll go to your phone calls it's just hard to read in that format but this is matt migami the
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.360]  hitler friends have urged me to write to you for the sake of humanity but i have resisted their
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:42.560]  request because of the feeling that any letter from me would be an impertence something tells me
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:50.080]  that i must not calculate that i must make my appeal for whatever it may be worth it is quite
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:55.440]  clear that you are today the one person in the world think of that who could stop world war two
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:59.840]  who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to a savage state
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:09.680]  must you pay the price for an object however worthy it may appear to you to be will you
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:17.680]  listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately shunned the method of war not without considerable
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:28.480]  success anyway i anticipate your forgiveness if i have erred in writing to you but to me
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:35.520]  the letter is so powerful because this is a guy that freed 500 million people by simply saying
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:41.440]  we're not going to pay taxes british taxes on salt we're going to walk to the ocean and
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:48.080]  collect it ourselves it's our country and that's where bundy ranch and things like that come in
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:53.920]  when we refuse to pay taxes because they're unjust our governments illegitimate when we refuse to
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:46:00.640]  submit that's the real act of war when we speak out that's the act of war when we say no that's
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:06.080]  the act of war when you a good person becomes a police officer and upholds their oath and
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:12.400]  defends good officers exposes bad officers that's real war when you have children in a world this
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:19.760]  dangerous and raise them up right that's a war then yes gondy wrote a lot about violence he was
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.040]  against offensive violence he was not against defensive if someone came to kill you he was
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:28.720]  all for the second amendment he defended the second amendment because the american left
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:32.160]  tried to get him to attack it he wrote letters saying no it's a great thing
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:40.880]  he was a very intelligent person undoubtedly but imagine if hitler would have listened
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:48.080]  how the world would have changed hitler had a peace treaty with england secretly hitler who
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:53.120]  thought he was going to be allowed to take over all these areas hitler who was set up believed he
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:47:00.080]  was invincible believed he had the deals done believed his agents and his operatives inside
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:06.480]  all these different organizations were unstoppable that he'd infiltrated america and russia and
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:14.960]  england well hitler you found out that in the final equation you were given france you were given
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:22.880]  poland you were given czechoslovakia you were given what was left of the hungarian empire austria
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:39.440]  and so hitler is now known for crippling germany hitler is now known for bringing in
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.800]  the new version of planetary tyranny that adopted all of his stratagems
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:52.320]  and i see weak people who admire hitler because of his snappy cugoboss uniforms
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:48:01.520]  and i feel so sad for them because the people that admire hitler weren't there when over a
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:07.680]  million germans were drowned in the subways by hitler as an act of punishment because they'd
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:13.520]  failed him at all hitler was an enemy of the german people
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:21.120]  let's go to eileen in montana eileen you're on the air go ahead
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:27.120]  hey elix i hope it's this expansion and you'll reach that you start distributing some real
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:31.520]  environmental info information and be the sustainable solution you say the world needs
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:35.440]  well there's big problems there's real environmental problems and i totally agree with
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:38.640]  you they've got all these counterfeit ones they push all day give me an example of some of the
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:44.240]  real environmental crises well um not just the crises but the solutions you know you're not
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:49.520]  about global warming but you're about sustainable and i have this this sustainable agenda that the
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:56.960]  world needs that everybody screaming for a solution has not allowed since 1994 including gore even though
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.960]  well i mean they have counterfeit sustainability that just means give the globalist control
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:05.600]  over all the resources and restrict everyone else and then put carbon taxes on everything
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:12.320]  instead of restricting gmo toxic waste dumping uh stuff like that instead of not producing
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:18.320]  carbon carbon emissions you know because one if you end global environmental illiteracy
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:23.280]  99 point everybody is environmentally illiterate they don't even know what the environment is
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:28.480]  and they don't know how their actions affect it i will end global environmental illiteracy
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:35.200]  two are disposable society that is the biggest abuse that emits carbon emissions no i agree
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:41.360]  that we've gotten to we are wasteful that the the the disposable society creates disposable humans
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:47.360]  disposable animals uh i don't like it either but the modern movement has a lot of trappings that
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:53.360]  sound good at the end of the day it's meant to sell you on the larger purchase of world government

[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:24.160]  little wrap up with the uh the debate last night obviously the people are kind of surprised at
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:30.880]  what has happened and of course just the puppet show people loved our commentary so we i think
[03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:36.800]  we're gonna kind of recap the best of i didn't even get to see bigs last night i passed out so
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:41.200]  apparently it was pretty sensational but it wasn't because there were tubs of liquor
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:48.800]  and midget swigging from chandeliers or anything all right we'll be back with ping pong that there
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:54.960]  was some ping pong the one the only system we're not as cool as we wish we were leon macadoon
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:05:03.040]  is co-hosting your phone calls for it kit daniels info wars dot com president obama has ordered the
[03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:08.000]  federal government to start conducting behavior experiments on us citizens you're at that right
[03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:12.000]  the new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the
[03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:16.080]  government wants them to do effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze
[03:05:16.080 --> 03:05:20.960]  for a piece of cheese the feds are going to start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage
[03:05:20.960 --> 03:05:25.840]  meaning brainwash people to say signing up for obama care or even turning into their guns at a
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:30.800]  local gun buyback program so basically the obama administration wants to take the freedom of choice
[03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:34.560]  away from the individual and give it to the government that doesn't sound like freedom now
[03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:38.400]  does it freedom is the right of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their
[03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:42.880]  conduct doesn't infringe on the rights of others to do the same the obama administration however

[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:44.960]  tell you a long time viewer and a long time supporter of info wars life products thank you
[03:25:44.960 --> 03:25:50.480]  can't say enough about it everybody get in on that it will help you okay getting down to it
[03:25:50.480 --> 03:25:56.480]  i want to tell you alex uh you and i are simpatico on about 99 percent of just about everything that
[03:25:56.480 --> 03:26:02.240]  you talk about so excuse me viewers and listeners for that but what are we not in conjunctive orbit
[03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:10.400]  about it's possible that uh i may be misconstruing your position on religion i know you're a believer
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:17.120]  in god and of course jesus you make that perfectly clear and that's cool but uh from what you were
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:23.360]  saying about an hour ago actually it's a little more than that now you were saying my my inference
[03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:29.760]  from what you were saying was that if somebody wasn't in tune with jesus that they couldn't
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:36.160]  possibly conceive of the evil of the globalists and all the horror that's going on in the world
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:41.680]  and possibly stand no what i was saying is is that i think people wake up to the evil in the world
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:47.280]  that's going to get them closer to god that's what i was saying okay that's cool too however
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:54.480]  i've been up to the evil in the world for over 20 years and it hasn't really brought me closer to
[03:26:54.480 --> 03:27:01.440]  god it has brought me maybe closer to a spirituality and a love for my fellow man and the animals we
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:08.480]  share the world with but it hasn't brought me any closer to jesus and i fancy myself like i said 99
[03:27:08.480 --> 03:27:16.400]  percent on the same page as you and i wouldn't want us to alienate the 22 percent of the population
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:23.120]  that has either no religious affiliation or are active listen i'm not judging anybody and i don't
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:27.360]  think somebody that doesn't believe in god because they don't see the proof as a bad person the people
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:33.040]  running the show though are into the occult and they know what they're doing and i'm ranting and
[03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:37.280]  raving for three four hours up here trying to cover this stuff trying to be honest so i don't
[03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:41.840]  try to hurt anybody's feelings as long as somebody didn't hurt somebody else i'm not you know out to
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:47.360]  get them uh so that's what i was getting at is that i don't push religion on people but a lot
[03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:52.960]  of people end up waking up and and and seeing that there is spiritual forces out there just because
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:56.800]  of the issues we cover i think that's what i was getting at but god bless you time on good to hear
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:01.280]  from you thanks for holding leon maggity you got any comments on that i've heard a lot of people
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:06.800]  say that and i i do agree i mean i think you we got to have an open heart and we do need to see
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:10.880]  our you know our brothers and sisters out there we're all in this battle together and it is a
[03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:16.320]  spiritual battle if you believe it or not and when you expand on it i'm not criticizing all
[03:28:16.320 --> 03:28:20.720]  muslims a lot of them are nice people but the the more and more dominant element of islam is
[03:28:20.720 --> 03:28:26.320]  do what we say we'll chop your head off and i just don't think that's too liberal so i wonder why
[03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:32.960]  the liberals all seem to think it's so cool yeah well i mean they you can kind of see the hypocrisy
[03:28:32.960 --> 03:28:39.680]  there when they they didn't talk at all about the feminist that protested that one islamic talk where
[03:28:39.680 --> 03:28:46.720]  oh she shut up with the top off should we beat our wives that was the that was the the cruxed of the
[03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:51.840]  the talk there and i've got to go honey to a conference yeah should we beat our wives she
[03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:57.120]  once and for all well i can just tell them of course i'm joking i'm joking no you should put
[03:28:57.120 --> 03:29:01.920]  them in a meat grinder no i mean you know it's extremely oppressive it's like the sexual mutilation
[03:29:01.920 --> 03:29:06.480]  all of it you can argue well that isn't what islam states or whatever well it's what's going on
[03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:12.720]  well and it's like what isa says the very extreme version of that religion is the true version of
[03:29:12.720 --> 03:29:17.280]  the religion and so they have all these young people who are maybe trying to get closer to their
[03:29:17.280 --> 03:29:24.640]  god and so they're thinking they need to you know go to the extreme so and she said nobody makes me
[03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:31.200]  submit right and then she got kicked by the guide and they were like yes we can beat our wives and
[03:29:31.200 --> 03:29:36.800]  topless feminists and they kicked her and no none of the feminists stood up for her well no they just
[03:29:36.800 --> 03:29:43.040]  want to make babes take his pants off and wear a hula skirt and march in high heels yeah they make
[03:29:43.040 --> 03:29:47.680]  the military wear hot red high heels it's about dominating men so really they're like closet
[03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:51.440]  radical as long as we're on the march the femicists are basically just oppressive a lot of them are
[03:29:51.440 --> 03:29:55.600]  into women a lot of femicists want to dominate them that's what the men are always so they can like
[03:29:55.600 --> 03:30:01.040]  smack them around a little bit you know kind of have a duck's ass haircut get daniels info wars.com
[03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:05.520]  do you ever wonder how the current migrant crisis is going to affect europe in america a decade from
[03:30:05.520 --> 03:30:09.600]  now if governments keep handing out welfare well sweden has been accepting a lot of immigrants for
[03:30:09.600 --> 03:30:14.720]  the past 15 years and now 58 percent of the country's welfare payments go to migrants the majority of
[03:30:14.720 --> 03:30:19.520]  violent crimes in sweden are committed by first or second generation immigrants most of them refuse
[03:30:19.520 --> 03:30:24.080]  to assimilate into sweden's culture even more shocking nearly half the immigrants don't work
[03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:28.480]  and now sweden has the biggest employment gap in europe between natives and non-natives in other
[03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:33.120]  words native swedes are working their butts off to support an immigrant population who won't work
[03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:37.760]  and want to assimilate but will steal rape and murder simply put when the government offers free
[03:30:37.760 --> 03:30:41.600]  goodies and welfare to immigrants the country's only going to attract the worst kinds of people
[03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:46.000]  but what's going on in sweden is now going to happen in the united states this is the new america

[03:39:33.280 --> 03:39:36.080]  i don't know my gut it's all tied up and knots over that
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:41.600]  that we were talking about it earlier david night thinks trump's gonna get the trump and biden
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:46.800]  what do you think about that i just hope trump isn't suckering people along but you know just
[03:39:46.800 --> 03:39:51.120]  talking about vaccines being dangerous is good i appreciated that i liked that he did not back
[03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:55.440]  down and and even though he knew it wasn't going to be popular with everyone out there i i appreciated
[03:39:55.440 --> 03:40:00.960]  that i appreciated the arena calling out you know the planned parenthood supporters and
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:08.880]  saying i dare you to watch these videos and you know we'll see we'll see speaking of the debate
[03:40:08.880 --> 03:40:13.120]  leon i just want to say great job i'm going to go shoot some news for the nightly news coming up
[03:40:13.120 --> 03:40:16.400]  tonight get some stuff done you're going to finish up here the next 20 minutes and i think it's
[03:40:16.400 --> 03:40:20.720]  yard even first these callers but right now let's talk about the drug war while we switch seats
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:27.280]  with the gooch uh let's go ahead and go to bush 40 years ago i smoked mary giovanna here is that
[03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:33.360]  club governor christie recently said quote if you're getting high in colorado today where marijuana
[03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:39.760]  has been legalized enjoy it until january 2017 because i will enforce the federal laws against
[03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:44.720]  marijuana will you i think one of the great problems and one of the american people don't
[03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:50.080]  like about politics is hypocrisy people who have one standard for others and not for them for
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:55.120]  themselves there's at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot
[03:40:55.120 --> 03:41:00.400]  in high school and yet the people going to jail for this are poor people often african americans
[03:41:00.400 --> 03:41:06.560]  and often hispanics yet the rich kids who use drugs aren't i personally think that this is a crime
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.200]  for which the only victim is the individual and i think that america has to take a different
[03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:17.040]  attitude i'd like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration i'm a fan of the drug courts
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:22.400]  which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail but the bottom line is the states
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:27.120]  we say we like the tenth amendment until we start talking about this and i think the federal
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:33.040]  government's gone too far i think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome and really has
[03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:37.520]  been something that's really damaged our inner cities not only do the drugs damage them we damage
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:42.960]  them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time so i don't
[03:41:42.960 --> 03:41:47.280]  think that the federal government should override the states i believe in the tenth amendment and i
[03:41:47.280 --> 03:41:54.000]  really will say that the states are left to themselves i want to give that i want to give
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:41:58.240]  the person that you call the hypocrite an opportunity to respond do you want to identify that person
[03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:02.480]  well i think if we left it open we could see how many people smoked pot in high school
[03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:07.840]  is there somebody you were specifically thinking of well you know the thing is he was talking about
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:13.920]  me yeah i was talking about that's what i thought but i wanted to make it easier for him yeah and i
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:18.560]  just did governor bush please so 40 years ago i smoked marijuana uh and i admit it i'm sure
[03:42:18.560 --> 03:42:22.560]  that other people might have done it may not want to say it on front of 25 million people my mom's
[03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:32.800]  not happy that i just did that's true but here's the deal here's the deal we have we have a serious
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:37.520]  epidemic of drugs that goes way beyond marijuana what goes on in colorado as far as i'm concerned
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:42.720]  that should be a state decision but if you look at the problem of drugs in this in this society
[03:42:42.720 --> 03:42:46.880]  today it's a serious problem ran you know this because you're campaigning in new hampshire like
[03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:51.200]  all of us and you see the epidemic of heroin the overdoses of heroin that's taking place
[03:42:51.200 --> 03:42:57.040]  people's families are are being torn apart it is appropriate for the government to play a consistent
[03:42:57.040 --> 03:43:02.720]  role to be able to provide more treatment more prevention may we're the state that has the most
[03:43:02.720 --> 03:43:08.640]  drug courts across every circuit in in in florida their drug courts to give people a second chance
[03:43:08.640 --> 03:43:14.480]  that's the best way to do this but let me respond the thing is is that in florida governor bush
[03:43:14.480 --> 03:43:19.280]  campaign against medical marijuana that means that a small child like morgan hints that has
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:25.600]  500 seizures a day is failing on nine traditional medications is not allowed to use cannabis oil
[03:43:25.600 --> 03:43:29.680]  and that if they attempt to do that in florida they will take the child away they will put the
[03:43:29.680 --> 03:43:34.480]  parents in jail and that's what that means if you're against allowing people use medical marijuana
[03:43:34.480 --> 03:43:39.760]  you'll actually put them in jail and actually the current circumstances kids who had privilege like
[03:43:39.760 --> 03:43:44.800]  you do don't go to jail but the poor kids in our inner inner cities go to jail i don't think that's
[03:43:44.800 --> 03:43:49.760]  fair and i think that we need to acknowledge it and it is hypocritical to still want to put poor
[03:43:49.760 --> 03:43:54.000]  people in jail i don't want to put poor people in jail ran in my place here's the deal you oppose
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:58.160]  medical marijuana no i did not oppose when the legislature passed the bill to deal with that
[03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:03.440]  very issue that's the way to solve this problem medical marijuana on the ballot was opened up it
[03:44:03.440 --> 03:44:08.080]  was a there's a huge loophole it was the first step towards getting to a colorado place and as a
[03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:13.520]  citizen of florida i voted no welcome back to the alex jones show i'm anthony gucci already sitting
[03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:19.920]  in here with leon macadoo for alex jones and i want to tell you that you now have less than 20
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:25.520]  minutes to be part of history be part of history in the making with info wars operation money

[03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:38.800]  plus million people around the world with serious life changing information and the reason i'm such
[03:44:38.800 --> 03:44:44.800]  proponent of this is i know that alex doesn't take outside funding he doesn't take loans he doesn't
[03:44:44.800 --> 03:44:49.760]  get billions of dollars from government sources he funds all this himself and even with these
[03:44:49.760 --> 03:44:54.480]  products he only takes a small percentage of profit at the end of the day this is really a game
[03:44:54.480 --> 03:44:58.960]  changer it's a game changing event and you have less than 20 minutes about 15 minutes right now

[03:45:58.880 --> 03:46:03.840]  on this broadcast today and talk about this because i've seen alex go from saying hey let's
[03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:08.400]  launch a television station to actually having the satellite up in the air right now and you can go
[03:46:08.400 --> 03:46:13.280]  on info wars dot com forward slash money bomb and look at the stations look at the satellite
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:17.840]  information where he's already reaching across the united states and obviously has plans for
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:23.520]  six different stages to reach the entire globe now we also want to talk about some news and some
[03:46:23.520 --> 03:46:27.200]  other information for the remainder of this broadcast which again 15 minutes left for the
[03:46:27.200 --> 03:46:34.240]  info wars money bomb 2015 clip we just played is pretty telling of how fake people are and how fake
[03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:40.160]  all these politicians in general are like stick figures up there and i think trump correctly
[03:46:40.160 --> 03:46:44.000]  calls them clowns because that's how i would describe them as well they're entertainers
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:48.560]  to the audience of the united states of america who unfortunately is being drafted into their
[03:46:48.560 --> 03:46:55.840]  ideology of complete jokery and it reminds me also how in september this month coming up in late
[03:46:55.840 --> 03:47:01.760]  september the tpp is coming back and obama and other ministers are already pushing it and saying
[03:47:01.760 --> 03:47:06.880]  this time it's for real we're going to push every possible thing we can through and lianna i mean
[03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:11.680]  it just reminds us once again they're up there talking about marijuana oh my god jeb bush smoked
[03:47:11.680 --> 03:47:16.000]  marijuana one at one time yeah right like that's the worst thing he's ever done right as they push
[03:47:16.000 --> 03:47:20.720]  things like this in the real centerfold right past us and they don't mention that in the debates nope
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:25.600]  they want to know what people's secret service code name is going to be and who would they put on
[03:47:25.600 --> 03:47:29.200]  the ten dollar bill and things like that and then and that's you're exactly right they want to
[03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:35.040]  ram this through before the next guy comes in and keep us all distracted in the meantime with our
[03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:40.800]  entertainers well that's the name of the game it also reminds me of this new study here from the
[03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:45.120]  washington post that's being written about in the washington post new analysis shows suicide
[03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:50.080]  links for teen on teens on paxil mischief an old study claiming drug is safe so what happened was
[03:47:50.080 --> 03:47:58.080]  mischief about what was it 14 15 years ago they had a study that said paxil which is an
[03:47:58.080 --> 03:48:03.440]  antidepressant anti-anxiety type drug anti-psychotic it's totally safe everything's fine give it to
[03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:08.000]  your teenagers give it to your kids it'll help trust us you know it doesn't do anything wrong
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:11.280]  even though i personally know people that have something called vitiligo where which is the
[03:48:11.280 --> 03:48:14.880]  michael jackson syndrome where your skin turns completely white like a vampire from taking it
[03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:18.960]  but it's totally safe yeah it's just totally safe guys and then now they looked at it again
[03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:24.320]  15 16 years later and they found that that study the data that that study had was completely
[03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:29.120]  manipulated and the original data actually showed all the side effects that it had just
[03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:35.760]  like elia lily in 1988 or something like that said that uh prozac was safe but they admitted later on
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:39.520]  that the same data that they said it was safe actually proved that it was going to kill people
[03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:43.200]  and cause suicide so that's the only time anything like that's ever happened oh yeah and then the
[03:48:43.200 --> 03:48:48.560]  harvard uh doctor researcher came out and said that it was like the human population being treated
[03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:54.160]  like guinea pigs by lili lily it's the same thing over and over again so then why is it such a big
[03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:59.920]  deal for trump to say hey and keep in mind trump didn't even say vaccines are bad right that's the
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:04.640]  funny thing he didn't even say that he said maybe they should be spaced out a little bit better right
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:10.080]  oh my word how could he how could he say that so hey we're gonna take some calls we're actually
[03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:14.400]  gonna jump right into it we're gonna go to mark in florida he says he wants to talk about the
