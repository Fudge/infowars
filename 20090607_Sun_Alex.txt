[07:41.800 --> 07:53.760]  let it happen we are being conditioned we are being taught that it is okay to torture
[07:53.760 --> 07:58.680]  and to be tortured that it's okay for the government to spy on you without warrants
[07:58.680 --> 08:04.480]  that it's okay for police to wear black uniforms and masks that cameras and school rooms and
[08:04.480 --> 08:12.040]  on street corners are normal we are going from a state of incredible liberty and freedom
[08:12.040 --> 08:24.040]  and dynamic creativity into a rapidly evolving situation of total despotism and enslavement
[08:24.040 --> 08:31.640]  a lot of things happen this week that really brought into focus a lot of the research and
[08:31.640 --> 08:38.040]  stories I've been working on over the last 13 years and more and more when I come on
[08:38.040 --> 08:43.480]  the radio on the weekday show or the sunday evening abbreviated transmission from 4 to
[08:43.480 --> 08:50.520]  6 p.m. central standard time I realize that everything else I'm covering all the other
[08:50.520 --> 09:02.200]  important news stories like british and u.s. courts ruling that police can torture u.s.
[09:02.200 --> 09:07.080]  citizens yes it's publicly a torture u.s. citizens and non-terror related and it just
[09:07.080 --> 09:14.320]  is a footnote in the buffalo newspaper a footnote the london guardian and I have scores of such
[09:14.320 --> 09:18.640]  articles I have a stack of probably 30 40 articles here in front of me and they all
[09:18.640 --> 09:27.880]  pale in significance towards the root of all of this the mindset of all of this and that
[09:27.880 --> 09:42.920]  is eugenics so today I want to go over some of the latest developments concerning the
[09:42.920 --> 09:48.880]  global government that's openly been announced openly set up and it's openly stated goal
[09:48.880 --> 10:00.800]  of carrying out forced population reduction and the fact that the general public has been
[10:00.800 --> 10:09.720]  sold on going along with this bill of goods and that the general public even if you're
[10:09.720 --> 10:14.720]  immoral and believe that 80% of the public should be killed don't you understand you're
[10:14.720 --> 10:20.840]  going to be amongst that 80% you're not part of the elite I'm gonna go over the latest
[10:20.840 --> 10:27.040]  news and break this down and talk about the biggest secret which isn't really a secret
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.720]  anymore it's now being pushed it's being mainline it's being mainstreamed because they've built
[10:32.720 --> 10:41.520]  their world government now they're getting ready to go ahead with the end they got their
[10:41.520 --> 10:48.160]  means their world government but what is the means to the end they've got their system
[10:48.160 --> 10:53.160]  to carry this out what is it they want to carry out as they set up their world government
[10:53.160 --> 11:03.960]  and as they complete the final beta test of this and roll it out this technocratic terror
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.280]  as they launch this against humanity what is it they're launching I think that needs
[11:08.280 --> 11:13.360]  to be discussed instead of just getting caught up in kind of that eddie pool that groundhog
[11:13.360 --> 11:22.520]  day of arguing does the world government exist or is there a eugenics plan or you know the
[11:22.520 --> 11:27.720]  silly childlike games where it's all in thousands of white papers and even on the news but then
[11:27.720 --> 11:31.640]  when you criticize they play the psychological trick and say oh you're crazy that doesn't
[11:31.640 --> 11:42.680]  exist very very silly so we'll just bypass that mindless debate and get right to the
[11:42.680 --> 11:50.760]  facts that are in our face every single day now later in the show they can find it you
[11:50.760 --> 11:59.440]  guys find that promo I was talking about from that local Austin show because I was driving
[11:59.440 --> 12:07.640]  in to do my weekday show from 11 to 3 I get ready for my radio show at home and I drive
[12:07.640 --> 12:15.360]  into the office at about 1030 and I heard a local show which is I tune into because
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.540]  I'm on that station we do the Sunday show out of it news radio 590 lbj fine talk station
[12:20.540 --> 12:24.680]  award-winning and I even know both men that do the show I like the show it's it's very
[12:24.680 --> 12:33.080]  entertaining very very well done they're very talented and more often than not now lately
[12:33.080 --> 12:38.880]  when I tune in they make little jokes about me which I see is a friendly thing I mean
[12:38.880 --> 12:46.080]  they're even plugging president planet dot com but in just a 15 minutes driving from
[12:46.080 --> 12:56.000]  home to work I heard basically everything that frustrates me encapsulated everything
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.640]  that really makes me wake up with nightmares encapsulated because I want to warn the good
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.680]  people of this country and I know I'm right I know I have the documents and the legislation
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.800]  and the history and I've done the research but I also know it's it's so horrible that
[13:12.800 --> 13:23.320]  I talk about that I don't blame people for not believing me especially because I get
[13:23.320 --> 13:27.700]  wound up and it's upset about it but that's a catch 22 you're supposed to get upset about
[13:27.700 --> 13:32.160]  things like this so we'll play the clip when we come back and then get into the actual
[13:32.160 --> 13:38.240]  news but this is a real world microcosm of this the Austin police continue to shoot Hispanics
[13:38.240 --> 13:47.480]  and blacks in the back every few months in Austin and regardless of which side of that
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.920]  debate you're on it'll be a mentally retarded black man waving a stick at the cops and the
[13:52.920 --> 14:00.120]  cops shoot some 15 feet away clearly no reason to do that you know there's a successive force
[14:00.120 --> 14:03.400]  and you see the stories around the country of an autistic kid and he won't answer the
[14:03.400 --> 14:08.200]  cops so they shooting or they taser him and they fall down and get back up and scream
[14:08.200 --> 14:13.480]  for mommy it scares the cop they got him down regardless of which side of that debate you're
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.760]  on that's going on here in Austin and you know guys in the back of a car they both get
[14:18.760 --> 14:23.480]  shot the cops say we thought they were going for a gun there there was no gun but the media
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.360]  kind of leaves that out there and says where's the gun the media knows there's no gun they
[14:27.360 --> 14:30.960]  know that's in the police reports they know that's admitted it's just they just keep that
[14:30.960 --> 14:37.840]  debate going about was there a gun so so they don't have to say the cops are wrong cops said
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.240]  we thought he was going for a gun there was no gun they'd be all over the news showing
[14:41.240 --> 14:49.160]  you the gun and yeah this guy had been arrested for drugs a month before regardless that doesn't
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.240]  mean you can kill anybody who's out at night in a car and if you're going to get some blue
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.800]  bell ice cream at midnight you're gonna get killed next the issue here is this I'm not
[14:58.800 --> 15:05.160]  discussing the police not having their squad car videos on of course now they're having
[15:05.160 --> 15:10.600]  admit they actually did but they're not releasing it they're now starting to have to come out
[15:10.600 --> 15:14.160]  because that they're having trouble covering this up and they're now having to admit he
[15:14.160 --> 15:21.400]  didn't have a gun they're now now having to admit all this but it's not about all that
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.520]  that's not the issue a caller called in and said you know they treat the blacks and Hispanics
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.600]  on the east side of Austin Texas and they have these you know type north south east
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.440]  west all over the country the other side of the tracks you all have similar stories in
[15:35.440 --> 15:41.920]  your towns or cities that they treat them differently than they treat the wealthy areas
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.640]  you know in Miami where it's mainly Hispanic they treat the wealthy Hispanic areas differently
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.160]  than the poor Hispanic areas I think it's more of a money thing a class thing because
[15:52.160 --> 16:00.160]  the police treat people that they know can sue them a little bit better than those that
[16:00.160 --> 16:06.960]  they don't when we come back I know this is kind of a riddle so far I'm gonna I'm gonna
[16:06.960 --> 16:12.240]  break down this this this microcosm that illustrates everything is the caller called in and said
[16:12.240 --> 16:18.200]  this is basically a eugenics program blacks and Hispanics are expendable and the host
[16:18.200 --> 16:23.200]  made a joke going oh yeah prisonplanet.com then a lady calls in and says yeah let's kill
[16:23.200 --> 16:33.960]  all the Mexicans and she was serious stay with us I'll explain it millions of Americans

[20:39.560 --> 21:00.160]  great talk radio starts here yeah that's what we're doing trying to fight the new world
[21:00.160 --> 21:06.400]  order in this devilish system we're fighting the people that trained the Nazis the Nazis
[21:06.400 --> 21:15.880]  were a mere shadow of their mother kind of like Grindel is a mere shadow of his maker
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.840]  and who is the Beowulf to take them on that is you the people of this country in this
[21:21.840 --> 21:26.200]  world who have the dynamic human spirit made the image of God that is what is going to
[21:26.200 --> 21:32.000]  counter the new world order okay so I know about Margaret Sanger and the foundation of
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.720]  the modern US technological scientific complex the Rockefeller Foundation it's all public
[21:38.720 --> 21:45.600]  information about their plan to kill all blacks and to highly reduce anybody else of color
[21:45.600 --> 21:50.480]  and to kill off most whites that could compete with them that's their view and I'm going
[21:50.480 --> 21:56.520]  to go over the evidence of that coming up here today but the issue is I'm driving along
[21:56.520 --> 22:01.160]  and I hear about you know this big debate about rioting that even happened a few weeks
[22:01.160 --> 22:07.720]  ago when they shot these two black guys killing one asleep in the car rolled up no loud speaker
[22:07.720 --> 22:12.120]  no lights and yes it's police policy to turn the lights on and say you there on the car
[22:12.120 --> 22:16.640]  get out hands up or whatever the police think that it's suspicious and that's fine and dandy
[22:16.640 --> 22:21.040]  but that's not the debate here I'm driving along and I hear a caller go well they just
[22:21.040 --> 22:25.760]  don't care as much about blacks and Hispanics you know this is basically eugenics they just
[22:25.760 --> 22:30.520]  want to get rid of them and I think the host of the show rightfully got it that was probably
[22:30.520 --> 22:36.240]  one of my listeners and they said oh really oh prisonplanet.com yeah there's a plan to
[22:36.240 --> 22:42.200]  kill all the blacks and Hispanics and I'm okay very funny you know that's fine it doesn't
[22:42.200 --> 22:46.700]  bother me I mean I got a thick skin I've had rush Limbaugh attack me I've had big Democrats
[22:46.700 --> 22:52.120]  attack me I've had national TV attack me the New York Times and Bloomberg and LA Times
[22:52.120 --> 22:57.760]  attack me last week got thick skin it means I'm doing my job and plus I've shook both
[22:57.760 --> 23:01.760]  those guys hands before I've even worked with the priors brother nice guy they were just
[23:01.760 --> 23:07.400]  having fun it's a fun show but then what came up next is what upset me and they did counter
[23:07.400 --> 23:12.440]  this lady and that's good but see they were experiencing exactly what I'm talking about
[23:12.440 --> 23:21.760]  but that is in high places the attitude of this lady is exactly what runs the New World
[23:21.760 --> 23:27.920]  Order but she's a low-level minion who's being attacked by the very same eugenics program
[23:27.920 --> 23:33.040]  but she's got this arrogant up of the attitude of yeah go ahead and kill the Hispanics and
[23:33.040 --> 23:37.640]  blacks because they're all scum they're all basically drug addicts they all are gangbangers
[23:37.640 --> 23:45.080]  they deserve to die abort them before they're born now I almost called Friday when I heard
[23:45.080 --> 23:49.680]  this like as right as I'm getting out of the car I hear her call in before I go into my
[23:49.680 --> 23:55.400]  own show and I just said you know what I'm not going to worry about it and I did go on
[23:55.400 --> 23:59.880]  the show and and and you know mention it and cover some eugenics news but then I'm driving
[23:59.880 --> 24:06.680]  in to do the show today in these studios and I hear the promo of clips of the ladies saying
[24:06.680 --> 24:10.040]  it so I thought well this is perfect I'll just play the promo promo their show that
[24:10.040 --> 24:16.280]  battle you know kind of a win-win here and mention what this lady was saying see to them
[24:16.280 --> 24:21.760]  to the host of the local show who are nice guys it's so alien to think that people want
[24:21.760 --> 24:28.200]  to kill all the blacks and Mexicans and Hispanics because they're not psychopathic killers they're
[24:28.200 --> 24:33.640]  nice guys that run in marathons and have families and you know are funny guys well see guys
[24:33.640 --> 24:37.360]  you got to grow up you got to look into what I'm saying before you dismiss it because when
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.320]  I'm saying it's so hardcore and shocking I don't blame you for not wanting to believe
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.400]  it but you better understand that I have the evidence and I'm telling you the truth and
[24:46.400 --> 24:50.800]  that goes for everybody else out there that can't believe what I'm covering when I'm saying
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.480]  look just take the challenge the taster's choice the Pepsi challenge whatever you want
[24:55.480 --> 25:01.720]  to call it take the challenge look into eugenics look into eugenics Margaret singer Hitler
[25:01.720 --> 25:10.280]  Google them or IBM eugenics Hitler or Microsoft eugenics and prepare yourself it's all them
[25:10.280 --> 25:20.920]  saying it it's not me you understand now let's go ahead and play this clip here it is I highly
[25:20.920 --> 25:26.120]  doubt that they're targeting the east side or the Mexican community but I kind of think
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.800]  it's a good thing if they did the Todd and Don show weekday mornings at 10 it takes care
[25:30.800 --> 25:35.920]  of those dams of that are running around with guns pointing on that the cops and then our
[25:35.920 --> 25:40.600]  chicken city council gives them money let them abort those kids that's one last game
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.720]  member we have to worry about one last illegal they drop in a bay the Todd and Don show weekday
[25:45.720 --> 25:54.320]  mornings at 10 on news radio 590 KLBJ now I've covered that now this is only the news
[25:54.320 --> 26:00.920]  that I printed in five minutes right before showtime I decided to go ahead and go in this
[26:00.920 --> 26:05.880]  direction because it's driving and heard that promo and I just printed these in five minutes
[26:05.880 --> 26:11.080]  that means I searched the articles and printed them I have like eight of them here how do
[26:11.080 --> 26:22.240]  these tie together bad CPS bill deserves a good veto this article reports and I've got
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.680]  the bill here SB 1064 this is in Texas again but it's happening all over the country because
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.080]  the globalists internationally write these bills and their lobbies pass them locally
[26:31.080 --> 26:34.640]  that CPS no longer needs a warrant probable cause anything they can just come steal your
[26:34.640 --> 26:39.280]  kids without even telling you or a judge or anybody before they would get these fake little
[26:39.280 --> 26:46.720]  family court things swore out by these judges that on CNN they report get campaign donations
[26:46.720 --> 26:53.200]  from the child kidnapping foundations that sell these kids out for 200,000 300,000 400,000
[26:53.200 --> 26:57.600]  500,000 sometimes for a blonde hair blue-eyed kid and I had a senator on a few weeks ago
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.720]  reporting about how they have public bounties in Georgia for blonde hair blue-eyed kids
[27:02.720 --> 27:08.080]  this is on record they literally go out find an excuse find the bruise on the first grade
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.400]  blonde hair blue-eyed girls leg because some rich family in Connecticut wants them and
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.880]  in a couple weeks she she's there mommy and daddy don't get her and how does that tie
[27:17.880 --> 27:24.640]  into this listen to this Obama's elite agenda black abortion for profit that's out of a
[27:24.640 --> 27:30.760]  whole bunch of mainstream news we'll go over that another site clan parenthood remember
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.560]  last year it came out that people would call up plan parenthoods and say yeah I want to
[27:34.560 --> 27:38.360]  donate money to abort just black babies and they start getting excited going oh yeah that's
[27:38.360 --> 27:41.800]  what we're here for oh yeah and this week I'm gonna go get all those clips again I'm
[27:41.800 --> 27:47.960]  gonna do a whole hour on this maybe two hours on this and Margaret Sanger quotes and the
[27:47.960 --> 27:54.640]  rest of it and then how does that tie into the Financial Times of London headline of
[27:54.640 --> 28:03.880]  a week ago of billionaires meet in secret to promote world population reduction see
[28:03.880 --> 28:12.240]  how does all this tie together I'm gonna go over this in the next segment and take your
[28:12.240 --> 28:20.720]  calls but here is the issue to the racist whites who have this attitude of look just
[28:20.720 --> 28:27.000]  abort the black and Hispanic babies kill all the children on the east side of Austin
[28:27.000 --> 28:34.120]  and I heard other callers this week saying the same thing I mean these are psychos and
[28:34.120 --> 28:38.040]  this is an attitude I've heard from CPS and quote liberals over and over again is well
[28:38.040 --> 28:42.480]  we gotta abort all these brown babies nobody wants them who are you gonna adopt them it's
[28:42.480 --> 28:50.080]  funny there are more requests every year for adoption than there are children they don't
[28:50.080 --> 28:53.280]  tell all these mothers hey go ahead and have the baby and then adopt it no they tell them
[28:53.280 --> 28:57.320]  go ahead and kill that baby but then if the woman goes ahead and has the baby they then
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.560]  come in and try to CPS and kidnap the kid to keep it in the market that's kind of like
[29:01.560 --> 29:07.200]  the big cartels in the 20s and 30s this is on record congressional testimony the big
[29:07.200 --> 29:12.640]  companies that were shipping in heroin opium cocaine coca-cola so that's called coke they
[29:12.640 --> 29:16.920]  were losing their monopoly ship and coke and heroin and so they made it illegal so they
[29:16.920 --> 29:22.400]  could use the police to knock out their competition then jack up the price kind of like they don't
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.880]  want you knowing about how you can give your baby up for adoption instead of board it because
[29:26.880 --> 29:30.480]  they want to make sure the level of adopted kids stays down so they can kidnap them and
[29:30.480 --> 29:36.480]  get more money heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and

[34:46.360 --> 34:59.640]  june 7th 2009 you know let's talk facts here about how modern science that we know developed
[34:59.640 --> 35:12.120]  in the 1718 19th and 20th century starting with lord mouth is sir mouth is saying that
[35:12.120 --> 35:17.320]  they need to exterminate the majority of the british population and figure out how to spread
[35:17.320 --> 35:21.920]  plagues on them how to put them in compact cities and kill them because the population
[35:21.920 --> 35:32.880]  was overpopulated that was in 1750 thereabouts that he first published and then darwin comes
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.880]  along and says the same thing and the social darwinist pick up with that and his cousin
[35:38.880 --> 35:45.800]  sir frances galton comes out and creates the theory of eugenics which the royals just
[35:45.800 --> 35:50.080]  loved saying the elites are better bread and the masters of the planet and the mere fact
[35:50.080 --> 35:55.320]  that they're in control gives them divine right of kings they got in control and most
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.040]  of the wedgewood galton darwin family would die on like they'd have five sons and four
[36:01.040 --> 36:04.080]  of them would die because they were all in her merry they were all marrying each other's
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.560]  first cousins because they thought they were the master race so the scientific elite were
[36:08.560 --> 36:13.840]  all in her marrying for out for hundreds of years just like the royalty was in her merry
[36:13.840 --> 36:20.440]  it's all delusions of grandeur totally mentally ill like some you know breed of german pointer
[36:20.440 --> 36:25.960]  dog that they're chow you know it's been overbred just just endlessly breeding the dog he'll
[36:25.960 --> 36:30.800]  just sit there in the corner shaking and urinating on itself and yipping and yapping with delusions
[36:30.800 --> 36:41.040]  of grandeur that's who runs things just inbred filth and so by the 1890s eugenics has adopted
[36:41.040 --> 36:47.160]  his law in england law in the united states law in france and germany and even mexico
[36:47.160 --> 36:54.920]  and by 1920 34 states in the u.s its law the police dropped by with social workers and
[36:54.920 --> 36:58.440]  people would say i have a right to a trial i have a right to a jury you can't take me
[36:58.440 --> 37:05.840]  because i'm poor and sterilize me you can't and they would so they set up family courts
[37:05.840 --> 37:12.800]  and health departments it was a doctor in a lab coat that came and so they said oh yes
[37:12.800 --> 37:18.240]  you have a bill of rights but not when it's for medical reasons and the local uppies
[37:18.240 --> 37:23.560]  in the towns would say yes sterilize that white trash and sterilize those blacks and
[37:23.560 --> 37:31.120]  mexicans and chinese and on the books they took a half a million white women they took
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.080]  millions of blacks but good records of that weren't kept and they took the majority of
[37:36.080 --> 37:39.720]  the native american population still going on today and they say you want health care
[37:39.720 --> 37:45.040]  we gotta do a procedure and they sterilize you and then see a lot of people are listening
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.320]  right now all over the country going yeah yeah there's too many people yeah yeah yeah
[37:49.320 --> 37:53.480]  see you've been taught that and the issue is when i'm gonna tell you here's the big
[37:53.480 --> 37:59.240]  kicker you're being sterilized too dummy you're drinking sodium fluoride that attacks
[37:59.240 --> 38:05.720]  every gland in the body and attacks reproduction and massively increases cancer just google cancer
[38:05.720 --> 38:10.240]  research sodium fluoride you'll be reading us government documents in the twenties that's
[38:10.240 --> 38:14.840]  where hitler and stalling out there i did a put in the water that's in prolet surprise
[38:14.840 --> 38:20.520]  winning books on world war two that they would put in the water supply to seek i know you
[38:20.520 --> 38:26.920]  were taught to laugh about it i know it's funny yes you've been drinking a deadly toxin a
[38:26.920 --> 38:32.240]  deadly sedative that's why but you've got enough of your humanity left to listen to
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.600]  me listen to me carefully you can shake off the drugs you're on they forcefully medicated
[38:37.600 --> 38:43.840]  to the water they shoot you up with the mercury don't believe me just google three times increase
[38:43.840 --> 38:50.040]  in all timers after three flu shots you'll see government studies they've increased the
[38:50.040 --> 38:56.440]  mercury in the flu shot so see you you're saying kill everybody in the black side of
[38:56.440 --> 39:00.280]  the mexican side of town you're saying kill kill kill because they're all gang members
[39:00.280 --> 39:08.920]  scum just like you heard the woman earlier but then you don't understand when you really
[39:08.920 --> 39:13.960]  read the eugenics documents they say we're going to sell the well to do in middle class
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.800]  whites on doing this to blacks and others but our real target is them the eugenicists
[39:18.800 --> 39:25.080]  of you because they are of superior bloodline and may challenge our hegemonic world dictatorship
[39:25.080 --> 39:30.280]  so we have to actually target most just like a farmer would do you know to trimming the
[39:30.280 --> 39:34.680]  trees is the way they describe it bad sons a little baby trees coming up underneath the
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.240]  tree underneath the crepe myrtle or the oak we have to kill most of them and then select
[39:40.240 --> 39:46.200]  the only best ones we want for interbreeding with ourselves so see you're you're driving
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.240]  around going yeah kill the mexicans and blacks let's see you don't know you're already been
[39:51.240 --> 39:58.040]  hit by write this down write this down as you drive down the road soft kill weapon and
[39:58.040 --> 40:03.240]  when you get home today if you still know how to type that in and you're not too busy watching
[40:03.240 --> 40:10.000]  sports and acting tough soft kill weapon you'll read pentagon documents silent weapons for
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.840]  quiet wars it's a very quiet war what they're doing to you right now what they're doing
[40:14.840 --> 40:23.680]  to me and the technocrats and most the minions are even in on this think they're immune but
[40:23.680 --> 40:27.840]  you'll always notice a research scientist somebody involved at higher levels who's got a big
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.600]  piece of the puzzle and knows what they're part of but still believes in it you'll notice
[40:31.600 --> 40:37.000]  nothing but distilled water nothing but properly nothing but organic food they've engineered
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.200]  these foods by design every major GMO crop has been studied and they are specifically
[40:42.200 --> 40:50.000]  selecting it to create a different interactions of the body that sterilize all rodent populations
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.320]  guinea pigs rats rabbits doesn't matter and that's why women are going sterile men are
[40:54.320 --> 40:59.680]  going sterile that's a fact you're being hit and hit hard and I'm sorry laughing and giggling
[40:59.680 --> 41:05.240]  about it doesn't change it that men that's why you're effeminate that's why you look
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.160]  like women even if you try to run and exercise and lift weights your testosterone has been
[41:10.160 --> 41:17.280]  massively reduced you're under chemical and biological attack that's why we're all turning
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.240]  in to ninies and the women are hyper feminine and that's why they're getting breast cancer
[41:23.240 --> 41:28.400]  which is generally harmonially triggered you look at those studies now having your breast
[41:28.400 --> 41:33.160]  wrought off painfully and dying it and fine you might want to end all your fake liberal
[41:33.160 --> 41:39.880]  and conservative baloney ideology let me tell you something the big secret the real racist
[41:39.880 --> 41:46.040]  are smart folks they don't run around wearing wide hoods and burning crosses they act like
[41:46.040 --> 41:51.760]  loving liberals that's why black high schools all over the country and elementary schools
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.880]  are called Margaret Sanger elementary I went to a predominantly black school and kindergarten
[41:57.880 --> 42:08.840]  by white rock lake and it was Margaret Sanger elementary big joke that her statues out front
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.480]  many of the black schools it's a big joke she called black subhuman that had to be exterminated
[42:13.480 --> 42:21.440]  she called them weeds animals you can read her famous letters to the big proctor and
[42:21.440 --> 42:26.800]  gamble family foundation and the Colgate's and others where she's saying yes we've got
[42:26.800 --> 42:30.760]  a pose as if we're liberals that love the blacks and we're going to break up their families
[42:30.760 --> 42:34.640]  and pay their women not to have men in the houses and we're going to drug them and we're
[42:34.640 --> 42:38.120]  going to and we're hiring all these black leaders and black doctors so they'll trust
[42:38.120 --> 42:43.960]  us and take the injections oh yeah you can Google that and read it online but don't

[47:38.600 --> 47:58.360]  radio network so when you read Margaret Stanger and hundreds of other top eugenicists federal
[47:58.360 --> 48:03.120]  government chief state governors it's all their letters back and forth to each other
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.720]  and even handbooks they publish for social working social working was founded to carry
[48:07.720 --> 48:12.680]  out racial hygiene to spy on the community to go around and kidnap people's children
[48:12.680 --> 48:16.800]  that's why we always hear the stories about Hitler Hitler would take German's children
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.160]  if the state would steal their kids in Russia would steal people's kids Russia picked up
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.560]  the communists picked up the same eugenics plan which was again funded by the Rockefellers
[48:26.560 --> 48:31.640]  and the Rothschilds on record I mean if you just go to the encyclopedia I don't just mean
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.000]  Wikipedia because it's inaccurate a lot but actually actually what Wikipedia has on the
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.960]  Rockefeller Foundation is accurate because I've bought their books I've actually read
[48:39.960 --> 48:47.040]  their minutes the congressional testimony but but but you can go to other online encyclopedias
[48:47.040 --> 48:54.640]  and read and then link through to the Rockefeller Foundation's own federal filings where it's
[48:54.640 --> 49:00.000]  all eugenics the whole foundations for eugenics and how they funded the Soviets and the Nazis
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.440]  the Kaiser Velhelm Institute how they funded the human genome project at Cold Springs Harbor
[49:05.440 --> 49:11.000]  the birthplace of U.S. eugenics the head of it had to step down last year remember Dr.
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.720]  Watson for saying blacks weren't human on the news they're not trying to find out all
[49:17.720 --> 49:21.480]  your genetic codes because they want to be sweet to you folks they're finding out for
[49:21.480 --> 49:26.360]  race specific bio weapons as even the Austin American statesman reported two years ago
[49:26.360 --> 49:32.280]  about Dick Cheney in a policy report saying we need to deploy race specific bio weapons
[49:32.280 --> 49:37.080]  to kill certain races and the Austin American statesman the family wrote a good story and
[49:37.080 --> 49:45.400]  said why is Dick Cheney talking about wiping out certain races and they even got weird
[49:45.400 --> 49:50.800]  African black leaders that go to these conferences and talk about wiping out most of the blacks
[49:50.800 --> 49:54.360]  but I guess they get all this money and all this power from the globalist so I guess they
[49:54.360 --> 50:00.200]  get off on it I mean this is this is serious business and you know I read this a week ago
[50:00.200 --> 50:04.320]  on air but I'm gonna cover it again right now ABC News covered it tomorrow I'm gonna
[50:04.320 --> 50:09.600]  play a clip of it where they describe them as superheroes and put David Rockefeller's
[50:09.600 --> 50:16.160]  head on Superman I'm gonna play that tomorrow on prisonplanet.tv so you can actually see
[50:16.160 --> 50:21.520]  it not just the audio of it dealing with this about oh all these world leaders met secretly
[50:21.520 --> 50:27.280]  at the Rockefeller Foundation at their university because they care so much and want to help
[50:27.280 --> 50:35.400]  African children meanwhile you actually read what the Times of London interviewing the
[50:35.400 --> 50:39.480]  head of the foundation for the article they admit no it was how to reduce population that's
[50:39.480 --> 50:45.360]  how they're helping the little children and you find out how they're doing it it's breaking
[50:45.360 --> 50:50.320]  up their families having CPS kidnaping their kids drugging their kids in my film in game
[50:50.320 --> 50:56.600]  I have the head for the state for psychiatry testifying for the legislature representative
[50:56.600 --> 51:02.840]  Susanna Hupp a great lady she says well why are 68% this is in the film in game she goes
[51:02.840 --> 51:07.760]  what this is Texas testimony they said why are 68% of the foster kids on multiple psychotropic
[51:07.760 --> 51:13.080]  drugs they said they have bad genes we're having to do this because they have bad genes
[51:13.080 --> 51:17.240]  that's just made up there's no test there's no they just so you know we put two thirds
[51:17.240 --> 51:28.400]  plus of the kids 68% is over two thirds of the kids on psychotropic drugs now listen
[51:28.400 --> 51:34.600]  to this billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation now remember how Margaret Sanger and others
[51:34.600 --> 51:37.920]  when you read her documents and her letters it's all we've got to make them think we're
[51:37.920 --> 51:42.480]  helping them and we're helping the children that we care about them and that we and we've
[51:42.480 --> 51:46.840]  also got to run the equality groups and claim that there needs to be a quality for blacks
[51:46.840 --> 51:50.400]  this is how we'll get control of their communities right now they've got their own stores their
[51:50.400 --> 51:58.560]  own businesses their own colleges they're becoming wealthy I mean folks blacks had 10% illegitimacy
[51:58.560 --> 52:08.080]  in the 1940s they now have over 90% illegitimacy whites had 95% legitimacy now it's past the
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.960]  halfway point where less than half of whites children are born into a two parent family
[52:13.960 --> 52:19.320]  zero attack one parent homes we're not the issue is your three to four times we're likely
[52:19.320 --> 52:24.120]  to be in prison or on drugs the system knows that we are homo sapien sapien we're meant
[52:24.120 --> 52:29.800]  to be in little tribal units with a man and a woman want to beat the new world order folks
[52:29.800 --> 52:36.760]  stop fighting with your husbands and wives team up it's the family against the world
[52:36.760 --> 52:40.640]  that's how the elites operate but they teach you to implode your family so the state can
[52:40.640 --> 52:46.000]  have their way with you and I have the main line textbooks where they say the family belongs
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.160]  to the age of barbarism I remember about a year ago I mentioned a textbook I covered
[52:51.160 --> 52:55.960]  on air the University of Texas uses University of Texas at Austin for all their social workers
[52:55.960 --> 53:02.360]  that says families are obsolete belong to the age of barbarism and are a disease all family
[53:02.360 --> 53:09.440]  members are mentally ill families are mentally ill everyone needs to be reeducated and people
[53:09.440 --> 53:14.760]  didn't believe me so on the prison planet dot com forum hundreds of textbooks got scanned
[53:14.760 --> 53:19.380]  and put up all saying the same thing it blew everybody away it's always worse than I'm
[53:19.380 --> 53:24.680]  telling you now listen to how this is all put out flower early and nice but this goes
[53:24.680 --> 53:29.280]  further than ABC news that just said oh the secret rich you know that they had a secret
[53:29.280 --> 53:35.600]  meeting to help black children but they won't say what they met about and then played weird
[53:35.600 --> 53:40.720]  super friend music in the background with Ted night announcing them those super friends
[53:40.720 --> 53:46.240]  and the league of justice with the heads of Ted Turner and David Rockefeller literally
[53:46.240 --> 53:52.500]  on superheroes bodies the average moron on fluoride and prozac and shot up for a mercury
[53:52.500 --> 53:57.640]  watching that thinking oh they're meeting in secret for my own good and they're only
[53:57.640 --> 54:01.600]  having to report this now because we keep exposing their secret meetings and making films about
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.160]  how they're meeting to carry out eugenics my film two years ago released in game documenting
[54:06.160 --> 54:16.440]  it all now major news billionaires club in bid to curb over population oh and you actually
[54:16.440 --> 54:23.160]  read with the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says they're doing with 80 plus billion dollars
[54:23.160 --> 54:29.240]  they say there it's it's for creating mosquitoes that fly out and bite people and then inject
[54:29.240 --> 54:35.760]  them with viruses to sterilize them you can't make this stuff up but when you're on the

[54:46.600 --> 54:50.840]  club in bid to curb over population America's richest people meet to discuss ways of tackling
[54:50.840 --> 54:55.640]  a disastrous environmental social and industrial threat some of America's leading billionaires
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.800]  have met secretly to consider how their well could be used to slow the growth of world's
[54:59.800 --> 55:05.240]  population and speed up improvements in health and education and they admit the education
[55:05.240 --> 55:10.720]  to teach you not to have kids and see that's what the global carbon tax is they brag that
[55:10.720 --> 55:14.680]  carbon isn't bad we're carbon based life forms the planets based on carbon dioxide
[55:14.680 --> 55:19.080]  oxygen water and sunlight those are the four ingredients but by taxing that they say they're
[55:19.080 --> 55:24.160]  going to shut down the amount of resources that are available to where you can't afford
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.160]  to have a child this is why they have to bankrupt the world economy openly read the writings
[55:29.160 --> 55:34.800]  of the former treasury secretary Henry Paulson's a big eugenicists all of them are this is
[55:34.800 --> 55:41.040]  a cult and so stealing and thieving and setting up tyranny is all good because it's it's for
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.520]  your own good at the end of the article they say why all the secrecy they wanted to speak
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.360]  rich to rich without worrying anything they said when end up in the newspapers painting
[55:50.360 --> 55:55.320]  them as an alternative to world government because see there already is a world government
[55:55.320 --> 55:58.400]  see that little statement they don't say there's no world government they say oh an alternative
[55:58.400 --> 56:10.960]  to the world government and it just goes on here to go over how they have to reduce the
[56:10.960 --> 56:16.480]  world's populations now let me tell you how cold-blooded these people are let's say you
[56:16.480 --> 56:21.880]  believe that the world population has to be forcibly reduced by 80% as the united nations
[56:21.880 --> 56:29.120]  biological diversity assessment 1996 and 1989 state and that's conservative most of the
[56:29.120 --> 56:36.560]  well dr. pionka here at ut says forcibly you know use a bullet to get rid of 90% but he
[56:36.560 --> 56:40.880]  at least is somewhat moral in his evil he says I'm ready to die and so is my family
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.200]  we all want to die well pionka don't let me get in the way you think there's too many
[56:45.200 --> 56:52.720]  people you go first oh but you have an important message to impart with all those bio biologies
[56:52.720 --> 56:57.680]  students that write white paper saying you're too liberal all humans must die yeah just
[56:57.680 --> 57:06.720]  google dr. Eric pionka student phd white papers human parasites and you'll read hundreds
[57:06.720 --> 57:13.240]  of published phd's of people five ten fifteen years ago who guess what now you google the

[57:19.120 --> 57:24.480]  it's no big deal they just write white paper saying oh I don't I don't you know Alex Jones
[57:24.480 --> 57:27.960]  in fact that that's how I first learned of it when they were attacking me sending me
[57:27.960 --> 57:34.640]  threatening emails saying read my my phd from eight years ago dr. pionka is a genius and
[57:34.640 --> 57:38.800]  you just can't grasp that he's trying to save the earth humans are a parasite as you will
[57:38.800 --> 57:45.360]  see in my phd and then we post their little phd humans are a parasite we would be better

[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:25.640]  is about a control group hijacking humanity if you read the royal commission on population put
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:32.040]  out by the british government in 1949 you'd know they actually stopped clean power systems from
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:37.320]  going in in the third world so that they would increase their numbers to actually hurt their
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:41.640]  population so they'd eat up all their resources so they could be controlled then they said they
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:47.000]  used soft-kill weapons to wipe out the larger mass after they used the huge population explosion
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.200]  to hamstring them this isn't about environmentalism this is about cold blooded control and until

[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:13.480]  all right let's go back to Africa not one of the military people over there in Kenya you
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:16.440]  originally tried to call in about something happening in Kenya go ahead then I'll get to
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:23.240]  everybody else go ahead you're on the air okay Alex I just wanted to basically say what I said
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:28.600]  although you know in Africa the military is helping a lot with the people here which is a
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:35.160]  good thing but see that's PR hold on see they'll have you build bridges put in medical clinics
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:40.200]  and the doctors in there getting malaria and fighting the bugs want to help little black kids
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:44.840]  they don't know they're injecting them with different vaccines that have had different
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:50.680]  compounds added they've been caught mainstream news adding hormones to tetanus to sterilize women
[1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:56.120]  adding hiv uh to different injections I mean they've been caught but see it's compartmentalized
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:00.760]  well they are there the things that we do over here will will help with some things but there's
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:05.640]  a medical aspect the problem they have with some lot of their clinics is they put a lot of the
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:10.600]  canyons or the Africans to college the medical school and stuff like that and they never come
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:13.480]  back they see in the united states or they go to britain or they go somewhere else where they
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:17.880]  can make money that's a big problem they're having here they don't come back to uh to do medical
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:23.240]  for you know work in their communities or in the country so I agree and that allows bill
[1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:29.480]  melinda gates that allows bill melinda gates and all them to fill up the vacuum right which is it
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:33.240]  was just a good which is a real bad thing because you know like a few like I say the people of
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:39.000]  africa are actually really good people and uh that I've had a per you know meeting a lot of nice
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:43.880]  people over here and they're they're they're decent people are you seeing a big chinese presence
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:51.560]  vying for control in africa there there is a major um struggle in a sense that they
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:57.160]  continues over here between different nations like their nations chinese nations and just
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:01.320]  different countries they come in and they help build infrastructure within the country on the
[1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:12.760]  continent
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:26.760]  and uh basically making relationships with them uh so they can work together and then we're
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:31.320]  still bad to report it and say they're hypocrites you know my whole issue is look at the aztecs
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:37.400]  look at the romans look at all the craziness that every government turns into and uh think about
[1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:42.760]  tiskegee and the radiation experiments and all the stuff government over and over again has been
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:46.520]  caught doing through the medical system and then we're just going to trust them now and then it
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:51.400]  comes out for 36 years they've been taking our blood at birth without asking us for a secret
[1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:59.720]  dna database at colesprings harbour which is the eugenics records office sorry go ahead i was just
[1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:04.600]  going to say i mean you know if you take if you take that step and believe that these people are
[1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:11.000]  a luciferian cult of pedophiles you know that that falls right in line the feminism
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:16.280]  destroying families um the eugenics destroying families you know we can talk about the cremation
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:23.640]  of care ritual at uh bohemian grove you know it's a druidic absolution ritual you know designed to
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:30.440]  put all of the sins of these global exactly you got ultra rich elites that are sick of everything
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.720]  normal they're sick of the best-looking mistress they're sick of 15 houses and 10 lear jets they
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:41.480]  like cutting little kids heads off i appreciate your call i mean they like snuff films i mean they
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:47.560]  like evil believe me it's not just a pedophile ring but again i mean folks it's so hellish
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:52.360]  it's so hellish what's running things and the public just isn't ready to accept it and that's
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.200]  why you're going to get everything you got taken folks but you'll remember what i said later and
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:24:59.640]  then fight back that's what's important down the road you're going to remember this show
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:04.600]  it's never too late to fight the globalists i know you're in denial because you were trained
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:09.080]  to be cowards from birth but you can wake up and be men and women again steven houston you're on the
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:14.760]  air yeah good afternoon uh elix hey uh i had an interesting conversation earlier today with the
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:21.400]  lady at church and uh she was mentioning to me uh she has a bunch of apartment complex properties
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:26.840]  here in the harris county area just outside of houston and she just mentioned to me out of the
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:32.760]  blue house that she's had well drilled for these properties so she doesn't have to be on city water
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:40.120]  municipal water supply well now the county of harris is making her pay for that water and they are
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:46.920]  charging her at the rate of two and a half million gallons uh i think it's per month rather than the
[1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:51.480]  three uh less than three hundred thousand and i asked her if they put a meter on it she said no
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:58.280]  all they're doing is estimating and so i launched into from that about what they did in uh what's
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:03.800]  that country down in south america argentina and i said here you know they did the same thing and
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:08.600]  then they had people getting bills of two thousand dollars and upwards per month no no that's it that's
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:12.680]  it and i totally agree with let me explain this in the un brags that's why everything's about water
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:17.240]  you hear about boon pickings oh he wants to help put windmills in in the panhandle no that's the
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:22.280]  biggest aquifer in the u.s his deals actually to get that water so they teach all the yuppies
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:27.000]  that there's no water left so they'll accept artificial scarcity just like they tell women
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:31.960]  diamonds are precious when they're semi precious stones rubies and emeralds are actually precious
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:39.080]  diamonds are crap they're just geographically only in africa uh one place in arkansas a small
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:43.960]  area in canada and a few areas in australia and the globalists bought all those areas up
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:48.520]  diamonds just lay all over the ground diamonds are semi precious they're not even at the top
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:52.280]  of the scale for semi precious but they tell women they're semi precious i mean i mean that
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:57.480]  they're precious they advertise you gotta have them same thing with water they tell you don't use
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:01.720]  water we're out of water there's no water they'll show you a lake when it goes down what it's a
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:07.240]  man made like to begin with and you know meant to do that and they and they train you and that's why
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:11.880]  all these big water districts that are really semi private are going around snatching water using
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:16.040]  taxpayer money to do it and they're gonna artificially tell you there's no water they're
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:20.840]  doing all over the world and double triple quadruple and by law in california and texas
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:25.560]  they're installing them without telling the public that the news quotes smart thermostats
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:31.320]  they remote control in your house and so they're just again that's what globalism is ripping you
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:36.760]  off scamming you squeezing you and yes all over the country in the world it's the same people run

[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:46.680]  100 year old wells with plenty of water they're saying you can't drill wells they're saying
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:51.800]  they're saying water is not renewable they're saying trees aren't renewable you see the globalist
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:57.480]  are monopoly men the ultra rich and wealthy got their power through government see conservatives
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.800]  mainline conservatives won't tell you big corporations run the government they are bigger
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:08.440]  than most governments of the hundred biggest economies over 50 are now corporations you understand
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:12.040]  they are government and the left says all corporations are bad and governments good
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:17.000]  so see the right's defending big corporations the left's defending government as if those two
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:22.040]  are fighting when they all work together and until this scam is realized we're in deep trouble

[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:11.560]  you've covered this and i i don't know if anyone else has why wasn't obama's grandmother at his
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:17.720]  inauguration well that would be an embarrassment to have his grandmother who runs around on video
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:22.120]  saying he was born in kenya and now she saw him born in the village and of course he said he had
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:26.440]  no muslim roots it was all made up now that he goes over to the middle east he says you know
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:31.400]  everything in muslim and i have muslim roots which is fine if he had them it's the issue that he
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:37.960]  lied about it uh and was very deceptive about it uh you know but again he's the eugenics president
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:43.480]  they need a brown face on the new world order to sucker everybody in he's just suckering the
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:49.400]  arabs of the middle east end just like he suckered uh the united states in i mean he lied about
[1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:55.320]  everything he said he would do i don't know if he really lied he could be so mk altered that it might
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:35:00.760]  not be lying yeah well before somebody emails me because they're ignorant and says his grandma died
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:06.440]  two days before he won the election uh or two days after he did or whatever the yes the one in
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:12.680]  hawaii uh that put him through school she died of cancer but the other grandma uh is still kicking
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:18.280]  last time i saw uh telling news cameras of course he won't talk about all his aunts living in shacks
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:25.240]  or his brothers living in shacks or his aunts uh you know uh that uh are living illegally uh in uh
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:30.760]  boston literally in shacks i mean i've got family that didn't do in too well sometimes and i send
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:36.280]  them money but no this is filth this is trash this is somebody who's made like what is it 10 million
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:42.440]  dollars off his book and his family doesn't get jack crap because that narcissistic lying slime ball
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:49.320]  is evil and you know again everything about him is is a lie he's six percent black he's half white
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:57.960]  44 percent arab on record his daddy's an arab his cousin odinga's an arab who is always attacking
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:04.440]  the canyons the the the arab's uh are the the the muslims are the minority over there and odinga
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:09.400]  rules it and and when he was in the senate obama's own documents came out where he was telling odinga
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:15.720]  how to stage riots to uh contest the election and take over the country illegally obama is a
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:21.160]  hardcore criminal and that's what my film the obama deception exposes period you think you might
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:25.240]  have meant mentioned this in the in your second obama film yes it's all going to be in there i
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:29.320]  wanted to hit stuff in the obama deception about how he said he was going to get out of these
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.640]  countries but he lied how he wasn't going to hire lobbyists but that's all he hired how he said he
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:38.840]  would make all the bailout money and and stimulus money public and now he makes it secret about how
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:43.480]  he's funded by the globalist how he funds eugenics how he's going to have forced youth brigades and
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:47.800]  now they've got him on tv and red and black uniforms marching telling the high school kids
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:53.080]  they've got to go march and red and black uniforms i mean it's happening folks he's got over a dozen
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.840]  bills introduced to basically end the second amendment and every time we bring it up the
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:04.760]  media says it doesn't exist well if a mainline reporter did ask any questions like this i mean

[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:06.840]  because they love them so much oh it's so liberal you see they can't come take your house or your
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:11.080]  kids or your land they just come and say i'm taking it you'll fight back but if they come and say

[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:23.400]  you kirk watson makes me sick i mean he's the quintessential little oily fat cat one night
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.600]  they were doing beyond the beltway up here nationally syndicated show out of the same
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:30.360]  studios here because they were traveling reduce the doomont comes on after this show
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:35.000]  here on this station and others and watson came in and saw me literally turned white when i was
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:40.200]  leaving and i said i watson i'm not gonna be mean to you have a nice day watson you're going to
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:45.400]  hell don't worry i didn't say that to him but you know i'm a professional guy i just can't get up
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:49.960]  here and think about i'm snatching people's kids without due process and to know you know
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:54.920]  literally i scan the news four five five six hours sometimes sometimes i get addicted and
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:50:01.480]  might scan for five six hours at a time you know at night alone but every day four five hours you
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:07.320]  know split up in the morning and at lunch and at night and every day i see articles in austin where
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:12.520]  i live where it'll say oh a mother arrested for child abuse and i go it's not going to be a mother
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:16.840]  five paragraphs in in fact i'll be sitting there at the breakfast table reading the paper and i'll
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:21.960]  say to my wife watch this it says a mother put her kid in a hot tub and boiled its skin off it's
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:27.080]  going to be a foster parent it'll say parent because they don't want to say they want to put
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:31.400]  the propaganda on the idea of parents they play little semantical games and then i'll open the
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:35.720]  next page and i'll say oh i'm right how many times you see me do that at the office paul
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:42.120]  we're also i mean i know i know how they operate and it'll say oh the foster parent some lazy phd
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:47.480]  they're always a phd they couldn't get a regular job they're lazy you know they don't contribute
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:51.720]  to society they just go out and they warehouse four or five kids at their house and they make
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:55.080]  money off of them and when they're bad they put them in boiling water they probably took the kid
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:59.080]  because they get out of bruise on their leg and now they're going to go in some boiling water now
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:02.600]  they're going to get their teeth pulled out i mean how many courts have ruled that the state
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:09.320]  can keep kids in cages i always hear a repairman saw the kids living in cages but the state has
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:13.720]  ruled that the foster parent can keep the children in cages they just can't do it more than 14 hours
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:19.640]  a day you can rule you can go read those cases you think i'm joking i have the buffalo news
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:27.640]  and i had the london guardian same day this came out thursday and it says oh the police
[1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:33.480]  can taser you to make you answer questions or to give dna so are they civeto now out of these
[1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:37.320]  warrantless checkpoints where they have these blank warrants signed by judges without true
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:42.600]  probable cause radio hosts over there without warrants like indiana does it with all right i
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:47.880]  guess i'll put away my notes i was going to do myself but one of these they have they're just
[1:51:47.880 --> 1:51:52.040]  going to taser you i remember in miami about four years ago where they started tasering
[1:51:52.040 --> 1:51:57.880]  people would give urine samples the only thing that would stop them down and saying oh yes
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:52:03.080]  that's called torture legalized torture in america and they tell you torture and people
[1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:07.560]  with waterboarding are raping their kids in front of them they don't the army's own report the army
[1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:11.240]  admits they rape kids in front of their parents and they say that in the torture that's like 95
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:17.560]  percent of google army report yeah right abu gaib raping children you'll have msnbc
[1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:23.400]  and you'll have a new yorker magazine in fact they don't believe me guys right now i want to

[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:39.960]  new yorker magazine because i know you're cowardly some of you out there and you want to deny what's
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:44.760]  going on or maybe you're saying i'm the extremist how dare you not want to rape children alex how
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:48.120]  dare you uh not want the government to be kidnapping children and taking them to government
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:52.360]  rape rooms with big fat pedophiles that have their way with them what do you think the pedophiles go
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:57.240]  they go become crew and see officers and cps people you know about the texas youth commission
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:02.120]  the media focused on the yeah it's fighting human cock fighting with kids beating each other to
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:08.360]  death no they were pimping little kids out that's what the texas rangers tried to stop but no they
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:12.920]  weren't allowed to have your time we're gonna have to make it the money off the pimping the kids at
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:18.120]  815 your time we're gonna have let me tell you i get angry about real issues the same one we had on

[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:55.320]  first ones to tell me i'm weird because i think this is bad ruling allows taser used to get dna
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:54:01.880]  maybe nations first actually i google that it's not the nation's first and it says it's legally
[1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:06.840]  permissible for police to zap a suspect with a taser to obtain dna samples as long as it's not
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:14.200]  done maliciously or to an excessive extent or with resulting injury so that so that ruins a lie
[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:19.080]  saying it doesn't injure you all right first off we got the uh... ben jellis interviewer oh you

[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:37.320]  license plates the program is called californians help eliminate all the evasive registration
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:43.080]  scoff laws or cheaters and again the cops could pull people over without state plates it's about
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:48.920]  making they always make the most basic thing illegal or the perception of illegal it's like
[1:55:48.920 --> 1:55:53.400]  when they they tell cops if you pull somebody over and they've got a road almanac they're
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:57.960]  probably a terrorist or if they got a wrong poll sticker they're probably a terrorist to see if
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:02.360]  they can sell you to start looking when you're in people's houses by the way you know most carpet

[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:17.480]  scoping your house because uh the company ends up getting about 20 percent or any fines or fees
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:22.360]  or payoffs that's on record and then they get a little goody to their little spy so while you're

[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:29.720]  around through everything you got this country's like the soviet union and again i'm the weirdo
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:34.040]  because i don't like it so you got a problem we were all taught that was the soviet union that
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:38.760]  was nazi germany but see now we're being taught it's good no it isn't good it's degenerate

[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:21.240]  could strengthen and straighten out the idea that ever occurs to any of the more rebellious members
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:25.560]  speaking about teaching them to have abortions speaking before the rockefeller sponsored planned
