[01:25.520 --> 01:32.800]  they're always the greatest danger especially when the protectors publicly run al-qaeda and the
[01:32.800 --> 01:38.640]  headline today out of cns news is syrian rebel swap crosses the top churches for al-qaeda flags
[01:38.640 --> 01:47.040]  that is the type of stuff that is going on now we're live ladies and gentlemen it is friday

[08:56.640 --> 09:05.360]  ladies and gentlemen we're live i've got to tell you this country is in deep deep deep trouble
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.240]  and if we will simply get out of our comfort zones and admit how much trouble we're in we
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.360]  can get off this train but i've got to tell you something right now i just looked at my
[09:17.360 --> 09:24.640]  head it guide back in the coffee room where i was getting a glass of water and i said to him
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.960]  let me tell you if we're going to get out of dodge now's the time and it hit me like a ton of bricks
[09:32.560 --> 09:40.640]  if you're going to get out of the united states now is the time just like a science fiction movie
[09:40.640 --> 09:48.400]  alien or something when they set the self-destruct this ship will self-destruct in t minus five
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.040]  minutes bloop bloop bloop counting down i mean the the sirens are going
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.760]  and and i'm in here trying to fix it i mean if we can wake people up wake the military
[10:01.760 --> 10:05.600]  and police up out of their power trip which we've done the military to a great extent
[10:06.080 --> 10:09.360]  because they were never on a power trip because they were in the real world actually fighting
[10:09.360 --> 10:12.560]  real enemies most of the time not just messing with citizens all day
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.440]  if we can turn things around but we got to turn it around now we've kind of turned the ship a
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.920]  little bit but it's still now going to run sideways into the iceberg we've somehow got a turbo the
[10:25.920 --> 10:32.480]  engine and flip it around quickly before we smash right into it and the good news is we're turning
[10:32.480 --> 10:41.200]  the ship but not fast enough and we're going into this thing the news i've got just
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.160]  it was just physically painful in fact i didn't just get a chill up my spine i actually just had
[10:52.160 --> 10:57.440]  pain in my chest over what's happening i mean it's that bad ladies and gentlemen how screwed up
[10:57.440 --> 11:06.160]  this country is and i'm sitting here studying all this watching all this unfold and there's no way to
[11:06.160 --> 11:12.880]  get through to the zombie public and the the general public's watching mtv and fox television
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.080]  and all the entertainment shows and HBO and they all think it's cute and funny and they have no idea
[11:18.080 --> 11:28.320]  how much trouble they're in and just how evil the establishment is they have no earthly conception
[11:28.320 --> 11:30.240]  how serious this new world order is

[12:46.720 --> 12:56.080]  the story is up on info wars dot com in a report by paul joseph watson
[12:56.080 --> 13:06.960]  and you have to understand that the the bedrock of a corrupt evil authoritarian society is we
[13:06.960 --> 13:13.040]  will arrest you we will disappear you they've killed people in custody at airports before
[13:13.040 --> 13:17.360]  who were in handcuffs and they say that they've hung themselves including women

[13:23.360 --> 13:31.520]  them tsa loudspeakers threaten travelers with arrest for joking about security
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.600]  technically it's worse than what watson even wrote there it just says joking period
[13:42.160 --> 13:48.960]  prisoner training don't complain about your grope down and the issue here is there's no law
[13:48.960 --> 13:54.000]  saying you can't say don't grab my junk or i think this is disgusting or i think this is horrible
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.400]  or i think you ought to get a real job or you better watch the radiation come out of those
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.120]  machines or i don't want you recording my naked body it's on record you lied about that that's
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.640]  the stuff they're saying you're not allowed to say and they're on record threatening people with
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.040]  arrest that dare speak up to them what do you think this is america and remember it's all
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.080]  done to protect you from al qaeda that the government founded and has run the entire time and the
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.000]  people running the government clearly were involved in 9 11 and did that as as an overthrow of our
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.760]  system of our republic of our country in fact the real headline on watson's story and i'm going to
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.560]  call him and have him change it the real headline would be tsa loudspeakers
[14:35.440 --> 14:40.400]  threaten travelers with arrest if they tell jokes let's play the announcement from start
[14:40.400 --> 14:48.160]  to finish one more time a particular attention to your luggage and personal belongings unattended

[15:19.840 --> 15:24.800]  they also talk about maybe treated as a threat to the facility it's not about even about your
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.920]  security it's about this facility this is all military installation talk that you would have
[15:29.920 --> 15:36.720]  in an occupied country this is how they talk to folks in feluja when they were occupied this
[15:36.720 --> 15:43.360]  is paramilitary control this is martial law this is don't be caught out after dark or you may be
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.960]  permanently detained from the running man up on jumbo trons in the street now they have jumbo
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.520]  trons saying don't trust your neighbors watch everyone see something say something i mean we
[15:53.520 --> 15:59.680]  are in the classic orwellian system where the british government put up billboards five years ago
[15:59.680 --> 16:07.520]  saying secure under the watchful eye showing an all-seeing eye watching you that is secure under
[16:07.520 --> 16:13.600]  the watchful eye of big brother they just said secure under the watchful eye and showed a big eye
[16:13.600 --> 16:20.720]  in the sky shooting a pyramid spectrum of analysis down on the people on the street saying we're
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.160]  watching you to make us feel like we're guilty we're criminals we've done something wrong we're
[16:26.160 --> 16:31.680]  the bad guys they're the good guys when the government is run by foreign narcotics trafficking
[16:31.680 --> 16:37.920]  sex trafficking child trafficking murder trafficking snuff film trafficking illegal
[16:37.920 --> 16:48.080]  big pharma legal gmo radiological du trafficking absolute murder gangs of hardcourt globalist
[16:48.080 --> 16:54.800]  and when i have to explain to everybody
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.320]  because i knew this would happen when i went in and talked to some of the crew and my crew is
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.080]  very intelligent and very informed they're on the top i would say one percent of people that are
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.320]  aware they try to hire people that know what's going on but i had to go some of my crew and i
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.880]  said what do you think the story is about well that pilot joked about you know oh yeah i got a bomb
[17:14.880 --> 17:20.800]  in my pants so they arrested him and i said no it's not about bombing the pants that they could
[17:20.800 --> 17:26.080]  say is a terroristic threat but saying hey i think they had a bomb threat if there was something going
[17:26.080 --> 17:32.160]  on that's not illegal but i go you always default in that psychological warfare to the last thing
[17:32.160 --> 17:37.520]  they were doing and that's attached to law if you do put in a bomb threat it's a felony didn't they
[17:37.520 --> 17:42.320]  make hey what's going on a bomb threat if they've got a checkpoint going and bombs giving dogs then
[17:42.320 --> 17:49.680]  they arrest you and then have you plead guilty because you they would never beat you in trial
[17:52.480 --> 17:57.920]  but they use color of law to threaten you to think you've committed a crime to then go on probation
[17:57.920 --> 18:04.560]  so it's all fraud it's a criminal system where they want to pack the giant prison population
[18:04.560 --> 18:10.000]  actually have the private prison companies are on record in texas and new mexico and other states
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.160]  in the middle schools now running security and they say we're preparing them for the next step in life
[18:16.720 --> 18:23.680]  which is prison they're there assessing data basing preparing with the largest prison population
[18:23.680 --> 18:26.320]  in the world not just per capita the largest period
[18:28.960 --> 18:33.920]  so this is the new gulag casino economy that max keiser and others have talked about i haven't gotten
[18:33.920 --> 18:40.080]  our top story yet we'll come to it after the break it's so big and crazy and out of control
[18:40.080 --> 18:43.840]  i don't even know what to say at this point then i'll get back into the whole tsa situation and
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.480]  then jesse ventura's got some special announcements he's gonna be making here on air and then we're
[18:48.480 --> 18:54.240]  also going to have ron paul popping in the middle of the next hour or the start of the next hour
[18:54.240 --> 19:02.960]  that's all coming up but this is about saying your free speech your joke if you joke and say
[19:02.960 --> 19:09.440]  don't grab my junk if you joke and say i don't like how you're acting or if you complain we're
[19:09.440 --> 19:13.920]  going to arrest you and that's indeed what's happening now they call you back behind the deal
[19:13.920 --> 19:20.000]  they scare you they put you in handcuffs then they don't let you fly that day and they say you're
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.840]  not flying today a lot of people are nodding their head if you complain and say i've already missed
[19:25.840 --> 19:31.120]  two flights here because you guys overbook what's your problem you're idiots they're having people
[19:31.120 --> 19:36.240]  put in handcuffs they're saying you're not flying today so so it's it's the new system we're not

[25:35.040 --> 25:44.480]  stuff now about a month ago about a month ago we got contacted by a high level source at dies
[25:44.480 --> 25:52.160]  air force base that's all i'm gonna say high level source that nukes that weren't supposed to be there
[25:52.160 --> 25:59.440]  were brought out of bunkers loaded on 18 wheelers the security force freaked out this private police
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.400]  this was witnessed by my source and said you these aren't supposed to be here since the 80s
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.520]  and and this isn't a proper uh federal department that's supposed to transport these
[26:09.520 --> 26:14.800]  and where are they going was a big argument about even letting them go but the base commander came
[26:14.800 --> 26:20.240]  out and said they're going this is a national security order and those nukes rolled reportedly
[26:20.240 --> 26:21.200]  to the east coast
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.240]  to lindsay graham senatorial district we didn't know the same day he was saying that
[26:30.240 --> 26:34.320]  his district was going to be nuked in the near future if we did attack syria
[26:34.320 --> 26:41.280]  that came out in cbs news now let me give you the new stuff you know the top general in the navy
[26:41.280 --> 26:47.280]  or admiral in the navy over the nuclear weapons here's our report exclusive high level source

[27:13.440 --> 27:22.240]  this isn't just some more news out there now a week ago navy fires number two nuclear commander
[27:22.240 --> 27:34.560]  after gambling probe and i said probably just made up do you really believe this top navy admiral

[27:38.640 --> 27:42.720]  because it's made up folks but i said if it starts happening to more top nuke commanders
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.720]  then you know there's some type of coup counter coup going on boom just breaking 30 minutes ago

[33:35.760 --> 33:43.040]  decadent level or all decadent at one level or another at a deep cowardly level also have a
[33:43.680 --> 33:50.800]  lot of deep courage but humans are all multifaceted i don't like meeting with a navy seal about
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.120]  them blowing up the helicopter or the navy seals i don't like knowing the government's really that
[33:55.120 --> 34:01.280]  evil i don't like knowing that they're doing thousands of declassified lethal studies on
[34:01.280 --> 34:07.600]  men women and children killing little foster kids injecting people with cancer viruses it's not like
[34:07.600 --> 34:12.880]  oh great i have all this horrible news i get to prove the government's bad no it all comes out
[34:12.880 --> 34:19.120]  no one gets in trouble i don't like having a super high level source that witness nukes being pulled
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.760]  out that weren't supposed to be at dais air force base and loaded on trucks and being carried by a
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.240]  transport group that's not supposed to be carrying nuclear weapons that's all set up and established
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.560]  they have a federal transportation group that does that
[34:34.480 --> 34:41.120]  with former special forces people and others in a convoy and then i start seeing top generals and
[34:41.120 --> 34:46.320]  admirals over the nukes being removed by the same people and gucciardi's on it it's the same guy that
[34:46.320 --> 34:52.000]  removed both of them and now they're not saying hey he was gambling like they did this admiral but
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.160]  then dropped the fake charges i said that's probably a setup i mean normally gambling whatever it was
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.400]  they wouldn't remove somebody over that because it's an embarrassment that's nothing in the corruption
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.800]  that goes on in the higher ranks of the pentagon and the top brass on record i mean that's nothing
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.240]  i mean these guys are running whole criminal empires two three four star generals
[35:14.240 --> 35:19.360]  or they're given jobs that are white side white hat that aren't in the corruption
[35:19.360 --> 35:29.520]  to go carry out other operations but the issue here is that now another top general has been removed
[35:31.360 --> 35:36.880]  for loss of trust and the associated press is reporting and i know i hit print on the full
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.880]  article will you please give me that thank you very much so we now have the navy firing it's
[35:42.880 --> 35:51.040]  number two nuclear commander that was a few weeks ago and now today ap michael carry air force general
[35:51.040 --> 35:59.520]  in charge of all nuclear missiles removed from the global air force strike command
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.120]  and we're going to tell you who removed them and the details with anthony gucciardi he's printing
[36:07.120 --> 36:10.800]  the articles off he's walking in here in a minute he should be in here in the next five minutes
[36:10.800 --> 36:17.360]  but that's why they are having announcements at the houston airport and at the boston
[36:17.360 --> 36:22.160]  logan airport everywhere else for that matter now including austin saying if you make jokes
[36:23.040 --> 36:27.520]  or say you don't like the tsa we're going to arrest you folks that's that's free speech to say this
[36:27.520 --> 36:33.840]  is all ridiculous oh really we're going to arrest you they want everybody used to it everybody
[36:33.840 --> 36:39.680]  trained everybody prepared everybody knowing that we can disappear you and now i guess at a tsa
[36:39.680 --> 36:46.080]  checkpoint on a highway if you make a joke they'll arrest you this is what they want to do is just
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.960]  grab and disappear us and our families it's what they've done all over the world the people running
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.160]  our government running our military go into countries and kill hundreds of thousands of people
[36:56.160 --> 37:02.480]  in some cases millions when the globalists have a captive audience they kill everybody
[37:02.480 --> 37:11.440]  when the globalists have a captive audience they whack them out when they have a captive audience
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.720]  they do horrible things when they got foster kids they put 67 percent of them on psychotropic
[37:16.720 --> 37:22.080]  on average of seven drugs when they've got prisoners they do all sorts of secret testing on them
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.120]  when they get poor people they do horrible stuff to them this is what they do if they can get their
[37:27.120 --> 37:31.600]  hands on you and if they can get in they're going to take your pension funds they're going to take
[37:31.600 --> 37:35.360]  your property they're going to take your health they're going to take your children they're going
[37:35.360 --> 37:42.400]  to take your religious rights they're doing it in a reign of terror that is just rolling out now

[37:48.400 --> 37:55.280]  in a moment of the tsa in houston the articles up on info wars dot com tsa loudspeakers threaten
[37:55.280 --> 37:59.760]  travelers with the rest if they make jokes or basically talk back it's just if you say anything
[37:59.760 --> 38:02.480]  we don't like we're going to arrest you there's no law in that
[38:05.280 --> 38:10.240]  then i talk about what gucciardi saw with welden hinson and josh owens flying back from
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.360]  the nsa headquarters covering that last week a guy at the sandwich shop says man they hasn't

[38:44.160 --> 38:49.280]  went on but it's not your business now you tell us who told you that they're under arrest or you're
[38:49.280 --> 38:53.360]  under arrest for a felony and he said well that guy but he didn't do anything he said that you guys
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.800]  had some threat and searched the plane is that true they went over put him in handcuffs took
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.200]  him away this is all in like 10 minutes in the federal marshal air marshal comes over
[39:04.080 --> 39:07.920]  good good shardy said he was just some giant obviously you know hormonal guy
[39:08.880 --> 39:14.320]  bigger than sword snagger is the way he described him and he came over to him he said i'm going to
[39:14.320 --> 39:20.000]  walk you guys in down to the plane he goes you're really lucky really lucky because if you ever do
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.600]  say something like that we're going to charge you with a felony you're going to go to jail he was
[39:23.600 --> 39:26.720]  like what's going to happen to that old man i mean he just was there something going on they're
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.440]  like yeah something went on it's under your business well why are you arresting him why are
[39:31.440 --> 39:37.680]  you arresting him if he didn't do anything well then saw this as well and he said you don't worry
[39:37.680 --> 39:46.240]  about that i mean they're so they want to grab anybody they can and the more innocent the better
[39:46.240 --> 39:52.480]  i want to warn everybody about this country this country is evil don't come here if you live outside
[39:52.480 --> 39:57.440]  the us okay this like the russians put a travel advisory said don't go there they may secretly
[39:57.440 --> 40:03.920]  arrest you that's true folks this country is run by evil that is openly trying to break our will
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.440]  the nazis got in at 33 by 35 they were doing the same thing messing with people shutting down
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.080]  businesses they didn't like intimidating people checkpoints harassing didn't like how you talk
[40:14.080 --> 40:18.880]  to take you in for interrogation you fall and hit your head by 37 they were just arresting
[40:18.880 --> 40:23.280]  and mass whoever they wanted put them in forced labor camps by 42 they were lining everybody up
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.480]  and shooting them and i'm telling you i've studied the sociology the anthropology the history
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.320]  the nazis were a lot nicer we got ron paul coming up he needs to go ahead and get in here i told him
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.400]  five minutes after i need to go ahead and get him in there now the point here is that
[40:38.400 --> 40:46.880]  that that this is the type of garbage that we're dealing with in a society by the way i'm glad
[40:47.760 --> 40:50.720]  yesterday i did a little piece about hitler and the olympic torch the olympic
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.000]  relay with the torch and and and the rings and all of it because you know a commenter on twitter
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.960]  said that that wasn't true hitler wasn't involved in the olympics hitler officially launched the
[41:00.960 --> 41:08.880]  modern olympics in 1936 okay and he did invent the torch and the style of old swag and and the
[41:09.440 --> 41:15.200]  procession of the torch lighting he modernized the rings and the design he drew became the
[41:15.200 --> 41:21.040]  modern symbol a french aristocrat who believed sports should be the new religion to replace
[41:21.040 --> 41:27.520]  christianity did originally in 1914 draw some similar rings that never got adopted because
[41:27.520 --> 41:33.520]  the olympics got cancelled because of world war one but my point was is that got off into
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.760]  how he said bring back bread and circus to control the population but also so we have
[41:37.760 --> 41:42.720]  a warrior class little fight the french seem to be more athletic like the germans and the
[41:42.720 --> 41:46.880]  germans were aware that that's why they seized on the olympics after and took it over and that
[41:46.880 --> 41:53.760]  just shows how we have an article where the us stamps issuers are are destroying stamps
[41:53.760 --> 42:00.160]  because they show kids playing ball and jump rope saying that's dangerous and basically racist
[42:00.160 --> 42:07.520]  my wife was at a dinner a few nights ago with some family distant family who were saying we're
[42:07.520 --> 42:14.560]  atheist blah blah blah and we're criticizing the owner of hobby lobby because he's christian and
[42:14.560 --> 42:20.800]  closed on sunday and sells christian stuff if you want it and my wife said well you know i'm a christian
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.680]  a lot of our families christian and uh you know it's not really fair that you're talking like that
[42:25.680 --> 42:37.600]  and she said she said hobby lobby is racist and basically so are you so racist now is dodgeball
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.680]  racist is being christian and that's what the tsa has said to me before they said you're a
[42:43.680 --> 42:48.720]  conspiracy theorist well i don't want to be groped if i next i expect you to go to a restaurant and
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.120]  say i don't like veal i don't think they treat the baby cows well i'll just take a regular steak
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.280]  oh you're you're you're a conspiracy theorist or or it'd be like if i had an opinion on the color
[42:59.280 --> 43:04.800]  of drapes and my wife didn't like it hypothetically i want green drapes not those pink ones oh that's
[43:04.800 --> 43:10.560]  racist it it's literally just this default setting of you're a bad person i'm a good person
[43:10.560 --> 43:16.560]  and the reason i digress off into all of this is
[43:20.480 --> 43:26.720]  the globalists have created this myth that there are these terrorists and that they're
[43:26.720 --> 43:30.000]  going to attack us so we're going to take all your rights keep you safe meanwhile they run the
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.120]  terrorist on record and that's the thing about it it's all naked now it's all completely absolutely
[43:37.120 --> 43:51.600]  naked now and you know i say now's the time to get out of dodge get out of dodge i didn't finish the
[43:51.600 --> 43:57.680]  rest the story the problem the reason i haven't left dodge is i can see this is a global program
[43:57.680 --> 44:02.880]  global standardization continuity of agenda in their own words this is going in worldwide the
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.600]  same system in fact the russians say they oppose it all but that's that's because they're not part
[44:07.600 --> 44:14.080]  of the power block they're all implementing the exact same stuff they're just they run it instead
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.880]  of the globalists running and they're not trying to sterilize everybody with vaccines they're
[44:18.880 --> 44:22.960]  paying people to have kids so they're not as eugenicist based because they've already gone
[44:22.960 --> 44:31.120]  through 80 years of that but the issue here is that we're in deep trouble we're in deep trouble
[44:31.120 --> 44:38.080]  as a society chris let's bring you on air chris jordan uh tell folks what you've heard the tsa
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.400]  announce yourself because some people are in the comments at info wars dot com and prison
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.080]  planet dot com kind of like they did it four years ago we started videotaping the groping of
[44:46.080 --> 44:51.440]  children taking diapers off babies grabbing women's breast tsa asking women out on dates
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.440]  they've paid out on lawsuits they're so disconnected from reality they'll pull a woman's
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.160]  sweater off grab their breasts and say i want to date you i mean that's how mentally ill they are
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.760]  they'll print off naked scans of women and say please sign this baby
[45:06.640 --> 45:10.800]  people said oh they're not groping and tsa said we're not groping people and then of course
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.520]  the video came out and they said well it's for your safety and it's the same thing people are
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.520]  like oh there's no way they're announcing if you make a joke at the airport we're going to arrest
[45:19.520 --> 45:26.400]  you when now since at least i've learned last christmas this is airing everywhere uh in fact
[45:26.400 --> 45:32.000]  christ jordan's heard it gg urnata has heard it and so has the rest of everybody that's flown
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.080]  has heard this and and it's almost like well yeah didn't you know they're airing this
[45:36.080 --> 45:42.640]  so so this is what they play in america oh by the way unattended bags oh by the way this facility
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.080]  oh by the way you make a joke we're gonna arrest you here it is
[45:47.440 --> 45:53.440]  pay particular attention to your luggage and personal belongings unattended luggage will
[45:53.440 --> 45:59.200]  and personal belongings may be treated as a danger to the facility do not be persuaded by
[45:59.200 --> 46:05.360]  strangers or individuals you do not know well to take articles aboard your flight you were also
[46:05.360 --> 46:12.400]  reminded that any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest we
[46:12.400 --> 46:18.240]  appreciate your cooperation while these measures are in effect and remember anyone caught criticizing
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.840]  the dear leader will be permanently detained and by the way they now we know thousands of christian
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.040]  groups pro-life groups in the memos destroyed them shut them down orders from the white house
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.560]  hundreds of meetings a month a month a month hundreds of meetings the leadership of the irs
[46:34.560 --> 46:38.560]  i mean they're in there with everybody's tax returns everybody's background go after him go
[46:38.560 --> 46:45.200]  after them beyond nixon and total lapdog establishment media and and and and trying to
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.480]  arrest and persecute pro-life groups these are authoritarians the sky is the limit of course
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.120]  if bus loads of people pull up during the shutdown the first day they pull guns on them and kidnap
[46:55.120 --> 47:00.240]  them for two days and cuss at them and scream at them i won't go to national parks now they've won
[47:00.240 --> 47:06.880]  it's theirs they they hate you they're arrogant it's their property not you you work for them and
[47:06.880 --> 47:12.320]  see it's an unnatural system where they have unlimited fiat money fiat currency always creates
[47:12.320 --> 47:17.760]  hyperinflation except if it's a selective economy and only given to government agencies select
[47:17.760 --> 47:24.320]  corporations and groups everybody else goes into a depression and then they've got all the extra money
[47:24.320 --> 47:29.600]  for their systems to grow like cancer so it's like cancer shutting off blood to everything else
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.960]  except itself and now we're like a dog that weighs 50 pounds dragging a 400 pound cancer around
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.880]  and the cancer hates us so much it's trying to kill us it'll die of course too but doesn't matter
[47:40.880 --> 47:45.440]  its instinct is i want it all i want it all i hate you i hate you because it looks at the dog
[47:45.440 --> 47:51.360]  and sees it has a spirit cancers you know with its little amoeba eyes are looking at the dog
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.240]  and hating it even though it's the dog's heart's barely beating and it's trying to kill it as fast
[47:56.240 --> 48:02.400]  as it can this is what tyranny's do just how many tsa agents have announced i'm god and gone crazy
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.720]  and stripped naked and began running around the airport it happens all the time because who else
[48:06.720 --> 48:12.640]  would want to sit there and dominate people eight hours a day while being fried by radiation now
[48:12.640 --> 48:17.760]  that said here's the big news in this segment the next with anthony gucciardi and i brought him in
[48:17.760 --> 48:26.480]  here today because i we broke this a few weeks ago back on september third i guess a month ago
[48:26.480 --> 48:31.840]  now time really flies exclusive high level source confirms secret us nuclear warhead transfer
[48:31.840 --> 48:37.440]  or this is a very dangerous report this is a real whistleblower okay of the highest magnitude
[48:37.440 --> 48:43.760]  when people go to prison people get killed now for just speaking out against the dear leader okay
[48:43.760 --> 48:47.600]  that's why we need your prayers folks and realize how important this is and by the grace of god we're
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.760]  still here because we're so prominent they're worried about crushing us they still may do that
[48:53.040 --> 48:57.840]  exclusive high level source confirms secret us nuclear warhead and again if you just joined us
[48:57.840 --> 49:04.960]  anthony gucciardi break down now we have another top nuke general over the all the all the missiles
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.720]  in the us has been relieved for quote loss of trust by the same guy tell us tell us what's happened
[49:13.040 --> 49:16.640]  go ahead and start over your mic wasn't on go ahead okay so as you may know when we broke
[49:16.640 --> 49:20.880]  this on september third basically it was a bombshell anyway and our source stopped responding
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.640]  to us which was concerning to me but the reality is that not only did lindsay graham come out later
[49:26.640 --> 49:30.640]  on that day and say there could be a nuclear strike in south carolina if we don't go to war
[49:30.640 --> 49:36.880]  with syria if we don't go to war with iran but then the second top commander of the nuclear arsenal
[49:36.880 --> 49:42.560]  got suspended over gambling which is a you know a bs charge he said he used fake chips or something
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.080]  like that and then but then the police it said it didn't happen and there was no charges right but
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.320]  here's the thing that no one's looking at both of these were anonymous from insiders in the
[49:50.320 --> 49:54.160]  government reporting to the news agencies they didn't want to report on this the government
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.760]  did not want to announce this same with this top new as usual you hit the key we're not even supposed
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.000]  to know all these top generals are being removed in some type of coup they're probably firing more
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.160]  of them but we're not even allowed to know these are whistleblowers inside of government going to
[50:08.160 --> 50:12.800]  the news organizations right here it says as well that they did not want to announce on september
[50:12.800 --> 50:16.960]  third the suspension because it remains under investigation and they did they weren't ready
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.560]  to go official with it wait a minute so this happened right when we reported this this happened
[50:20.560 --> 50:24.640]  on the same day that's the next thing people don't even understand oh my gosh i didn't even yeah it's
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.680]  buried at the but look look at this very bottom of the article um it says they didn't want to report
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.320]  it on some daily mail let's show that the exact same day it happened it comes out weeks later that
[50:34.320 --> 50:40.320]  exact day that guy was suspended over a lie a lie over a lottery charge obviously what do you
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.000]  think's really going on here he didn't want to do it he did not want to transfer this nuke off
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.840]  record with no transfer paper secretly to south carolina because he knew what might go on and
[50:47.840 --> 50:51.920]  then this guy i believe was more like a whistleblower and they need to shut him up and it's the same
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.720]  guys firing all of them the same guys that are doing all the bidding and i rack and everything
[50:56.720 --> 51:01.520]  oh my gosh i can't believe we're in the middle of this we'll be right back from the makers of

[55:15.280 --> 55:18.800]  just breaking so it's hard to go and sift through it but once we're finding out more it makes more
[55:18.800 --> 55:24.000]  sense so the original guy we reported the missing nuke report with the super high level military
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.400]  intelligence who's now not responding to us anymore on september 3rd then lindsay graham that same
[55:28.400 --> 55:33.200]  day came out and said there's going to be a nuclear strike it looks like if we don't go
[55:33.200 --> 55:40.320]  against syria and i ran in south carolina but on the same day the second in command it looks like
[55:40.320 --> 55:46.080]  was suspended if not fired later on the summer level day we reported this but then it gets worse
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.920]  they didn't announce that it turns out they didn't want to until an anonymous leaker inside the
[55:51.920 --> 55:56.400]  government it's one of these documents basically came out and said it was happening and then at
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.080]  the end of the article it says they didn't want to do it on so they didn't want to announce it on
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.800]  september 3rd because they were still investigating but then this gets worse so now that was the
[56:04.800 --> 56:11.840]  second guy right on september 3rd this is the guy general in charge of nukes the top guy and
[56:11.840 --> 56:18.800]  here we have the report not only was he fired but they actually didn't want to say anything about it
[56:18.800 --> 56:23.040]  the officials disclosed the matter to the ap on condition of anonymity that's in the associated
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.320]  press that there's a secret purge of generals going on and that's what i said at the time
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.200]  they found an email about it someone forwarded an email about it it must have been ultra classified
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.040]  they didn't want to announce this so they want to fire all these guys off record behind the scenes
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.360]  black op style and just get rid of them because then later they can die of a fast acting cancer
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.760]  yes exactly i have a heart attack but get this people were saying oh it's just routine you know
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.000]  it's the icbm inspection oh yeah they're saying that at info wars dot com they're saying the operatives
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.200]  are look here's the exact response the decision was made by james kowalski and basically this
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.800]  guy is in charge an internal email revealed that it was due to a temporary duty assignment that this
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.520]  guy failed to do around that exact same time so what was that temporary duty assignment the guy
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.320]  failed to do that would fire him over i mean this guy was in charge of fleets he was in charge of
[57:10.320 --> 57:14.880]  when you fired generals issues of congressional hearings i mean it's it's hardly ever fired
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.160]  them you give them you know honorary service or anything like that this guy's damn done you're
[57:18.160 --> 57:24.400]  fired you are fired instantly and then it's and it's the guys all in charge of the nukes yeah
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.520]  the guy not with graham running around the night after we set her the night saying oh my gosh the
[57:29.520 --> 57:37.360]  nukes gonna blow us up and the nukes are going there yes it's one thing if we just had the nuclear
[57:37.360 --> 57:40.400]  intelligence if we had graham coming out and saying we're just getting all these guys yeah here's the
[57:40.400 --> 57:43.680]  deal our source didn't know why they were disappearing these nukes they weren't even supposed to be
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.040]  there no these are secret black ops nukes disappearing everybody's freaking out over it
[57:49.040 --> 57:53.360]  we don't know why and then all of a sudden the top generals all start disappearing and being fired i
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.880]  mean this is incredible and the what does your gut tell you i think the first one refused to do it
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.200]  this second guy either refused to do it or was a whistleblower but i i don't need to guess it says
[58:03.200 --> 58:06.720]  he failed to do a temporary duty assignment temporary duty assignments such as moving the
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.520]  nuclear weapon which was unsigned for to south carolina i mean why else would you fire a top
[58:11.520 --> 58:16.240]  nuclear commander and then have this other guy in a phony charge of lottery tickets or gambling or
[58:16.240 --> 58:22.000]  whatever and they put the most trusted over these the most sane the best backgrounds and notice they
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.480]  probably said we're not doing this because i mean i know the nukes disappeared i mean that's real
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.240]  yeah now this is all happening i don't know what's going on this is a problem to cover on it
[58:30.240 --> 58:34.000]  they might not be able to do anything if we keep doing it but the fact the matter is they look like
[58:34.000 --> 58:46.160]  they and i tell you i this feels super dangerous i tell you this is gcn the genesis communications
[58:46.160 --> 58:55.760]  radio network ben swan here we are winning alternative media is challenging and beating
[58:55.760 --> 59:00.640]  mainstream media and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum

[59:58.720 --> 1:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:26.480]  congressman ron paul the former congressman scheduled to join us coming up the next segment
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:32.960]  uh you've got two top nuke generals an admiral and a general removed turns out one of them that
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:38.560]  the afternoon after we broke the missing nuke story last month now the other top nuke general has
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:44.160]  been removed and anthony guttiardy undoubtedly our source missing nukes that's that's a real
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:48.800]  source we didn't know what it meant then graham announces south carolina is going to be blown
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:54.560]  up when the nukes were being sent to that area from our source then we learned this top general
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:59.200]  was removed that day that afternoon but that the ap says that they wanted to keep it secret but it
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:04.880]  leaked now another top generals removed and now we have all these articles about it i mean we need
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:10.000]  to find out what's going on here immediately we may our source may have stopped a false flag
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.920]  this sounds like some kind of nuclear coup sounds like these guys weren't playing ball but they'd
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:17.200]  still be in place and both of these were leaked you mentioned the first one the second one was
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:23.440]  their leaked email so here's the guy james kowalski he's the one firing the top guy right now so these
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:29.360]  are super higher ups i mean this is someone that has the ability to fire the top nuke commander
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:34.240]  not the second that's lieutenant general yes lieutenant general and then we have this guy
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:40.160]  who's his boss that looks like an alien bored clone show them side by side yeah they look
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:45.360]  they look very similar and we're not saying a thing like that's just it's a joke yeah a joke
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:52.160]  yes but um they look you know typical military uh guys and they're going around firing all these
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:02:00.240]  new commanders and then get this replacing them with this guy jack weinstein and i don't know
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:05.120]  his deal yet this is the big news this is breaking as of like 30 minutes who is mr weinstein well the
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:09.280]  only thing i could find is that he's been assigned to the pentagon since 2009 so he's at their home
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.480]  base you know he's probably kept and what is his rank he is uh well he's going to be now the new
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:19.120]  commander of the whole united states but he's a major general right now of the air force now my
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:24.560]  thing is as we're talking all fair it looks as if they were asking these two individuals that were
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:29.280]  fired the number one new commander and the number two new commander to ship the nuke unsigned transfer
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:34.240]  which already did happen but then potentially authorize a false flag event in south carolina
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:39.920]  as a pretext to go to syria and that would ultimately maybe worked but we blew the lid on it
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:44.000]  and the second thing is this looks like the second guy might have been a whistleblower as well
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.720]  against this and these guys go in and say okay you're not going to play ball we'll get rid of you
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:52.880]  and put this guy in who's from the pentagon and other ones might be as well i don't know but this
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:57.360]  guy's been with the pentagon since 2009 and he might play ball he might do whatever they want
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:01.200]  he might be the kind of guy that's you know just a fill in there they they build him up and throw
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:07.840]  him oh look at weinstein yeah yeah so that's my so that's the guy with all the nukes yes this is now
[1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:13.680]  the uh controller of all the nuclear weapons in the united states air force wise that can be attached
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:19.200]  to obama and let's flash and then in 2007 we had the minot missing missing nukes which they said
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:23.440]  wasn't true at first and was confirmed and all the people started dying yeah yeah well it ain't
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:28.240]  going to be me i hope well i hope so too i mean i hope it's not the source either again we can't
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:34.000]  get in contact with them but what i do know is that all this information we have now we're not
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.760]  supposed to have it was all anonymous leaked emails and stuff and that's why they're so scared of leaks
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:42.000]  it'll stop their criminal takeover that's why obama's they're not allowed to just nuke stuff or
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.720]  steal nukes because obama's god yeah basically they're saying we're not even allowed to know
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:50.320]  if there was a nuclear transfer and then what happened when i called dais was really really
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:54.160]  weird they said it's pretty much illegal it's against policy it's illegal for us to even talk
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:58.080]  about nukes they said that and then i kept pruning them and they said they got a bunch of calls and
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:01.680]  then officially on facebook they weren't they wouldn't even talk to me in person they just
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:07.440]  said on facebook that didn't happen according to our website so they kept denying it in weird
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:11.760]  ways that weren't even real like saying that did not happen according to our official press release
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:14.960]  like they they didn't answer the question the official press release was we don't comment on
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:20.080]  nuke transfer exactly so it's it's very obvious to me what's going on and it should be obvious to
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.160]  anyone listening well there was a big freak out at the base when this happened like a nuke's aren't
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:29.440]  supposed to be here under treaty since 86 when you see them on google maps yeah yeah the bunkers
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:34.560]  what's going on here it turns out well the mostation there this is where the b2 bombers are at this
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:39.120]  is crazy congressman ron paul former congressman coming up uh anthony we're going to be covering

[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:33.040]  well former congressman ron paul joins us and it's very exciting to see he's got a new best
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:38.560]  seller out we'll talk about that he's launched his own radio tv network and is fighting the info
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:43.920]  war and boy we couldn't think of a better time to have him with his economic knowledge and all of
[1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:50.880]  his financial predictions unfortunately coming true like prophecy with the debt limit uh with
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:55.920]  the chinese communist lecturing us and the imf lecturing us like we're some third world country
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:01.520]  being being conquered by financial interest uh with the so-called government shut down arresting
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:06.640]  people that show up at the national parks letting illegals have a demonstration on the mall but
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:11.840]  closing it to everyone else uh former congressman ron paul thank you for joining us sir good to be
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:17.600]  with you today alex there's so much happening i mean what do we tackle first well why don't we
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:23.520]  solve all the problems of washington let the bus come it's coming soon they're not going to work
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:28.320]  their way out of it so that's going to collapse this just keep working on the fact that when we
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:34.560]  get around to rebuilding this whole entire system that we do it the way it was intended originally
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:38.960]  and actually improve upon it i think the concept of liberty has advanced even since the time of the
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:45.920]  founders but we've regressed so desperately far from what they intended i think we should anticipate
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:50.800]  that you know in the future in the next several years you're going to see a big big collapse of
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.600]  this and then we have to talk about what kind of a monetary policy why we need to bring our troops
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:03.200]  home why we have to quit expanding the deficit every every day and you raising these debt limits
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:09.600]  and planning on total socialized medicine that all has to end and uh it's going to end because it's
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:15.440]  going to fail i think we should anticipate that and look at it as an opportunity and that's our
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:21.200]  job to make sure that people know what is best for us and i i'm always arguing the case that less
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:27.920]  government more freedom is what we need dr ron paul's our guest sir many top analysts have said
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:35.760]  that the american empire is in its beginning stages of death and now a lot of columnists and others
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:41.200]  are saying look this looks like the beginning of the end of this kleptocratic mega government
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:47.920]  what is your take on when the big event is coming or will it be a a group of events well it's it's
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:54.480]  hard to protect the timing but i think i agree with the assessment that it that it will end and i
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:59.280]  look at it like a building standing but no foundation yeah it's sort of sitting there and
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:05.120]  wobbling but it hasn't crashed and i think it will because you know the financial system is so unstable
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:09.840]  it's totally based on debt and confidence in a dollar and confidence in the fed that they'll
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:13.280]  always print the right amount of money and they'll always keep the interest rates right and they'll
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:18.960]  always bail out everybody that needs bailed out which i think is a total hoax so the event the
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:24.800]  big event could occur next week it could occur in five years from now and i i just think it's too
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:32.800]  difficult to to predict but so far there has been a steady erosion in that direction that is there's
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:38.000]  less confidence now the fed has to buy more foreign debt and more mortgage debt because
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.200]  their foreigners are buying a lot less but the trust is still there they're still anticipating
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:49.920]  that fed is is credible and the dollar is still credible but uh eventually that will be lost and
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:55.680]  exactly when that's going to happen i i don't know but i would think in the next several years
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:00.880]  you're going to see some very major changes and a real challenge to all of us on what is what's
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:06.640]  going to replace it dr paul gallup and other polls show the lowest approval rating ever for
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:12.080]  government in general the lowest level of trust i think that's a positive thing that tells me people
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:18.800]  are finally starting to realize how much trouble we're in absolutely you know uh you know if if
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:25.680]  somebody's trying to recover from uh alcoholism or drugs the they say it can't be done unless they
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:30.960]  acknowledge you know that there's a problem and things are very negative before you start doing
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:37.200]  the right things and i think a five percent uh uh you you know trust the factor for the government
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:42.960]  is is really a good sign because that means that uh now they're quit believing the government i mean
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:47.280]  they they don't trust the government they don't believe the government the government always
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:53.920]  lies to us and uh whether it's foreign policy or domestic policy and then we have clapper and these
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:58.800]  other guys get them these committees and and lie to us about what they're doing and how they're
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:06.000]  spying on us so the people have you know have a right to challenge this and i think the internet
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:11.520]  helps i think radio shows like yours helps i think everything that we do in this day helps and it's
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:18.720]  so much different than it was before we had these vehicles and of course the system was always assumed
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.960]  to be much healthier than it is today but uh you know just think i just think how quickly the
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:31.120]  soviet system disappeared i think that was the greatest miracle uh or event at least in the 20th
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:36.800]  century that nobody was you know the day before the month before the year before said oh you know
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:41.760]  next year the soviet system would be gone that everybody would have considered that person nuts
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:46.560]  but it was fragile and it fell apart it went quickly and thank goodness we didn't have to
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:52.400]  have a nuclear war in order to get rid of the soviet system so i think we're in a we're probably
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:57.680]  1987 right now where the soviets were at 87 and within two years it was gone
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:04.880]  uh sir i 100 agree with what you just stated in fact i've made the point that i believe we're
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:13.280]  1987 if you were comparing it to each germany 1989 we're about 1989 if you compare it to 1991
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:19.200]  i hope that homeland security just stands down uh if some type of collapse happens it doesn't try
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:23.760]  to go around squeezing the public but they appear to be organizing to do just that but here's the
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:30.560]  good news i like your take on this we saw the world stand up including uh congress and others
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:38.800]  led by your son uh saying no to backing al-qaeda uh no to expanding the war in syria uh we've
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:44.400]  seen obama's total push to get our guns failed for now uh basically everything they've tried
[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:50.240]  has failed they got obama care but now they can't even implement that maybe mitch mcconnell's right
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:54.480]  maybe let them try to implement it instead of them blaming libertarians and conservatives
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:15:01.760]  for the mess that's happening no i think we're at that point uh you know just let it go uh not
[1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:06.160]  that i criticize those who have been fighting it i've been i was fighting at all the chances i've
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:12.800]  ever had but i think let it go maybe the people are so angry now again loss of trust they can't
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:20.080]  even sign up you know it it's such a it's such a mess but you know what uh you mentioned the change
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:27.360]  in attitude about nsa as well as syria i think that is just great stuff but even in another issue
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:33.280]  sometimes more controversial for some people and that is the government has just about conceded
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:41.840]  with the the state's uh right to uh legalize the use of marijuana and uh that is a freedom issue
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:47.600]  and if the state's right it is something even liberals you know sort of like it's a bellwether
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:53.200]  because the liberals are defending states right but you know they're they're starting to talk about
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:58.080]  state laws changing monetary policy and standing up for their rights so i think
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:04.080]  nullification is here today it's as healthy as it's been in you know the last 200 years
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:09.680]  really it was only tested early on and uh but i think i think it represents nullification
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:17.520]  they're just backing off because when the people overwhelm the politicians will respond and i know
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:22.080]  it's very frustrating with a lot of people they say no they never listen they never listen but
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:26.640]  but that's because there aren't enough people when the numbers are there and you pointed it out
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:34.000]  they had to respond and and and rain in uh obama when it came to syria and hopefully the softening
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.480]  stand against iran is also a reflection of the people's attitude 75 percent of the people don't
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:42.880]  want us to go to work against iran i don't even understand why you have five percent of the people
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:48.720]  want to start a war with the iranians that is so stupid and yet there's still something out there
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:56.400]  and the neocons are crying up a blue because of of all that and that uh he's back down a little bit
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:01.520]  but it's the american people that count that's why i think attitudes are so important sure and
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.360]  former congressman ron paul joins us want to get into homeschooling and your new book that really
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:10.080]  is at the heart of the solution here before you got going about five minutes but first off
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:17.360]  looking at the government shutdown itself and and nullification overall california just nullified
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:23.680]  the ndaa secret arrest attack on heaviest corpus so again it does show even the grassroots left
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:29.520]  can begin to understand the tyranny and and recognize states rights and nullification
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:34.320]  are there for a reason but looking at the government shutdown you you've only got 17
[1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:38.560]  percent of the government that's actually shut down and that's stuff that the people actually
[1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:43.600]  use like national parks and other areas they're giving tickets to people that jog on the sidewalk
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:48.320]  by national parks they're closing areas of arlington cemetery the tomb of the unknown soldier
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:54.480]  the uh iwo jima thing i mean the instinct of authoritarians to try to dominate everyone when
[1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:59.120]  it's backfiring it does give credence to your point that they're really a bunch of buffoons
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:06.720]  yeah and this whole thing you know about the shutdown uh is a farce you know it's political
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:13.120]  gamesmanship and it's amazing that the president doesn't get much more negative press out of this
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:19.840]  but you know his buddies in the media keep keep trying to prop him up but there is no real shutdown
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:25.920]  you know they're always passing a law or obama makes a ruling yesterday it was the issue of
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:32.560]  uh taking care of the veteran of individuals that have died in the war and given their benefits
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:37.520]  you know that they can do anything they want if they can bail out nations and banks everything
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:41.360]  else to the tune of trillions of dollars they're not going to allow a default and they're not and
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:46.080]  they could do anything that they desire here the only thing they close down are those visible
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:51.520]  things that have a political implication and hopefully the american people will be cynical
[1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:58.080]  enough and realize that it's a joke it's a real joke and a farce on on what they're doing and i
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:03.840]  think uh i think this is good that the people you know are waking up and realizing uh you know it's
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:08.720]  a bunch of politicians uh trying to outdo each other well just approval you just said look at
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:14.320]  what they did for months when they couldn't pass a debt level increase uh they just said oh our
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:18.560]  debt's not going up into an accounting gimmick so obama's saying we're going to crash if you
[1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:23.200]  don't do what i say he's the one engaged in financial terrorism and i want you to speak to
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:30.640]  that and then janet yellen if folks thought ben was a hyperinflator wow i'm told she's the she's
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:36.560]  the actual author of this doctor yeah that's right well this this october 17th is another
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:41.360]  farce just like the closing down of government they should be worrying about the breakdown of
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:48.240]  government which will come but uh that date is arbitrary picked out of the clear blue and the
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:53.360]  national debt reached the point where it is right now the official debt breached in may
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:58.240]  so they've been doing what they want to do so they always could do this whole idea that they don't
[1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:03.600]  that they won't have money to pay the interest you know why why who cares whether they pay the
[1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:08.320]  interest to the federal reserve you know and they hold two trillion dollars so you could take care
[1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:14.800]  of this debt if you're looking for just excuses to prop it up uh but this is just a gimmick
[1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:19.360]  to try to frighten the people and say if you don't do it you know your benefits are going to
[1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:26.240]  disappear and government is won't be there and the president needs your support but uh it's always
[1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:33.360]  there and we have to realize how what the fed has done for the bailouts and they're always there
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:38.160]  they bailed out the system to the tune of trillions of dollars and now that we're getting a new
[1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:44.960]  chairwoman of the fed we shouldn't feel any more relaxed about it because she is a much greater
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:52.160]  inflationist than even greenspan and brunette and uh but she tells us she's all for transparency
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:57.760]  i wonder if that means she's going to be for my audit the fed bill uh but don't don't hold your
[1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:05.520]  breath on that but she believes she supported all the queues and uh and she would even do more
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:11.120]  she is not going to back off because there's a little bit of immediate pain with the stock market
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:17.680]  if you if you even back off from 85 billion dollars of new money every month or to 75
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:23.680]  it would be a hysterical reaction on wall street she's not going to do that so my bet is that we
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:28.640]  are going to continue to inflate and continue to destroy the dollar until the world rejects a dollar
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:32.560]  and that's uh what we should be concerned about i want to talk about the book in closing but
[1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:36.960]  briefly peter schiff who i know is one of your top economic advisors and a great mind and
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:41.280]  many of his predictions have come true like the fact that they wouldn't taper he said last week
[1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:46.400]  last friday here and drudge report dot com picked it up became a national story he said they may
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:51.840]  want to collapse because then they can bring in tyranny as the solution and he's worried about
[1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:57.280]  that dr paul craig roberts the former had a policy at the treasury said the same thing many others are
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:02.320]  i mean is there a method to the madness do you think the obama people just like he's getting
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:06.400]  away with obama care right now and getting away with being the one behind the shutdown it's hard
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:10.800]  to say because you'd have to really read their minds and their motivations which i can't do
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:16.880]  i think it's closer to stupidity than it is that oh this have a collapse that we can do such and
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:22.560]  such but remember how many in the administration have always said don't ever let a crisis go to
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:28.720]  waste so it's probably a lot of that too uh policies are going to bring on these crises
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:34.080]  and that has always been used as an excuse to expand the role of government you know just like
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:38.560]  just like the fed you know when they create the bubbles and then they create the bursting of the
[1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:43.200]  bubbles then they say well what we need is more of that you know it's on and on sure but are you
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:48.320]  concerned about the continued increase of militarized police and that martial law could come during a
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:54.240]  collapse absolutely that should be a major concern and and then of course hopefully you know this
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:23:00.240]  whole move toward notification and kicking the feds out i hope that continues to grow uh and
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:04.960]  when they run out of money and they go broke that's going to happen you know uh what's what's
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:10.080]  happening uh maybe a good place to look is in detroit you know uh they don't have a police
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:16.960]  department anymore of of worth much and it it burgers on anarchy i'm interested to see if the
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:22.560]  crime rate goes down in uh detroit it may well go down when everybody has no they have to take care
[1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:28.480]  of themselves but no i hope i hope the the local people one of the worst things that happen on this
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:35.200]  local police stuff was that if they were able to confiscate property airplanes and boats and cars
[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:40.880]  they get to keep them it doesn't get sold in the treasure they get to keep that so they have this
[1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:46.720]  tremendous incentive to seize property and then the owners whether they're guilty or not can
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:51.760]  practically never get it back in that help this whole move toward the militarization that's right
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:57.600]  we have a started acting like armies and uh that the federal government uh we have a predatory
[1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:01.760]  government in closing as you've got to go the school revolution i've got my copy i want to
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:06.720]  carry an info or store dot com it's on amazon everywhere i've studied this myself if we take
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:11.120]  our children back i mean the status say this they say we've got your kids we're going to win in the
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:16.240]  end now they're not letting them play dodgeball football they're banning stamps federally that
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:21.360]  show kids doing sports i mean this is a cult of control freaks if we take our children away
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:26.560]  from them isn't that the key way to win uh former congressman ron paul tell us about your book in
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:32.960]  closing absolutely and that is the goal because obama wants to get him at the age of four it's
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:39.120]  a bad move and homeschooling is an option it's not for every single person but there has to be
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:46.000]  always an an ability to opt out of a government system hopefully we get an opt out on medical care
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.560]  but that doesn't look good but right now we still have the right to opt out with private schools
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:55.520]  and homeschooling and i am going to do my darkness because every single day you hear a story of some
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:00.000]  stupid thing that happened in the government school and i said that there they go get their
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.920]  kids out as soon as possible congressman ron paul we wish you were still there in congress uh and
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:09.760]  i guess uh you're just moving forward writing books doing the tv show that's having a lot of
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:15.440]  success traveling speaking uh going to college campuses and uh things are going well and i
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:19.680]  appreciate the chance to be with you again today you bet ron paul channel dot com thank you sir okay
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:23.920]  thanks dog you bet there goes former congressman ron paul keep calling him congressman i've been
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:29.520]  interviewing him for 17 years since he got back in congress i've been interviewing that guy before
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.720]  he got back in congress he had one term in the 80s and then wouldn't go along with the republicans
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:40.320]  increasing debt and stuff so he got kicked out as a libertarian and then came back in 1996 and
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:46.320]  i've been interviewing ron paul since he was running again and rand would come on uh because
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.080]  ron paul would come on every few weeks and get support because his district used to come up
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:53.840]  into the edge of austin all the way down to houston and they rewrote it a bunch and then
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:59.520]  rand would call the office and say hey we need an extra push right before the election but
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:05.280]  the last few times he was elected it was like 70 percent of the vote and that's when they
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:10.240]  rewrote his district into liberal areas thinking it would beat him he would go then talk to those
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:15.440]  folks and defeat them so always great to have former congressman ron paul on the broadcast and
[1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:21.600]  i just can't believe we're sitting here talking with a straight face about a government that no
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:28.720]  one has been able to sign up at healthcare dot dot gov the ones that have been able to have
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:34.160]  have gotten phone numbers with the media and and called and been able to be signed up on the news
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.880]  and mike adams was actually joining us he's not just the health ranger he's a great computer
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:46.320]  programmer and a software engineer he's helped us out a lot with stuff on the back end before uh of
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:51.760]  our sites heads up natural news dot com he's going to be coming on to talk about a whole group of
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:56.480]  articles and if i could probably in my folder if not print me his last three four articles dealing
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:01.040]  with the different facets of how it's a fake website how it's not real how they're grabbing
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:05.760]  your ip address because everything i saw him writing a week and a half ago a week ago two days
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:10.400]  ago days later comes out in the corporate media and turns out it's true of course i mean i knew he
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.640]  was saying it and he's accurate but it's just that they're having to admit it he's breaking
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:19.280]  so much of this and they're not getting credit of course that's how it always works look i really
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:24.960]  don't care about getting credit i'll be honest with you i just get excited when what we cover later
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:31.520]  comes out uh in the uh kleptocratic press and again the kleptocratic decepticon press isn't
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:37.520]  as powerful as it used to be it's a shadow of itself but still when it finally is there then
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:44.160]  people will address it more even in the alternative media and even in some of the more fair areas of
[1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:49.760]  the old media and so it is important to kind of force it out uh to get them to cover it
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:52.800]  the problem is the folks that get their news from mainstream media are already so dumb
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:58.720]  down does even really matter i mean we are the real press here and so even if it's not breaking
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:03.760]  in the mainstream media it's breaking here i mean we told you that we're missing nukes on september
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:10.160]  second and then they started talking about firing all these nuke commanders and nukes
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:13.920]  are going to blow up the east coast exactly where the nukes were sent i mean i don't know what this
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:19.920]  means the people that gave us the info were totally freaked out and totally on target
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:27.920]  and totally credible and totally high level and it was a big circus it dies air force based
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:31.520]  over this because they weren't supposed to send those out and reportedly took the base commander
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:35.120]  given the order and by the way if this hadn't happened the base commander would come out and
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:39.200]  say i was a liar wouldn't they i mean i want you understand something i don't just say this every
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:46.560]  day i'm risking my life bringing you this information okay on the nukes because they can ignore me on
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:51.760]  the big issues we cover because everybody else is covering it now too alex jones was a lonely
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:57.120]  voice 18 years ago i'm not a lonely voice now and that's a good thing but i tell you it's this
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:02.960]  whistleblower stuff it's this whistleblower stuff that really my spidey sense says man
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:09.440]  you are crossing the line and i just weren't on record that i know i am and that i think anthony

[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:18.560]  me up front in my family because you know who's walking absolute point on this a team operation

[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:30.480]  star and i've i mean i've seen a lot of journalists kill i've seen a lot of people shut down put in

[1:33:18.480 --> 1:33:26.240]  hey hell i pay the price all i want is to be left alone in my average home but why do i always feel
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:31.520]  like i miss the twilight sun and my friends when we get high-level sources saying that nukes that
[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:36.480]  weren't supposed to be in these bunkers were pulled out loaded on trucks that weren't supposed to
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:42.880]  even be authorized to transfer nukes and were shipped and then right outside the base is the
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:50.080]  biggest nuke uh building facility in the us they had missing nukes back in 2007 people blew the
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:56.000]  whistle and six people were killed at the base uh my not north dakota when that news came out to
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:04.080]  cover up who gave the order i mean this is serious business okay serious business i'm gonna get back
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:08.880]  into it ever jessie ventura leaves us in the next hour about to go to mike adams with key intel
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:15.520]  because i just keep noticing it's like daniel said three weeks ago it's going to be identity theft
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:18.800]  in this and they're going to give it to acorn like groups and then it turns out it's groups
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:23.840]  worse than acorn convicted of fraud and scams and any theft running it and now it's an associated
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:29.440]  press well same thing with mike adams he said like four articles i saw last week and this week
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:36.640]  that then days later it comes out in the mainstream news but it's incredible it shocks me how fraudulent
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:42.560]  this is it's just a giant database for the nsa to find out who doesn't have insurance so they can
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:46.960]  then go mess with these people and find them it's getting you to report on yourself the fine is the
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:54.080]  scam and i have that from high level sources they're going to take everybody's uh savings they're
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:58.880]  going to take the tax returns the the tax refunds they're going to garnish wages and it's all being
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:03.600]  announced they're going to grab bank accounts they hired 17 000 irs people it was five thousand
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:11.280]  10 000 15 000 now 17 000 and i mean i know they're criminals but it's so bold we're going to
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:16.880]  mic in a moment uh by the way uh remember info war store dot com we have the pro pure pro one
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:24.000]  water filtration to cut out the led the mercury the arsenic the glyphosates uh the hydrofluorosalic

[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:34.480]  not just pro pure and the pro one system 10 off of promo code water the lowest price
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:38.880]  and your purchase makes this broadcast possible and then we have the nascent iodine survival
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:44.560]  shield it came so highly recommended by dr group and mike adams and so many other experts uh for
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:48.880]  your thyroid health and during any radiological event you know thyroid blocks some of the radio
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:54.240]  active isotopes but it's it's the toxic forms that homeland security others are out there promoting
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:36:01.040]  because it's cheap and quick this is the nascent pure atomic form uh and it's on the same periodic
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:05.920]  area the table as the fluoride so it's also a fluoride detox are on record info wars life
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:10.960]  dot com to find that we sold out of it some more did come in and your purchase also supports the
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:15.440]  broadcast it's double the strength at half the cost of leading competitors you can also call
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:24.400]  toll free 8882533139 8882533139 with all the crazy stuff going on with Fukushima in the northern
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:29.120]  hemisphere having increased radiation levels i personally and for my family use the nascent
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:32.880]  iodine and before mike leaves us because he's an expert on this i'm going to ask him because he said
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:37.680]  nascent iodine's so great and everything why is it making me lose weight faster than other stuff
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:42.560]  why do i feel so good i mean this is amazing i can't wait to get up to group on about it i mean
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:48.160]  i've been doing it about two months now and um it's it's it's really incredible uh but but shifting
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:55.440]  years out of that natural news dot com i saw this article uh you know over the weekend i saw articles
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:37:02.160]  last week because he's a really successful computer programmer uh head fake is health care dot gov
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.560]  only an empty shell mock-up of a working obama care exchange and then the article he breaks down
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:10.640]  that it is well it came out in mainstream news yesterday we covered it that indeed they're
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:15.520]  saying it's just a facade it's fake you've got to get a number and then call to say you've been
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:21.200]  successfully the 10 in the poll that successfully signed up we now learn today didn't sign up they
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:27.040]  just thought they were like a nigerian email you are 5000 you think you're getting 10 million it
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:31.280]  it's not real you think you're getting it you don't here's his other one natural news dot com
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:35.680]  media admits if obama care isn't fixed in a month panic will ensue that's his latest
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:41.600]  obama care computer code riddle with typos latin filter text yeah just the you know the the fake
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:46.480]  text it's fake programming despite programmer comments and disastrous architecture so mike's
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:52.080]  been in the back end of this and can tell us what's going on just like programmers went to the
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:56.880]  back end of the amber alert being blocked and it was all still there that was a just department fake
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:02.960]  they got caught had to restore it i mean this is this is a bunch of commie globalist saboteurs folks
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:08.640]  i cannot stress to you how criminal these people are i mean i just i cannot believe
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:14.160]  that it's this open but i guess they've been doing secret testing on us for decades i mean
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:20.240]  why not but that was small globalist cadres now they've gotten so many crooks in the system
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:25.120]  that i guess they think it's their time mike before we get into obama care itself i want to
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:30.960]  ask you are you feeling the surreal nature right now are you freaked out like i am or am i am i
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:36.560]  wrong i mean i just they're acting nuts like arresting people to grand canyon pointing guns
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:41.280]  at german and japanese tourists that pull up on buses putting people in hotels for two days under
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:48.160]  gunpoint uh arresting kids that play dodgeball i mean what's going on here no it's reached a level
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:53.200]  of insanity that's just beyond absurd beyond orwellian and that's why i want to give a shout
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:58.240]  out to the truckers who are staging their protests in washington i want to give a shout out to all
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:04.000]  the veterans the greatest generation the world war two vets you storm every barricade in america we
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:09.680]  the people will support you we will not let the obama administration victimize you who gave us
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:15.280]  the freedoms that obama is destroying it's it's completely unacceptable it's it's out of control
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:22.880]  we're reaching a real crisis here alex which might result in a in a revolt or a reform or
[1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:30.800]  something really radically different coming uh getting to obama care it is it's like an end game
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:38.560]  it is a computer code nuclear option in in essence this system there are so many important
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:43.760]  points to make here number one when you sign up when you enroll through healthcare.gov just
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:50.240]  creating an account you contractually agree to waive your fifth amendment rights against self
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:56.960]  incrimination the system confirms that they will turn over everything you give them social security
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:00.960]  numbers driver's license numbers financial institution bank accounts employment history
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:06.800]  they will turn that over to law enforcement and irs auditors we also know the nsa is of course
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:11.280]  getting a copy of all of this which is one reason why the system is so broken because the nsa
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:15.280]  isn't working correctly with their new utah data center right now yeah notice this all was supposedly
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:21.440]  going to go online at the same time now it's catching on fire it is it is disastrous now the
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:26.240]  mainstream media has not yet woken up to this because mainstream media journalists are not
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:31.600]  programmers they don't know how to look at code they don't know what it means i happen to have a
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:36.560]  you know a long it development history i ran a big successful software company i founded it and i
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:41.760]  ran r&d teams for over a decade my assessment of the code and there are others who of course know
[1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:48.480]  more than i do about it but even my casual assessment of the code indicates this system at this point
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:55.440]  it would be faster to scrap it and start over than to fix the current system this is three years away
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:41:00.880]  three years away from being up and running smoothly the way they intended to there is no way alex that
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:07.440]  this is going to work by november december or january one not a chance zero chance and i'm
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:12.720]  saying that on the record this ron paul says stand down he ron paul stands to stand down
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:16.800]  this is big news and let it go through they're going to blame us he agrees with mitch mcconnell
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:23.360]  it's so horrible they've jumped the titan of sharks this will destroy them uh this strategy
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:29.760]  i happen to agree with i think we should let obama care go ahead and let it roll out because it's
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:34.640]  going to implode on its own i agree we should start calling congress tell them nope okay in the
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:40.480]  government shutdown give them whatever they want it's going to implode this this is so disastrous
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:47.280]  alex because the the obama care platform was the fantasy dream of the socialists of the democrats of
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:52.960]  the liberal obama worshipers and obama bots this was the dream everybody's going to have free or
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:57.600]  affordable health care and you're going to be able to go online and sign up it's done you don't have
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:03.120]  to worry about it again the failure of this program is the failure of obama this is the
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:08.720]  downfall of the fantasy land thinking of democrat did we miscalculate trying to block it or was that
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:14.400]  the moral right thing to do no until we saw the the the launch we didn't know so i don't think
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:20.400]  we miscalculated i think morally this has to be blocked but now that we know this thing is going
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:24.720]  to implode and any competent programmer could could confirm we need to get away from it and
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.680]  totally let him own it exactly because it's going to crash now then you got to think about alex
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:36.720]  what is obama willing to do to distract america from this impending catastrophic disastrous
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:44.160]  failure will he start a war will he start martial law will he you know false flag operations what
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:48.400]  to what lengths will he go you know fast and furious was just the tip of the iceberg this
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:54.480]  is an administration that will do anything to make sure that it doesn't take the heat for failed
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:43:01.280]  promises so you got to really wonder is there a financial crash coming by design to distract
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.160]  people from this failure that's going to become obvious to everybody by january one this cannot
[1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:12.320]  be fixed you can't throw more money at bad programming code and make it work you know there's
[1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:17.040]  an old joke in programming circles that the government thinks that if it takes one woman
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:22.640]  nine months to create one baby then you can have nine women create one baby in one month
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:28.080]  you just throw more bad money at it and they try to talk to IBM top engineers and people in
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:32.800]  software and they say they'll never say something's broken and scrap it they'll just keep throwing more
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:39.280]  money at something that won't work exactly now we haven't even got to the security risk kit daniels
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:44.320]  and paul watson there have been writing about this this is crucial the only reason that social
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:49.440]  security numbers and emails and other private financial data has not yet been stolen in huge
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:54.720]  numbers through healthcare dot gov is because healthcare dot gov is so broken that even the
[1:43:54.720 --> 1:44:01.840]  the hackers can't get okay so once it's up and running groups like anonymous are going to have
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:07.360]  a field day with it man we are talking about anything you enter into that system anybody who's
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:12.560]  crazy enough or or stupid enough to actually enter their private details in the healthcare dot gov
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:18.320]  that's going to go right to the nsa and it's going to go right into the hacker databases because
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:24.160]  the just looking at the client side javascript code on this this is the easiest thing to hack that
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:30.400]  i've seen in a long time it is a no-brainer for groups like anonymous and i'm not even a hacker
[1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:34.800]  but then you would just run a script injecting the info and then pull everything out of it
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:40.320]  oh my goodness like for example some of the the data uh the the data integration check
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:47.040]  checking algorithms are all client side which means they can be modified uh by the client by a hacker
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:53.680]  to inject malformed data into the database which could include sql statements for example
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:58.080]  that allow uh entire tables to be dropped they could delete entire tables they could
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:04.320]  they could copy entire tables they could randomly update tables they could put executable code other
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:10.000]  query statements i don't mean to get too technical but they could inject database uh engine statements
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:14.080]  into the records that would be executed by the server so you can also fry the whole thing and
[1:45:14.080 --> 1:45:20.400]  and destroy the whole database oh my god it this is a hacker's greatest dream and i don't know what
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:25.440]  i mean but we always said dr blalock said they're going to bring it in over a few years and wreck
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:30.160]  the old healthcare system and then fully nationalize it and socialize it and that's what a lot of the
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:35.120]  liberals are saying oh this is a genius plan will wreck the old evil right wing system written by
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.800]  insurance companies they're not going to get rid of their profits they're going to nationalize it but
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:43.040]  then they'll get all the profit and it's coming out that they control what treatment you get
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:48.800]  maybe the plan is to wreck everything with this maybe it's going according to plan mike that
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:53.440]  that's an idea that i've been thinking about in some detail when you actually examine the code
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:57.920]  you have to come to the conclusion that either there's only two options in this a they hired the
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:05.840]  most incompetent unqualified programmers you could possibly find or b they intend for it to fail
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:11.440]  they want it to fail they want a crisis because of course the democrats have always centralized
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:16.080]  power based on crisis well i guess i guess in a sense every every government has done that not
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:23.280]  just democrats but this administration in particular has a philosophy of making these
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:29.280]  you know heavenly promises that they can never keep look at all of the campaign promises of
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:33.520]  obama has he kept any of them you know he was going to label gmo's he was going to shut down
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:38.160]  the secret military prisons well no i mean he always says the opposite of what he says with
[1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:45.440]  pleasure he loves raising all the taxes on board people well well yeah exactly exactly so this system
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:50.160]  this is going to put america come january one here's the problem now i know i know a lot of
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:55.600]  people in the health care system you know doctors clinics hospitals you know researchers and so on
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:47:00.560]  this problem is going to get dumped on doctors because there are going to be millions of people
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:07.200]  who think they've signed up through obama care they think they have insurance they're going to show up
[1:47:07.200 --> 1:47:10.960]  at the emergency room or a doctor's office with a health problem and they're going to say
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:15.920]  the doctor's going to say you know where's your coverage and the people are going to say i've got
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:20.320]  obama care and you know the the doctor's office people are going to type it in and say no you
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:26.960]  don't you're not in the database this is going to be a disaster mark my words come january one
[1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:32.960]  now listen my dad is in health care consulting he's quitting next week i mean tuesday is his last
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.880]  day except for a little bit of consulting one day a week he said there's no way to follow these new
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:44.080]  federal laws and they're already three years into it at the regulation level arresting doctors you
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:51.760]  name it who don't literally dot an i in a computer and it's written the term he introduced got picked
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:55.520]  up by the state of texas when they passed a law against it but still it's not blocking it what was
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:00.240]  the term they called it it was uh it was death penalty because there's no judge there's no jury
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.280]  there's no nothing through the federal regs of the state they can just do whatever they want
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:10.080]  and and so the plan is no one can be in compliance and then they're just going to shut down and arrest
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:16.080]  everybody and then take over health care and my dad says it's by design well it may very well be i
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:21.360]  don't know yet if it's by design but it there are a lot of indications that it may be it's if it's not
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:27.360]  by design it it's so incompetent it's mind-blowing but you have to look at what is the philosophy
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:36.240]  of the democratic party the philosophy of obama is to wave a magic wand and and and fake like
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:41.360]  something is solved and then talk your way out of it obama is a salesman for his constituents are so
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:47.360]  stupid yes that they will believe that republicans messed it up well well right and they they believe
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:53.120]  i mean sibelius was out there on the daily show with john stewart saying no this system is working
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:49:00.400]  it's working you know you you can only say that for so for so long because computer code cannot be
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:07.200]  hypnotized by obama all right let's get that straight he can talk to the systems all he wants
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:11.280]  they're not going to buy the dream the computer code follows instructions and the instructions are
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:15.440]  a nightmare so he can do the nlp off the teleprompter it's not going to work it's not going to work
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:19.520]  believe me you know computer code is step by step by step what does obama do when his cell phone
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:24.720]  doesn't work scissors and talks to it he goes now you know i love you and right listen to him no and
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:28.400]  you know obama tried to say well this was like apple you know apple rolled out iphones and they
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:34.480]  needed an update it had a small glitch well if apple handed out toy plastic phones with faked
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:39.520]  screens with painted on phone numbers that would be like obama cares that's right it doesn't even
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:44.240]  beep like a kid's toy it does does nothing you just right it's fake it just feels right in the house
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:51.600]  so also on a technical level the complexity of the system is so immense this is i believe
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:57.120]  probably the largest it project in the history of the world other than the nsa a data gathering
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:03.600]  project you have to synchronize across multiple time zones and multiple servers databases from
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:07.840]  social security veterans administration state run driver's license system banking institutions
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:12.960]  immigration medicare medicaid all of these things have to integrate and a lot of these databases
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:18.240]  are legacy systems that are decades old the data types don't match alex you have to do
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:24.240]  what's called a normalization of the data types which itself is about a three-year project
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:29.120]  after you have the data normalized and you have exchange data exchanges like xml systems
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:34.240]  then it would take at least another two years i think from from day one this is about a five-year
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:38.000]  project to make it work and you would have to hire the most genius programmers on the planet
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.960]  and then it's all run by the nsa which they admit is the government's computer system
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:47.600]  it's literally having fires every day yeah with all the idiots trying to get the free
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:52.480]  health care running into their computers the disaster mike mike i want to hear your predictions

[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:25.280]  guy in my book and he's been a guest on the show in his background decades in china other places
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:32.000]  is the classic cutout of a cia operative he's gone public saying obama has kicked him out of the cia
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:38.400]  as a covert operations leader and is involved basically in a black ops coup around the country
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:45.520]  and that's why he's going public my gut tells me he's probably true all i know is i have top
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:51.040]  sources they're missing nukes at dais air force base and then that day uh lindsey grams are talking
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:56.000]  about nukes blowing up south carolina and that's where the nukes were going and then we see the
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.520]  two top nuke generals being removed mike adams uh you know we don't make up sources so much stuff
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:05.760]  like you know the navy seal family thinking they killed them and that they blew them up
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:10.320]  that all came out a year later after we broke it i mean we break a lot of stuff we have real
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:16.880]  whistleblowers not a lot of places whistleblowers can go i particularly at a it's just a selfish
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:21.520]  level almost don't like breaking the stuff because it really doesn't even do anything i mean we break
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:27.680]  it it comes out and then the crime just continues but i have a responsibility that when i get high
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:32.880]  level stuff to go public with it and i do uh but it doesn't mean it's fun what do you think about
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:36.160]  the nuke story and we're going to get back into obama care in this segment the next and then
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:40.000]  jessie ventura is going to join us i appreciate you coming on a short notice i mean what is your
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.200]  gut i tell you about all the weird military stuff and top generals being fired and the media being
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:51.120]  told they don't want this news out i mean the head of nuclear forces fired well i i have to say alex
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:55.440]  i i really narrowed my focus in the last couple of months because of this huge project that we're
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:56:00.400]  going to be announcing in december and it is really limited my time i'm i'm not up to speed on that
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:06.000]  topic uh what i'm what i'm really focusing on right now is is the obama care exchange system but
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:10.960]  i know that your sources are credible i know that the stories that you put out are original stories
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:16.240]  that are usually months later than confirmed by mainstream media and i feel like this obama
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:21.520]  care story that the computer code is going to be the same way that by by the time january rolls
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:28.000]  around the media will have to admit something unless they try to pull off the biggest mass hypnosis
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  campaign in the history of the country and try to tell everybody you know this is working maybe they'll
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.280]  say millions of people have signed up and they'll try to make each individual person think they're
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.720]  the only life is better in the soviet union life is better in airstrip one whereas peace freedom
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:50.480]  of slavery ignorance is wonderful classic orwellian themes and and that's what this may turn out to be
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:58.080]  but i also think that that obama has other more nefarious plans at hand and i also you know
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:05.920]  just the financial crash that's coming it could could make all of this uh irrelevant if if you
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:10.880]  have a global cascading financial collapse that that kicks in and you know it's going to happen
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:15.520]  it's just a matter of when it could be weeks months maybe even years it's hard to say but if that
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:19.760]  happens nobody's going to be caring about who's got health insurance it's going to be who's starving
[1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:26.880]  to death because you can't even get food anymore commerce is shut down all i know is is that the
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:31.360]  government is running around like a chicken with its head cut off and most of financial experts
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:36.560]  say we're getting really close to a collapse and i just don't know what the public will do if seven
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:41.920]  million people starve to death during the great depression or died from malnutrition uh disorders
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:48.560]  associated with lack of food then imagine if 90 percent were self-sufficient then now we're 90
[1:57:48.560 --> 1:57:54.480]  percent unself-sufficient i mean all hell is going to break loose but the day the chaos is really
[1:57:54.480 --> 1:58:01.120]  unleashed is the day that the food stamp debit card stopped working that you know if that gets cut
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:07.200]  off the ebt cards and remember you've got 43 i think 44 million americans on those cards right
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:12.080]  now i think it's i think it's 49 million it might be it might be i might be i might have old numbers
[1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:18.320]  but when that stops working it's going to be riots man within 72 hours every major u.s city will
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:23.840]  become total chaos and the democrats do everything they can to make sure nobody has guns to protect
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:27.760]  themselves well right that's why you can't live you can't survive in a city when that happens you
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:31.760]  you have to be out in the country i got to say this the democratic leadership and i'm not a republican
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:36.480]  folks but i got to say they are like demons or something i mean whatever the worst thing to do

[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:28.560]  final segment with mike adams the health ranger i'm your host alex jones the governor jesse
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:33.040]  ventura for minnesota governor got some breaking news he's going to be covering in the next segment
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:38.000]  lord willow and i'll be back this sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central with a sunday broadcast and of course
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:43.440]  i'll be hosting the nightly news tonight seven o'clock central uh mike what do you predict then
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:49.680]  because if we look at authoritarians you'd have to call the the implementation program of the
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:56.880]  globalist kind of a communist socialist system when they use communist as the mid-level and
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:02.960]  and low-level officers so it has a communist feel but it is far and megabanker own but if we look
[2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:07.280]  at what they've done in other countries china ukraine russia they will shut everything down for
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:12.240]  a decade and kill 10 20 of the population for control so who cares we can't get health care
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:16.400]  it's a scam we implode the economy i think that's really the attitude they're in control
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:21.360]  the bigger the crisis the more they can pose but i think at the same time it's key that we get the
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:26.160]  word out that they're behind it what is your gut on obama care and what's going to end up happening
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:32.640]  out of this i i think there's a reasonable chance we could end up in a real government attempted
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:39.120]  takeover slash shutdown uh martial law situation where uh you know the bomb administration doesn't
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:44.400]  believe that the people have any rights whatsoever no no due process no civil rights no constitutional
[2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:49.040]  rights and certainly no right to choose whether you wish to engage in commerce with a private
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:54.080]  company which is you know a spiritual right a constitutional right but that has been overthrown
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:59.760]  now by the supreme court uh justice roberts and obama care so they can do that at infinitum and
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:03.440]  they can tell you you have to buy this and that they can make catholics pay for other people's
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:08.800]  abortions and i'm sure they would love to do that because there there's a spiritual there's like a
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:14.400]  demonic reward for for causing death and suffering that i mean we could get into the higher level
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:19.920]  you know spiritual conversation in this but in terms of obama care itself i did during the break
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:25.440]  i i i thought well maybe what they'll do is they'll convert the whole thing to a placebo
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:29.680]  health insurance system so you log in you don't really have health coverage you don't really
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:33.840]  get to see a doctor but they'll tell you you're taking a digital pill for your cancer or your
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:38.000]  heart disease and then they can have the placebo effect where your mind thinks you have health
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.680]  insurance so maybe oh maybe healthcare.gov will become a placebo website that's the only thing
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:48.720]  that they could make work by maybe you'll get a can of obama bites exactly i mean they're gonna
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:54.560]  have to fake their way through this and you know the the american people are so they've been so
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:59.840]  victimized by fluoride and and chemotherapy and chemtrails and toxic chemicals and heavy metals
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:05.120]  they so many of them unfortunately have been so damaged and brain damaged by vaccines literally
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:12.320]  brain damaged i'm not sure how many are capable of of waking up to this i know more and more are
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:18.800]  waking up but i i don't know if that's a big enough number to overthrow true evil and to
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:25.360]  take did you see the video that leon macadoo did where 14 out of 20 austinites signed a petition
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:31.360]  to ban walking without helmets no i i i didn't see that one but i've seen you know mark dice's
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:38.160]  videos and they just become increasingly bizarre of what people will agree to do it just shows
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:44.080]  that there is no critical thinking left at least among people walking on the beach there in california
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:48.960]  i don't know about elsewhere but you gotta hope that there's enough i i think there are enough
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:54.880]  patriots and and real thinking people and people who believe in in liberty and believe in jeffersonian
[2:03:54.880 --> 2:04:01.040]  freedoms that we can take this country back from tyrants so we can restore the republic we can
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:08.240]  restore justice if we don't what's going to happen civil war man that's the only that's the only
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:12.880]  outcome because there's there's a lot of people you know you and i are both here in texas texas
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:18.560]  is not going to go down without a fight let me tell you just talking to people face to face texas
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:23.600]  is not going to surrender to obama without a fight is not you're right you're right i mean the people
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:29.200]  downtown at ut literally don't know what their name is literally are like brain that damaged
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:34.240]  zombies and then you go five miles out to a farm they're totally smart self-sufficient no what's

[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:29.840]  government is in control defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:38.480]  well former minister of governor jesse ventura is our guest and i want to get into a petition
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  he's launched how to regain our liberties and then the government shut down i want to talk about the
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:49.200]  gallop poll with him showing 18 percent approval total for government 10 for congress 60 percent
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:52.880]  say they don't like either party it's really a lot higher than that we're going to cover the
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:09:00.560]  waterfront with jesse ventura he's also about to start his own big show that's off the grid
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:06.560]  from outside occupied us so that's exciting we'll cover it all with jesse ventura always great to
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:14.720]  hear his voice and have him on with us but i want to first off get your take on the fact that the
[2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:19.600]  entire political spectrum is turning against the left right a republican democratic system that's
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:26.800]  exactly what your book before last called for governor well you know maybe all i can say alex
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:33.200]  is maybe the people have had enough and maybe they're going to become vigilant again like what our
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:39.360]  forefathers had in mind what our country was supposed to be was active in both citizenry
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:46.640]  uh looking at continuing to keep the government in check and in uh letting them know something
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.320]  that alex we've allowed them to perpetrate and that is we've forgotten we're the boss
[2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:59.600]  we're supposed to be the boss they're supposed to work for us and i think people have lost
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:05.920]  sight of that fact and and they've been misled to believe that somehow the government's the
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:11.120]  boss and we work for them and it's not supposed to be that way and i certainly hope they're waking
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:16.080]  up to that that sounds like the way the founding fathers talked or anybody else in world history
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:22.160]  that wanted freedom that sounds like extremist talk governor well you know it probably is extremist
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:28.880]  talk extreme freedom and uh if that's what our country was founded upon who they're the fathers
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:34.400]  of our country they they have the vision let's live the vision and they put that vision down in a
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:40.320]  document called the constitution and the bill of rights and that's the fabric of our nation
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:46.800]  and we need to live by those documents or we're not the nation that they wanted us to be well
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:51.760]  governor you're a humble guy overall getting to know you personally but also on air you don't really
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:56.400]  toot your own horn but uh for over a decade you've been speaking out against the violations of
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:11:01.120]  liberties and freedoms prominently in the national press before that as well and it was governor but
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:06.800]  you've really gotten more awake in my perspective the last decade or so on the nsa spying the secret
[2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:13.680]  police the the ndaa the patriot act and we're criticized for that or saying our government
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:20.400]  runs al qaeda stages false flags that's now mainstream news uh i think that the the establishment
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:24.800]  owes us an apology now i'm not holding my breath expecting it but i think it's important for us
[2:11:24.800 --> 2:11:31.520]  to say hey we were right you were wrong what do you say to that i i agree i mean we you know i've
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:38.720]  been talking about these issues now for over a decade you know a lot and uh probably i even
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:44.800]  talked about them back when i used to do my own talk radio in minnesota in the 90s i was always
[2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:50.480]  questioning government then that was one of the reasons while i was questioning government
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:56.480]  that i ended up becoming governor of the state of minnesota because there was a a major thing
[2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:02.960]  that happened in minnesota that i felt very strongly about and i got on my soapbox on the radio show
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:09.760]  and did my tirade on it go and behold at the end of the tirade i just made it off the tough statement
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:15.440]  of well maybe i ought to run for governor and the rest is history that's how it all started to where i
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:22.640]  then did it and was successful at doing it and uh ever since now i've been locked into this battle
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:29.360]  with the democrats republicans and the status quo of our country i mean i'm astounded alex when you
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:36.960]  see that the approval rating of congress is at 10 percent and yet they still get reelected how can
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:43.440]  that be well we know there's massive election fraud it's not total but it's been proven if somebody
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:50.160]  has a lens not to that level alex i can't believe that other candidates are winning and they're able
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:58.880]  to fraud out and only democrats republicans that i know i think it falls on us we for some reason
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:04.960]  have been so programmed that the only person you can vote for is a democrat or republican and we
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:10.000]  have to break that programming oh well i agree that's the main reason but but added to that
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:13.600]  there's also all the special interest money that goes to republicans and democrats
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:19.920]  so only they can get their name out to people so the public only knows about them that's true too
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:25.760]  well look at it the situation they have a perfect situation because they're in charge and they get
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:32.240]  to make the rules imagine let's put it into a football everybody's football season we all love
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:39.600]  football imagine if your football team was real good at passing the ball but you weren't that good
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:45.200]  at running the ball and let's say the first half of the game you got a one touchdown lead because
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:51.360]  you could throw the ball well but then the other side got half time they got to change the rules
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:57.680]  now and they said throwing passes is now illegal you're gonna have to run well that's what we're
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:03.280]  up against when the democrats and republicans make the rules they're going to change the rules
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:09.680]  which benefit them just like districtate when they make these congressional districts 400 and some
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:15.600]  throughout the country the gerrymandering there is oh there is only a handful that are even competitive
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:21.760]  they already know the republicans going to win here and the democrats going to win there
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:27.520]  and they make the district accordingly so they share power like the mafia with 30 year career
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:35.600]  politicians yeah they share power like the mafia yes wow and you wrote a book about actually i
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:40.800]  shouldn't say yes i don't know that much about the mafia well that's what the mafia does is they
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:46.320]  have they have territories about what government does i know a whole lot more about what government
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:51.600]  does than what the mafia does so i'll take your word for it well sure i mean mafias have territories
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:55.600]  and they have deals they have commission meetings and and that's what the republicans and democrats
[2:14:55.600 --> 2:15:01.440]  have done is i mean you you compare them to the crypts and the bloods yeah with my with my apologies
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:07.440]  to the crypts and the bloods and here's why i think of this alex these parties are worse than the
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:13.360]  crypts and bloods because they affect each and every one of us the crypts and bloods only affect
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:20.000]  people where they're at that's right in LA you know that's their stronghold but these guys affect
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  everybody whether you live in the far reaches up in Wyoming and montana or you live on the beaches
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:31.840]  of florida these people and what they do affect each and every one of us that makes them worse
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:36.720]  well that's my biggest gripe with this system and now that they're grabbing people from countries
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:41.680]  that don't have extradition agreements with the so-called us there's like nowhere to run us
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:49.760]  well i could tell you this if i became president the first two people the first thing i would
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:56.240]  do i would executively pardon both bradley manning and snow now i'd be great i would pardon them
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:16:04.640]  immediately because whistleblowers on the government are not bad they are good because if our governments
[2:16:04.640 --> 2:16:10.720]  out there and if they're breaking their own laws and they're doing what they're not supposed to be
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:18.160]  doing and a government employee has the courage the courage to come out and go public to inform
[2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:24.080]  us the people that's telling the boss so the government employee is doing the right thing
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:30.160]  he's seeing malfeasance in the workplace and he's going to the boss which is us the people
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:36.560]  we have to get that back in our heads again like i said earlier we are the boss well why should a
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:43.760]  person be chastised or reprimanded or sent to jail for doing the right thing you're right
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:49.360]  tosh plumbly is a cia contract a very famous whistleblower still works in contracting he gave
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:54.400]  fox news the interview it came out last night of what really happened in Benghazi and now the
[2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:58.240]  government's coming after him i want to shift gears out of the whistleblower for a moment and
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:04.160]  come back from break and get into uh the petition you've got going taking action with governor jesse
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:09.600]  ventura for minnesota governor joins us but before we go to break they are now playing this
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:15.840]  announcement all over the country at airports i know you haven't been there in over two years
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:20.720]  because you have been protesting it but i've seen you argue with the tsa just say hey this is wrong
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:25.600]  this is ridiculous i do the same thing they're now airing announcements that if you make a joke
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:32.720]  or that if you do anything they're going to arrest you there's no law you're not saying there's a bomb
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:37.680]  but if you laugh with them or if you say this is ridiculous which i do every time i fly well then
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:41.440]  they're going to arrest you i want to play you the announcement that they're playing in houston
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:48.320]  here it is a particular attention to your luggage and personal belongings unintended luggage will
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:54.720]  and personal belongings may be treated as a danger to the facility do not be persuaded by strangers
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:18:00.800]  or individuals you do not know well to take articles towards your flight you are also reminded
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:07.600]  that any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest we appreciate
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:12.160]  your cooperation while these measures are in effect all right that reminds me of the running man
[2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:16.560]  where they say don't be out after dark he'll be permanently detained i'm about to pop a cadre cola
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:23.280]  here uh jesse i mean this is crazy that's george w george herbert walker bush airport
[2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:29.040]  out of houston what do you say to that well it doesn't surprise me because remember my court case
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:36.000]  alex when i sued the tsa in homeland security and was thrown out of court the judge is ruling
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:41.920]  was she didn't have jurisdiction and i told everybody you need to understand that all airports
[2:18:41.920 --> 2:18:48.080]  in america today the constitution and bill of rights does not exist so you don't have the
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:55.600]  first amendment out there because there's nowhere you can go to seek redress i tried and they throw
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:19:01.200]  it out of court you can't get your day in court that way they don't have to deal with it and so
[2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:06.160]  i've told people remember when you're in airports you out here you have no protection under the
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:12.320]  constitution you have no protection under the bill of rights so hearing that message i fully
[2:19:12.320 --> 2:19:19.280]  understand it because they don't have to abide by the first amendment unpopular speech at an airport
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:24.080]  could get you thrown in jail and that's what the first amendment is supposed to grant us
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:30.560]  to protect unpopular speech because popular speech needless to say does not need protecting
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:38.480]  so it is not shocking to me alex i i lived at trying to go to court to see if i had any
[2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:42.880]  bill of rights protection well that's why i brought it up i know you've had your but i did not i know
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:46.160]  you've had your battles let's come back and talk more about that and then the petition with former
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:51.280]  minnesota governor jesse ventura also talk about his new book already a best-seller i got to say

[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.360]  got physically upset this morning when i saw the video in the audio of the announcement and then
[2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:43.280]  my crew was like oh you didn't know that's been going on the last six months everybody in the
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:48.160]  office that's flown has heard it and they now yell at you when you're going through line it's like
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:54.000]  they're there to let you know you're a slave this is a conscious project then there's nothing to
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:59.440]  charge you with they just threaten you but i have read about them actually arresting people
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:03.760]  and claiming disorderly conduct if you just say i don't like you grabbing my genitals well i guess
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:09.120]  that's terrorism governor they're now expanding into the highways here in austin they have random
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:14.800]  tsa checkpoints now i guess if i say no you're not grabbing my wife's breast i guess i go to jail
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:21.920]  they're now god i now live in north korea oh you know it started that stuff started in Tennessee
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:27.760]  they were the first state that they're called tsa viper team that's right and they're out on the
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:32.480]  highways i can't believe they're down in texas now too i guess they're spreading like cancer
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:40.640]  and uh you know i i i hope it doesn't get to that because i drive to and from Mexico every year
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:45.840]  and i hope that every state i go through i don't have to face the fact of being randomly pulled
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:51.920]  over for no reason just to see you know if i have a wrong bumper sticker on my car or something that
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:58.480]  they might might suggest that i'm not following the state policy line i don't know well in the
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:03.920]  future you'll probably have to watch shine their shoes or they'll arrest you well again it's it's
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:10.080]  it's our fault because we we've allowed it to get this way uh we have to be vigilant we have to be
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:17.040]  active citizens what our forefathers wanted for this great country of ours to be and we
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:22.960]  haven't done that we're following like sheep and we're marching in line like lemmings and uh
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:28.880]  the few of us that get out of line then get uh you know we take the brunt end that they either they
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:35.520]  try to assassinate you uh what you stand for who you are or in the case of john kennedy physically
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:40.640]  they assassinate you governor i want to get into your petition but but i mean you never brag about
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:43.840]  this or anything but i've had a chance to talk to you and i also know a lot about world war two
[2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:48.800]  history you know some of the ground that otting murphy chewed uh there in germany your dad was
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:53.600]  a war hero had a bunch of battle stars blew up a bunch of tanks was in some of the same major
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:58.960]  battles as as otting murphy all that stuff what would your dad today because you see all these
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:04.560]  world war two vets crossing the picket line uh not allowed to be on the national mall
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:11.840]  what was your dad think oh let me my dad was against the vietnam war before the hippies were
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:18.480]  i remembered as a kid i was coming home before hippies were even out there protesting
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:23.360]  i would come home from school and of course i was being taught that we were stopping the
[2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:30.400]  domino effect of communism while today i've learned at the same time the people behind the iron
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:36.320]  curtain as they called it we're being told we must stop imperialist capitalist imperialists
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:42.880]  from taking over the world so both people with both peoples were being say sold the same bill of
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:49.920]  goods but i remember my dad sitting at the dinner table and my father had i think six or seven
[2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:56.480]  bronze battle stars and i come from a rare family where my mother is also a world war two veteran
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:05.040]  she was a nurse in north africa and uh uh my dad was so against the vietnam war before before the
[2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:12.320]  hippies even were and i at that age i couldn't understand why but as i grow older now i realized
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:17.840]  that my dad gets smarter all the time and things that he and he only had a nice great education
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:23.840]  well he'd be proud of what you're doing now of just the image of world war two vets being arrested
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:27.600]  and they're just and arresting people at the grand canyon and when tourists pull in
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:33.920]  they're pointing guns at them i mean the government's crazy well you know it's every time i cross a
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:38.960]  border i go through one of these immigration checks i always have my window down and i say to the
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:46.960]  agent please don't violate our constitution of bill of rights you as an individual i appeal to them
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:53.680]  don't let it happen because you know even the government employees need to understand yes
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:58.800]  you're doing your job but you need to have the courage if they're asking you to do something
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:05.280]  that you know is against the bill of rights of the constitution then and you don't stand up for it
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:11.120]  well then you're not a hero you're not you're not you're not doing for our country what we need to
[2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:16.880]  have done and that's people within the government standing up for those two great documents and
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:23.040]  not just doing it because your boss tells you you're supposed to that's how they get away with stuff
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:27.920]  you're right stay there i want to come back and get into the petition and other world news

[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:10.720]  jessie ventura is our guest and and now i want to get into the main main reason he's here this
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:15.440]  petition he's gotten behind of these promoting that he wants to get millions of signatures for
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:19.200]  and it's a really good idea to take action we're going to go over some of the things that are in
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:23.920]  the petition but but finishing up with war being a racket and finishing your story about your dad
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:29.600]  and your mom why was your dad before it was even cool before it was even officially starting
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:36.400]  against the vietnam war being a world war two decorated veteran himself well i always remember
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:42.880]  my dad alex saying to me this isn't about stopping communism he said somebody's over there making big
[2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:50.720]  money and this is back in the early sixties when vietnam was just starting up and my dad over and
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:57.120]  he sure as heck was right on because it had nothing to do with stopping communism none of the wars
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:05.920]  do i don't care what medley butler said it in his book war is a racket they're always orchestrated
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:11.840]  so that somebody is going to profit and make huge amounts of money take a look at our most recent
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:20.640]  wars and take a look at albert that's right it's just disgusting how all these corrupt interests
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:26.160]  are just getting away with medley butler stated that he's a hundred years ago almost he said he
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:30.800]  didn't fight for the american people he fought for the united fruit corporation when they didn't get
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:37.920]  cooperation in central and south america they'd send in the marines to get it and now homeland
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:42.880]  security is going to send in their own forces to make sure we do what they say apparently so
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:49.200]  just like this whole thing in in in the syria it's really because the Assad government won't
[2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:55.120]  is not approving our oil pipeline that's right big part of it you know and and so they want to get
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:00.320]  a government in there that's that will grant the wishes of the oil company and let the pipeline
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:05.680]  go through that's why there's this rise up you're not going to tell me this is an argument
[2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:11.440]  organized the people are doing it because they're oppressed they're being instigated to do it
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:17.600]  because they want a now would a new government be good maybe maybe not i don't know i you know i
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:23.040]  often look at iraq today and i say is iraq better off today or were they better off before it's way
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:27.920]  worse i gotta figure they were better off before well same thing with egypt same thing with libya
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:32.640]  i mean here's cns news syrian rebels swap crosses the top churches for al-qaeda flags
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:37.040]  i mean this is like the worst group you can put in i mean that this is the atrocities they commit
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:41.520]  druslin post now they're accusing syrian rebels of committing war crimes i mean that's like asking
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:46.480]  that a bear went in the bathroom in the woods or fish swim in the ocean i mean it's just the whole
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:54.480]  thing alex the whole thing about syria using chemical weapons what hypothesis that is we've
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:37:01.920]  been using chemical weapons for 60 some years that's right paul well they got caught using real
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:07.040]  nerve gas in vietnam what do you think du is it's got a four billion year half-life it's radiation
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:14.320]  weapon well you know there you go so you know we're such hypocrites we point our fingers at
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:19.440]  other countries shake them up down but we ought to hold up a beer and once in a while take a look
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:23.760]  at it i agree i want to go to your petition the reason you're here but you're a smart guy i mean
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:28.160]  you've been around your street smart as well i've studied history cultures tend to go crazy and
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:33.600]  collapse sometimes power elites go crazy more often than not the establishment i mean i mean
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:41.120]  here's an example a national study out a global un study 91% of nuclear reactors of 400 plus worldwide
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:47.520]  are leaking they don't even fix them now all sorts of other maintenance in corporate and
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.840]  government systems like the engineers told bp as you know you did an investigation on it
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:56.400]  that you cannot dump salt water on top this you have to dump concrete i don't care if it'll
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:00.480]  save you hundreds of millions of dollars this will blow up and when the and when the head engineer
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:06.320]  refused to do it they removed him and put somebody in the wood and that's what i'm saying uh why would
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:12.400]  john corezine make 41 bets with people's private bank accounts uh as they had a mf global i'm saying
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:18.160]  the people running things are crazy it seems like they've gone nuts they think they're invincible
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:22.480]  i mean they're just doing crazy things what do you think's going on here well alex they're not
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:28.720]  crazy it's working isn't it i guess it is well then how are they crazy i guess we're crazy now
[2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:35.680]  we're crazy yep we it's time for us to look in the mirror and you know people they can only get
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:40.880]  away with it because we allow them to but but yeah sure but how does that i mean if i was the head
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:46.400]  of bp drilling and i wasn't an engineer i wouldn't say dump salt water on top of a well when you're
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:51.360]  drilling instead of concrete and the engineer goes it's going to blow up i don't care do it
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:56.240]  i mean there is some craziness there well certainly there is and obviously the person
[2:38:56.240 --> 2:39:01.840]  saying it isn't going to be standing by the explosion either are they no exactly yeah well
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:06.960]  that's like it's easy to go to war because the people that send you to war they're not going
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.440]  to be fighting it you are and they're not going to get hurt they're not going to you know one of
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:17.120]  the most disgusting things i ever saw with george bush was when the press had him outside the
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:22.880]  white house he was waiting for more and they were going to some function dressed in tuxedos and all
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:28.960]  that and george bush did that little tap dance around for the press and said gee lora and i are
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:35.920]  having such a fun being the president and i thought yeah well you got these young kids couldn't
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:43.280]  you at least be solemn you've taken us to two wars young men and women are dying halfway around the
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:49.200]  world and you're dancing around with your tuxedo on wow telling everybody what a good time you're
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:55.520]  having you just touched on something just being a news person and knowing all this i feel guilty
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:01.520]  if i go to a movie or if i go fishing or if i try to go learn how to play golf again but then i
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:06.720]  realize no i got to have some time off or i'll go crazy but i feel guilty when i'm working so late
[2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:10.800]  because i want to be with my kids but then i feel guilty if i don't go work because i don't have much
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:15.440]  trouble the country's in and then meanwhile these politicians reportedly during the shutdown have
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:23.360]  been drunk the entire time partying and having sex like it's funny and it is to them because they
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:31.760]  make the rules it's that simple yeah i i remember when i first won governor and i had my all my best
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:37.680]  friends from the old neighborhood over to the governor's gratitude residents for dinner and one
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:44.080]  of my best friends proposed a toast and they held the glass up and just simply said it's good to be
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:51.200]  king yeah you know and we were doing it laughingly because here's a kid from the old neighborhood
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:56.000]  how the hell could he become the governor and here we are sitting in the governor's brother
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:02.480]  eating dinner which none of my friends ever believed they'd do in their lifetime but yet
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:08.400]  what he said was so profound because it is good to be king and right now they're the kings
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:15.040]  and so you know we're the minions they we allegedly have to do what they want us to but
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:20.000]  we weren't supposed to be that way we're supposed to be in control electing them and
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:24.800]  i view is this alex every one of them should be voted out of the office that caused the
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:28.960]  government shutdown well there's this new movement going that sounds something like you'd say called
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:35.520]  throw the bums out uh in fact there's a big new world movement that was brought up about 20 some
[2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:41.120]  years ago that appeared first sure but i'm saying it's back it's back it's a new world movement with
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:48.960]  new ignition to it shifting gears into why you're here and people can go to a change.org and be part
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:53.680]  of it and people say oh this won't save the world hey it'll get a lot of attention it'll bring focus
[2:41:53.680 --> 2:42:01.200]  it'll show examples of how to fix things we've done petitions alex i can tell you this from experience
[2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:08.800]  elected officials the most important thing for them is getting reelected that's the most important
[2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:14.960]  thing that's why i can unequivocally tell people if they sign this petition and we get it up to five
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:20.400]  or ten billion let's pipe dream and think we can get it that far on the internet because he can on
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:27.200]  the internet if we can get it up that high trust me it will have an impact because i tried to get
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:34.080]  unicamble in minnesota single house legislature but because the people didn't respond with cards
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:40.480]  and letters of communication the elected officials knew it was too confusing for the people and they
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.920]  didn't want it it wasn't high oh no i agree i'm saying i'm saying petitions work i was saying big
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:50.880]  petitions work we've done them and they've become huge news items and it's gotten things done and you
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:54.560]  being behind it and getting everybody behind it very exciting the headline is federal elected
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:42:59.920]  officials in the government shut down and regain our civil liberties a petition by four minnesota
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:05.440]  governor jesse ventura so go go over the petition with us and tell folks how they go sign on to it
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:12.160]  well you know the petition to cover the variety of things that uh it covers abolishing the patriot
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:19.440]  act no more government shutdowns uh to for them to look at abolishing the income tax and going
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:25.520]  to a national sales tax which let me make that a quick argument that would make we the citizens
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:31.920]  number one just think of it this way you would get your money first not second right now you get
[2:43:31.920 --> 2:43:37.440]  your money second let's end that and give you your money first and the government gets its second
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:44.800]  and it goes on to just other straight common sense things that we need to have done in this country
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:50.720]  and that should be done and should be part of what the united states is it's a great idea when you
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:55.840]  run into the other taxes with it then my problem is they may try to try to slap it on top of the
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:44:00.160]  others but i agree it's a good idea overall and it's constitutional a policy income tax
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:07.600]  to trade off the income imagine this alex with no income tax you'd never have to face an audit
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:14.240]  again never because all taxes would be paid business to government which they already do
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:20.720]  and then people have said to me well what do you do with the internal revenue if they're not
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:26.880]  you know you reverse their role you make it so that they watch the corporations and the government
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:32.000]  can ensure they're doing the right thing with our money that's a great idea you know you get them
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:39.440]  not watching us reverse them and the national sales tax would do all those things well plus
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:44.320]  the sales tax it's hard to get out of so it would actually bring the revenue in and then you decide
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:49.040]  when you win and where you want to pay tax sure if you don't want to pay any taxes this week don't
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:55.760]  buy nothing and then it can be done like this to alex you don't have to tax food and you don't
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:01.840]  have to tax clothing unless say the article of clothing is worth more than $150 well i'll tell
[2:45:01.840 --> 2:45:08.880]  you this this is slavery when they take your money and then give you some of it back i mean
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:15.760]  that is that is incredible exactly and the national sales tax would change all that plus here's
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:22.720]  another big part of it it would force the government to live with the economy because if we're not
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:29.600]  buying nothing they're not getting any money i think it's a great idea my problem is they always
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:32.800]  say they're going to do it and then they say oh but we're going to have the social security tax
[2:45:32.800 --> 2:45:36.880]  which is still there that's really the income tax they can jack back up later but i do support
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:43.280]  that alex they're never going to do this that's why we need to elect people that will i agree let's
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:47.280]  go over more of the petition and where's the best place people to find the link directly to it at
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:54.720]  your facebook yeah they can go to my facebook or like i said ww.change.org slash jessie ventura
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:46:01.200]  multiple ways you can get there the petitions there i really encourage people that don't
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:07.040]  take but a second to sign it if you agree with it i can't imagine anybody that listens to alex
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:12.000]  jones who wouldn't agree with it and you're launching it right now folks all need to go there
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  i'm going to have an article put out at info wars dot com and prism planet dot com to try to force
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:22.800]  this out there even to just make the media look at the solutions in here what what do you think
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:29.760]  about the spectacle of the communist chinese and the imf and others lecturing us on the debt limit
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:36.320]  and then obama's saying raising the debt limit does not raise the amount of debt we have i mean
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:44.240]  this is getting crazy well yeah i i don't begrudge the chinese nothing i mean how how how much
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:51.200]  and better we do them 1.3 trillion there you go they have a dog in the fight they don't want to lose
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:58.160]  their money too so i don't begrudge the chinese saying something hell if somebody owed me money
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:04.800]  like that to and and was going to quit their job or whatever i'd go up to them say wait a minute here
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:11.760]  you owe me some money if you quit your job i'm not going to get paid oh no i get why that's happening
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:16.080]  i'm seeing look at our country maneuvered into this position as ron paul said earlier
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:22.000]  when he was on in the last hour he said look they've given tens of trillions of foreign banks they've
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:27.360]  bailed out mega corporations they always wait to pay the veterans who are disabled till last just
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:31.920]  like the city only fills the potholes last after they've gotten all the money they want
[2:47:31.920 --> 2:47:37.440]  they're holding us hostage is my point oh completely i you know i was on last week with
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:43.760]  congressman paul and the wonderful thing about being on with him is we agree it's like going on
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:50.320]  with you alex we're all in complete agreement and the only beef i had with ron paul was that he's
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:56.720]  not there anymore you know i thought here's the one guy i knew in congress that i could go to
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:01.760]  i could get an interview with him when i had a tv show and that he would talk to me and he would
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:08.400]  tell me the truth as he saw it and that's the kind of guys i like our people that tell me the truth
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:13.600]  i don't have to agree with you you don't have to agree with me but we at least know we're getting
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:19.840]  the truth we're not straight shooters straight shooters yes but but look we're not jesse ventura
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:25.120]  ron paul alex jones the truth is we're nothing special the average american things like we do
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:31.600]  all the polls show it the problem is like you said both parties have rigged the game they're up there
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:35.920]  and doesn't matter if they're unpopular they've rigged the game and then they act like we're
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:43.360]  weird because we just want our american system back well then we have to take it back i agree with
[2:48:43.360 --> 2:48:48.400]  you they're not going to cooperate and they're not going to do the job so we elect them to do
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:56.240]  then how many times do i have to tell people stop putting them in the office let me ask you this
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:00.320]  in your gut because you live in mexico part of the time now hedging your bet you've got a big show
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:04.480]  that's about to launch i think has a great idea how you're like from behind enemy lines or from
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:09.760]  outside the the occupied america and i can't wait to see that and hear that but governor ventura
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:14.800]  in your gut what do you think is going to end up happening even midterm long term in this country
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:21.920]  i don't know i you know i always believe the american dream that no matter what will prevail
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:27.040]  because we're the greatest experiment that's ever happened on the planet earth as far as
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:35.200]  governing goes i always want to cling to that dream that that that it shall never you know disappear
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:43.840]  but you know the reality is that it what i'm seeing out there and things that are happening
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:50.320]  in freedoms of the middle class being destroyed because the great thing about the united states
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:56.080]  that made it different from every country was the middle class and you can see the complete
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:50:01.120]  assault on the middle class i'm not sure if the middle class exists anymore right now
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:08.960]  kids go to school now and they begin their lives what is it 35 thousand dollars at that minimum
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:13.360]  that's right it's a rigged game in the middle class they say it's about 20 percent of what it
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:19.440]  was in the 50s and it's about to be gone and and that's what i fear alex as i look at it it's much
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:28.160]  the same as when you look at a specie of animals where humans start to abuse them and pretty soon
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:34.560]  that specie no longer exists they almost did it with the gray whale now they're almost doing it with
[2:50:34.560 --> 2:50:41.200]  elephants and rhinos over ivory we may never see another elephant or rhino on the planet so i urge
[2:50:41.200 --> 2:50:47.440]  people don't buy ivory we so maybe the end of men the end of america the end of john wane and and
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:52.240]  when jessie ventura goes the end of the end of freedom well we know one thing john wane
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:58.000]  may be ending and i'm happy on one account you know what that is what's that i i'm one of these

[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:25.360]  stuff breaking i'll find out during the break we got former governor of minnesota jesse ventura on
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:31.120]  his new book we sell it it's excellent they killed our president very powerful book info wars store
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:36.320]  dot com or book store is everywhere but getting it from us obviously supports us and and the governor
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:39.920]  is important work as well in free speech in this country that's under attack with the whistleblowers
[2:54:40.640 --> 2:54:45.600]  but ventura said he loved to come on sometime and have people that disagree call in so next
[2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:49.920]  time he's on at least for half the interview we'll open the phone up for people to disagree
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:53.440]  because it is entertaining and informative and he gets to hear their perspective so
[2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  he asked for it we'll do it next time but governor you got cut off by the satellite break it's
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:03.280]  it's automatic make your point about the redskins sir well what i want to say on that is this i used
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:09.920]  to do three i i broadcasted uh the nfl for three years two for tampon one for minnesota and i
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:16.400]  purposely would go to the best of my knowledge i never used that nickname i found it offensive uh i
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:23.200]  would only refer to them as washington it's this simple could you walk up to a native american
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:30.880]  on the street you did not know and call them a redskin hey redskin come here or walk up hey redneck
[2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:35.200]  no i mean i get it can be seen as offensive i just think it's grandstanding when obama makes a big
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:40.880]  deal out of it when he's bombing brown people i don't i disagree i don't believe it's grandstanding
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:46.000]  i think it's grandstanding when you hear the owner of the team saying that it's not racist and no one
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:51.440]  should be offended sure when they go after players for lesser stuff they say racist look at the kid
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:58.720]  in philadelphia the kid in philadelphia it says the racial slur and it's caught on tape and the nfl
[2:55:58.720 --> 2:56:07.200]  sends him to to school sensitivity training well what it shows me is this we as individuals can
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:13.680]  be accused of racism but corporations can't be very good point corporation in washington
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:20.640]  that has a racial nickname and nothing or we're keeping it our fans love it and the only reason
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:27.440]  that it's that term red skin is okay is because john wane said it in the movie now i understand
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:33.600]  that and that's how it came up but my point jesse is this what i'm trying to get out here is this
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:38.240]  i get it can have that connotation i'm not debating that and i get the double standard
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:41.520]  that's a great point you've made i'm not even disagreeing it's okay to disagree i just don't
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:47.600]  want to be clear my issue is obama running al qaeda bombing and killing all these brown skin people
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:53.840]  destabilizing africa he brings it up because it makes him look good to divert off into racial
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:57:00.160]  issues i get your point well remember though now alex is over national security oh of course
[2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:06.880]  exactly i'm sure you can be a rick you can say a racist thing with national security too of course
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:14.480]  and have to have it put no my my thing is nfl should do the right thing come on they couldn't
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:20.240]  have a team say from san francisco and call them the yellow skins and depict them as chinese could
[2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:27.040]  they but i think the argument is like the minnesota viking so i know you like i mean they but that's
[2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:33.200]  different that's an individual it's like the guy i saw he had on his shirt i'm a charity not a red
[2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:40.560]  skinned nobody's debating there is an element of our society like vikings and like uh this and
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:47.040]  that and the different tribes fine and then well you know what i i take your point an entire calling
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:51.920]  them red skins well i've seen them change the name of schools from indians saying we don't like being
[2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:57.760]  your mascot well they're entitled to say that yeah but see then then they control everything
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:05.920]  offensive yeah this thing is beyond that it's it's and for the nfl to chastise one of their players
[2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:11.920]  what hypocrisy oh i know that listen i agree with you there i agree with you there so listen i hope
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:16.160]  to get you back soon if not i guess it'll be in the spring and good luck down in mexico okay thanks
[2:58:16.160 --> 2:58:20.800]  alex always a pleasure and we'll talk to you again soon and to all your listeners out there keep

[2:58:55.520 --> 2:59:01.200]  and beating mainstream media and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum
[2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:07.040]  however independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like diamond

[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:56.080]  back after this report in spite of 16 years of data that now contradict the global warming narrative
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:01:02.480]  obama and the un are going to pretend that their predictive model hasn't failed is simply a pause
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:07.520]  in the global warming trend they need to pretend that there is some kind of a correlation between
[3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:13.600]  co2 and global warming so that they can force humans to pay a global regime for the use of any
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:19.040]  energy and it isn't just carbon taxes and global regulation that they're pushing they're also trying
[3:01:19.040 --> 3:01:24.720]  to shut down most power plants and prevent new ones from being built obama loves the nuclear
[3:01:24.720 --> 3:01:28.960]  industry as much as he hates the coal industry in the first part of this report we're going to
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:35.600]  look at the issues of nuclear safety and nuclear waste disposal in the wake of typhoon man ye the
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:42.560]  fukushima nuclear power plant dumped 1130 tons of contaminated water into the ocean now the reported
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:47.840]  levels were below what the japanese government considers to be safe but we learned just in
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:52.880]  the last couple of weeks that previously reported radiation levels were actually 18 times higher
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:59.840]  than reported and that 300 tons of radioactive water leak into the ocean every day and dangerously
[3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:05.920]  high levels of radiation have been discovered in groundwater the highly radioactive groundwater
[3:02:05.920 --> 3:02:10.960]  contamination is due to leaking storage vessels that are holding the water that was used in the
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:16.560]  original disaster maintaining the ice wall will use enough energy to power thousands of homes
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:23.440]  even if it works spent reactor fuel containing roughly 85 times more long-lived radioactivity
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:28.640]  than was released at Chernobyl still sits in pools that are vulnerable to earthquakes several
[3:02:28.640 --> 3:02:34.480]  of these pools are 100 feet above ground these pools could possibly topple or collapse from
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:39.200]  structural damage coupled with another powerful earthquake and the loss of water exposing the
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:44.880]  spent fuel could cause fire that could deposit large amounts of radioactive material over hundreds
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:49.920]  if not thousands of miles but what about nuclear plants within the united states
[3:02:50.560 --> 3:02:56.160]  dr. yakso a nuclear regulatory commission member for seven years and former nrc chairman
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:03.280]  said in april of 2013 that all 104 nuclear reactors have safety problems that can't be fixed and
[3:03:03.280 --> 3:03:08.640]  should be shut down noting the potential to have more failures like fukushima he said
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:14.160]  continuing to put band-aid on band-aid is not going to fix the problem of course there are many
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:19.280]  ways that nuclear plants can fail but in this particular mode there are 23 reactors in the
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:27.120]  us that use the same technology as fukushima 12 and seismically active areas manufacturers like
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:32.080]  g e hitachi will tell you there's nothing to worry about but evidently they're worried enough about
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:38.320]  it that they got releases from governments like japan and canada releasing them for liability
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:44.320]  that will be borne by the taxpayers like this half billion dollar ice wall public concern has
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:50.000]  focused on catastrophic reactor events like three-mile island and chernobyl but as we saw in fukushima
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:56.560]  pools of spent fuel represented great danger as well spent nuclear fuel is extraordinarily radioactive
[3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:02.160]  and must be handled with great care an unprotected person just a foot away from a recently removed
[3:04:02.160 --> 3:04:08.240]  fuel assembly could receive a lethal dosage in just a matter of seconds as one of the most
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:13.920]  dangerous materials on the planet spent reactor fuel requires permanent geological isolation to
[3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:20.000]  protect humans for thousands of years and of course politics and money are driving decisions
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:25.120]  more than safety plans to move spent fuel to remote sparsely populated areas like yucca
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:31.680]  mountain have been overruled by powerful politicians like harry reid as a result the largest storage
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:37.360]  pools in the country are located in a heavily populated area at a reactor complex sharon harris
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:42.560]  just outside raleigh north carolina transported from other reactors by rail through high population
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:48.560]  centers on the east coast scientists at mit and princeton warned that spent fuel recently
[3:04:48.560 --> 3:04:54.560]  discharged from reactor could heat up relatively rapidly and catch fire the fire could spread to
[3:04:54.560 --> 3:04:59.920]  older fuel and the long-term contamination consequences of such an event could be significantly
[3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:04.560]  worse than chernobyl my friends alec jones here to tell you about some of the most important

[3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:22.480]  we got ron paul coming up then jesse ventura uh really the big news i'm going to be covered on
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:27.920]  the nightly news tonight because i'll know a lot more then is that our high level source
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:32.400]  said that there weren't supposed to be nuclear weapons a month ago back on september 3rd at
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:37.120]  dais they pulled them out of secret mothballs loaded them on trucks that weren't the normal
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:41.920]  trucks that move nukes around there of course is the big private nuke base the big nuke plant
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:46.720]  the biggest in the u.s uh is right outside of there that's in all our articles and then this
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:51.520]  that night lindsay graham comes out and says the east coast including south carolina is going to
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:55.600]  be nuked well the nukes were reportedly going to georgia and then on the south carolina
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:07.440]  and then we learned two weeks ago that that night that night they were left of command this is hours
[3:10:07.440 --> 3:10:18.160]  after we broke it that night uh we have the head in the navy of the nuclear system second
[3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:23.840]  command of country's nuclear arsenal was suspended and now in the mainstream daily mail associated
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:32.160]  press you name it they get into why they say he was suspended and now we have another general
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:40.400]  even more high level over all the nuclear weapons in the united states uh being relieved of command
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:45.200]  air force general in charge of nukes have been fired and the obama administration doesn't even
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:51.760]  want this known ap says there's that article and now he's been replaced by major general jack
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:56.800]  winestein okay and then you've got
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:05.280]  the same individual that's removing all of them now i don't know if this is connected to all that
[3:11:05.280 --> 3:11:10.480]  but it looks like it is this would normally be huge news if one general over nukes got removed
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:15.440]  the number two guy now the number one guy and then and then one person has been put over
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:23.280]  uh all of them major general jack winestein this individual looks pretty young to me so
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:27.840]  there's a major shakeup going on we know that's been going on in the brass now the reason i've
[3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:33.760]  got this next gentleman on is because he came off to me and i said this privately when he was on
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:38.480]  with us last year and then earlier this year i said that guy's probably is like a cia operative
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:43.520]  or something just the way he acts the whole nine yards um you know the you know the cover of being
[3:11:43.520 --> 3:11:47.440]  in china running a big language school and then getting girls they were going to kill
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:52.320]  you know a board in the womb out of the country sounds like a white side type guy i even said that
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:57.680]  to the crew you guys remember me saying that this guy's just i'll use the term they spend and say
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:02.880]  his races but it does nothing to do with that the point is i don't know if he is he just comes off
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:08.880]  like he's not lying i don't know the people that know him that say he's a good guy and uh his name
[3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:15.920]  is dr james garrow phd and he runs the pink picota girls dot com it's save over 45 000 chinese girls
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:20.720]  for being aborted because they can guarantee they're going to be adopted and i know he's had the
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:25.840]  he's got the classic cut out of somebody all over the world working in working in charities and
[3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:31.360]  things he's gone public saying he was a high-level operative and covert operations and that his
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:36.720]  cover's been blown by obama and so he's going public now we have a lot of people like toss
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:42.560]  chumlee on his famous for the cia contractor testified to congress he's on on here two weeks
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:48.400]  ago he's on fox news yesterday uh you know i've had the navy seals blow uh the whistle to me on the
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:52.800]  murder and blowing 23 of them up and they've been lied and rape was fake it was a they killed an old
[3:12:52.800 --> 3:12:56.880]  guy that looked similar to him who actually worked for him it was all staged that's now all come out
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:02.400]  mainstream news in those cases though i'm meeting with the navy seal i know is a navy seal or in
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:10.160]  the case of chumlee or so i'm chumlee plumbing i can go uh look it up that he's a famous whistle
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:14.000]  blower from the church committee in iran contra and is who he says he is and is currently still
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:18.400]  working in that they're like well why didn't he lose his job doing that because that's the job
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:24.320]  he's done he didn't tell the secrets that that were illegal he told secrets in whistle blowing
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:32.800]  okay so i don't know uh if what our guest is going to say is is completely accurate uh but
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:37.440]  enough of the things he said in the past have come true that he's almost like he said last year
[3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:42.800]  here than earlier this year here there's a purge of military brass and we saw that with the Benghazi
[3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:47.760]  now it's admitted that's been going on they've replaced three members well no three chairman
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:52.000]  of the joint chiefs the last seven eight years and then they've replaced uh multiple members
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:55.840]  of the joint chiefs who won't nuke iran or start this whole war who don't want to give
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:14:01.600]  heat-seeking missiles to al-qaeda the ambassador didn't want to say to kill him here's the headline
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:07.360]  bombshell jim garrow reveals career as covert cia operative i don't know that headline's
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:12.080]  accurate because he said he's not going to reveal what agency because of uh agreements says bright
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:18.080]  bark tom clancy murdered by obama administration i know tom clancy was reportedly a listener
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:24.160]  i know tom clancy was fed a lot of high-level stuff that's come out now i have been in no people
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:28.560]  that know the family of bright barton they said he was having heart problems but that's perfect in
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:33.440]  in a bar with wine to then kill him i don't know i know they do kill people they killed the dc madam
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:38.480]  a month after she was on my show and i warned her and and and i'm going to shut up because we only
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:43.120]  got to the bottom of the hour to let him talk about it he joins us i guess from his home in canada
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:49.360]  uh dr jim garrow uh jim why are you going public what's happened and i mean if you can't tell us
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:54.560]  what agency we're with i guess that these folks got this headline wrong saying cia operative
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:14:59.360]  i mean tell us tell us why you're going public and i mean you certainly have the history in the
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:04.560]  past where you've been what you've done i mean it fits into everything but why you are now going
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:10.480]  public in that case well i basically have to alex i mean i've been outed and uh when that happens
[3:15:10.480 --> 3:15:15.120]  to you what do you do you got it uh you got to protect yourself you got to cover your your bases
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:19.600]  you got to make sure that the information that's going to keep you alive is out in the right spots
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:25.360]  you know with the right people um and that's basically my uh my job at the moment so coming on
[3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:31.440]  and and saying to you yeah like that of 45 year career doing what i've done uh for the country and
[3:15:31.440 --> 3:15:36.000]  let's face it so we've been through some very interesting times and the things that i've done
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:43.520]  uh will curl your hair um but it was of necessity and it was assigned so you do your job and uh
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:49.680]  you you go up the ranks and of course over the course of time i've i've gone up to where i'm
[3:15:49.680 --> 3:15:56.720]  number two in my agency well you've got the floor you've got the floor for 15 minutes so so tell
[3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:02.400]  us tell us what what you have to say and what's going on and uh this uh termination list you say
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:09.360]  you know about well let's face it we've got uh we've got a uh a dictator a tyrant who feels
[3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:15.040]  that uh he can do anything he wants above and beyond law he's crushing the constitution and
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:21.280]  anyone who dares to stand up and even question uh whether what he is doing is within law within the
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:28.080]  purview of law or not uh he he cares not so when you're up against an opponent like that
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:33.280]  regular american citizens need to worry about their safety their security they need to worry
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:39.280]  that the oath of office has meant nothing to this man um he has an agenda that has nothing to do with
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:45.120]  the protection of the american public republic or or the public at large so you see the moves that
[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:52.000]  he's making and he is tearing the place apart he's eviscerating the constitution and what he's doing
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:59.360]  too to back himself up is scaring the becheezers out of people uh part of it uh is with strategic
[3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:04.320]  killing uh and very important people have been killed around the world that you don't know about
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:08.720]  yet but you'll find out about it and of course within our own country we have people like
[3:17:08.720 --> 3:17:13.680]  breitbart and clancy and then hastings i mean hastings had a a ton of material some of it
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:20.960]  material that uh originated with breitbart uh was in the hands of clancy um and these people i mean
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:26.560]  how do i know these people i fed tom clancy information from the days when i was working with
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:33.920]  the uh the man who was uh the colonel in charge of modeling submarine warfare against america for
[3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:39.440]  china uh who was now vice president well by the way i know steve pacinic is who he says he is
[3:17:39.440 --> 3:17:44.240]  and he's been feeding me info for 12 years why does my show continue to be the place to bring
[3:17:44.240 --> 3:17:50.240]  the info i guess because i'm crazy enough to put it out well actually it's it's you know what
[3:17:50.240 --> 3:17:55.200]  it's because you're known to be a patriot and you don't care you don't give a hoot what people think
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:00.400]  so you're putting it out there i mean the stuff that jesse ventures brought forward with you um
[3:18:00.400 --> 3:18:04.720]  and other people have brought forward with you and i won't name people but uh i mean they've brought
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:11.040]  stuff that is has curled the hair of the public and either you laugh or you cry and frankly they
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:17.760]  should be crying over what you bring forward and and the fact that you're unabashedly uh pro america
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:23.040]  uh a total patriot i mean they should be listening to you do you have any info on these missing nukes
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:30.640]  yes but i can't stand any about that but yes absolutely keep in mind you've had people on
[3:18:30.640 --> 3:18:37.520]  your program we've talked very clearly about emps going off and be prepared and uh this is all lining
[3:18:37.520 --> 3:18:45.920]  up along that line oh boy okay so so so tell us uh what needs to be out there about operations
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:55.520]  i mean why you're going public um yeah you say obama blew your cover why well i blew his i talked
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:19:00.240]  about the litmus test of the military and of course look what's happening uh since the day that i uh
[3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:05.440]  let it out there because one person was being pressured uh who happened to be a favorite of
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:10.240]  the gentleman who told me what was going on and since that time i've had dozens of military people
[3:19:10.240 --> 3:19:16.960]  uh call me Skype me or or special message me uh about their own dilemmas and i've had chats with
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:22.080]  some of the folks that uh we are now aware have been pushed out the bottom line is looking for
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:27.520]  fealty obama is looking for people to bend the knee to him and him alone uh it doesn't matter what
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:32.880]  their position might be or are the responsibilities they have whether it's nuclear weapons whether
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:39.920]  it's uh covert operations whether it's secrets beyond belief everyone is about the need to obama
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:46.720]  i will not bow my knee to obama never would never will well i mean it's directly out of not even
[3:19:46.720 --> 3:19:51.520]  north korea does this that if you joke with the with the tsa people you're going to be arrested
[3:19:52.160 --> 3:19:58.320]  i mean this these people really are trying to take over there's no doubt well he's a spoiled brat
[3:19:58.320 --> 3:20:04.000]  you're looking at a psychologically damaged individual uh who was never confronted as a child
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:09.520]  never disciplined as a child has had his own way has been molly cobbled his entire life
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:14.000]  and feels that he can get away with anything well you know the evidence that he has in hand
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:19.120]  and the power that he has in hand indicates to him that he in fact can get away with anything
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:24.400]  including murder now the problem is he has crossed certain lines with certain people
[3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:28.640]  and he is scared and skinny do you know who scares the daylights out of him right now no
[3:20:28.640 --> 3:20:34.800]  believe it or not remember the bikers i was there 1.3 million people showed up in washington
[3:20:34.800 --> 3:20:41.280]  not all of them organized but many of them just there because of the cause itself uh that scared
[3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:46.400]  the willies out of the man do you remember when he was standing there uh reading with such depth
[3:20:46.400 --> 3:20:52.960]  of feeling uh his teleprompter yes do you remember that do you remember when he paused just slightly
[3:20:52.960 --> 3:20:59.280]  and it was because in the background he could hear the bikers they were there and the noise of that
[3:20:59.280 --> 3:21:05.520]  distracted him just enough to take his attention away from his his dear teleprompter well that's
[3:21:05.520 --> 3:21:11.920]  one thing he's had to look at 1.3 million people and the other thing is he turned off the cameras
[3:21:11.920 --> 3:21:16.800]  so that the news feed that would normally go out to the media showing traffic conditions
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:23.360]  it was over you couldn't see it and he was hiding behind that he was afraid next fear
[3:21:23.360 --> 3:21:31.360]  truckers then vets the vet thing what a stupid error on his part does he not know this these
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:39.440]  people are respected and when compared to him he's a dog compared to them they're champions
[3:21:39.440 --> 3:21:45.120]  and he's an idiot he's a moron well i know this they're destroying the infrastructure of this
[3:21:45.120 --> 3:21:49.920]  country they're they're carrying out agenda 21 they want to make everybody dependent and they
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:55.120]  are insanely arrogant and arresting foreign tourists that show up at the Grand Canyon not even
[3:21:55.120 --> 3:22:00.640]  speaking english from japan uh i mean they've created like this little federal security
[3:22:00.640 --> 3:22:06.080]  guard force that is on a psychotrip if i was trying to cause a rebellion this is what i would do
[3:22:06.080 --> 3:22:11.120]  are they trying to cause a rebellion or are they such cowards they think the psychology that would
[3:22:11.120 --> 3:22:16.560]  intimidate them is going to intimidate us because all it's going to do is backfire well keep in mind
[3:22:16.560 --> 3:22:21.600]  the clovered piven strategy of create a crisis and then manage the crisis and that's what he's
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:27.680]  doing he's creating crises all over the place it is so out of the box this stuff that's going on
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:33.040]  that he knows full well nobody's prepared to deal with this how do you deal with this no one's ever
[3:22:33.040 --> 3:22:37.040]  thought it's ever gonna happen no reasonable person would think that a president would do what he's
[3:22:37.040 --> 3:22:44.000]  doing so here we are he's winning the war of the crisis by creating it managing it all the way
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:49.200]  and no one is challenging him look at the people we've elected into the house and what do they do
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:55.120]  what's bainer doing bainer's busy losing when he's got victory right within his grasp instead of
[3:22:55.120 --> 3:23:00.720]  you know sticking sticking it to obama and saying look hey yeah we'll deal with this debt ceiling
[3:23:00.720 --> 3:23:05.120]  sure we'll give you a little a little edge this way or that way but here here's what you have to
[3:23:05.120 --> 3:23:08.800]  start stripping away well that's what's so frustrating as we always have victory right
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:14.560]  there we just tell it like it is but but but no one does it they just sit there shaking in fear well
[3:23:14.560 --> 3:23:20.720]  I get the feeling you're gonna see some military folks who have been outed along with myself and
[3:23:20.720 --> 3:23:25.920]  others who are gonna start to stand up in public and saying you know what we know what's going on
[3:23:25.920 --> 3:23:32.240]  we don't fear this man one bit not one iota and we're gonna run for office and then watch what
[3:23:32.240 --> 3:23:37.760]  happens well I'll say this I think they've taken American confusion or not even laziness but just
[3:23:37.760 --> 3:23:41.440]  distraction has cowered us I think now that they're openly pushing a fight I think they're
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:45.840]  going to get one I hope it's not physical I hope it is informational we just take the country back
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:23:51.120]  over but but shifting gears because the interview's over about eight minutes sir there's a lot you
[3:23:51.120 --> 3:23:55.200]  have to say you were telling me off here are some things what is it you want to impart to people
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:23:59.600]  because I am not just seeing what you're seeing I can't confirm what you're seeing I have a lot of
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:05.440]  people that I can confirm are high level people and whistleblowers and we are finding out who is
[3:24:05.440 --> 3:24:11.280]  for the tyranny who is against and we are seeing a lot of people on the inside leak info that's
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:16.640]  got a concern the establishment oh absolutely and of course patriots are willing to do it because
[3:24:16.640 --> 3:24:21.840]  they realize they're not dealing with somebody who honors the constitution so why wouldn't they just
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:28.720]  push them aside um a journalist has been doing he's been searching me out for two years he's
[3:24:28.720 --> 3:24:33.600]  been really really thorough what he's done Eric rush I think I mentioned before to you the black
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:40.320]  guy who's on Hannity a lot and talks racial issues this man has been sat he sat by my by my side
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:44.800]  he's he's examined me totally he knows he knows more than anyone else he's going to come out with
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:48.720]  an article that's going to curl your hair when you find out what I've been involved in oh no no
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:52.800]  that's good so we are going to have more coming out soon but but I mean basically you were telling
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:57.200]  me that you've had some problems some harassment some issues and so that's why you're just protecting
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:02.880]  yourself to a certain extent by going public yes yeah and you know the public needs to know
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:07.040]  that there are people like myself there are people in positions of authority or previous
[3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:12.080]  positions of authority like generals and admirals and within my own agency I mean I was number two
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:18.000]  in command and we did not answer directly by the way to the president and that's something that people
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:24.240]  better be aware of some of what Tom Clancy even implied or other people have implied in their novels
[3:25:24.240 --> 3:25:29.600]  it's actually true that there's not necessarily a chain of command that starts with the president
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:35.360]  and it works down there are sidebar issues and sidebar agencies that are not readily known but
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:40.160]  I'll tell you this they're totally loyal to the republic and that is important for the public to
[3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:48.000]  know there is hope that there is going to be a change well my concern is they could use these
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:53.440]  nukes to hold the country hostage and I mean I know from the source this really is the source
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:58.400]  this happened and then all Hades broke loose after we put that out these generals being removed
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:02.720]  admirals over the nukes other stuff Lindsey Graham running around saying we're going to get nuked
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:06.640]  and I don't know exactly what's going on yet because my sources don't know
[3:26:08.720 --> 3:26:15.040]  yeah well I warned you about the litmus test well extrapolate on that take that as a known value
[3:26:15.040 --> 3:26:20.400]  okay they're asking will you shoot Americans okay if they if they won't allow you to confiscate their
[3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:25.760]  arms will they allow you to go out or will they follow your order and shoot to Americans who won't
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:30.880]  to who won't bow the knee that's an important starting point why doesn't the military if it's
[3:26:30.880 --> 3:26:35.840]  an foreign globalist enemy just a lot of Obama and his his kleptocrats because if that's I was
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:39.840]  high level I'd say oh yes I'll shoot the Americans and then I would start building an operation
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:46.800]  against them well they are frankly they're um you know if they're loyal to the constitution
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:50.560]  and the loyalty of the people obviously they're going to stay if they can't if they can't if
[3:26:50.560 --> 3:26:56.080]  they're in a position where they have to you know either pledge fealty to the man uh or not uh
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:26:59.760]  they're going to go out they're going to leave they because they know what's coming sure so if
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:04.320]  they're given an order that's so evil that they can't bluff anymore and claim their loyal then they
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:09.040]  just leave that's it that's it and you're you're watching it happen and we know full well what's
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:14.000]  going on I mean the public are not stupid they know when uh when a high level person in the
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:20.640]  military whatever branch leaves uh under a bit of a cloud well this is all the guys over the
[3:27:20.640 --> 3:27:27.840]  nukes number one and number two removed yes what does that tell you come on what does that tell you
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:32.160]  somebody wants total control of the nukes total but again what are they gonna do about the patriots
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:38.400]  when I know about nukes leaving a base within two hours of it happening well isn't that great
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:43.440]  that we have that information source isn't it wonderful now we know where that they're leaving
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:49.280]  where they're going to and what are they being purposed for that's the critical element well
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:55.360]  that's why they focus on patriot whistleblowers because that's the chink and smog's armor you got
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:28:00.480]  it you got it bright parts now gone clancy's gone and uh hastings of course got blown up well
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:05.680]  hastings they clearly blew up but I mean clancy it was like sudden illness gone uh but I mean you
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:10.800]  have info or you think they killed clancy I have info I know full well I know what the poison was
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:19.280]  they used on them both of them yeah yeah what is it a poison them that metabolizes out so they
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:23.360]  can't trace it within five days why do you think they didn't post clancy for five days
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:30.720]  gone from the system gone well look at look at Breitbart I mean that was I mean the way they
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:34.880]  acted it looked like there was something going on saying he was dead 45 minutes after he was admitted
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:40.320]  thing and it was natural causes without any type of autopsy until later and then look at hastings
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:45.200]  how they cremated the body the family wanted it I know I know the family says he was killed but
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:49.840]  they're scared of course they're scared and they should be if they can get Breitbart clancy and
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:54.720]  hastings then they can get any of us at any point in time which is a private conversation you and I
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:29:00.400]  should be having frankly Alex because you're going to be a key element in getting information and
[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:05.840]  truth out oh you think you think I could be next on the list I think you're right up there at the
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:12.480]  top that'll be pretty obvious wanted but wait a minute do they care do they care that Breitbart
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:18.480]  the minute they the guy who was right beside Breitbart after he collapsed saw that his face
[3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:23.440]  was bright red do you know what that was that's the poison nobody goes bright red when they're
[3:29:23.440 --> 3:29:29.120]  having a heart attack opposite they turn white the turn ashen you turn ashen gray and then blue
[3:29:29.120 --> 3:29:36.640]  yeah all right well I have to talk to you then um off air but how do people find out more what's
[3:29:36.640 --> 3:29:45.120]  the best website uh well right now I'm going on facebook under uh jim garrow just j-i-n-g-a-r-r-o-w
