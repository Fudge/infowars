[00:00.000 --> 00:12.140]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.140 --> 00:29.420]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:29.420 --> 00:36.660]  well the White House and NASA have come out and they say that 2014 was the
[00:36.660 --> 00:41.580]  hottest year on record doesn't matter that almost all other independent
[00:41.580 --> 00:46.300]  meteorologists and scientists are showing that this has been one of the
[00:46.300 --> 00:51.140]  coldest years that we just left on average worldwide that we saw in more
[00:51.140 --> 00:58.940]  than 40 years and the least amount of hurricanes typhoons you name it because
[00:58.940 --> 01:06.260]  the Sun has been dimming as part of its cycle 2014 breaks record for warmest
[01:06.260 --> 01:14.420]  year Noah that's the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA
[01:14.420 --> 01:18.900]  experts say who've been proven to be totally political the main
[01:18.900 --> 01:25.640]  climatologist of course at NASA is a huge Al Gore eugenicists well I don't
[01:25.640 --> 01:29.420]  like to be profane but turdbasket there's not another word to describe them
[01:29.420 --> 01:34.860]  and they want to carbon tax everything so you got the Pope out there pushing
[01:34.860 --> 01:39.380]  carbon taxing California is going ahead and implementing and Australia is
[01:39.380 --> 01:41.620]  getting rid of it because they implemented it first and it wrecked
[01:41.620 --> 01:47.340]  their economy it's wrecked the Spanish economy over in Spain this is getting
[01:47.340 --> 01:53.540]  crazy meanwhile there's an article from Mark Moreno at his website climate
[01:53.540 --> 01:57.060]  depot this link on drudgereport.com that we're going to post in hole at
[01:57.060 --> 02:01.140]  infowars.com and retweet out at real Alex Jones scientists bulk at hottest
[02:01.140 --> 02:05.700]  year claims ignore satellite showing an 18-year pause we are arguing over the
[02:05.700 --> 02:10.980]  significance of hundreds of a degree the pause continues and that's just off
[02:10.980 --> 02:14.940]  the selected buoys and satellite readings they're using that they cherry pick
[02:14.940 --> 02:20.060]  ladies and gentlemen they've been proven all over the western world here's an
[02:20.060 --> 02:24.700]  example of what they did in the last 20 years they will move the thermometers
[02:24.700 --> 02:31.300]  say at Camp Mayberry here in Austin from the side of a building or under a tree
[02:31.300 --> 02:38.180]  to out on the concrete tarmac of the helicopter pet same thing here where I
[02:38.180 --> 02:43.900]  live years ago they under federal funding for a new system of thermometers of
[02:43.900 --> 02:49.900]  course and weather gauges moved it out onto the tarmac well do you think it's
[02:49.900 --> 02:55.540]  hotter out on the black tarmac where you can fry an egg than it is in the grass
[02:55.540 --> 03:04.100]  this is what they do they play games and what did the head of the UN program who
[03:04.100 --> 03:07.700]  was in charge of all the major worldwide universities gathering the data say
[03:07.700 --> 03:13.620]  six years ago when climate gate broke he said we've got to hide the what we got
[03:13.620 --> 03:22.780]  to hide the what the decline we've got to hide the decline and climatologist
[03:22.780 --> 03:26.260]  dr. Roy Spencer has come out and said that's a fraud
[03:26.260 --> 03:29.900]  climatologist dr. Pat Michaels has said that it's not true
[03:29.900 --> 03:36.380]  physicists dr. Lubos Motel analyzed the satellite temperature data and laughed
[03:36.380 --> 03:39.820]  out loud saying it was not the warmest year
[03:39.820 --> 03:45.300]  climatologist dr. Roger Pickle senior said we found a significant warm bias
[03:45.300 --> 03:49.380]  picking warm readings and ignoring the cool readings
[03:49.380 --> 03:54.060]  climatologist dr. Judith Curry essentially 2014 essentially time of
[03:54.060 --> 03:58.940]  2005 and 010 for the hottest year if you look at their readings it's actually if
[03:58.940 --> 04:02.980]  you look at other readings again the colis within 30 to 50 years it's not an
[04:02.980 --> 04:06.580]  exact science because there's so many micro climates I'll be covering that more
[04:06.580 --> 04:11.140]  today we got a big broadcast lined up we have the state rep on from Utah that
[04:11.140 --> 04:17.420]  it's had a devastating devastating devastating victory for freedom and

[07:11.500 --> 07:15.540]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[07:15.540 --> 07:19.620]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42

[08:36.420 --> 08:40.340]  in the Middle East and so much more will be joining us in the third hour we have

[08:52.820 --> 08:59.500]  Common Core and two plus two equals five all this and more coming up the pope
[08:59.500 --> 09:04.580]  advocates violence in response to free speech but that's how Jesus died and now
[09:04.580 --> 09:08.660]  the pope's having to backtrack on his comments saying that well you talked
[09:08.660 --> 09:12.860]  about somebody's religion you get punched in the nose I wish the pope would
[09:12.860 --> 09:15.420]  talk more about the hundreds of thousands of Christians murdered the last
[09:15.420 --> 09:20.060]  few years the Middle East by the jihadis that are being funded but I guess
[09:20.060 --> 09:24.700]  that's not his job now let's go to a special report put together by staff
[09:24.700 --> 09:30.660]  sergeant Joe Biggs and John Bown dealing with Obama's terror cells in the USA
[09:30.660 --> 09:34.740]  we're gonna premiere this here then tweet the video out at real Alex Jones
[09:34.740 --> 09:38.500]  stay with us here's the report
[09:38.500 --> 09:52.740]  so mr. president how do you how do you handle how do you handle promises that
[09:52.740 --> 09:57.700]  you've made when you were running for election and how do you handle it how
[09:57.700 --> 10:03.380]  do you handle it I mean what do you say to people do you if you just you know I
[10:03.380 --> 10:12.460]  know people people were wondering you don't okay how sad was it in the
[10:12.460 --> 10:20.500]  streets of Paris as 40 world leaders walked down the street absent was the
[10:20.500 --> 10:24.740]  United States of America where was the president attorney general Eric Holder
[10:24.740 --> 10:29.700]  was in Paris for a terrorism summit with French president Olan but darted out
[10:29.700 --> 10:34.220]  just before world leaders historically convene to pay their respects to the
[10:34.220 --> 10:39.780]  fallen Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Holder then went on a media blitz claiming that
[10:39.780 --> 10:44.100]  there is no credible threat to Americans the entire threat environment is as
[10:44.100 --> 10:48.780]  dangerous as anything you've seen since 9-11 is that still the case yeah I would
[10:48.780 --> 10:52.420]  say that that's true although there's not a specific credible threat that I can
[10:52.420 --> 10:56.780]  point to it makes the average American wonder what the Obama administration is
[10:56.780 --> 11:02.180]  hiding when anyone can go online and discover the clear and present danger of
[11:02.180 --> 11:07.780]  decades-old State Department documents revealing what has been lurking within
[11:07.780 --> 11:12.820]  at least 22 of our United States pretty a tape uncovered by our investigation
[11:12.820 --> 11:16.940]  team shake to Lonnie a scene here with recruiting America Muslims and
[11:16.940 --> 11:22.580]  instructing them in Islamic guerrilla warfare tactics the tape is known as
[11:22.580 --> 11:36.020]  so-to-for-ball on the half of the Muslims of America I present before you a
[11:36.020 --> 11:42.780]  documentary film in helping the training of prisoners I'm proud to say that to sit
[11:42.780 --> 11:51.300]  with the colleagues who have been successful in finding an international
[11:51.300 --> 12:02.940]  organization which is called Soldiers of Allah S.O.A. and we are establishing
[12:02.940 --> 12:09.180]  training camps who can reach us you know at the Quranic open history offices
[12:09.180 --> 12:15.940]  at State New York or in Canada or in Michigan or in South Carolina or in
[12:15.940 --> 12:21.060]  Pakistan wherever we are you can reach us you're most welcome to join one of
[12:21.060 --> 12:31.260]  us the clarion project who I work for we broke this story about how a terrorist
[12:31.260 --> 12:36.460]  enclave has been detected in Texas we know this from declassified FBI documents
[12:36.460 --> 12:39.700]  there is originally some broad intelligence about it and so we started
[12:39.700 --> 12:43.540]  investigating we figured out the groups front organizations that they were
[12:43.540 --> 12:47.580]  using in Texas and then some activists from a group called act for America went
[12:47.580 --> 12:51.860]  and verified the specific location so that we made sure that we we definitely
[12:51.860 --> 12:55.660]  know what we're talking about and then we got declassified FBI documents and
[12:55.660 --> 13:00.380]  confirmed it from that end so we know for a fact that this organization that
[13:00.380 --> 13:06.140]  runs the 22 villages as they call them also have one in Texas in 2001 ATF
[13:06.140 --> 13:11.300]  special agent Thomas P. Gallagher testified in court that individuals from
[13:11.300 --> 13:16.660]  the organization Muslims of the Americas are trained in Hancock, New York and if
[13:16.660 --> 13:21.340]  they pass the training in Hancock, New York are then sent to Pakistan for
[13:21.340 --> 13:26.900]  training and paramilitary and survivalist training by Mr. Jalani on
[13:26.900 --> 13:33.140]  January 23rd 2002 American journalist Daniel Pearl was kidnapped on his way
[13:33.140 --> 13:38.740]  to question chic Mumbark Ali Jalani's connection to shoe bomber Richard Reed
[13:38.740 --> 13:44.780]  in downtown Karachi nine days later Pearl was decapitated on May 16th his
[13:44.780 --> 13:49.940]  severed head and decomposed body were found cut into 10 pieces Jalani was
[13:49.940 --> 13:54.820]  temporarily in Pakistani custody after the kidnapping the main compound near
[13:54.820 --> 14:00.660]  the town of Hancock in upstate New York known as Holy Islamberg was founded in
[14:00.660 --> 14:07.100]  1980 by Jalani as religious sanctuary for devout Muslims this land is located
[14:07.100 --> 14:11.500]  near the reservoir that supplies most of New York City's drinking water in fact
[14:11.500 --> 14:16.220]  most of the compounds are near strategic locations within the United States
[14:16.220 --> 14:21.780]  designed to affect a mass population event at any time according to the 2006
[14:21.780 --> 14:26.020]  law enforcement report Jalani opened his compounds near significant
[14:26.020 --> 14:30.300]  infrastructure targets his on bill is less than five miles away from the
[14:30.300 --> 14:35.260]  Katawa nuclear facility the FBI's own documents define the Muslims of America
[14:35.260 --> 14:39.580]  as an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of
[14:39.580 --> 14:44.260]  planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and here within the
[14:44.260 --> 14:48.700]  U.S. how can the Obama administration claim they are concerned about lone wolf
[14:48.700 --> 14:53.740]  attacks IE gun owners tea partiers and constitutionalists when training videos
[14:53.740 --> 14:59.180]  clearly link she Ike Mumbark Ali Jalani to an expanding network of radical
[14:59.180 --> 15:03.580]  Islamic cells within the United States further State Department documents have
[15:03.580 --> 15:08.260]  not listed Foucault as a terror organization regardless of countless
[15:08.260 --> 15:13.020]  felonies committed by its members Jalani's intent is echoed by the Muslim
[15:13.020 --> 15:18.260]  Brotherhood with slogans like God is our objective the Prophet is our leader the
[15:18.260 --> 15:24.020]  Koran is our law Jihad is our way dying in the way of God is our highest hope
[15:24.020 --> 15:27.900]  and Obama's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are becoming increasingly
[15:27.900 --> 15:42.740]  well-known why why President Barack Hussain not hitting hard on the terrorists and on ISIS and I know it sounds crazy but bear with me
[15:42.740 --> 15:50.420]  President Barack was born after his older brother Malik the father Mr. Hussain
[15:50.420 --> 15:57.380]  named his son Malik and that's one of God's names in Islam the second son he
[15:57.380 --> 16:05.500]  named him Barack what is Barack me Barack is the right Prophet Muhammad and we
[16:05.500 --> 16:12.500]  can see Mr. Malik sitting with Mr. Obama visiting him in the White House Mr.
[16:12.500 --> 16:17.540]  Malik is in charge of the Muslim Brotherhood in Africa there's a lot of
[16:17.540 --> 16:24.100]  finances going on through Mr. Malik and we can see him in another picture holding
[16:24.100 --> 16:30.380]  the Jalani and dagger on his waist and he is a big supporter to the Muslim
[16:30.380 --> 16:37.980]  Brotherhood and that explains that Mr. Barack Hussain is not hitting hard on
[16:37.980 --> 16:43.900]  the Muslim Brotherhood on the contrary he took them off the terrorist list for
[16:43.900 --> 16:49.060]  years and years the Muslim Brotherhood is on the terrorist list around the
[16:49.060 --> 16:54.820]  world in the Europe world who knows them best but Mr. Barack decided to take
[16:54.820 --> 16:59.460]  them off the terrorist list and start to be sponsoring them and put them in
[16:59.460 --> 17:04.740]  charge of Egypt the IRS and your tax dollars allow these nonprofit
[17:04.740 --> 17:09.040]  organizations openly hell bent on the destruction of the United States to
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.620]  operate within the United States demographics show that the Muslim birth
[17:13.620 --> 17:17.740]  rate is the world's highest but it is falling faster than the birth rate of
[17:17.740 --> 17:23.220]  any culture the Muslim world currently has 25 million idle young men
[17:23.220 --> 17:27.820]  struggling to follow the immigration path to Western Europe and the United
[17:27.820 --> 17:32.500]  States to escape abject poverty and diminishing resources now the Obama
[17:32.500 --> 17:37.380]  administration is playing semantics with the usage of the term radical Islam in
[17:37.380 --> 17:41.500]  an apparent bid to paint their investment in a better light the lengths to
[17:41.500 --> 17:47.460]  which he will go to avoid telling us the truth about the enemy is becoming a
[17:47.460 --> 17:52.900]  comical it's certainly embarrassing for example he will never forget about that
[17:52.900 --> 17:57.620]  we use the word shiha they still never use that but he refuses to use the word
[17:57.620 --> 18:03.300]  Islamist which is used throughout the Muslim world it's used by journalists by
[18:03.300 --> 18:07.780]  authors there are a variety of reasons why there was radical Islam one of them
[18:07.780 --> 18:12.260]  there are a variety of reasons why people do these things some of them are
[18:12.260 --> 18:16.500]  potentially religious but all I'm asking is if you think among those variety of
[18:16.500 --> 18:20.620]  reasons radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals
[18:20.620 --> 18:24.660]  took the steps that they did we see say radical Islam I mean I think those people
[18:24.660 --> 18:29.900]  who espouse a version of Islam that is not you are you uncomfortable attributing
[18:29.900 --> 18:33.020]  any of their actions to radical Islam it sounds like oh I don't want to say
[18:33.020 --> 18:37.980]  anything negative about a religion that is no I'm not talking about a lot about
[18:37.980 --> 18:44.060]  radical Islam I'm not talking about the general religion Mr. AJ is hard to get an
[18:44.060 --> 18:47.620]  answer yes or no but and look the Middle East is coming apart with this

[24:52.540 --> 24:57.580]  deep in the heart of Texas Austin here's what I want to do let me just
[24:57.580 --> 25:03.700]  mention some of the news that's coming up today top Obamacare official stepping
[25:03.700 --> 25:12.540]  down dive Obama's it just has a 37% approval rating in a new major scientific
[25:12.540 --> 25:18.180]  poll new bill would mark the beginning of the end of Common Core Germany
[25:18.180 --> 25:22.180]  proposes jihad identity cards because the terrorists are so allowed to fly
[25:22.180 --> 25:28.500]  everywhere all you do is pick them up for probable cause you don't then issue
[25:28.500 --> 25:34.260]  them jihad cars they're not allowed to travel that is Nazi Germany in Germany
[25:34.260 --> 25:40.620]  Belgium police of course killed to an anti-terror raid during shootout Elon
[25:40.620 --> 25:45.620]  Musk who I know is a listener of the broadcast and who we're gonna get on the
[25:45.620 --> 25:52.860]  show gives 10 million to fight killer robots and of course that's the head of
[25:52.860 --> 25:59.660]  Tesla well the problem is they've already got autonomous drones operating all
[25:59.660 --> 26:02.580]  over the place but he is certainly worried about the real issue there on
[26:02.580 --> 26:08.100]  that front Zuckerberg defends Facebook censorship despite Charlie Hebdo support
[26:08.100 --> 26:12.980]  and of course calling his users dumb efforts that's in a London Guardian he
[26:12.980 --> 26:16.660]  hangs out with the Communist Chinese censorship jar learning how to make us
[26:16.660 --> 26:22.620]  a salutary in society he is a true hypocrite monster pig on every front
[26:22.620 --> 26:30.260]  Vatican attempts to clarify Pope Francis comment on Paris attack Pontiff
[26:30.260 --> 26:36.540]  causes stir you cannot provoke you cannot insult the faith of others really
[26:36.540 --> 26:43.980]  he said yeah if someone talks about about my mother I will hit them the last
[26:43.980 --> 26:47.700]  Pope criticized the Islamists is killing Christians in Syria and other areas and
[26:47.700 --> 26:53.500]  killing radical Muslims in Libya Egypt you name it this Pope so which one's
[26:53.500 --> 26:57.420]  right I mean I'm not a Catholic but of the Pope supposedly infallible which one
[26:57.420 --> 27:02.500]  was fallible then was it the last one that they made leave or this new one
[27:02.500 --> 27:09.180]  who's an admitted socialist first time I think we've had a public socialist Pope
[27:09.180 --> 27:14.740]  over 1.2 billion people of 7 billion on this planet and he came out and doors
[27:14.740 --> 27:20.420]  carbon taxes and global government a few weeks ago and now he's saying that you
[27:20.420 --> 27:24.180]  shouldn't be able to criticize folks
[27:24.180 --> 27:30.140]  well Kit Daniels wrote an article here that I think is very powerful and went
[27:30.140 --> 27:34.100]  viral last night on infowars.com but went out last night I want to retweet it
[27:34.100 --> 27:38.740]  today at real Alex Jones and posted on Facebook Pope advocates violence in
[27:38.740 --> 27:42.980]  response to free speech but that's how Jesus died Jesus Christ was crucified
[27:42.980 --> 27:47.420]  for stating he was the son of God and they told him shut up and were Canada
[27:47.420 --> 27:50.980]  they're gonna kill him and he wouldn't do it and then Pontius Pilate gave him a
[27:50.980 --> 27:54.940]  chance and he wouldn't do it and Pontius Pilate said I find no fault with this
[27:54.940 --> 27:59.780]  man but I guess the Pope kind of trumps Christ doesn't he for a lot of folks out
[27:59.780 --> 28:07.740]  there I said I am Jesus I am said Jesus and you will see the son of man
[28:07.740 --> 28:13.340]  sitting in the right hand of the mighty one and coming on a cloud of heaven the
[28:13.340 --> 28:19.260]  high priest tourist clothes you why do we need any more witnesses he said you
[28:19.260 --> 28:23.660]  have heard the blasphemy what do you think they all condemned him as worthy
[28:23.660 --> 28:31.660]  of death that's out of the gospel of Mark so he's got to square that number
[28:31.660 --> 28:35.180]  one carbon taxes will kill a billion people over a decade that's the numbers
[28:35.180 --> 28:41.700]  that Moncton's put out before and I agree with them that if you cut off the
[28:41.700 --> 28:45.540]  energy to the world over 10 years it'll kill a billion people and more and
[28:45.540 --> 28:48.740]  Obama's told him you can't have cars you can't have air conditioning can't have
[28:48.740 --> 28:53.540]  medicine you can't have anything and so this is quite a departure from anything
[28:53.540 --> 28:58.540]  I mean this guy is he goes out and hugs old people and people with diseases and
[28:58.540 --> 29:03.580]  the mainstream media that normally attacks Catholics I mean sure you've
[29:03.580 --> 29:10.100]  noticed that attacks different popes suddenly is in love with this pope and
[29:10.100 --> 29:14.380]  just endorses everything he has to say and do I guess knowing he'd come out for
[29:14.380 --> 29:19.900]  a world council of religions and come out for ecumenical movement and come out
[29:19.900 --> 29:23.580]  for restricting free speech and come out for a world government I guess
[29:23.580 --> 29:30.940]  interesting story don't know your take on it that's just some of what we got
[29:30.940 --> 29:35.580]  here in the stack today all oil projects worth billions put on hold because of
[29:35.580 --> 29:40.060]  robbing oil prices and I've got more on George Soros I want to hit first and that
[29:40.060 --> 29:45.380]  ties in with another story canned foods are what schools say people should have
[29:45.380 --> 29:50.380]  as a defense against shooters that's we're on the added to the empire being

[33:41.460 --> 33:48.500]  tie three things together then go to report on from jacari Jackson on CNN the
[33:48.500 --> 33:52.540]  federal government recommending that you take a can of beans with you when you
[33:52.540 --> 34:00.260]  go to college or public school to throw at a shooter I'm not joking and by the
[34:00.260 --> 34:04.780]  way they know that's ridiculous it's meant to mock you they're all going to
[34:04.780 --> 34:13.740]  have paramilitary guards paid for by you and I that's coming up but when I saw
[34:13.740 --> 34:16.300]  this headline yesterday I meant to cover it and get to it but you're sorry to
[34:16.300 --> 34:22.020]  report last time for that only news it's just so over the top but that's what
[34:22.020 --> 34:26.700]  all of this is about is breaking our will just like when the feds came out a
[34:26.700 --> 34:30.500]  few years ago and told women to vomit or urinate on someone who's trying to rape
[34:30.500 --> 34:35.500]  you that's the feminist thing to do no don't teach women how to use guns and
[34:35.500 --> 34:39.300]  have them carry guns and then attacks on women basically disappear in areas where
[34:39.300 --> 34:44.340]  that happens carjackings in Florida and Texas that were epidemic ended for all
[34:44.340 --> 34:49.700]  intensive purposes went down 99% look it up within two years of concealed carry
[34:49.700 --> 34:55.500]  going in do you think muggers like in Chicago and New York like areas of Texas
[34:55.500 --> 34:58.980]  do you think they go out to rural areas and mug good old boys in their trucks
[34:58.980 --> 35:07.940]  no just like they don't stick their arms in Arizona down rattlesnake holes a
[35:07.940 --> 35:12.660]  nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves actually a nation of cowards will be
[35:12.660 --> 35:17.060]  gang raped by every criminal type you can imagine and we are being gang raped
[35:17.060 --> 35:22.020]  financially economically physically it's only gonna get worse now all of that
[35:22.020 --> 35:28.660]  said I want to open the phones up specifically for police officers and I
[35:28.660 --> 35:32.180]  won't make you hold a long time and a lot of you are on duty you're out there
[35:32.180 --> 35:36.620]  working or even recently retired police officers just to get your take on this
[35:36.620 --> 35:40.700]  if you agree or disagree with me now now listen to three points I'm gonna make
[35:40.700 --> 35:47.140]  this the same tactics used here using other countries I'm gonna tie three
[35:47.140 --> 35:51.660]  stories together you have jihad training camps set up since the 1980s
[35:51.660 --> 35:55.900]  allowing jihadis to train to go to Pakistan Afghanistan other areas in the
[35:55.900 --> 35:59.900]  US and they're on no fly list because other agencies put them on that they're
[35:59.900 --> 36:04.900]  allowed to fly in out of the country the the underwear bomber the latest
[36:04.900 --> 36:10.860]  attackers in Paris the attacker at Fort Hood was known and was allowed to operate
[36:10.860 --> 36:15.820]  all this has come out same story the head of the 7-7 bombings that's
[36:15.820 --> 36:21.220]  mainstream news that's not me even saying that this stuff comes out it's
[36:21.220 --> 36:25.740]  very simple equation let them build up let them create a threat let them attack
[36:25.740 --> 36:31.020]  with their useful idiot jihadis then basic Americans get our freedoms taken
[36:31.020 --> 36:36.140]  then the overarching militarization and federalization and globalization of
[36:36.140 --> 36:41.660]  police can expand but that's not enough to take over the country how did
[36:41.660 --> 36:46.980]  George Soros get five billion dollars the State Department money in 2013-2014
[36:46.980 --> 36:51.660]  and then go on Fareed Zakaria show we have a transcript in the video posted
[36:51.660 --> 36:58.740]  on info wars.com from May 27th of last year about seven months ago he came out
[36:58.740 --> 37:03.460]  and he said quote I am responsible for the operations and the overthrow of
[37:03.460 --> 37:10.940]  Ukraine they went in and financed with five billion dollars using real and
[37:10.940 --> 37:15.780]  perceived grievances and hyped grievances basically anti-police riots
[37:15.780 --> 37:20.300]  all over the country they then had their government take the government building
[37:20.300 --> 37:26.180]  unelected and then they put Joe Biden's son over the oil and other Democratic
[37:26.180 --> 37:32.180]  officials children literally children college graduates but children over the
[37:32.180 --> 37:35.860]  entire economy and began a war against Russia I'm not defending Russia saying
[37:35.860 --> 37:40.380]  they're perfect Lily White the West started it George Soros a Nazi collaborator
[37:40.380 --> 37:45.500]  demon who's brought down countless countries financing riots to devalue
[37:45.500 --> 37:49.340]  their currencies he's on record doing that he brags he's brought down more than
[37:49.340 --> 37:55.260]  seven nations looted their currencies he brought down Ireland he brought down
[37:55.260 --> 37:59.980]  England for a while he's brought down a whole bunch of third-world countries why
[37:59.980 --> 38:04.020]  would he finance and I'm not saying that the Ukrainian government was perfect
[38:04.020 --> 38:09.060]  but it was elected they take legitimate things on the surface that sound like a
[38:09.060 --> 38:12.220]  reason to get upset and then they use it to bring in even greater tyranny later
[38:12.220 --> 38:16.860]  and now Ukraine a year later is in total shambles so here he is Soros had
[38:16.860 --> 38:22.140]  missed responsibility for coup and mass murder in Ukraine he told George Soros
[38:22.140 --> 38:25.820]  for each Zarkaria over the weekend he's responsible for establishing a foundation
[38:25.820 --> 38:29.060]  Ukraine that ultimately contributed to the overthrow of the country's elected
[38:29.060 --> 38:33.940]  leader and the installation of a junta handpicked by the State Department it has
[38:33.940 --> 38:38.900]  the quote right here first on Ukraine one of the things that many people
[38:38.900 --> 38:44.340]  recognize about you was that you were during the revolutions of 1989 funded a
[38:44.340 --> 38:48.900]  lot of the scent of activities civil society groups in Eastern Europe that's
[38:48.900 --> 38:52.580]  not what Zarkaria sounds like it's what Soros sounds like Europe and Poland and
[38:52.580 --> 38:54.980]  the Czech Republic are you doing similar things in Ukraine
[38:54.980 --> 39:00.340]  Zarkaria soros well I will set up a foundation Ukraine before Ukraine became
[39:00.340 --> 39:03.380]  independent of Russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since
[39:03.380 --> 39:08.260]  implemented important part in the event now Soros responded and he went on okay
[39:08.260 --> 39:14.300]  well what's good for the goose is good for the gander what is he found and fund
[39:14.300 --> 39:18.220]  media matters he tells the White House what to do media matters is their mouth
[39:18.220 --> 39:23.060]  piece who do they attack Ron Paul Rand Paul Alex Jones Matt Drudge freedom of
[39:23.060 --> 39:28.940]  speech gun ownership state sovereignty and they call in their memos that have
[39:28.940 --> 39:35.340]  been made public by even Bloomberg and Politico four years ago to infiltrate
[39:35.340 --> 39:41.140]  media and bring it down I mean they try to get people in your operations folks
[39:41.140 --> 39:45.380]  and I'm not going to go into all of it but a lot of people have faced it I mean
[39:45.380 --> 39:53.820]  they don't play games okay they they are a spy intelligence operation of
[39:53.820 --> 39:58.740]  George Soros they're just one group this guy overthrows countries you understand
[39:58.740 --> 40:06.140]  that he used the white supremacists to take over Ukraine the deputy president
[40:06.140 --> 40:12.100]  they put in house Hitler on TV you can pull it up their symbol is blonde haired
[40:12.100 --> 40:15.900]  women shooting a lecture electricity bolts on Kimberly Palpatine out of
[40:15.900 --> 40:21.500]  their hands and he's howling Hitler you cannot make up stuff this weird but he's
[40:21.500 --> 40:24.540]  liberal so it's okay because he said he was liberal and gives money to everybody
[40:24.540 --> 40:30.780]  billions he's a mob boss and so you got George Soros running around doing all
[40:30.780 --> 40:38.460]  this he's trying to overthrow that enter this story that I covered yesterday from
[40:38.460 --> 40:41.700]  the Washington Times now again we'd already covered this I say that to say
[40:41.700 --> 40:45.380]  we can confirm this you can blow up in the videos or look at the names on the
[40:45.380 --> 40:49.060]  signs he doesn't hide it how like he went on 60 minutes and said yeah I was a
[40:49.060 --> 40:52.140]  Nazi collaborator rounded up you know all these people I'm not ashamed of it
[40:52.140 --> 40:57.180]  I survived I'm proud of myself basically he admits he's trying to undermine the
[40:57.180 --> 41:01.860]  US sovereignty he admits he wants your guns he admits he overthrew Ukraine he
[41:01.860 --> 41:09.100]  was the point man he tried it before George Soros funds Ferguson protests
[41:09.100 --> 41:17.220]  hopes to spur civil action so he uses some of the heavy-handed tactics the
[41:17.220 --> 41:20.540]  globalist training on the police the rest of it to then demonize police
[41:20.540 --> 41:26.340]  themselves to try to start a revolution in America pointed at the police that
[41:26.340 --> 41:30.740]  will drive the police into the fed's arms as their saviors break them and get
[41:30.740 --> 41:34.940]  them to accept the paramilitary takeover which is what he wants he doesn't want a
[41:34.940 --> 41:38.220]  revolution like he wanted Ukraine actually overthrows the government he
[41:38.220 --> 41:42.620]  wants to spur a destabilization to bring in a greater tyranny to give Obama a
[41:42.620 --> 41:47.140]  smokescreen to bring in martial law if it would have worked just like they
[41:47.140 --> 41:52.740]  tried to use Occupy Wall Street he funded to do this and folks this is heavy
[41:52.740 --> 41:57.900]  information I'm not giving you my opinion this is a fact
[41:58.340 --> 42:04.460]  $33 million I'm the guy that made four films on the police state wrote a book
[42:04.460 --> 42:07.660]  on it predicted all that was coming because I read the Rand Corporation
[42:07.660 --> 42:11.500]  documents and others and had sources but I wasn't against the police I was
[42:11.500 --> 42:15.540]  against them being taken over and being turned into basically North Korean style
[42:15.540 --> 42:20.260]  enforcers now to try to get him to do that they want to have a war against the
[42:20.260 --> 42:25.420]  police to then force them into that position it's like they start the war
[42:25.420 --> 42:28.540]  on terror against radical Muslims next you learn oh it's really for the Tea
[42:28.540 --> 42:37.540]  Party same deal this is the plan and so here he is 33 million of his billions
[42:37.540 --> 42:42.060]  he gives just to spur this and the Washington Times and investigative
[42:42.060 --> 42:48.980]  report and links through that he was involved in the Zimmerman organization
[42:48.980 --> 42:53.020]  the Soros Open Society Foundation that's the one that overthrew Ukraine is
[42:53.020 --> 42:58.340]  operating in America hey blacks your unemployment doubled how does how do we
[42:58.340 --> 43:03.220]  make sure Soros's puppet Obama doesn't get to blame cause a race war a soft
[43:03.220 --> 43:08.500]  race war of names make it all about the white truck driver who's going bankrupt
[43:08.500 --> 43:15.260]  he's the reason a black truck drivers going broke or a white teacher she's
[43:15.260 --> 43:20.740]  the reason a black teacher across town has trouble in school no or a cop a cop
[43:20.740 --> 43:26.780]  just randomly reject all your anger not the Federal Reserve not at the IRS not
[43:26.780 --> 43:29.620]  at the New World Order not at the Attorney General shipping guns in the
[43:29.620 --> 43:35.300]  Mexico to blame gun owners and false flag the 2nd Amendment blame cops and I
[43:35.300 --> 43:44.620]  told you he was behind it this guy is a literal demon and he's par for the
[43:44.620 --> 43:51.460]  course he's just one of the more arrogant outspoken people I know somebody
[43:51.460 --> 43:56.420]  that's been in the East Coast home I'll sleep at that of George Soros and the
[43:56.420 --> 44:03.260]  entire place is black mirrors and black paint and black floors do you know why
[44:03.260 --> 44:09.860]  people have their house like that do you know what black mirrors are used for
[44:13.620 --> 44:24.220]  that's as hardcore Satanism as you get black floors black walls black mirrors
[44:24.220 --> 44:32.660]  can you imagine where this guy's heart is this is who wants your guns this is
[44:32.660 --> 44:37.940]  who's taking over the public schools this is who literally runs CNN MSNBC in
[44:37.940 --> 44:42.140]  the White House you guys say one person he's the guy calling the shots more than
[44:42.140 --> 44:47.220]  Bershensky more than Kissinger he is the he is the guy on the ground getting it
[44:47.220 --> 44:54.340]  done the war general the Field Marshal the Erwin Rommel he is in the field folks
[44:54.340 --> 45:07.740]  he is coming and he's got his people just out there engaged in every dirty
[45:07.740 --> 45:10.580]  trick you can imagine and you know what I just expect that flying in over the
[45:10.580 --> 45:13.700]  enemy base I don't care it's fine I expect it if I didn't have these people
[45:13.700 --> 45:16.500]  jacking with me and messing with me and pulling all sorts of stuff that I'm
[45:16.500 --> 45:20.780]  even gonna get into that I wouldn't know that I was over the main target so I'm
[45:20.780 --> 45:24.620]  not complaining I expect it whatever happens happens I'm going 110% in I'm
[45:24.620 --> 45:28.300]  dropping my load on these people that's the end of it we're gonna fly in over
[45:28.300 --> 45:31.700]  the base we're gonna pull that lever we're gonna make sure those bombs go in
[45:31.700 --> 45:37.300]  in the info war but he knows we're winning the info war that's why he
[45:37.300 --> 45:41.900]  wants to finance false flags and I'll say at the Democratic Party three years
[45:41.900 --> 45:46.860]  ago their memos came out where they said we want to blame Glenn Beck Alex
[45:46.860 --> 45:50.260]  Jones people like that for the next terror attack you know give the
[45:50.260 --> 45:53.500]  Democrats money don't worry if it looks like we're unpopular we're gonna be
[45:53.500 --> 46:03.260]  popular after the next terror attack well folks there's no even veiled denial
[46:03.260 --> 46:10.420]  there they're telling you what they're up to and just get ready for it and so
[46:10.420 --> 46:14.020]  the police of this country need to understand something if you want to
[46:14.020 --> 46:18.300]  know who's financing radical Islamist in Egypt and Syria it's George Soros on

[46:49.380 --> 46:53.100]  universities and who learn how to manipulate member Gruber at all those
[46:53.100 --> 46:56.140]  university speeches teaching the professors how to lie and the graduate
[46:56.140 --> 47:06.820]  students and everyone laughing and smiling feeling included into the evil

[54:17.580 --> 54:21.900]  loading up but there's no current police officers calling in to give us
[54:21.900 --> 54:26.860]  their take is that because they're afraid of the NSA spying on them that
[54:26.860 --> 54:30.820]  will be passed on the police you don't have any free speech or is it because
[54:30.820 --> 54:34.940]  you're just busy again when I don't ask cops to call in a whole bunch call in
[54:34.940 --> 54:39.340]  sometimes when I ask they do call in that's active-duty military especially
[54:39.340 --> 54:48.180]  military police or police it's on record George Soros Open Society Foundation
[54:48.820 --> 54:54.340]  they're on record bragging that George Soros gave 33 million to try to stir up
[54:54.340 --> 54:58.620]  fighting here in the United States and to scapegoat the police don't you see
[54:58.620 --> 55:02.500]  he's trying to cause a revolution like he did in Ukraine what do you think about
[55:02.500 --> 55:13.500]  this do you disagree with me maybe you love George Soros 800-259-9231 I want
[55:13.500 --> 55:17.100]  to go to this report by Jacarie Jackson this is from CNN if you think we're
[55:17.100 --> 55:22.780]  joking can goods stop school shooters that's right don't have teachers that
[55:22.780 --> 55:27.740]  are armed don't have pilots that are armed just learn to urinate on someone
[55:27.740 --> 55:33.700]  or throw a can of peas at them this is the joke level ladies and gentlemen that
[55:33.700 --> 55:36.180]  they want us to live but the very bureaucrats that are against us being
[55:36.180 --> 55:39.860]  armed they're the ones living behind armored fortresses with armed guards at
[55:39.860 --> 55:44.060]  taxpayer expense like Pierce Morgan who has armed bodyguards let's go to that
[55:44.060 --> 55:48.900]  report this is Jacarie Jackson for info wars.com now something that's very
[55:48.900 --> 55:51.860]  important to us in this country is the safety of our school children
[55:51.860 --> 55:56.140]  understandably so but we can't all agree on how best to protect them and now we
[55:56.140 --> 55:59.820]  have this article Alabama middle school principal tells kids to bring canned
[55:59.820 --> 56:03.740]  goods to class and throw them at possible gunmen here's a note that a
[56:03.740 --> 56:08.420]  parent received from the school and this is W.F. Burns middle school and we'll
[56:08.420 --> 56:32.420]  show you a little bit of this train it's called the Alice training program
[56:32.420 --> 56:38.420]  wait a minute that's not supposed to go you said they should keep moving and throw things
[56:38.420 --> 56:42.620]  behind you either of those things no they followed their natural instinct to hide
[56:42.620 --> 56:50.380]  and what did that make them sitting duck right and sitting ducks makes easy
[56:50.380 --> 57:11.740]  targets and we don't want anything easy for the intruder. Can we try again? Absolutely, yay!
[57:11.740 --> 57:23.340]  It's all about terrorizing kids for a threat that's incredibly rare. Actually I like to say this is this
[57:23.340 --> 57:28.180]  particular program they don't do this at every school but this school is participating in this
[57:28.180 --> 57:32.220]  program and while I do applaud them for not being sitting ducks and actively
[57:32.220 --> 57:35.980]  trying to defend themselves I think a much better strategy would be to simply
[57:35.980 --> 57:40.380]  arm the teachers you have the principal you have the janitor maybe there's a
[57:40.380 --> 57:46.500]  locked cabinet a gun case someplace where a teacher has a access key or in
[57:46.500 --> 57:52.140]  some places like Harold ISD in Texas they have their teachers carry concealed
[57:52.140 --> 57:57.860]  weapons. Every one of the plans in the United States and schools emergency
[57:57.860 --> 58:03.540]  plans are to lock the doors and hide the kids well that was disturbing to us
[58:03.540 --> 58:08.740]  because we're 30 minutes from law enforcement we had no way to protect
[58:08.740 --> 58:12.180]  ourselves and there was anybody around to take care of us we were our first
[58:12.180 --> 58:16.660]  responders right I came up with a plan and the plan you know it's been on the
[58:16.660 --> 58:21.300]  news a lot it's pretty self-explanatory. We're gonna go to Moray. Jakari's full
[58:21.300 --> 58:26.740]  report is at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com yeah at least the Alabama
[58:26.740 --> 58:30.300]  school is training them to fight back which the feds say lay down but it
[58:30.300 --> 58:35.020]  shouldn't be canned foods folks it should be firearms it should be firearms but
[58:35.020 --> 58:39.180]  overall school shooting training is just a terrorized kids about a threat that is
[58:39.180 --> 58:43.380]  I mean you got like what six seven eight times better chance of a honeybee

[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:16.020]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:24.620]  network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones dale is a police officer in
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:29.860]  Illinois and I'd like to open the phones up to active duty military corrections
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:38.580]  officers police officers you name it because George Soros is now on record
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.620]  I mean we knew it was Soros funded groups that I saw marching around chanting
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:48.020]  for violence against police and being left alone and under federal orders they
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.580]  had the police attacking the press instead just everything they can to
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.220]  demonize the police I mean this is a setup admitting that they basically want
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.260]  to start a civil rights movement against the police in this country so the feds
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:04.020]  can come in as the good guys and fully federalize them when it's federal
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:08.700]  training that's caused the police a lot of their problems this is so clear what's
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:15.780]  happening I want to hear from police active-duty military do you disagree
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.100]  with me they're trying to start a civil war I mean it's pretty much admitted
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:27.260]  800 259 92 31 Dale is your police officer in Illinois what's your view on
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:33.540]  all this well start with I'm not afraid of the New World Order of the NSA ABC or
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:39.300]  EMG any of them I'm not afraid of the problem we have is that there's so many
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:43.860]  people out there that have never walked a mile in my shoes and those are police
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:48.980]  work is actually about I've seen so many people in the last oh god I don't know
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:53.660]  several months say that we're doing everything wrong we're not doing right
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:02:00.180]  we're not doing it Ferguson for instance the we may argue about this quote on
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.660]  quote chokehold on this guy in New York far as I was concerned with cops did
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:10.860]  exactly what they had to do the guy way over 300 pounds and that wasn't so can
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:16.460]  what the only place you could grab that guy to get anything around him is around
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.060]  his throat because it's only about 18 to 20 inches the rest of his body was
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:25.820]  probably over 40 inches well sure but I mean we all argue about these cases the
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.300]  point is George Soros is trying to cause a revolution and trying to escape
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.820]  got the police to start it do you agree with that statement or what do you think
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:46.220]  about George Soros is the question I agree I think George Soros is trying to
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.820]  start something but it isn't what it's causing the people to want to rebel
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:55.900]  against the police we've had more incidents in Illinois in the last couple
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:00.620]  weeks where we make a traffic stop and the 1890 turn-year-old kids want to
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:05.140]  fight with us because they think they've got a right to well this is being this
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:09.580]  is being paid for by Soros we know that oh it is and and the White House
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:15.500]  controlled media is hyping it to cause a civil war I mean the police need to
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.380]  start speaking out against this because we're barely stopping this breaking out
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:25.980]  right now we have been but the media unfortunately is so small you George
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:32.860]  Norrie maybe sometimes on Fox News will stand up for us and behind us you've got
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.740]  five or six other media they're just the opposite and people are so damn stupid
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.500]  I'm sorry to have to say it that way they've got no clue what is going on in
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:47.620]  the real world they got none and then they complain that this is going on and
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:51.180]  it's not the cops are going to start the Civil War it's the people that are
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.500]  going to start the Civil War get the police officers believe you're not
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.900]  going to get I'll tell you from my heart I've been a cop for almost 30 years from
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.280]  my heart the last thing I'm going to do is run to the federal government for
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.260]  help I know for a fact there are people that know me only personally know
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:13.780]  exactly how I stand I will do everything in my power if let's just say for instance
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.220]  they say you're going to take the guns away from everybody on this street I
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.940]  will do everything my powers not as a standard away but let the people on that
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:25.780]  street know the work they're coming well I'll tell you what Dale I don't know if
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.140]  you're on duty right now but if you can I got to go to break will you come back
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.620]  and recap your thoughts on Soros and I'll give you the floor for a couple
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:36.500]  minutes can you do that Alex I wish I would I mean a brush right now my
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.860]  mother-in-law just fall for an ambulance no I understand you gotta go I know how
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.420]  it is I hear you you got to work thank you thank you Dale great points I want
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.540]  you to be able to finish your points we're gonna come back with Jeff Steve
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:50.980]  and others straight ahead and talk about this this is a big deal folks I mean
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.740]  George Soros just thinks he's gonna start a civil war using the police as
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:05:00.860]  the detonator and we got to stop him every year we make resolutions to lose
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.620]  weight and get in shape and the truth is it's hard even with diet and exercise
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:09.540]  because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.180]  ever before working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry I found that
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.500]  super high-quality nutraceuticals in addition to my diet and exercise were
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.900]  the answers synergistically worked I can see the drastic changes every day with
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.540]  the amount of weight I've lost my increased stamina and more of a twinkle
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.260]  in my eye that's why we are now so excited to launch the infowars life

[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.060]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.900]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:23.060]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.860]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.220]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.900]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.300]  start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.140]  cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:47.100]  cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA the new infowarslife lung cleanse is
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.420]  here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.700]  toxic environment now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:05.300]  calling toll-free 888-253-3139 he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:30.300]  GCN radio network
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:35.340]  all right we just talked to a police officer in Illinois and he said 100% he agrees
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.020]  well I mean it's in the Washington Times George Soros admits that he spent
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:45.180]  $33 million trying to create a new civil rights movement around having
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:53.980]  citizens clash with the police and let's be clear we're the biggest critics of the
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.780]  cops in Albuquerque that shoot the unarmed homeless guy and then celebrate
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:04.100]  it they both been indicted by the way we're huge critics of federalization
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.940]  globalization of no-knock warrants being expanded the general public to the
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:14.740]  overall drug war all again I'm the guy that made four films about this I'm the
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.900]  guy that made you know a wrote a book about it about the federalization about
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:24.460]  the training about how they would make them political police and environmental
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:31.660]  enforcer police and how they would turn zoning people into cops that I'm all
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:37.780]  fighting I'm not fighting the individual because they want to create this system
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:43.940]  have us clash with it to then force the police into an even more militarized
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.660]  position and to go under federalization so they don't get shut down or arrested
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.220]  or sued by the feds so the fed send out the Soros money have the controlled
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.380]  media under Obama blame the police in general come out and attack them make
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:04.260]  statements the president mayors you name it put it out there projected onto the
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:10.460]  average cop when I've said it I mean I've experienced it the average cop knows
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:15.860]  about the new world order knows about globalism knows about the federalization
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:20.820]  knows gun control is about victim disarmament and is more awake than the
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.340]  general public so they're the enemy local governments the enemy the globalists
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:31.860]  don't want that so they want to cause civil unrest to the point of civil war
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:38.740]  just like George Soros Braggs he did last year on CNN he told Farid Zarkaria I
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:46.980]  read the quote last hour that he was behind with his open society foundation
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.180]  doing it the Washington time went to the numbers the open society foundation
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:56.100]  last year in the Trayvon Martin case before that and now last year 33 million
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:00.420]  to stir it up we caught the Justice Department secretly trying to stir up
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:06.700]  riots in Florida does that mean Zimmerman's a great guy does it mean he's
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:14.380]  perfect no does it mean it's tragic yes it is but it doesn't matter the worst
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:19.980]  guy probably in the world when it comes to evil George Soros that we know of the
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:24.940]  most active demon is involved because if they can get blacks and whites fighting
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:28.380]  if they could scapegoat the lowest level of the government the police it will
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.340]  cause total destabilization loss of confidence and then they can bring in
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.780]  their greater control just like the communists did in every other country
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:40.540]  just like a totalitarian's of the other nations this is a tried and true plan so
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:45.380]  if George Soros wants open borders we don't want open borders he wants to take
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.220]  our guns we don't want to give our guns up if he wants to restrict freedom of
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.980]  religion in this country we're not for it if he wants to overthrow Ukraine we're
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:58.660]  not for it he's a bad guy he wants derivatives he wants banker bailouts
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:03.780]  everything he does is bad but marijuana legalization which is decriminalization
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:08.500]  which I would support and I do support except for he basically runs the
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.820]  movement and is going to use it as a political movement into the future he
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:16.780]  wants to control it and he wants to bring Monsanto in to genetically modify it
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.060]  and then he will control the activist groups so they don't oppose it that's
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:26.500]  the inside baseball from the highest levels of organizations like normal that
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:33.580]  George Soros is financing and they've now weaponized marijuana so strong they're
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:38.620]  going to come out with strains that basically turn your kids into zombies so
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:44.140]  there's always a dark side to any libertarian movement I support it because
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.860]  I support the basic idea of individual liberty but I will also support the right
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.780]  to criticize weaponized marijuana and warn people because you can go by Drano
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:56.780]  and you know kill yourself with it they don't have it you know illegal send
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:01.460]  them a marijuana being weaponized it's got a lot of promising attributes to it
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:05.340]  it's got a lot of bad ones as well we should look at full spectrum analysis I
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:11.300]  want to go to Mark in Washington who's an active detective Stephen Alabama is
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:16.900]  of course a correctional officer Jeff in Utah has been a police officer up to one
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.020]  year ago and we've got a few open lines for police specifically for police or
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.460]  activity military because you're the people that are going to be the front
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.900]  line if George Soros can start a civil war in this country like he did in
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:35.460]  Ukraine and who did they fire bomb and shoot in Ukraine the police what did his
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:40.180]  open foundations group run TV ads for and promote the media they had five
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:45.180]  billion dollars worth showing cops brutalizing people to then overthrow the
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:49.980]  government and put an unelected government in charge and now Ukraine is
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.460]  in deep economic trouble being looted and George Soros just said he wants 50
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.820]  billion dollars of US taxpayer money to help Ukraine he'll manage it and give
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:04.860]  it to his sons and people that was in the news last week that's what he does
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:09.300]  and he'll want to manage and have a reconciliation if civil war breaks out
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:13.460]  later and don't you worry we can all be politically correct and do what he says
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.540]  and the cops can go under globalist control and prove they're not bad Mark
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:21.940]  in Washington who's a current detective do you disagree with what I've laid out
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:26.620]  here how clear is it what do you want to say to Soros what's your view on this
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.620]  now I agree with you at the key is it's got to educate the public I mean it's
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:35.740]  going to be tougher for the the coppers in the bigger cities because you have
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:41.860]  a larger population but I for instance in the area that I work in it's a smaller
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.660]  community smaller County it's just one-on-one relationships with people and
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.940]  they get to know you and they see how you act you treat them like you want to be
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:55.220]  treated I'm not really worried about our area too much but I think the people
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:00.620]  are smart enough to figure out when when they're being bamboozled I mean Soros
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.940]  has an agenda he's a dirtbag he turned his own people in World War II so I mean
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:12.580]  guys a demon but he'll get his in the end he really is a demon he is yeah but
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:16.980]  as far you know I talked to a buddy of mine who's a canine handler L.A. County
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:21.540]  Sheriff's Office my talk to him a couple weeks ago and I asked him what the
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:25.660]  sentiment was a down in his area and he's not seeing too many problems with
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.420]  anti-police I mean you're always going to have a group that doesn't like police
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.540]  it's I mean it's just it's normal behavior people don't like to be told
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:37.580]  what to do or they don't they don't like to be confronted when they're when
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:44.620]  they make mistakes but I think it's just personally I think what what hurts us is
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:50.820]  that the media keeps putting the you know the guy that make mistakes over and
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.460]  over again on the well sure and that's part of the agenda not to reform
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:00.820]  problems but to hype us up into a war I'm just saying it's a bold move do
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:06.180]  police realize that if Soros is successful this is gonna get a lot of
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:10.940]  people killed I mean this is their big move is to start this civil war and
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:16.060]  these guys tend to succeed I mean I just hope folks realize we are two minutes
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:22.740]  to midnight here I mean this is getting really serious well let me put it this
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:27.220]  way it's gonna be bad if it happens it's gonna be bad in some areas it's gonna
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:31.980]  be really bad in the urban areas oh yeah rural areas where I'm at I'm not too
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:38.980]  worried about it I'm I just unless the P I mean unless you know please go
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:43.180]  astray and just start you know violating people's rights in every city and that
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.860]  becomes an epidemic then maybe that'll change oh I agree with you it's gonna be
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.780]  an urban pockets controlled by Democrats I mean that's where it's gonna be but
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:54.940]  it's it's going to get they want to create a destabilization as an excuse
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.260]  for the feds to roll out troops and the Justice Department will act like they're
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:02.420]  against it all when they're behind it just like fast and furious I'm just
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:07.700]  trying to get a major debate going within the Peace Officer Association so
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:14.060]  that they realize the larger agenda and program this is the key out it's one on
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:18.340]  one coppers talking to each other I mean I talked to all the guys I work with
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.820]  and we are on the same page you know we have caught we have one-on-one
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.780]  conversations I got one guy work with it's also infantrymen in the National
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.860]  Guard and he's told me that you know all his guys including his commander of all
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:36.220]  made a pact that they're not going to a by Lake Cossie Palantata and they're not
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:38.580]  going to be taking guns from people and they're not going to go against the
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:43.340]  American people and I think they may tell their their higher-ups yeah we'll do
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.620]  whatever you tell us but when the poop hits the fan I think they're gonna be on
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:51.140]  America oh they will be at least in general when the rubber meets the road
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.660]  if the globalists are bold enough to do this they're gonna end up losing
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:58.740]  everything when they make this move but it's going to be messy I hope they're
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.500]  smart enough to back off God bless you sir be safe out there and I want to be
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:07.980]  clear federalization federal grants the erosion of the Constitution the courts
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:14.980]  and the people allowing administrative law to turn us into a police state now
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.060]  have police in some areas carrying out tactics and activities that are tyrannical
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:27.100]  and so it is causing legitimate concern and an angst for the police but
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:35.420]  separating that out the system is going to use that exacerbated exaggerated to
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:42.420]  detonate a bigger crisis and that's the bottom line and and I'm here trying to
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:51.300]  stop the new order agenda that's why I'm a hundred percent trying to hammer this
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:55.620]  subject because I'm telling you folks you know how much I've been predicted I
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:59.220]  know how the enemy operates plus they tell us what they're gonna do Soros
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:05.220]  didn't spend $33 million on Ferguson stuff because he didn't think he didn't
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:10.540]  have a shot then they sent in Democratic operatives in New York Chicago
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:19.140]  Missouri St. Louis all over saying kill cops kill cops kill cops and the feds
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.980]  were there and told the cops to stand down now that tells you something right
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:28.980]  there the the system is getting bold and if cops start getting killed and start
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:33.420]  getting paranoid start shooting innocent people and there's some kin state type
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:38.220]  events with the cops mode out a bunch of protesters see they want to be for
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.420]  vendetta type event you know where the cop kills a little girl and then they
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.340]  start overthrowing the government there's been cases like that in Romania
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:48.580]  other places that really happened similar events catalyst they want to create
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:53.340]  fake catalyst to get this going because they're not winning politically we're
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:58.380]  gonna come back with Jeff Steve Peter and others stay with us

[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:31.820]  ahead oh hey um yeah basically just want to climb saying that a lot of my
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:36.580]  civilian friends do away so it's hard to ask me repeatedly what if you know what's
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:42.020]  going on why don't you get out and other than you know I'm an instrument you
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:47.820]  know should move communicate it doesn't really translate a lot to civilian jobs
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:53.180]  but other than been holding down a job for myself and my family some good guys
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.980]  have to stay in so regardless of what happens I'm going to be one of the
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.580]  good guys in the system oh I totally agree I totally agree with what you're
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:06.860]  doing what do you think about Soros being so bold openly financing an
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:12.540]  anti-police agenda oh well I mean come on obviously that's gonna happen from a
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:20.060]  Nazi collaborator so um my only issue with that is
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:26.340]  basically I see I don't understand how the system really takes it's gonna
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:30.500]  succeed they've done the polling they know what's going on they know how much
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.980]  of especially the military I don't know what the percentage is of the police
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:39.300]  especially the military who was a week so when the rubber meets the road
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:43.540]  that's obviously after post Katrina when everybody really realized what's going
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:51.660]  on is I honestly I describe it to my friends with each Germany you know what
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:55.980]  when the wall fell and the Italian commander was like no you guys are
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:01.900]  staying on post lockdown no one's going anywhere so these guys get the issue
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:05.500]  all the orders they want but they know how many of us when the rubber meets the
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:09.660]  road well that's right I mean look at how Waco just credited the system look
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:15.340]  how Katrina taking the guns blew up if they start a real civil war that's why
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.620]  they want to make it racial if they can make it black against cop they think
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:24.620]  maybe maybe somehow then they can contain it it's just it's so it's crazy
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.780]  God bless you I appreciate your call let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Utah
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:36.260]  former police what's your view on Soros it's just so bold I agree I think we're
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:45.540]  1159 here Alex what's your view on all this well I was a police officer for
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:50.620]  quite a while and I ended up getting in trouble because I didn't take a gun away
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:57.020]  from a kid that had shot himself and I returned it back to his parents it's a
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:02.980]  bad deal and I ended up getting pushed out and I think the moral the thing that
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.740]  happened is the moral basis of the country has to change and we're not
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.820]  having that no no one's teaching their kids to behave or respect or or anything
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:18.100]  like that so that's it I mean the society's degenerating into a thug gang
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:22.060]  culture and so you're gonna see that manifest in the police as well because
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:25.700]  that's what it's pulled from and look at the military's got huge gangs taking it
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:29.300]  over it's just we are degenerating I mean that's what it is and that's what
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.820]  I'm saying blaming the police isn't gonna do anything we need to reform the whole
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:38.020]  system going in and actually taking government over just like this state
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.260]  rep that's coming on did something incredible that could change this
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.980]  country's course in ways I can't even describe God bless you good to hear from
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:50.900]  you Steven Alabama go ahead a question sir been correct officer I guess for
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:55.220]  about three years and I finally gave it up about a year ago I think what you
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:01.060]  said on this Joker is if you look back at everything that Hitler did to get into
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:04.740]  power you look at what he's doing I mean it's pretty much you know note for note
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:10.580]  to me like I said and as a correctional officer I mean I was told you could look
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:15.460]  at them but don't touch if they were doing something wrong you know just let
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:20.620]  them do it because I mean they don't want to touch in any I guess just like
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:25.420]  prisoner at all if you did you got either rode up or you know you had to fill
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.740]  out so much paperwork it just wasn't worth it and then they would tell you
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.460]  that if it was a hostage situation there's no negotiations so you're in
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:37.860]  there with 3045 people in one room you're the only one goes through there
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:43.420]  and they could take you at any time and I just don't understand that but for
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:47.460]  those that don't know medium and upper security prisons pretty much are run by
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:53.500]  the inmates according to racial gangs correct correct I mean they could sit
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:58.620]  there and you know pretty much cash you out spit in your face do whatever they
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:01.580]  wanted to and if you laid your hands on them you know it was either end of your
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:06.060]  career or you know they put you in solitary where you couldn't touch
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.740]  anybody well see that's the thing society is degenerating and so the police
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:15.460]  are gonna get more brutal as a society does and it's all unraveling you can
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:21.420]  just see it happening right and plus we had a man that ran for office
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:27.220]  appearing actually in Georgia and I just heard on the radio today that he
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.180]  didn't he didn't win office but he's actually in jail right now for stealing
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:37.260]  money from our profit organizations so no it's just it's it's the it's the
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:41.300]  immorality is our main problem and then we have people like George Soros running
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:45.900]  around I mean the guy should be in jail as a Nazi collaborator instead he's
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:50.700]  trying to shut down my operation we're on the marsh sick of it the empires on

[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.220]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:50.300]  We've got some really positive news that if it gets picked up in other states, could create
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:56.380]  the biggest boom this country has ever seen and could put the federal government itself
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:03.100]  run by foreign interest and the private Federal Reserve back in its proper role.
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.180]  We've got some other very positive news as well.
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:10.420]  We're going to be talking to the head of American Lands Council, AmericanLandsCouncil.org, Ken
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:16.540]  Ivory, who was instrumental in coming up with the bill and passing it to take back the land
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:17.860]  in Utah.
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:18.860]  This is huge.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.180]  We're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.580]  Waging up with police.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:26.260]  I've been arrested for peacefully demonstrating in Austin and in New York.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.420]  I've had a jail guard ram my head in the wall for no reason.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:34.580]  I have had run into some really bad pug police in my days.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.380]  We're against the system hiring these type of people and protecting them.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:43.100]  The point is, George Soros wants to cause a civil war with police as the pretext, as
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.900]  the scapegoat, because they're the most visible group, and when you see mainstream media just
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.780]  demonizing police at every front, local police, and George Soros giving 33 million to hype
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:59.020]  it up, we just shouldn't have a civil war and go out and hate police and then have
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:03.020]  folks go out and randomly shoot cops in the head just because the media hypes it up and
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.620]  acts like they're the problem.
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:09.500]  The problem is we've become immoral, we've become lazy, we've forgotten that freedom
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:12.900]  isn't free, we've forgotten to promote the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we've let
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:18.180]  special interests and crony capitalists come in and take over and use socialist tactics
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:22.460]  to buy the public off and maneuver us towards bankruptcy.
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.540]  Well, this bankruptcy is a fraud.
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:26.420]  We don't owe the derivatives.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:31.340]  We have the land, we have the energy, we have the ideas to be fabulously wealthy and we
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.640]  will be.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.180]  We don't need to pay 95% of our money like the French do or more in taxes.

[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:27.460]  These are true nutraceuticals, infowarslife.com.
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:33.260]  Now this story, you're about to hear, I feel like we should have a drum roll or something
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:38.420]  because the states are supposed to share power with the federal government 50-50.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:39.740]  That's the federalist view.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.740]  The anti-federalists wanted even more states power, that's why senators were popularly
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:49.780]  elected only since 1917, well 1913 they passed it but the first time it started happening
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.100]  was 1917 with the 17th Amendment.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:59.940]  And if you expand out on that, we now have a federal imperial government itself run by
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:05.700]  foreign special interest and the UN, UNESCO, others claim most of the federal lands in
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:10.220]  this country as collateral on the national debt, look that up, just like third world
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:14.940]  countries have to give their public lands over to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:20.300]  That's why Rockefeller created the national parks, now national parks are great but there
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:25.340]  are only a few percentage points of the overall federal lands where they're closing roads,
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:31.420]  harassing people on four-wheelers, kicking campers out and saying we don't want humans
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:33.700]  here period.
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:37.820]  That's part of training you that that land isn't yours so they can give it to the Chinese
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:44.620]  government like they've given hundreds of thousands of acres in places like Nevada
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:53.500]  that's 89% federal, places like Utah are over 65% federal, roughly half the country
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:57.700]  is under federal control ladies and gentlemen, now the feds are in states like Texas trying
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:01.980]  to claim all the land on both sides of the Colorado or the Red River, we're talking
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:07.320]  about trillions here over time, Bill Clinton used these rules to shut down the only clean
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:16.220]  burning coal in this hemisphere in Utah, then overnight it doubled the stock that he was
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:20.460]  invested in in China, the only other clean burning coal in the world after they put
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:26.980]  the regulations in on us to use the coal, so that's what's going on here, that's what's
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:34.420]  unfolding and that's why this is such a big deal, Utah transfer of public lands from the
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:39.700]  encyclopedia, the state of Utah passed legislation in 012, the Utah transfer of public lands
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:44.060]  act to require the federal government to grant the majority of federal land of the state
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:48.820]  back to the state of Utah for 2014, well 2015 is here, the state has pointed out that federal
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:55.500]  government controls more than 50% of the land west of Kansas, in Utah's case 64.5%, I think
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.500]  it's more than that if you count some of the other stuff, a situation that has increasingly
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:05.500]  resulted in tensions across the Rocky Mountain West, they've got 89% of states like Nevada
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:12.580]  and that's not enough, so joining us is Ken Ivory, Utah House Representatives and President
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:20.460]  of the American Lands Council, he's a district 47, was elected to the Utah House Representatives
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:26.380]  in November of 2010 and he has developed and secured passage of legislation that these
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:30.780]  efforts include the transfer of public lands act and the passage of bills backed by the
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:36.580]  Utah Association of CPAs to begin reducing state dependence on federal funds they call
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:42.100]  financial ready Utah, he's the president of the American Lands Council, Ken dedicates
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:46.740]  his time to educating legislators and community leaders throughout the states about the jurisdictional
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:52.060]  rights and duties to manage, protect and care for the lands within our borders, now again
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:57.500]  I'm not going to go any further, but he's the author of Where's the Line, How States
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:02.380]  Protect the Constitution, this is the kind of guy we need in Congress, the type of person
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:09.340]  we need in the Senate, the type of person we need as the federal land commissioner,
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:14.580]  the type of person we need over the different federal bureaus, not a bunch of globalist
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:19.340]  with special interests that want to be robber barons, the robber barons funded in the last
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:24.660]  hundred years taking over state governments so that people out west didn't know the land
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:29.420]  was theirs and they'll say oh they're going to build factories and make it all ugly,
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:34.660]  no they're not, no it's like 98% empty out there, the globalists are the ones coming
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:38.500]  in that take the land and turn it over to selective groups, they don't want us having
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:43.820]  access to it, this guy's a hero, he got it passed, now it's starting to be implemented
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:49.380]  and if they can do this and block the out-of-control feds, there aren't even feds, the federal
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:54.700]  argument's over because it's been taken over by UNESCO, it's under UN Treaty, Gen 21 on
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:42:00.660]  record that we can't develop this country, it's a fraud, it's an economic embargo, it's
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:05.180]  like setting off our power plants and if he can get this deployed to other states this
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:10.060]  could cause an economic boom the likes of which we've never seen, this is so exciting,
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:15.180]  I mean they're even trying to stop ski resorts being put in out west now, saying it's bad
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:19.180]  for the earth, it's a load of bull, humans tend to make the environment better when they
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:24.180]  actually live in the area, so joining us I know I'm ranting is this state rep, I know
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:29.100]  that's a big intro but I wanted to fill the listeners in on why this is such a big deal,
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:34.140]  here's the headline Utah Demands Fed Surrender Lands by December 31st, that's New American
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:40.220]  Magazine that came and passed, so exciting sir, give us a presentation on what's happening.
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:44.380]  Well thanks Alex, it is a big time, it's a wonderful time to be alive as Ronald Reagan
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:50.060]  said, I was just down in Austin last week doing a training for new legislators in Texas,
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:55.380]  this is an issue that transcends the west because beyond Colorado, states and the east
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:43:00.500]  are spending billions of dollars a year to pay the federal government to manage the forest
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:05.500]  in a way that burns six million acres a year, kills millions of animals, destroys that resource,
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:08.740]  pollutes the air, destroys the watershed for generations.
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:13.500]  You all east of Colorado and across the nation spending billions of dollars a year to lock
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:19.420]  up what the government accountability office said is more recoverable oil in Utah, Colorado,
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.460]  Wyoming than the rest of the world combined.
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:25.140]  Now another important thing, we were invited to come and give a presentation to the Reagan
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:28.580]  Library a couple months ago on national security.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:34.380]  Our national security cannot operate our electronics technology, renewable energy technology, cannot
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:40.100]  operate without rare earth minerals and right now 95% of the rare earth minerals for those
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:45.220]  industries to function come from China, the price is going exponential and we've got rare
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:49.660]  earth minerals locked up all over the western lands under federal control.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.660]  Now here's the critical thing Alex, here's how simple this is.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.300]  You get right back to the fundamental principles, right?
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:01.860]  Just exist to secure these rights, life, liberty, property and self-government.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.620]  That's why a government exists.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:09.780]  Well without the right and control of property we don't have liberty and so here's the situation.
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:14.460]  You've got the federal government controls more than 50% of the land east west of Kansas
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:17.900]  but the statehood promises called enabling acts.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.580]  The statehood promises are the same.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.940]  In many cases they're word for word the same.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:27.580]  In some cases Montana and North Dakota for example it's the same document and yet on
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:31.660]  one hand the federal government transfers the land and on the other they don't.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:37.660]  Now promises are the same what most people don't realize is that at one point Illinois,
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:42.860]  Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and of course Alex you know that great western
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:49.860]  state way over there of Florida they were as much as 90% federally controlled for decades
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:54.260]  and they were sending resolutions to Congress and hey we can't educate our kids.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.700]  We can't grow our economy.
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:59.300]  Our people are leaving our state because you're controlling all our land.
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.180]  They've banded together, they compelled Congress to transfer their land, honor their statehood
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:05.740]  agreement and we're simply doing the same thing today.
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.940]  We expect Congress to honor the very same statehood terms that they kept with all states east
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:15.460]  of Colorado because it is the only solution big enough to get to better access, better
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:17.380]  health, better productivity.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:22.260]  So what people can do they go to that American Lands Council website AmericanLandsCouncil.org
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:27.740]  number one you can sign the petition and get in the game, log in at the website, get in
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:28.740]  the game.
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:34.020]  We're leading the nation in restoring the rights of property, liberty and self-governance
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:36.620]  which restores our balance as you were talking about.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:39.700]  The other thing you do is simply tell someone.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:44.500]  Tell somebody else about this show them that map get them in the game and critically tell
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.500]  your leaders.
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.380]  Don't assume they know, don't assume they understand.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:53.260]  Tell them and tell them persistently and as Thomas Hart Benton, he was the Democratic
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:58.660]  Senator from Missouri who rallied all those western states in the 1850s.
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:03.220]  He said, you got to get your members of Congress to fix their eyes steadily upon the period
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:07.300]  of the speedy distinction of the federal title to all the lands within their boundaries.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:08.300]  And they did it Alex.
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:13.740]  Illinois is not 96% federally controlled, Missouri is not 90% federally controlled, Louisiana
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:18.180]  is not 90% federally controlled and they have the exact same statehood terms that these
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.260]  western states do today.
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:23.820]  So that's in a nutshell, that's where we're at happy to go wherever you'd like and answer
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.820]  any questions.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.820]  This is a big subject.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:29.460]  There's a lot of information on that website AmericanLandsCouncil.org.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:34.100]  You can get to the Facebook page as well, we push the information out every day.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:39.780]  But this is the single solution big enough to restore balance in our nation and get us
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:44.900]  back to liberty, property, self-governance, where we have better access, better health,
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.860]  better productivity on our lands.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:47.860]  Absolutely.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:53.820]  Ken Ivory, he is the president and head and founder of AmericanLandsCouncil.org.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:47:01.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason products cost so much, the reason that our economy is stalling
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:06.340]  is we're not being given access to the rare earth minerals, to coal, you name it.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:13.340]  What China is, there in Australia, there in Africa, there in Latin America, they're exploring
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:19.240]  and American companies aren't doing it because the regulations and the feds are trying to
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.740]  get more land out west.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:25.420]  I mean, take the Bundy Rant situation, there were 34 families, now there's one.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:29.940]  We can't even produce beef in America because of regulations.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:35.900]  More and more farmers are giving up because special interest from my research, what prohibitive
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:42.580]  costs there that they're able to be exempt from so that they don't have any competition
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:45.380]  and if we're able to free up, what are some of the numbers?
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.100]  I know they're on the land council website.
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:53.060]  I mean, am I exaggerating to say that if we start freeing up even 10, 20, 30% of western
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:59.180]  land and some of the federal land in the east, that this would just make the 10% growth rates
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:02.100]  that we had until the 1920s look small?
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:06.460]  Yeah, give me an example, you can see this map right here over my shoulder.
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:12.700]  The Institute for Energy Research early last year said there's more than $150 trillion
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:15.760]  in mineral value locked up in the federally controlled lands.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.140]  At the same time, under failed federal policies that tie the hands of these good workers on
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:25.580]  the ground that would like to care for the land, we're burning 6 million acres of forest
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:30.980]  in Alex, 6 million acres a year, that's polluting the air, it's destroying the watershed, it's
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:36.980]  killing millions of animals, instead of sequestering that carbon into homes and viable products
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:41.420]  where that wood then stores that carbon for an indefinite period.
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:47.220]  But the federal policies that are supposedly environmental policies, destroying the air,
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:52.620]  destroying the water, destroying the animals, destroying the habitat for generations, no,
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:56.660]  we've got all the tools, we've got all the tools, we simply have to get back to the very
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:02.380]  simple constitutional remedy of liberty, right, and control of property, and self-governance.
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:08.620]  Let me tell you a story, Alex, what's happening right now, Canada, our neighbor to the north,
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:14.180]  over the last decade, Canada has been transferring land, water, and resources to the provinces,
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:18.540]  and then just last year, they completed the transfer of land, water, and resources to
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:22.380]  the Northwest Territories, and here's what they said they discovered.
[01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:26.780]  They said, we discovered that when we let people closest to the matter, closest to the
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:33.260]  land, water, and resources make the decisions, we learned that you get a better decision.
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:35.540]  That's not rocket science, that's not rocket science.
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.940]  Yeah, that's not rocket science, and so in the land of liberty, we're going the other
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:39.940]  way.
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:44.300]  We've got a federal government that's centralizing control over more and more aspects of every
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:48.980]  aspect of our daily life, and so Alex, what we've really got to do is in the States, we've
[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:55.540]  got to help our federal governing partner focus very specifically, focus on doing those things
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:50:02.020]  that only it can do and do exceptionally well, like world peace and a sound monetary system.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:05.980]  Focus on doing only those things that only it can do well, and leave local zoning and
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:11.260]  planning and the tending of the garden to those people that know the soil, know the
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:15.220]  climate, know the culture, know the geography, know the geology, and are right there to deal
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:21.220]  with the circumstances, whose lives and livelihoods depend upon that land, like Canada discovered.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:28.900]  Now, obviously, the media set things up where discrimination is only white against black
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.900]  or black against white or north against south.
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:36.900]  That's how they want us thinking, but isn't the ultimate discrimination, the fact that
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:44.580]  special interests and socialist in DC and others don't want the West and the States
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:47.580]  to have the same freedoms as the East has?
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:54.060]  I mean, how can you have maybe five, 10% of the land in the East being federal and upwards
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:56.820]  of 90% in states like Nevada?
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:03.140]  How can Congress and how can the feds say no to the law you've passed?
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:07.180]  So maybe spend some time on that pleaser as the state rep that helped get this passed
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:11.820]  and authored, and then walk us through the procedure now, because we know there's going
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:14.820]  to be special interests that are going to try to stop this.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:15.820]  That's a great point, Alex.
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:20.500]  What I want to point out first is, this is not a partisan effort.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:23.300]  Republicans and Democrats sponsored or voted for the bill.
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.340]  Republicans and Democrats on the committees and the commissions.
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:32.300]  In fact, in Nevada, bipartisan commission unanimously approved moving forward on the transition
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.420]  for the trans Republic lands.
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.380]  Critical effort because educating our kids is not a partisan issue.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:42.100]  Bringing up our animals and our watershed is not a partisan issue.
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:46.620]  Having jobs and having a roof over our head and caring for our lands is not a partisan
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.620]  issue.
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:51.900]  So we've got some counties all over the West that have less than 5% taxable land.
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:56.020]  How do you take care of kids and roads and public safety when you've only got 5% taxable
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.460]  land?
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:02.260]  So in terms of moving forward, there are states all over the West now that are starting to
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:04.940]  take legislative action on this very same thing.
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:06.700]  You've got Arizona is taking action.
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:12.540]  Nevada is already taking action, working more, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Alaska is now getting
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:13.900]  in the game on this.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:18.660]  South Carolina, Alex, did a resolution supporting the transfer of public lands.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:23.180]  And so for your listeners that are in states east of Colorado, if you go to the resources
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:27.340]  and then what's happening in my state and you click on the eastern states, you've got
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:32.020]  a packet where you can get your legislators to run a resolution in eastern states to support
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:33.020]  this.
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:34.940]  Now back to your point on discrimination.
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:39.100]  The United States Supreme Court just a year and a half ago in a case called Shelby County
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:47.260]  versus older said the constitutional equality of the states is essential to the harmonious
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:48.700]  operation of the Republic.
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:56.940]  They said our nation was and is a union of states equal in dignity, power, and authority.
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:53:00.300]  Well think about these football games we just saw this last weekend, right?
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.300]  Aaron Rodgers.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.300]  I mean, what an incredible guy.
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:06.220]  I mean, I know you're probably a Dallas fan, Dallas got ripped off on that call at the
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:07.220]  end.
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.220]  Aaron Rodgers is running off of one leg and he's still doing amazing things.
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:14.140]  But imagine if you're fielding a football team and you've got to field a couple of guys
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.140]  that just are not 100%.
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:16.700]  In fact, they're 30, 20%.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:21.540]  Well, if you're the opposing team, you're going to exploit that all day long.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:24.580]  Well, that's what's happening in our government right now.
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:28.780]  You've got part of your team where the states and the federal government are supposed to
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:30.380]  have healthy tension.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:34.140]  They're supposed to be opposing one another to provide that healthy tension that keeps
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.140]  our system in balance.
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:40.260]  Well, if you've got a whole bunch of your team that are extreme disability where they
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:45.900]  only control 10, 15, 20, 30% of the plan, you're going to exploit that all day long.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.780]  And that's what's happening in government.
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:49.100]  Give you a perfect example.
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:52.100]  A year ago, there's something called Pilt.
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:56.180]  All of you in the East are paying money, your tax dollars to subsidize the West.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:59.500]  It's called payment in lieu of taxes.
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:03.180]  It's payment in lieu of the taxes we would otherwise collect if the federal government
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:05.780]  kept the original promise to transfer the lands.
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:10.180]  So payment in lieu of taxes, federal government in 1976, they said, hey, don't worry.
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:11.180]  This is going to be permanent.
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.180]  It's going to be mandatory.
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.580]  It's just as good a sovereignty.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.300]  You can trust us.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:19.380]  Well, over the last six years, the federal government hasn't even had a budget.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:24.340]  And so not only is the Pilt not permanent mandatory, it's not even in the budget because
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:25.340]  they don't have it.
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:28.500]  A year ago, they didn't even put it in the continuing resolution.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:33.180]  And these counties are now dependent upon this money that's only 13 cents on the dollar
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:36.140]  of the taxable value of their land in many cases.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:39.300]  So they're dependent on this for public safety, education, roads, transportation.
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:41.820]  It makes you creatures of the federal government.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:45.300]  And it's almost like the federal government has conquered the West by never letting it
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:46.800]  be truly sovereign.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.800]  And I'm a Texan.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:48.940]  I love Texas.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:52.740]  But Texas advertises to businesses, hey, come here.
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:54.060]  We've got more open land.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:55.780]  We've got lower taxes.
[01:54:55.780 --> 01:55:04.700]  So it's basically like we're a NFL Green Bay team playing a college team when we compete
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:05.700]  against the West.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.460]  I mean, you don't want Utah to go under.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:10.100]  It's a great, beautiful state, a lot of hard-working, smart people.
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:13.620]  But it's almost the analogy of Texas versus California.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:17.100]  Look at how California is falling apart because they can't compete with Texas.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.340]  Now, that's because of their socialist policies.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:21.980]  And I understand you're saying it's not partisan.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:25.740]  And I understand there's a lot of Democrats that want to have free open societies in prosperity.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:32.700]  But it is the environmental socialist anti-human control freaks that don't think humans should
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:34.500]  be anywhere out West.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:39.820]  And there's the feds denying more and more access to the public lands they control.
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:44.860]  Isn't that driving the anger out West at being treated like serfs?
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:45.860]  Oh, indeed.
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:46.860]  Right?
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:47.860]  Indeed.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:52.340]  I mean, when you can't control your own land, your own water, your own resources, when
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:53.340]  you...
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.340]  I mean, I'll give you an example.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:58.500]  My commissioner down in Sevier County, Commissioner Gordon Topham, a couple of months ago, we're
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:03.980]  talking to him and he says, look, my forest, a healthy forest has 40 trees to an acre.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:08.740]  Right now, my forest has 800 trees to an acre right now.
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:11.980]  There's so many trees, they're competing for the same resource, they're dying, they're
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:13.820]  dead all throughout the forest.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:15.540]  This is the same all around the West.
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:20.780]  He says, I'm one spark away from losing my watershed in the second most arid state in
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:25.660]  the nation and my community dies, and my federal partners telling me that they're going to
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:31.940]  prevent me from protecting my community to have a viable source of water, protecting
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.460]  the air from being polluted, my animals from being burned up, my watershed from being destroyed.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:37.460]  That's how serious this is.
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:38.980]  And again, that's not a partisan issue.
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:43.540]  Now, yes, there are these eco obstructionist groups that they'll go out and all day long,
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:47.300]  they'll put out press releases and say the federal government's mismanaging the land,
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:51.780]  so we're going to sue them and extract taxpayer dollars if we went on a technicality.
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.320]  And they simply don't want that gravy train to end.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:58.580]  But the states are stepping up because this is purely a matter of the health, safety, welfare
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:56:59.580]  of our communities.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:04.700]  And the United States Supreme Court, Alex, two years ago said that jurisdiction over
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:08.980]  health, safety, welfare is possessed by the states and not the federal government.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:13.340]  They said the independent power of the states serves as a check on the arbitrary power of
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:14.340]  the federal government.
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:15.700]  And then they said this, Alex.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:20.980]  They said states are separate and independent sovereigns.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.180]  Sometimes they have to act like it.
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.180]  That's right.
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:27.100]  And it's time to bring balance back to the situation.
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:34.060]  AmericanLandsCouncil.org, Ken Ivory, you are a hero, and I don't say that very often
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.540]  with a lot of our guests, but it's true.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:40.980]  What you're doing is so important in the fact you're traveling all over the country
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:44.380]  that other legislatures are duplicating what you're doing.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:49.100]  How long until we start to see the benefits of this, if Congress doesn't try to block
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:50.100]  you guys?
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:54.100]  Well, I appreciate the kind words, but I'm a dad.
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.260]  And that's why I got in this game.
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:58.820]  I've got four kids and it's a simple math problem to see what's coming.
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.820]  And we've got it.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:00.820]  We've got to act.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:03.460]  I mean, Erskine Bowles, Clinton White House Chief of Staff will tell you.
[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:06.820]  David Walker, Nonpartisan Government Accountability Office will tell you.
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:09.140]  The American Institute of CPAs will tell you.
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:11.060]  We've got a very serious math problem.
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.580]  The problems are real, solutions are painful.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:14.580]  We have to act.
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:16.820]  We've got to grow fast or we're going to go bankrupt.
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:18.340]  I know you probably got to go.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:19.740]  It's a 60-second break.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:22.180]  Can you do five more minutes and talk about that math problem?
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.660]  Oh, yeah, you bet.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:28.980]  And again, get to the website, americanlandscouncil.org, sign the petition, get in the game.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:32.220]  When you're ready to make a difference, we are the vehicle around the nation that's making
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.220]  that happen.
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:34.220]  We're here to help you.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:35.220]  You are.
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.220]  You are.
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:37.220]  Stay there.
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.220]  We'll be right back with Ken Ivory State Rep.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.220]  You talk.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:45.780]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:54.540]  Several months back, I started taking your nationwide and your supermail prior to this.
[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:55.540]  I was barely walking.
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:58.700]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:02.660]  InfoWarsLive.com, you've heard the callers of the show.
[01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:03.660]  Your products are great.

[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.700]  Every day they're great stuff.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:18.100]  Whether it's survival shield, nascent iodine, or DNA force, supermail vitality, superfemale
[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:24.180]  vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe that all of these products
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:28.940]  will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited

[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:36.460]  The X2, just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox from the body, it's great
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.460]  stuff.
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:43.620]  Check out InfoWarsLive.com today and the entire line of ground breaking, cutting edge, hard
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:51.580]  core products.
[01:59:51.580 --> 02:00:03.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:22.500]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA region 6 in occupied North America.
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:23.500]  There is a war.
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.500]  It's happening now.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.300]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.900]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:32.820]  We are the resistance.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:34.820]  We are the InfoWars.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:39.580]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, Ken Ivory, Utah House Representatives.
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:43.780]  He's in District 47, AmericanLandsCouncil.org.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.660]  Every legislature, every city, every county, even though it's a state matter, should be
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:52.700]  just hammered with this information, hammered with his book.
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:56.300]  This is the real prosperity.
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.540]  America will mathematically collapse if we don't get some serious growth.
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:03.620]  Talk about the math problem, sir, in closing in the last five minutes.
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:05.980]  Well, yeah, you look at the math problem.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:10.940]  Almost every state, nearly 50%, somewhere between 30% and 50% of their state budgets
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:13.460]  come from the federal government that is unsustainable.
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:16.420]  Government Accountability Office every year says it's unsustainable.
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:19.500]  It's the single largest line item of revenue to states.
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:23.740]  So how are we going to take care of sick people, poor people, roads, public safety, educate
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:28.460]  our kids if we don't get ahead of the curve and get back to economic self-reliance?
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:31.780]  Yeah, there's a lot more we could talk about on that at another time.
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:32.780]  Big issue.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.900]  We're working on something called Financial Ready Utah.
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.860]  It's our financial earthquake preparedness planning, some modeling tools to get there.
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.660]  But what's really critical, we've got folks in Congress now that are stepping up.
[02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:45.100]  They understand this is the only solution big enough.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:46.780]  We've got folks preparing bills.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.820]  We've got our own Jason Chaffetz, the oversight committee, going to start seeing some oversight
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:52.820]  on that.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:56.100]  Congressman Bishop, the Interior Committees, and we're going to start seeing some hearings
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:57.500]  on some of these things.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:03.020]  But critically, critically, rights we don't know are no better than rights we don't have.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:06.580]  And rights we don't exercise are no better than rights we don't have.
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.580]  They're dead.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:09.940]  Property is essential.
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:12.500]  Liberty does not exist without the right and control of property.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:16.380]  So get on the website, sign up, sign the petition, and then tell someone.
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:17.380]  I don't care how you do it.
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:18.860]  Carrier, pigeon, smoke signal.
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:22.140]  I know that if Benjamin Franklin were around today, he wouldn't be set in type one letter
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:23.140]  at a time.
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.900]  He'd be on Facebook and Twitter, and he'd be jamming this information out as fast as
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.900]  he could go.
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:29.380]  And then tell your leaders.
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:34.340]  Tell them persistently, fix their eyes steadily, as Thomas Hart Ben said, on the period of
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:38.460]  the speedy extinction of the federal title to all the lands within the states, which
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:44.180]  is what Illinois and Missouri and Arkansas and that great western state of Florida already
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:45.180]  did.
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:46.180]  Promises are the same.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:47.180]  Already been done before.
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:48.940]  It is the only solution big enough.
[02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:54.020]  We need to make this the number one issue in the 2016 campaign because it is the only
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.540]  solution big enough to get our nation back to better health, better access, better productivity.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.460]  Well, look at Australia.
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:05.060]  It's beating the global curve of recession because they've got rare earth minerals being
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.500]  extracted, and it's not even really hurting their environment in most areas.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.260]  I mean, it's such a big country like us.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:12.100]  I mean, we should be in there getting that.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:13.940]  We should be getting clean burning coal.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:18.500]  Is there any way to reverse what Clinton did, blocking all that clean burning coal in Utah?
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.620]  Yeah, we're working on a lot of those things.
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:23.020]  In fact, we've got states working back together on this thing.
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:26.380]  The critical word on that, Alex, is jurisdiction.
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:28.780]  The governing right power and authority.
[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:32.660]  Where does the jurisdiction lie for the health, safety, welfare of the people?
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:34.660]  Now, that's something we're working on in Utah.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:36.860]  We're working on with states all over the nation.
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:41.700]  And critically also, this whole idea of federalism, this governing partnership, the critical word
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:44.380]  there is union.
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.020]  Federalism is a team sport.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:50.700]  To be an independent check of the federal government, states have to start working together,
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:55.380]  both at the executive level, at the legislative level, at the attorney general level.
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:58.820]  It's happening in some instances, but we've got to get that more coordinated.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:03:59.820]  Absolutely.
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:00.820]  States have got to team up.
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:04.980]  That's what some of the corrupt elements of the feds are scared of in the one-minute
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:05.980]  closing.
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:09.500]  You sound pretty confident, though, that the system knows we're going to go bankrupt and
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:10.700]  we don't do this.
[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:12.780]  The question is, can we do it fast enough?
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.060]  Why are you so confident?
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:17.820]  Like Ronald Reagan said, Alex, it's a wonderful time to be alive.
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:18.820]  We have no choice.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:22.780]  We have no other option, but to succeed and use the liberty, the property, the self-governance
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:26.980]  we have, and that's what's in our DNA, is a wonderful time to be alive.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:30.220]  We're lucky not to live in pale and timid times, he said.
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:35.140]  We've been blessed with the opportunity to stand for something for liberty and freedom
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:36.900]  and fairness and property.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.380]  These are things we're fighting for.
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:43.380]  So get to the website, AmericanLensCouncil.org, get in the game, we're here, we're leading
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:44.380]  on this.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.380]  We're here to help anyone who wants to get in.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.140]  Ken, we're out of time, but I'm impressed with your work.
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:50.180]  I was already aware of it, but thank you for coming on.
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:54.020]  I want to have you back on soon to talk about your book, Where's the Line, How States Protect
[02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:55.020]  the Constitution?
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:56.020]  Godspeed.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:57.020]  Hey, my pleasure.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.020]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:59.020]  Thank you.
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:00.020]  We'll be back.
[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:01.020]  Folks, stay with us.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.660]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:07.860]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:11.060]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:16.340]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:17.740]  The worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:20.340]  Prime-directed discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:23.140]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:26.380]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[02:06:26.380 --> 02:06:28.740]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:30.300]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:33.100]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.020]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:39.060]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.660]  Block free iPhone app at infowars.com.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:48.660]  Block free podcast and video feed, imperative, destroy the planet TV.
[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:51.300]  You got to set your eye on the enemy.
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:58.820]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out, intellectually it's begun, you can fail it.
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:03.420]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:07.820]  the exclusive Info Wars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:12.180]  This ultra clean, vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:16.900]  For the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs
[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:18.500]  essential nutrients.
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:23.820]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:24.980]  by the body.
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:31.900]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:37.100]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form
[02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:39.900]  that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:44.500]  B12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed, no needles, no injections.
[02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:48.540]  Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself, discover the secret.
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:49.540]  Secret 12.
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:54.980]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited, secure yours today and InfoWarsLife.com are by calling
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:08:14.460]  us at 888-253-3139.
[02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:29.260]  Trashing through the lives and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:34.580]  Walter Jones had to reschedule, had a conflict, he'll be on sometime next week, congressman,
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:35.580]  doing a great job.
[02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:46.500]  We're going to open phones on this Friday edition, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:50.380]  Now since our guest was on with us for 30 minutes, we've had folks holding, we had some
[02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:59.100]  police officers, active duty military call in, George Soros admits, his foundation, give
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:03.180]  you the exact name of it, Open Society Foundation, the one that overthrew Ukraine that he brags
[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:11.980]  he overthrew on CNN, is financing the radical anti-police demonstrations.
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:16.820]  And these are the demonstrations, the demonstrators being busted and the white agitators saying
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:20.260]  deck the halls with dead cops.
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:23.980]  I mean, you've got free speech folks, but if somebody's walking around in front of me
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:30.700]  saying I'm going to kill you, but see, they're allowed to do it because they're there to
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:34.300]  stir everybody up and destabilize this country.
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:38.100]  I know I've harped on that.
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:42.900]  I'm all for indicting bad police, I'm all for not hiring bullies, I'm all for when
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:47.820]  a cop's being arrogant in your face, out of control, standing up to them and speaking
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:49.100]  out against what they're doing.
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:53.580]  I don't like the threat continuum training they get where they taser you, some of the
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:58.300]  police, if you don't do exactly what they say instantly at a traffic stop or something.
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:03.460]  Obviously, the police, though, feel intimidated, they're being attacked more and more, the
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:07.420]  society's destabilized, so they're telling them to keep control of the situation, be
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:08.420]  really aggressive.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:12.540]  Well, that's then going to be shown on the news and then used against the police and
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:18.300]  it's building towards a confrontation when most police don't act like that.
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.700]  But it creates the perception that that's going on.
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.580]  Look at the IRS taking old ladies' houses with no judge, no jury, no indictment.
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:29.460]  New York Times reported on that and said, is this okay?
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:34.060]  Oh, this lady had a restaurant for 40 years and usually only met about $300, $400 a day
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:40.140]  or a little one, five-person diner or whatever, five little seats at the front.
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:43.420]  And so they said that was structuring her money that she deposited it, so they took
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:48.100]  her life savings of $33,000, even though they admit it was after-tax money and she didn't
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:53.140]  steal it, but the regulation they implemented and they interpreted that they're going to
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.140]  take her money.
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.180]  And that's the mega crime.
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:59.460]  And Congress is letting that happen.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:03.780]  Congress is letting the IRS target hundreds of thousands of gun owners, tea partiers,
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:09.380]  Christians, veterans groups, you name it, harassing them and not getting in trouble
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:14.620]  and lying about it and getting caught destroying hard drives.
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:18.700]  The IRS, and I'm going to be the average IRS person, the IRS itself, a collection agency
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:21.860]  for the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve is the number one issue.
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:28.620]  The minions of it, like George Soros, Bigden Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger,
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:33.740]  the Clintons, the top Bushes, but even those people are just minions.
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:36.460]  We're talking Dutch royalty, British royalty.
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:38.260]  We're talking the Rothschilds.
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:44.780]  We're talking Soros with all his European holdings that are a lot more than $20 billion.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:52.500]  These are the people, the big Chinese drug cartels, the Japanese mafia.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.540]  We're dealing with global mafias.
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:58.980]  When you go look at who funds anti-gun initiatives, and I'm going to your calls, Robert and others.
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:02.900]  When you look at who funds the environmental land grabbing stuff, it's always Goldman
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:06.540]  Sachs, always JP Morgan, the Chinese government.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:15.100]  The Chinese government is taking over land in Michigan, in Nevada, in Arizona, in Texas,
[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:19.460]  and let me tell you, the federal government just rolls over and gives them public land
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:24.900]  for nothing, nothing in many cases, or pennies on the dollar.
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:35.700]  This is a bunch of crooks like Hitler and Stalin dividing Poland in the Warsaw Pact.
[02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:38.500]  And I'm not going to sit here and put up with it.
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:39.500]  You're like, oh, well, who are you?
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:40.500]  What are you going to do?
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:44.860]  Listen, this stuff's so outrageous that if the people know about it, it's over.
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:50.620]  Let the feds that have been captured and our globalist fronts tell the West, sorry,
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:55.020]  Nevada, 89% is ours, and we're going to run all the cattle people off.
[02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:56.020]  Folks are done.
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:13:01.980]  That's why you can argue, hey, Bundy and them were wrong to stamp to the feds and run
[02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:03.780]  them off that property.
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:09.300]  They took the land that he had grazing rights to.
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:15.540]  Since 1876, they ran the other 35 families off that land in the last 20 years.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:20.300]  They put grazing fees on there that never been there and then claimed he was a welfare
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:27.300]  person because he was out in the middle of the desert raising cattle on scrub brush.
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:32.020]  They know the public doesn't know about grazing rights and water rights, surface rights, mineral
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.020]  rights.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:37.340]  So, we've had land in the same spot since 1829.
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:38.900]  We've got the Mexican land grant.
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:39.900]  We paid for it.
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:41.140]  Three cents an acre.
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:43.820]  We've still got part of it.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:44.820]  Sold it off over the years.
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:45.820]  It used to be big.
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:48.420]  In East Texas, still thousands of acres.
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:49.420]  I know about it.
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:56.860]  See, so I know Bundy was right, but the public, that old man thinks he owns the National Park.
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:57.860]  What in the world?
[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:01.220]  It's not the National Parks that are only a few percentage of federal land.
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:04.220]  See, they always say, what, do you want to get rid of those?
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:10.460]  No, we're talking about millions and millions of acres in Southern Nevada that they suddenly
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:15.380]  are putting blocks on the road so people can't go down to the river and swim or so you can't
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:16.740]  ride your four-wheelers.
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:22.220]  Or federal paramilitaries months before this happened shot a 15-year-old kid in the back
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:28.020]  on his bicycle because he didn't stop when they said get off the federal land.
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:31.340]  And so a bunch of feds showed up sort of beating people up all over the place in the
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:35.780]  middle of nowhere saying, nowhere in this county on these roads can you stand on the
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:38.740]  side of the road and protest.
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:41.700]  You have to go on a little box and then they beat some people up.
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:46.820]  So folks showed up with guns and the feds and the paramilitary they had aimed guns at
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:49.460]  them and said, we're going to shoot you if you continue.
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:53.700]  And the people continued on and the feds had to back down because they didn't want the
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:15:00.540]  civil war to start with a bunch of white Hispanic black people up against a bunch of, I didn't
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:05.220]  see any black feds, Hispanic and white feds because that wasn't the racial angle they
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.220]  wanted.
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:10.540]  They want a civil war to start black against white so we don't all feel like we're in
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:11.540]  it together.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:17.260]  They want to be local cops we start the civil war with by shooting them in the head in cold
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:24.140]  blood not hands up but guns guns on walking up saying, hey, you got a hundred his cattle
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:29.220]  in there you're letting die and there's already been an order for you to back off so you didn't
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.220]  do it.
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:33.940]  We're coming in and they had to stand down and our reporters were there.
[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:37.380]  It's historic footage.
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:41.100]  The people there weren't looking for a shooting war with the feds.
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:45.980]  They'd been pushed all the way to the wall to bankruptcy.
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:48.980]  And don't worry beef prices are record cost.
[02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:51.260]  Most people are going out of business.
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:57.620]  Where do those cops think those federal police federal troops really think the hamburger
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:02.620]  comes from they eat at the diner down the road.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:10.900]  Don't you understand you got 89% of the land out there and it's not enough.
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:15.380]  And when the corrupt federal courts are out of control there will be equilibrium there
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:24.420]  will be for every action an opposite and equal reaction equal and opposite reaction.
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:27.580]  So you're just on the wrong side.
[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:34.300]  If you're a fed out there in camo aiming assault rifles at people on horses and it's
[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:42.460]  when you pointed the guns at people who didn't have guns the guns came out see how that works.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:46.460]  And the feds did the right thing they backed off and Harry Reid is so angry he wants you
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:49.940]  to go out there and die stealing land from Americans.
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:55.140]  He wants you to go out and mess with the hardest working people that are around because they're
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:56.140]  the enemy.
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:57.540]  They don't want welfare.
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:58.900]  They don't want to hand out.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:01.380]  They want to produce and the system doesn't like it.
[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:06.260]  Robert in Missouri corrections for 20 years former military Soros is public trying to
[02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:08.680]  start a civil war with police.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:11.740]  What do you make of it.
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:17.300]  Well you know I live here in St. Louis Alex and you know if you pay attention to St. Louis
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:20.580]  News which you know this is near and dear to my heart.
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:24.900]  I got 80 year old relatives that live in the Ferguson Delwood area and guess what we've
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:29.060]  been having killings in this town and it hasn't been making national news.
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:34.140]  We had seven murders in 24 hours just the other day.
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:40.380]  They've got these kids these young black kids with with with nothing but a pot to go to
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:45.860]  the bathroom and they got them so wound up against just whites in general and the usual
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:46.860]  suspects.
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:50.620]  No I know it's in the local St. Louis News every day a white gets shot or their head
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:54.500]  clubbed in and the national media won't talk about it because it doesn't fit into their
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:58.740]  narrative right as they put out Selma movies to put salt in the wounds.
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:00.580]  I mean you can see what they're trying.
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:06.180]  Yeah and I knew I called this out from the day this all started with Mike Brown that
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:11.940]  I knew it was orchestrated from the top levels of this rotten federal cesspool.
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:16.340]  And you know this is the point that you know the worst they make it out here on these streets
[02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:22.300]  the further they can ratchet up this nasty police state and you know I work behind bars
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:24.100]  I've been doing this for almost 20 years.
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:29.740]  I was in the Marine Corps before I started this and you know what this is this is the
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:36.540]  psyopsis of all psyopsis in this country you know I try to wake my fellow you know compatriots
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:42.980]  up to this and many of them are like the blaze level awakened they're only at the Breitbart
[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:48.060]  Glenbeck level they're not willing to go to the next level they still trust the federal
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:53.700]  government as some sort of an agency that's trying to keep a hold on this rather than
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:58.940]  the agency that's actually orchestrating this and many of them can't make that next step
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:04.540]  and it's tough but people are starting to see it but you know I know a lot of guys you
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:09.180]  know and the SWAT teams and so forth and you know they don't want to go along with a gun
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:15.700]  confiscation but at the same time they're still not willing to go past that membrane
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:20.260]  that says hey the feds are running this thing and that's the real problem.
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:24.740]  Well sure and again let's be clear it's not the feds it's foreign globalist interest under
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:34.940]  UN treaty publicly I mean George Soros is running CNN MSNBC and 33 million to get police anti
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:40.580]  police riots going I mean how obvious that's exactly what I'm saying how obvious is this
[02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:41.580]  have to get.
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:47.140]  It's a it's a it's a sick it's a sick situation it is due to our own laziness.
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:51.700]  You know what don't hang up Robert I want to come back to you briefly and then to Kevin

[02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:02.460]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape and the truth is it's hard
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:07.580]  even with diet and exercise because of toxic food and our environment that is stressing

[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:32.780]  Hear that, that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:37.140]  place and what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:40.620]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:45.860]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:48.580]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:52.780]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:55.260]  Be vigilant but not fearful.
[02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:58.260]  Go to faketv.com.
[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:32.460]  Racial attacks in Missouri because I mean, especially a whole bunch of Eastern Europeans
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:39.460]  that have communities have been killed because they tend to live in the more inexpensive inner
[02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:46.140]  city areas and it's on the news and they just ask, is it racially motivated even though
[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:51.340]  witnesses hear of the chances they're killed, how does just murdering some random white person
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:56.820]  whose family history never had to do anything to Africa, well, how does burning down a black
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:04.940]  church stand, I mean, it's giving criminal elements who are also kind of dumb down the
[02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:07.540]  excuse to go out and do violent things.
[02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:12.420]  And again, it's all part of getting us fighting with each other instead of the globalist that
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:16.140]  are sucking this country dry.
[02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:20.420]  I see it every few days, I'm not even really watching Missouri at this point or St. Louis,
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:25.820]  but you're saying it's happening pretty much every day, yeah, I mean, I see these reports
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:31.260]  and the media nationally, especially, can you imagine you have a week seven black people
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:34.140]  in a city were being murdered because of their color of their skin?
[02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:37.780]  How big a news story it would be?
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:38.780]  Robert?
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:45.660]  This, this is, you know, this, we, we as people that pay attention to all this media, we've
[02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:54.100]  got to realize the media that is fashioned for black people to take in is totally different
[02:25:54.100 --> 02:26:01.180]  than the, the normal media that like a regular white guy will take in, they, they have been,
[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:06.220]  if you pay attention to it, it's a militarization of their mentality and it ties in with this
[02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:13.220]  weaponized form of music, which is the dominant cultural factor in inner city black life.
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:17.980]  And I've watched this for 20 years and anybody that wants to come up and try to debate this
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:23.460]  with me, I'll come at you because see, there, anybody that, you know, it's baloney.
[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:28.300]  This is a weaponized form of music that is poisoned in these kids.
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:33.300]  If you look at the murder rate, 59% of the homicides are done by African Americans who
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:39.620]  are about 13% of the population, but within that 59%, well over 70 to 80% is those that
[02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:42.300]  are 18 and under 20 and under.
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:48.980]  And so this is the thing, that's the cultural rot is the music culture, Hollywood, Dejango,
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:56.260]  this whole thing is, is meant to make them hate anything white and deport Bosnian people.
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:03.580]  You know, I got a friend, he was shot Monday night twice within a block of where Zemir
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:05.660]  Bejik was hammered to death.
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:10.420]  And this is in Bosnian part of town, it's a bar I hang out at and he was shot Monday
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:14.620]  night by a couple of these little thugs that tried to rob and they put a gun up to his
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:15.620]  head.
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:19.500]  He bats the gun away, he got shot in the hand and he's in the hospital right now.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:25.340]  And so, you know, this area right down here, they've got these kids hating on the Bosnians
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:27.700]  and white people like it's their fault.
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:31.540]  And then these young thugs who think they're in the right are going to mess with cops that
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:33.540]  are trained killers and get killed.
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:38.820]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's this synergistic relationship and they know that the worst
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:44.220]  they make the culture, the worst the cops got to be and, you know, it's terrible.
[02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:49.380]  They moved all the jobs offshore, the Chinese, the Indians, the Mexicans, and now we don't
[02:27:49.380 --> 02:27:53.980]  have anything here and these kids are just lashing out and then the weaponized form
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:54.980]  of rap music.
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:58.940]  Well, now you sound like Lewis Farrakhan, because that's what he says, attacking Asians
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:01.780]  and Mexicans and everybody else for taking the jobs.
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:05.380]  You know, when I asked these inner cities though, why can't folks get together and open
[02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:06.620]  their own businesses and stuff?
[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:08.740]  Well, that's what Farrakhan says too.
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:14.180]  The federal government deployed social welfare systems to make sure that it didn't happen.
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:20.540]  So it is a planned program as a beta test on blacks and now it's being deployed against
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:21.540]  everybody.
[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:23.020]  And what you've said is pure veritas.
[02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:24.020]  I appreciate your call.
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:27.460]  It's very sad, very sad.
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:31.700]  And it's just because all I want is to not have black people aboard half their folks
[02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:35.860]  and to not have the media trying to get a race war going and to not have this hip hop murder
[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:42.100]  gangster culture being deployed so much that it's hard to even keep my kids away from it.
[02:28:42.100 --> 02:28:46.540]  And let me tell you, you give gangster rap to white kids in rural areas, you get murdering
[02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:47.540]  gangs.
[02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:49.340]  Same thing happens.
[02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:52.660]  It is weaponized music.
[02:28:52.660 --> 02:28:59.580]  It is designed like brainwashing with these catchy beats, all of it to just absolutely
[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:03.140]  indoctrinate kids into a destructive lifestyle.
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:05.700]  And that's why the globalist 110% back at.
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:10.700]  We're going to go quickly to Jacob, Randall, Bob, John, Beau, and others when we come back.
[02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:13.740]  I'm going bam, bam, bam to your calls.
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:18.540]  Then Pope advocates violence in response to free speech, but that's how Jesus died.
[02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:21.780]  I'm going to get some into this Kit Daniels article.
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:25.260]  We're going to look at some of the economic number and Obama's poll numbers and we're
[02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:31.340]  also going to get into some geopolitical news that I haven't hit yet.
[02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:34.300]  Please don't forget in the month of January and it's going to end soon.

[02:29:55.380 --> 02:30:05.300]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits

[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:07.380]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:40.860]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:32:01.700 --> 02:32:06.380]  And the truth is, it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food and our
[02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:09.980]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:14.820]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high-quality nutraceuticals,
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:19.180]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers and synergistically worked.
[02:32:19.180 --> 02:32:23.660]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:26.220]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:30.540]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWarsLife Resolution Pack, combining

[02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:06.620]  Jacob in Utah, you're on the air, thanks for calling in.
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:12.540]  Hey Alex, I hope you're having a great day, I just got a question for you.
[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:25.820]  First I just want to say that peer truth is stranger than fiction at gmail.com, that is
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:26.820]  peer truth.
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:32.460]  All right, hold on a minute, listen, do you have a specific thing that you want to cover
[02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:35.260]  on air or a question or comment?
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:40.180]  Because we can have folks spam people's phone numbers or emails out and it causes problems
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:44.180]  sometimes, so we don't really let that happen unless we know who we're talking to on air.
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:46.180]  Did you have a comment or question today?
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:50.820]  Yeah, I just want to say that you're doing a great job, you're waking up a lot of people
[02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:56.220]  and I mean if people can come to that, you know, that's fine.
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:59.420]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call.
[02:34:59.420 --> 02:35:04.340]  You don't sound like a very serious caller to me and it sounds like some kind of hokey-pokey
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:06.060]  stuff going on.
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:09.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob and Michigan, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:17.380]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call, I just want to add something to Representative Ivory
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:18.380]  from Utah.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:23.260]  This is really huge and I want to just make a couple connections.
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:29.820]  The BLM are related to all the administrative agencies which basically go in and confuse
[02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:36.420]  the meaning of words to confuse the mind, all these agencies are bogus, the IRS, FBI,
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:43.900]  and then they have federal judges rule that oh yeah, we can have 100% of the land in Utah
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:44.900]  or wherever.
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:45.900]  No, it's pure bull.
[02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:50.460]  We have to start saying no to this or they'll have us out on the back 40 pulling stuff like
[02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:52.460]  a mule again.
[02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:58.900]  Absolutely and this actually loops around to the same thing that the Max Prince, you
[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:04.260]  know, the Sheriff Mack and the Constitutional Sheriff in those counties, there's going to
[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:09.500]  be also the really important pushback on that is the Constitutional Sheriff's and I might
[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:14.740]  add that according to my information and you can verify this, Sheriff Mack has had a little
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:19.940]  heart attack and he's doing okay, apparently he had a stand or something but I just wanted
[02:36:19.940 --> 02:36:22.460]  to put that out and everybody keep him in your prayers.
[02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:25.940]  I didn't know that, we'll try to contact Sheriff Mack, I just want to get him on a few weeks
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:29.020]  ago, I didn't know that.
[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:30.020]  Thank you Bob.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:34.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Canada, thanks for holding.
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:36.460]  Yeah, Alex, you there?
[02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:37.460]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:41.500]  First of all, I don't want to patch you up on the back too hard because I know you get
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:45.260]  there enough but I'm from your old stomping ground, I'm originally from Dallas, Texas,
[02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:51.500]  grew up in the heart of Oak Cliff and matter of fact, I did a lot of things for Kennedy
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:55.620]  back, even as a young kid, I'm about 20 years your elder, maybe a little bit more but getting
[02:36:55.620 --> 02:37:00.900]  to the point here today is that, I've got to say, be careful how I say this but my son
[02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:06.780]  is, I'll just say he has a work in Europe, okay, and in that work he has a lady involved
[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:13.660]  in his work and she's from Paris and her brother works on special forces with the Paris Police
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.660]  Force.
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:15.660]  Okay.
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:21.260]  And out of the blue, she was just telling, he was telling her and then she told my son
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:28.980]  that one of those two, the terrorists there, was actually in the office eight or nine times
[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:34.860]  before it happened, one of the terrorists, and he said, he told her that the very day
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:42.140]  that it happened, they knew the police, the special forces knew exactly who had done it.
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:45.220]  And I thought that was strange, matter of fact, I thought it was strange when I saw
[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:48.820]  it on the news that these guys all wearing masks and all of a sudden, within hours they
[02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:50.380]  knew who they were.
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:54.620]  I mean, that stunk of an inside job to me, but anyway, I thought that information was
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:38:01.140]  pretty important and it seemed, no reason for her to be lying to him, I mean, the situation
[02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:06.900]  and it fits really with the whole situation and what happened there in Paris.
[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:11.220]  But not just that, I mean, that's not the, can I take a few more minutes?
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:12.220]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:16.980]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what in the world's going on with our
[02:38:16.980 --> 02:38:18.580]  government in the United States.
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:23.900]  I mean, I was in Europe when 9-1-1 happened and I knew right off the bat when I saw it
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:27.500]  on TV, I said, something right with this picture.
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:30.060]  And when you go through the whole thing, you can see it's an inside job.
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:35.260]  Oh, it's ridiculous, but then the question is, what is an inside job?
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:39.420]  Criminal elements in the government with Muslim radical decoys, who they were protecting,
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:44.380]  who were CIA, who were trained at military bases, colonels have gone public, were set
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:48.380]  up, nerve gas was released, they were killed, the planes were then flown to buildings by
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:52.940]  remote control, the buildings then had explosives pre-deployed and were blown up to cover up
[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:53.940]  the evidence.
[02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:57.020]  And I've even interviewed people like Barry Jennings, who was the deputy head of emergency
[02:38:57.020 --> 02:39:01.700]  management for New York, who came on the show, talked about bombs in the building, how they
[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:06.060]  blew up building 7, and he was dead two weeks later.
[02:39:06.060 --> 02:39:11.020]  Yeah, President Kennedy, I mean, like I said earlier, I grew up in the heart of Oak Cliff
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:16.260]  and we were let out that day from school to go see Kennedy come down in downtown Dallas.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:20.020]  We took a bus down there, myself and my brother, and we were only three blocks from where it
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:25.180]  happened around the corner from the Texas Book Depository, and we were, and we actually
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:29.700]  were coming down from the building down on the street, and we heard the shots, it wasn't
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:34.140]  three shots, give me a break, it sounded like a firework display, and there was much more
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:36.900]  than three, and as we were running to the end of the street, there were people running
[02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:40.260]  around the corner saying, the president's been shot, the president's been shot, and
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:44.460]  we saw the motorcade rushing off, and I mean, even that, even as a young kid, I was in the
[02:39:44.460 --> 02:39:51.820]  sixth grade when that happened, and I mean, to see what's going on, all these inside jobs,
[02:39:51.820 --> 02:39:55.620]  CIA, whatever's doing it, and on and on and on, it really doesn't take a rocket sound.
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:40:01.140]  I've been around the world, I've seen things, I know what's happening, and I appreciate
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:02.980]  what you're doing, no doubt there.
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:08.020]  Well, brother, thank you for thanking me, but I thank you, we're all in this together,
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:12.820]  and it's compartmentalization, it's government secrecy, it's the National Security Act that's
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:17.060]  allowed all these criminal elements to take over the government, that's why they want
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:20.900]  it to be in secret, just like a bank robber will close the blinds and lock the door and
[02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:25.300]  say you're closed, the government says it's closed so that special interest can come in
[02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:29.660]  and take over, and now they're so bold, George Soros just struts around trying to get a civil
[02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:36.340]  war going to kill local cops so the feds can come in, I mean, that's what Soros is doing,
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:40.020]  trying to get these violent protests going, and it's happening, he wants to get a race
[02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:46.660]  war going, he's a piece of garbage, it's funny to him, but he thinks everybody's scared
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:50.140]  of him, and a lot of people are, I've heard other talk shows criticize him, and then they
[02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:55.140]  shut up, because the stuff that he, let's just say the stuff that starts getting pulled
[02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:59.620]  scares people, well, I'm not scared of any of it, it's not because I'm macho or tough,
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:06.340]  I'm done, in fact, just imagining giving in to fear or imagining being scared of these
[02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:10.940]  people just is like I'm dead already, it's just, it's not going to happen, and we need
[02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:16.100]  to have that attitude of we're done, we know who you are, we know what you're doing, and
[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:20.300]  just we didn't start this fight, and when you, and when the globalists blow up a bunch
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:23.780]  of stuff and try to blame it on us, we're going to get right in your face day one, expose
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:27.740]  it, and we're not buying into your official narratives anymore, we don't believe anything
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:33.660]  you say, appreciate your call, John, good to hear from you, let's talk to Beau in Virginia,
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:40.940]  Beau, thank you. Hey Alex, how are you doing today? Good, brother. Well, I've only been
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:50.060]  awake for a couple of years, I've came to a conclusion last night, I was watching a
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:59.060]  video that the anonymous put out about how to kill the new world order and save the world,
[02:41:59.060 --> 02:42:06.260]  and I was watching a video of Martin Luther King Jr. about the new world order right
[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:15.700]  before his death, and he said the only way that we can deal with the new world order
[02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:22.940]  is through peace, okay, and I believe that there's enough people in this country now
[02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:33.660]  that has half a brain that we ought to march on Washington in mass, in mass peacefully,
[02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:40.660]  and try to bring a peaceful conclusion to this mess before it blows up in our place,
[02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:44.380]  and we will- Well, that would be one of the answers, the problem is they've balkanized
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:50.380]  people, and I appreciate your call, God bless you, on so many angles and so many fronts
[02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:55.140]  that they'd have provocateur groups in there immediately or they'd find a sheriff's department,
[02:42:55.140 --> 02:43:00.340]  you know, on the way there that was controlled, that would attack us, you know, it's just
[02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:04.860]  we're so balkanized by the criminals. That's why I like the idea of the states taking back
[02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:10.820]  the land, citizens taking back the cities, but you're right, peace is the answer. They
[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:16.380]  want us to get violent, they want to scapegoat the police because Lord knows there's a lot
[02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:20.380]  of problems with the police, but make that the whole problem when it's a very small part
[02:43:20.380 --> 02:43:26.060]  of it, if you actually look at where the trouble's coming from, it's globalist social engineering,
[02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:31.060]  it's a scientific world program, it's eco science that the White House science are
[02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:38.300]  wrote about, it's a master global social engineering plan, and knowing the plan is half the battle,
[02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:43.980]  people really learning how the world works, and we've come so far, 10 years ago, 15 years
[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:54.780]  ago, 20 years ago, it's been 20 years, I've been 20 full years on air now, 20 full years,
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:44:02.420]  and in 20 full years, we've gone from most people, probably 70% of people listening because
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:08.980]  they thought it was entertaining and funny, 30% knowing it was true and accurate and contributing
[02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:18.100]  and educating me, that was part of the process, to now 75, 80% the numbers have flipped, no,
[02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:21.900]  the new world order is real, global governance, what they say, what do you do about it, they
[02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:26.940]  want some simple solution, another 25, 30% that would drink cyanide, as the government
[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:34.140]  told them to, Jim Jones cult members, mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness,
[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:40.620]  mostly bias, those are all our enemies, incrementalism, people believing that they don't have power,
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:44.660]  people so overwhelmed by the world and their kids and the laundry and jobs, and that they
[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:48.180]  just, you know what, I just want to have a life I don't want to hear about, I don't care,
[02:44:48.180 --> 02:44:54.500]  but caring and being involved is what's animating, it's like saying, I haven't worked out in
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:59.100]  five years, hypothetically, that was about how it was, I didn't work out for like five
[02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:04.580]  years, went from being in great shape, being in horrible shape, then tried to work out
[02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:10.100]  and it felt terrible, quit, getting involved politically at first is like you hadn't lifted
[02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:14.980]  weights or jogged in years, it doesn't feel good, but you do it just for a few months,
[02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:21.260]  religiously, you're going to be addicted and not able to stop, I mean imagine what Thomas
[02:45:21.260 --> 02:45:26.660]  Jefferson would be doing right now or Martin Luther King would be doing right now, he wouldn't
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:34.620]  be running around saying club Bosnians heads in in St. Louis because they're wider or throw
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:43.300]  mall off cocktails at the police, in fact he would win if the police attacked them and
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:49.220]  they didn't do anything, that's why the system protected the provocateur so they could discredit
[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:56.420]  demonstration to begin with, and that's why Soros is funding this anti-police movement
[02:45:56.420 --> 02:46:00.100]  is because if they overthrow the government they get to put in their system of control
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:04.700]  and he wins, if they don't it makes a more centralized government take place to respond
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:10.180]  to it which he already controls with Obama and his people, and it's not just George Soros
[02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:16.140]  but if you've got to single out one guy who just is like constantly involved in everything
[02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:25.380]  bad, it's him, I mean I cannot believe what a busy bumblebee he's been, so we need to
[02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:29.060]  be busy telling friends and family about this radio show, that's a good place to start getting
[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:32.220]  copies of my films, making copies of them, giving them to people, putting them on access
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:37.020]  television, taking our videos from YouTube, prisonpoint.tv, sending them to Facebook,
[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:43.860]  Twitter, sending our stuff out on your Facebook and Twitter, if you've got money and you're
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:48.820]  Nouveau Reese or you own a business and you've done pretty well, I don't care if it's my
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:52.980]  website, start a news website, post articles to it you think are important and put up a
[02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:58.900]  big billboard in your town, or do it for infowars.com and Lord knows we're not perfect, we're trying
[02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:05.420]  our best, tell people about the show, support your local AM and FM affiliates, tell the
[02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:09.740]  local sponsors you're buying from them because they sponsor the show, become a sponsor, that's
[02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:19.140]  how wars are won is with money and with will, we're winning the info war, we've come from
[02:47:19.140 --> 02:47:25.100]  way behind to debt even right now and the enemy is freaking out.
[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:28.820]  The panic button is trying to get a race war going, that's why I harp on this because
[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:34.940]  the people doing this have overthrown countless countries but with racial and religious and
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:40.380]  ethnic differences, they're experts at it and they're trying it here folks, they're
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:45.940]  trying it and believe me, I'm not bragging so don't thank me because my life's worthless
[02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:49.100]  if we don't beat this anyways, my kids are in big trouble.
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:53.940]  So don't thank me, this is like bailing water in a ship or a boat that has holes in the
[02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:58.700]  bottom, we're rowing the land, it's a mile out, we can make it, if two people row and
[02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:04.620]  four or five bail, right now we got one person rowing and one person bailing, collectively,
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:08.180]  we need to get everybody bailing that can bail, everybody rowing that can row and look
[02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:11.660]  there's not a question, that waters icy, we're gonna drown and freeze to death in about two
[02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:15.940]  minutes if we get in it, we're a mile away, there's a cold wind in our face, it's hard
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:22.900]  going, but we're making progress, we gotta get to the land, we gotta get to the land
[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:27.620]  because the alternative, your back's burning rowing, you better row harder because you're
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:32.900]  gonna die if you don't, just make the decision, you're gonna row and that's the end of it
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:41.420]  and that's what makes you strong, just like working out, it's a process because we're
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:45.900]  in the hands of really wicked people, I mean we are in their hands right now, I want out
[02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:51.180]  of their hands, it's basically like this, here's an allegory that we're gonna break
[02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:59.260]  them back with calls, we're two seven year old boys that got grabbed and thrown in a
[02:48:59.260 --> 02:49:08.780]  van at the park, we're tied up in the basement and we've noticed that there are some clear
[02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:13.500]  plastic tanks that have got dead kids and I'm up against the wall, maybe some kids heads
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:18.540]  mountain on the wall, those are some real cases that have happened, somehow I get out
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:27.660]  of the bonds and there's a big door and I'm not strong enough with the crowbar to pry
[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:33.860]  it open, but maybe if I get you out of the bondage you're in, we together we can break
[02:49:33.860 --> 02:49:37.980]  our back and get that door open before this guy comes back from work and tortures us for
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:44.260]  a couple weeks, now I'm in here getting chills down my back constantly when I talk about
[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:48.220]  this because I realize this is all real folks, this is all really happening, I mean there's
[02:49:48.220 --> 02:49:55.980]  a good chance you know they're gonna come after me, that's why I've gotten even more
[02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:59.500]  serious, more focused, big picture the last few years because I mean this isn't a game
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:03.580]  people, the stuff I've seen doing this, it's real, they've tried to buy me off everything,
[02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:09.020]  I mean this is real, you understand folks, this is real, the people running our government
[02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:14.460]  turned Syria over to Al Qaeda to kill 300 plus thousand people, men, women and children and
[02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:24.860]  to blow up every church they found, you think they're nice people, George Soros is a demonic
[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:32.580]  entity, he was involved of course, I mean do you understand that, they got us right
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:37.140]  now folks, bound, collectively we can break out of here, you're like well that guy's
[02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:41.020]  scary, he may be up the stairs, at least you're going up the hall, at least you got a chance

[02:54:08.260 --> 02:54:14.020]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network, i try coming to you from occupied texas, i mean i really
[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:19.380]  am occupied by un global government, i'm under fema region six, suspend the constitution,
[02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:22.420]  they pretty much admit that now, i mean just admit where we are to get out of it,
[02:54:23.140 --> 02:54:28.340]  we're tied up in a basement, let's get out of this, study lack of exercise causes twice as many
[02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:33.780]  deaths as obesity, cbs news is reporting, some good news, a new bill could mark the beginning
[02:54:33.780 --> 02:54:41.540]  of the end of common core and two plus two equals five, so there's a lot of stuff going on on that
[02:54:41.540 --> 02:54:46.900]  front, let's go back to your phone calls, there's some bad news though, mcconnell, the leader of
[02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:54.100]  the senate says senate will try to pass house immigration bill, i mean it just never ends,
[02:54:54.100 --> 02:55:00.100]  with republicans like this who needs kami democrats, just a collection of crux, scott in texas,
[02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:08.100]  you're on the year, go ahead, yeah, hi alex, hey brother, hey, i've been listening to you for 11 years
[02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:12.260]  and this last week has just prompted me to call, i've been thinking about this for
[02:55:13.140 --> 02:55:19.780]  oh a couple of months, remember the contract with america back in i think it was 94, yeah that
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:27.380]  was sabotaged on purpose by newt generich, right, well my thought is similar to the lines of that,
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:36.500]  what if we had a small college run by say all the guys that contribute to your show, your guests,
[02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:44.260]  say with 100 kids, rewriting the entire code of federal regulations, all the policies, everything
[02:55:44.260 --> 02:55:56.500]  that's in writing, and then we had a package, a replacement package that a group of politicians
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:56:02.740]  could come around and say look vote for us and we will, we will vote this in as a replacement
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:11.140]  package one, well you know one slash deal, that is the type of thing that is a velvet revolution
[02:56:11.140 --> 02:56:15.140]  that they never call a revolution in the end, those are the type of revolutions that succeed,
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:21.620]  usually violent ones fail, are succeeded because it was velvet ideas but armor coated
[02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:26.740]  and was you know a defensive move against tyranny, so we're one of the few violent ones
[02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:31.940]  that turned out good, but you're absolutely right, just like they've got these initiatives
[02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:36.580]  to take the federal land back to the states and the people, those are now passing and having victory
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:40.740]  because it's such a good idea who can say no to it, they'd rather have some buildings blow up,
[02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:46.740]  some cop shots so we can have a civil war because we would actually fix things peacefully, so yes
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:53.220]  something like maybe even having the Ron Paul Institute come up with a plan of an America reboot
[02:56:53.220 --> 02:56:59.380]  or America re-upload and then people run on that, states run on it, federal run to build a bigger
[02:56:59.380 --> 02:57:05.940]  coalition about what we pledge to do to restore the republic and just go back to what we know works,
[02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:11.140]  it's real simple and it's a great idea, it doesn't mean your plan would succeed,
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:16.900]  doesn't mean if Ron Paul did it, it would succeed but those type of ideas enough of them out there
[02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:22.740]  will gain steam and we will end up reforming the country and that's how we should fix things
[02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:28.740]  is with ideas not with bullets, but if they come to take guns and start an offensive war on us and
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:33.140]  want to round people up, I mean I'm sorry, you know we have to defend ourselves and we didn't come
[02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:37.300]  to look for a war but if it's going to start to quote the founders there at Bunker Hill it's going
[02:57:37.300 --> 02:57:43.060]  to start right here and so we'll have the moral high ground even if they make it up and say we're
[02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:48.820]  terrorists and we'll have to defend our families and that's just the way it is. If we did all of
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:55.460]  the work outside of Congress the way they have groups write their legislation and had everything
[02:57:55.460 --> 02:58:03.140]  done in place, you know trying to elect a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz, that's great but we're never
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:07.780]  going to get the majority that way. Plus they can assassinate one of those people if they turned out
[02:58:07.780 --> 02:58:15.780]  to be legitimate. Right but if we had an overhaul package in place ready to go and a group came
[02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:22.020]  along, a majority group of politicians said look vote for us and we will vote this legislation.
[02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:27.140]  I totally agree with you, it's a genius plan, a real contract on America but not an American
[02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:32.340]  emergency resurrection package and we need to promote it so that when things collapse by design
[02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:37.940]  we don't get the globalist reboot, we get the republic reboot that we need. We'll see you Sunday
[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:43.380]  folks 4 to 6 p.m central standard time and I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive internet

[03:00:30.260 --> 03:00:38.980]  there. I'm doing the infowarslife.com New Year's challenge 48% off right now but we are going to
[03:00:38.980 --> 03:00:44.020]  end it here. I've told them to end it now on the three great infowarslife.com products oxy powder

[03:00:49.860 --> 03:00:53.780]  great introductory price for those of you that haven't tried it yet. The oxy powder alone will
[03:00:53.780 --> 03:00:59.780]  blow you away and I mean that as a pun. Well this just broke by a Don Salazar. Be one thing if they
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:06.820]  had a black guy, a white guy, a Hispanic guy, a lady but Miami cops shoot mug shots of blacks
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:13.860]  for target practice snipers trained with photos of real people and unless the news is distorting it
[03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:20.340]  which they could be doing it's all blacks and I think that's pretty unacceptable. Just like I
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:24.820]  thought was unacceptable when the feds ordered millions of no compromised targets of pregnant
[03:01:24.820 --> 03:01:32.580]  women and children. Remember that? So that story is up on infowars.com right now. I mean who did
[03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:38.900]  that plus the PR disaster? I mean who? This is really hard to believe because it's but the feds
[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:45.220]  shooting little kids in training stuff. It's hard to believe but it was real. I just I don't know
[03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:49.380]  what to think anymore at this point. This is just they really want to get the cops in a fight a
[03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:55.940]  racial war with the blacks. It's just the perfect Soros plan. This is really stupid if the cops did
[03:01:55.940 --> 03:02:02.420]  this. Let's go to Gerald in California. You're on the air. Welcome. Hey, how's it going Alex?
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:08.340]  Alex, I'm a long time listener. Well, not long time. I'm 24 years old started listening to you
[03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:12.180]  when I was 20. Well, God bless you. Thanks for putting up with me my friend. What's on your mind?
[03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:18.660]  I don't even know where to begin. I think what's on my mind is most importantly the fact that it's
[03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:24.020]  hard to pass a message along to kids and you know young adults of my age but I'm doing my best.
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:30.980]  I also want to you know talk about the Paris this whole France incident you know as it being
[03:02:30.980 --> 03:02:38.420]  propaganda to you know take away our second amendment. Also I'm outraged by Liam Neeson's
[03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:47.940]  stupid frivolous very very very lackluster comment about you know the too much guns in America.
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:55.380]  That was by far the most outrageous thing I've heard coming from a person who promote propaganda
[03:02:55.380 --> 03:03:01.860]  in a sense you know with his the movie roles he decided to take on. You know I found it preposterous
[03:03:01.860 --> 03:03:07.780]  and you know it's just it's a it's a contradiction but you know we all know with those type of movies
[03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:11.860]  they get passed through the government you know so they can promote certain things. Oh absolutely
[03:03:11.860 --> 03:03:18.020]  but Liam Neeson is a good actor and I'm so upset with him saying that American guns are blaming
[03:03:18.020 --> 03:03:22.180]  Paris. What in the world? I mean it's like if somebody slips on a banana pill you blame the
[03:03:22.180 --> 03:03:26.980]  second amendment and I guarantee you in fact have the guys look into this. I bet money Liam Neeson
[03:03:26.980 --> 03:03:33.060]  has bodyguards and I bet they're armed just like that pig Michael Moore who again is pushing the
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:38.420]  whole race war agenda claiming gun ownership is racist. I mean it's just it's just absolutely
[03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:42.660]  divide and conquer. God bless you have a great weekend. Anthony in Florida probably the last
[03:03:42.660 --> 03:03:46.900]  caller we have time for. Sorry to all the other callers. Go ahead you're on the air Anthony.
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:56.020]  Yeah I when I when I see this shooting here at Paris it just proves yet again that we should
[03:03:56.020 --> 03:04:03.140]  always question the official narrative because quite frankly you know you see these people running
[03:04:03.140 --> 03:04:11.860]  and screaming it just it just seems so fake and it's like what do you call it? It just seems like
[03:04:11.860 --> 03:04:20.260]  you know it's total Hollywood script and it just and I think that what real real journalism is
[03:04:20.260 --> 03:04:25.860]  questioning the official narrative. Well I agree with you and we've questioned it. It stinks to
[03:04:25.860 --> 03:04:30.100]  high heaven. They were allowed to train. They were allowed to fly. There are no fly lists.
[03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:35.860]  They were they were connected to the CIA operative Amaral Alaki. That's just the name of few and
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:41.060]  so it's it's false flag at some level. Are there radical jihadis? Were these guys the
[03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:47.060]  shooters? May have been. Is this being used to restrict free speech and call for internet censorship?
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:53.300]  Absolutely. Not just by governments but by the great pontiff himself and many others.
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:05:11.780]  See you back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Great job crew and tonight 7 o'clock Central.
