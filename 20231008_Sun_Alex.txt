[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  It's Sunday, October 8th, 2023. This is going to be an extremely important transmission.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  You're about to get Tomorrow's News today. Stay with us.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  For two years, I've started the show with air-aid sirens. I've been on air 29 years, never did that.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  As I told you, war is coming in Middle East, war is coming in Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, war is coming in Asia.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  These are the times of World War. World War III has already begun.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  There are powerful multinational financial forces who are openly funding and manipulating all of this.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  They're not in control of all the groups, but they are setting the stage, setting the components, the atmosphere for what you're witnessing.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  Hundreds, probably thousands of dead Israelis, probably thousands of dead Palestinians.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  They say hundreds of dead on each side, thousands wounded. They're saying hundreds, at least, Israeli captives held hostage, taken back to the Gaza Strip by Hamas.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  But as I told you yesterday, as it was unfolding in the emergency Saturday broadcast, Hezbollah is behind it.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  And now Hamas has said that Iran was the main backer and basically directed the attacks.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  Wall Street Journal, Hamas says attacks on Israel were backed by Iran.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  Hamas spokesperson says Iran gave the main support for a surprise attack on Israel. Israel blames Iran for Hamas attack.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  That's the Jerusalem Post, The Atlantic, a message from Iran.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  The Israeli-Hamas war, no matter who loses, Iran wins.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  OK, let's not be emotional about this. It's terrible to see the men and women and children being slaughtered.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  It's terrible to see civilian casualties. And I unequivocally repudiate what Hamas and Hezbollah have done.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  That said, we're not children here. People don't tune in here to get a bunch of bull.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  You tune in to get the real skinny. Now, as soon as this happened, I already knew the main players.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  When I woke up at 5 a.m. yesterday and began reporting on this, we're now just a day into this giant, unprecedented, second largest sneak attack on Israel in its 70-plus year history.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  But I made a lot of phone calls to people that have worked for the CIA, for the Department of Defense and others, including some that work in this building.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  And they agreed with me. Actually, I asked their opinion. They told me their opinion before I even went on air that this was Iran mainly behind it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  And a lot of other key points. Now, there are scores of former Israeli intelligence agency individuals who were in Shin Bet, Mossad, Israeli military intelligence who've gone public,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  saying there's no way Israel had this big an intelligence failure, tens of thousands of Hamas, Hezbollah-backed troops going in, now more than 7,000 missiles fired in 24 hours,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  armored vehicles, trucks, motorcycles going in, bulldozers, and hours and hours and hours before any main Israeli forces were moved into the area to block it,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  when they know the main threat comes out of the Gaza Strip. They knew there was massive movement. They knew there was huge preparation. They have spies embedded throughout that area of the Middle East and throughout areas that they don't hold what the Palestinians call occupied Palestine.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  So, the first big takeaway is you can bet your bottom dollar those in Israeli stand down. And whereas we're sad for those that were killed and we repudiate what Hamas has done, it's really disgusting, we're not going to sit here and be idiots.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  Israel's leadership stood down and took this attack because now Netanyahu will get his dictatorship. That's just the facts. Now, there's a lot of other big pieces we'll break down on the other side.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  The Great Awakening
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  Last year we put this book out, The Great Reset in the War for the World. It became a number one national bestseller. Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance. This is such a powerful book. It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together. That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  The Great Awakening is happening right now. You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at infowarstore.com. This is an historic book. I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to infowarstore.com and get The Great Awakening. This is going to go to number one. I want to thank you for your support. It's a powerful book. Get yours now.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  Now, if people want to be emotional and you want to be shallow and you want to be ill-informed, this is not going to be the broadcast for you. It is Sunday, October 8th, 2023.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  We are live from the Austin, Texas, studios. We'll be here for four hours broadcasting worldwide tonight. Hope you share the links to everybody you know and those you don't know.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  Your email list, text messages, and every other way you can. That's how we punch through the globalist censorship Berlin Wall, electronic Berlin Wall.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  Okay, let me just give you the summation up front of what's going on. For sure, undoubted, absolute fact. Can't argue with it. It's overwhelming. And then I'm going to drill through all the evidence.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  I tend to go through all the evidence. That takes hours and then give me the answer at the end. I'm going to tell you what's going on. I'm sure a lot of you are going to agree with me. Some of you are not going to agree, but here's the facts.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000]  Here's the reality. This is disgusting tribal religious war. War is horrible. I repudiate what Hamas, run by Hezbollah, has done.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  And Israel is going to flatten the Gaza Strip. And Israel is going nowhere with thousands of nuclear weapons.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  And our hearts go out, I know mine do, and the crew's do, to the men, women, and children that have been killed needlessly, senselessly, and have been taken into captivity.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  That said, I don't like some of the indiscriminate bombing that's also been disgusting that we've seen by Israel against the Gaza Strip.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  But this is sectarian war going on for 70 plus years and thousands of years ago before that.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  The Jews have kicked the Greeks out, the Romans out, everybody else out for 3,000 years from that area.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  They've lived in peace many times with the Arabs. That's good, but that's not what's going on. That's the historic reality.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  Now, let's pull back from this. Here's the facts. And there are countless army intelligence, you name it, individuals, journalists, in their new incarnation, or incarnation, saying,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  there's no way that the Mossad and the Shin Bet, the internal security force of the Israelis, who have literally tens of thousands of spies in the Gaza Strip, there's over two and a half million people,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  did not know there was an attack coming now with 7,000 missiles, now they're saying 20,000 men and women.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  Trucks, motorcycles, hang gliders, light aircraft, drones being prepared to launch.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  I mean, the United States knew months before Russia was building up troops about to go into Ukraine a year and a half ago, and the Pentagon was accurate.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  They said, we believe they're about to invade. I saw the buildup months before in October, three months before, and I said, four months before,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  and I said, I believe they'll invade by the end of the end of February, because that's when they have a month left before it unfreezes and the tanks can't go through all the mud.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  And they invaded on October 24th, 2022.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  So, it's easy to call all this, so here's the bottom line, and it's not about demonizing the Israeli government, it's not about demonizing Benjamin Netanyahu,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  though he's very unpopular and he's setting up the judicial reform that's very police-statish, just like we see happening here.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]  But it's just a fact, okay? And so, you ask, how was he elected the leader of Israel?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  Same way Justin Trudeau is, it's a parliamentary system, so you can get 30% of the vote, and roughly, depending on the parliamentary setup, and still be the president or prime minister.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  So, that's what's going on. So, yes, this does help Benjamin Netanyahu cement power, expand power, unify the government behind him.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  I'm not saying he's behind the attack, I'm not saying he's a villain in this, I'm saying, these are the pieces I'm about to lay out before I give you the bottom line.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  And there's no debating this bottom line. We'll open the phones up in the second hour, we'll do it tomorrow as well, but, I mean, anybody that's informed can't really disagree with this.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  There was a intelligence, military, police stand-down. This was not a failure. 9-11 was not a failure, that was a massive stand-down, and that came out in congressional reports, even though it was a whitewash.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  So, there's your big piece of the jigsaw puzzle, now you add on to it. What happened a year and a half ago, almost two years ago?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  A instant withdrawal from, a snap withdrawal from Afghanistan, disregarding Trump and the Pentagon's plan to phase out over a year.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  They pull out in one week, and the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, slash ISIS got over 7 billion dollars in modern weapons.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  Anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-aircraft batteries, millions of M4s, modern M16s, millions of other munitions, grenades, mines, I mean, why would you do that?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  They could have flown it all out. You notice the Israelis, we have the videos, I sent them to you, pulling out F16s out of air bases that are about to be overrun, pulling back their tanks till they get more forces there.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  The Israelis didn't hand this over as much as, you know, they could stand. Some stuff got overrun, some stuff got taken.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  Shall we have 7 billion dollars?
[00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:21.175]  7 billion dollars of high tech equipment left in Afghanistan.
[00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:26.215]  And now Al-Qaeda, Taliban says they're going to get safe passage through Iraq to go into
[00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:29.455]  Israel and now attack Israel from its eastern flank.
[00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:33.135]  I've got that in the Associated Press and I don't just believe AP, I went and checked.
[00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:38.355]  This is being announced by the Arab News and the Persian News out of Iran.
[00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:44.375]  So Israel stands down.
[00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:50.615]  You have 7 billion dollars at least in high tech weapons handed over to the jihadis.
[00:12:50.615 --> 00:12:51.615]  And then it gets worse.
[00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:54.295]  We have all the different videos and we'll show you one of these right now.
[00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:58.735]  There's dozens of these and it's hitting the news now.
[00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:12.735]  Of the jihadis and Hezbollah, Hezbollah funded Hamas with American and Western made M4s and
[00:13:12.735 --> 00:13:17.735]  other US government issued standard sidearms.
[00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:24.455]  And there's footage of just piles of thousands of these weapons, including saws, medium machine
[00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:34.335]  guns, heavy machine guns being handed out in the second wave of the invasion by Hamas,
[00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:37.695]  again funded by Hezbollah, the Iranians.
[00:13:37.695 --> 00:13:42.295]  And now we have Hamas and Hezbollah bragging that they bought on the black market, not
[00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:46.955]  just the machine guns, not just the rocket launchers, not just the hand grenades, but
[00:13:46.955 --> 00:13:55.235]  drones and anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles on the black market out of Ukraine.
[00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:57.195]  And you can say, well, I don't believe Hezbollah or Hamas.
[00:13:57.195 --> 00:14:02.435]  OK, well, why did Biden give seven plus billion dollars of high tech equipment, many
[00:14:02.435 --> 00:14:06.835]  helicopters, jets, you name it, to the Taliban?
[00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:10.075]  Because if you can't evacuate, you know what the standard thing is.
[00:14:10.075 --> 00:14:13.555]  If you're given an order, pull out in one week and they could have gotten those
[00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:15.355]  aircraft and things out.
[00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.295]  But if you can't, what do you do?
[00:14:18.295 --> 00:14:20.695]  You blow it up.
[00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:24.315]  You sabotage it, you burn it to the ground.
[00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:28.195]  Your base is being overrun, you got to evacuate, you destroy the heavy equipment and you burn
[00:14:28.195 --> 00:14:34.375]  the files, you smash the computers, you burn it.
[00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:39.435]  At least seven billion dollars, and that's on the low end, some estimates are 20 billion
[00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:41.475]  or more.
[00:14:41.475 --> 00:14:45.435]  So we have Ukraine supplying weapons via that black hole.
[00:14:45.435 --> 00:14:48.435]  You have Afghanistan via what Biden did, supplying the weapons.
[00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:49.435]  And then it gets worse.
[00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:52.035]  You have the Israelis stand down and then it gets worse.
[00:14:52.035 --> 00:14:53.755]  What's the cherry on top?
[00:14:53.755 --> 00:14:57.675]  There's a lot of little nuts and things and whipped cream we're going to add here.
[00:14:57.675 --> 00:14:58.675]  What is it?
[00:14:58.675 --> 00:15:03.635]  Who gave Iran last month six billion dollars of their frozen assets?
[00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:08.435]  And then the Ayatollah told Lester Holt, I have the clip.
[00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:12.755]  Oh, we didn't say we'd use this for humanitarian.
[00:15:12.755 --> 00:15:17.915]  We'll use this for whatever we want.
[00:15:17.915 --> 00:15:21.355]  So Biden gives them six billion dollars a month ago.
[00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:25.475]  Biden gives them seven billion dollars in weapons.
[00:15:25.475 --> 00:15:31.075]  A bunch of weapons come out of Ukraine, U.S. NATO weapons.
[00:15:31.075 --> 00:15:32.075]  Israel stands down.
[00:15:32.075 --> 00:15:35.755]  Want me to keep going here for you?
[00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.475]  So then you say, well, who's behind it?
[00:15:38.195 --> 00:15:43.235]  All of the defense agencies, all the bureaucracies, whether it's the Pentagon or whether it's NATO
[00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:47.835]  or whether it's Israel or whether it's Hezbollah, whether it's Hamas, all of these groups
[00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:51.675]  are going to get more funding, more control out of the conflict.
[00:15:51.675 --> 00:15:55.195]  The leadership of all these countries is the same, basically.
[00:15:55.195 --> 00:15:56.195]  They don't care.
[00:15:56.195 --> 00:16:00.335]  A bunch of people get killed because war is the health of the state.
[00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:04.635]  To quote many a historian.
[00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:09.495]  War is the health of a corrupt, out of control, Napoleonic or Hitlerian state.
[00:16:09.495 --> 00:16:11.575]  So those are the facts.
[00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:18.375]  Israel stood down, not their people, not their average average cop or average soldier
[00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:21.455]  or even average intelligence agent.
[00:16:21.455 --> 00:16:26.135]  But the higher ups guaranteed got the reports and starting to come out, there was a buildup
[00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:31.295]  and Netanyahu, this is key, has called this Israel's Pearl Harbor.
[00:16:31.295 --> 00:16:33.035]  Boy, is it that perfect.
[00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:38.935]  I'm no fan of Imperial Japan in 1941.
[00:16:38.935 --> 00:16:44.435]  I'm no fan of them expanding and doing horrible slaughters of Filipinos and Chinese
[00:16:44.435 --> 00:16:48.655]  and others and marching our troops on death marches.
[00:16:48.655 --> 00:16:52.415]  But I can also sit back and say it came out congressional testimony.
[00:16:52.415 --> 00:16:56.075]  It came out from the admirals before they died that they knew the attack was coming
[00:16:56.075 --> 00:16:57.175]  within a few days.
[00:16:57.175 --> 00:16:58.495]  They knew about the Japanese fleet.
[00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:01.615]  They knew about submarines that had already been captured the day before and that morning
[00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:04.455]  before the attack, running into reefs and things.
[00:17:04.455 --> 00:17:07.015]  They didn't have all the good sonar and things back then.
[00:17:07.015 --> 00:17:11.275]  They were capturing Japanese attack subs, midget subs, the day before and the day after.
[00:17:11.275 --> 00:17:12.295]  They knew it was happening.
[00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:14.775]  They had the aircraft carriers out to sea so they wouldn't be hit.
[00:17:14.775 --> 00:17:19.175]  The old obsolete battleships, they let them hit because they had to get Americans that
[00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:23.555]  were against the war into the war.
[00:17:23.555 --> 00:17:26.015]  And Churchill wrote about that in his memoirs.
[00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:28.535]  So it doesn't mean the Japanese are good.
[00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:30.355]  It doesn't mean Hitler was good.
[00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:36.615]  It means that the West knew the attacks were coming and let the attack happen.
[00:17:36.615 --> 00:17:42.195]  And so, yes, just like they knew 9-11 was happening bare minimum and let that take place.
[00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:48.895]  And so this is the specifics again of what we've seen in history repeat over and over
[00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:50.135]  and over and over again.
[00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:57.435]  Now let's pull back to a million feet here and let's look at the big picture of Blackrock
[00:17:57.435 --> 00:18:03.375]  and Vanguard and State Street that control 87-88% of the world's money and that we're
[00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:07.615]  coming to the end of the old dollar hegemony and new central bank digital currencies are
[00:18:07.615 --> 00:18:11.695]  coming out and they want global controls and they want an excuse for surveillance
[00:18:11.695 --> 00:18:15.555]  and they want rationing of food and they want to train you the good times are over.
[00:18:15.555 --> 00:18:19.515]  But if they do that and they admit they're behind it, like they do in their white papers,
[00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:21.995]  the WEF and UN, you will remove them.
[00:18:21.995 --> 00:18:22.995]  You won't follow their orders.
[00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:29.235]  But if there's wars in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, China has already basically
[00:18:29.235 --> 00:18:32.795]  started a war in the South China Sea, a thousand miles away from their coast, taking
[00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:43.875]  islands and attacking people in the Philippines, that climate will then help them bring in
[00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:49.795]  what they thought World War I and World War II would be, a totally empowered United Nations
[00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.795]  in complete control.
[00:18:50.795 --> 00:18:54.395]  I mean, I got to say, the footage of the hang gliders coming into the rave where the
[00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:58.695]  early morning folks are still dancing on ecstasy and meth.
[00:18:58.695 --> 00:19:03.315]  And then here come, I mean, this is like something out of the old Cobra cartoons in
[00:19:03.315 --> 00:19:09.595]  the 80s when Cobra would do the same thing with motorized hang gliders, Cobra, Cobra.
[00:19:09.595 --> 00:19:11.515]  I mean, this is just out of control.
[00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:14.595]  And of course, that's the next big piece of this.
[00:19:14.595 --> 00:19:21.595]  You know that if you are Hamas or you're Hezbollah, that if you give a family $10,000
[00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:27.475]  a year, their son or daughter will fight on the front lines for that money and probably
[00:19:27.475 --> 00:19:28.475]  be killed.
[00:19:28.475 --> 00:19:33.155]  If you give them a half million dollars or less, they will suicide bomb tomorrow.
[00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:38.595]  You give the Palestinian families, grandmas, you give it to, here's a half million
[00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:39.955]  bucks, sweetheart.
[00:19:39.955 --> 00:19:45.995]  Her firstborn son guaranteed and his little brother will go blow themselves up at Israeli
[00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:48.835]  checkpoint tomorrow.
[00:19:48.835 --> 00:19:52.575]  So $6 billion gets given to Hezbollah.
[00:19:52.575 --> 00:19:55.515]  That's the Iranian group worldwide.
[00:19:55.515 --> 00:19:56.515]  They're serious folks.
[00:19:56.515 --> 00:19:57.515]  They're not them.
[00:19:57.515 --> 00:19:58.515]  I'll put the Muslims down.
[00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:03.355]  The Arabs have a lot of courage, but they're usually a real emotional and aren't very well
[00:20:03.355 --> 00:20:04.355]  coordinated.
[00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:05.735]  The Persians are some of the best military people in the world.
[00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:07.235]  They're very smart.
[00:20:07.235 --> 00:20:10.915]  And that's who our Pentagon and other people have been really concerned about.
[00:20:10.915 --> 00:20:13.835]  And as soon as I saw this, I said, it'll be Hezbollah.
[00:20:13.835 --> 00:20:14.835]  And it was Hezbollah.
[00:20:14.835 --> 00:20:18.195]  Hezbollah trained them, they gave them the money, and then when the $6 billion came
[00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:25.035]  in, how many people can you give $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 to?
[00:20:25.035 --> 00:20:26.955]  That's usually on the high end, a hundred grand.
[00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:30.075]  Most people will blow themselves up in the Middle East.
[00:20:30.075 --> 00:20:31.075]  You do it for your family.
[00:20:31.075 --> 00:20:34.515]  You'll blow yourself up, they get a hundred grand, but they videotape it while they do
[00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:35.515]  it.
[00:20:35.515 --> 00:20:38.195]  There's going to be more if it gets a lot of attention.
[00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:42.195]  Sometimes suicide bombers get $5, $10 million if they're a big cause celeb.
[00:20:42.195 --> 00:20:46.715]  They're rock stars in the Muslim world, whether you're in India, whether you're
[00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:50.035]  in Malaysia, whether you're in Iraq, whether you're in Syria, whether you're
[00:20:50.035 --> 00:20:53.675]  in the Gaza Strip, whether you're in the Golan Heights, wherever you're at,
[00:20:53.675 --> 00:20:58.795]  you blow yourself up killing infidels, particularly Jews, you get big money.
[00:20:58.795 --> 00:21:05.355]  So here, here's $6 billion and a month later, they've now got the suicide money.
[00:21:05.355 --> 00:21:06.355]  Let's do the math.
[00:21:06.355 --> 00:21:12.235]  Let's say, conservatively, 10,000 suicide soldiers on suicide missions attacked,
[00:21:12.235 --> 00:21:13.915]  they're now saying it's 20,000.
[00:21:13.915 --> 00:21:20.875]  How many times does 10,000 divide into, let's say they gave them half the money
[00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:24.715]  for suicide squads, the other half for weapons, or this helped them replenish the
[00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:25.715]  money they'd already spent?
[00:21:25.715 --> 00:21:27.075]  Let me see.
[00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:33.715]  How many times does 10,000 divide into $6 billion?
[00:21:33.715 --> 00:21:42.555]  How many times does 10,000 divide into $6 billion, or five point, whatever,
[00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:43.955]  almost $6 billion?
[00:21:43.955 --> 00:21:44.955]  A lot.
[00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:51.115]  So what you saw is the money gets paid, it goes in the account,
[00:21:51.115 --> 00:21:55.035]  you usually get it after they got paid before, they're living in the worst squalor
[00:21:55.035 --> 00:21:56.035]  in the worst...
[00:21:56.035 --> 00:22:02.155]  They say the Gaza Strip is the worst place in the world, and then boom,
[00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.155]  here comes the suicide army.
[00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:12.969]  So, you want me to keep giving you the knowledge, and I'm not bragging here, it's very frustrating,
[00:22:12.969 --> 00:22:20.570]  no other show is going to have this depth, this understanding of every perspective.
[00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.290]  I just instinctively tell the truth right away.
[00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.090]  I didn't do all this background yesterday, I said, I said, Hezbollah and Iran's behind
[00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:30.510]  this through Hamas, and people are like, well Jones, it's actually, they say it's
[00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.510]  Hamas.
[00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.510]  Yeah, the media says.
[00:22:32.709 --> 00:22:45.350]  So, if you pay 10,000 men and women, mainly men, how much did I say divided into what?
[00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.230]  Just turn your mic on.
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:54.590]  All right, so 6 billion divided by 10,000 is my, I got to wear my glasses, my eyes
[00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.830]  used to be perfect, 2015 vision, now they're not that good, so I can't read the screen
[00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.830]  over there.
[00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:07.429]  So yeah, if you divide 10,000 people out of 6 billion, they got $600,000 a piece.
[00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:15.469]  How much did I say the high end is, the high average is, for them, $500,000?
[00:23:15.469 --> 00:23:19.830]  For a suicide bomber, you can look it up, a suicide mission.
[00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.469]  This was a suicide mission.
[00:23:21.469 --> 00:23:24.129]  What did they come up with, $600,000?
[00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:31.090]  Let's say they only spent half of it on the suicide payments, so that's $300,000, in fact,
[00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:38.330]  I bet it comes out that those suicide soldiers, mark your words, were paid $300,000 a piece.
[00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:43.889]  See, that's real intelligence, not having some CIA credential or Mossad credential,
[00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:49.409]  but studying constantly, knowing world history, tracking what's going on, understanding,
[00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:54.090]  they admit they pay these people big money to do it, it came out of Iran, and so some
[00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.129]  people that hate Israel are going to say, why are you being pro-Iran?
[00:23:58.129 --> 00:24:06.449]  Stating the facts that Israel clearly stood down, stating the facts that Iran is involved,
[00:24:06.449 --> 00:24:11.290]  I'm not with the Israelis, I'm not with the Iranians, I'm not with any of these groups,
[00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:16.730]  I'm with the truth, because only understanding how this works, only understanding how this
[00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:23.129]  goes on, only understanding how these manipulations take place, is going to let us transcend
[00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:28.530]  this idiocy, the Pentagon is going to get record funding, the domestic police state of the
[00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.770]  American people is going to get expanded, Europe is going to expand its tyranny, the
[00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.409]  weapon manufacturers are going to make more money, Iran is going to look more powerful,
[00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:40.290]  it's going to get more control in the area, the Hamas leadership is going to get
[00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.649]  more funding and power, their people are going to get killed, they don't care, their
[00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:51.649]  mothers will take $100,000 for their son to go blow themselves up.
[00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:59.489]  Some do it for nothing. On average, a few hundred thousand dollars. Now you know where
[00:24:59.489 --> 00:25:10.570]  that six billion went. Buying the weapons that our government let them get in Afghanistan
[00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:19.570]  and in Ukraine. Those are facts, facts, facts, facts, facts. Those are reality points.
[00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:26.570]  So, it's not as easy as just saying Israelis good, Hamas bad, or Hamas good, Israelis
[00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:34.169]  bad. You see, that's easy and mindless, isn't it? You can see the dead Israelis
[00:25:34.169 --> 00:25:38.810]  and they don't deserve to die and they kidnap women and children, it's terrible,
[00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:44.449]  but let's pull back and ask, who at the highest levels allowed all these weapons and
[00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:50.510]  all this money to be transferred? We know. Joe Biden, meaning Barack Obama and the globalist,
[00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:56.730]  and then you tune into MSNBC and CNN, they are attacking Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he
[00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.610]  is getting powerful out of this, and even telling the truth that he stood down, because
[00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.090]  of the internal fighting of these globalist groups. And then you've got them saying,
[00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.730]  oh, Hezbollah and Hamas really had a reason to do this. I've got the videos, you
[00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:17.290]  want to see them? MSNBC reporter criticizes Israel, claims Hamas attacks deserve context.
[00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:24.649]  Liberals all over the US praising and celebrating what Hamas has done via
[00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:30.530]  Hezbollah's funding, and then it gets worse. We've had tens of millions come in the last two
[00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:35.489]  and a half years under Biden, and they reported thousands a day from Middle Eastern countries,
[00:26:35.489 --> 00:26:40.730]  almost all military men, military age men. The Iranians are serious business and they
[00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.449]  do have sleeper cells right in the town where I live, and they've got them in your
[00:26:44.449 --> 00:26:48.290]  city and your town too, and they're ready to blow up the power stations, they're ready
[00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.689]  to attack the police stations, they're ready to attack the synagogues, they're ready
[00:26:51.689 --> 00:26:59.570]  to poison the water supplies, they're ready to kill you. And then when they attack,
[00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.649]  Biden won't get in trouble or whoever they put in, it'll be, oh, we got to take
[00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:08.210]  all your liberties, oh, intelligence failure, we're sorry. I think you'll be so upset because
[00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:15.370]  Hezbollah attacks a bunch of US cities, or they'll do it through a cutout group so they'll
[00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.810]  get the blame, and then that'll give the globalists even more power, just like Benjamin
[00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.850]  Netanyahu did. So I'm talking about the end result of what this does, no matter what
[00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.110]  quote team you're on. I'm on team reality, I'm on team don't be a chump, I'm on
[00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:34.469]  a team million foot view. But I can also zoom in to one inch view, point blank range.
[00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:40.310]  So we're going to lay all this out today and where it's going, but then there's the
[00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:44.750]  other big takeaway. Going back 2030 years ago, the Israeli government really started
[00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.469]  accelerating the arming of their citizens everywhere. But more and more, they brought
[00:27:48.469 --> 00:27:52.350]  in people out of Europe and other areas that don't want guns. And so it's reported
[00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.669]  that less than a third of the households had weapons. If you're living right up against
[00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.710]  two and a half million people want to kill your ass, and there's a fence blocking them,
[00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:06.149]  you are insane if you don't live in a house with foot thick walls, and if you don't have
[00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:13.149]  every damn weapon you can get your hands on. Like you attack us here at this office,
[00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:18.110]  we got armed people here, they're trained security guards, and almost all of us are carrying
[00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.389]  a gun. So you might get some of us, but we're going to get you too. You're not going
[00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:29.389]  to be dragging us out by our hair while you're off to some torture camp. So that's
[00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:34.110]  the lesson here too, is that these jihadis target groups that they know are disarmed
[00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:41.149]  are not heavily armed. So this is serious. We'll talk about what comes after all this next,
[00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:46.149]  because you tune in for tomorrow's news today, don't you? We'll talk about it all here today.
[00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:51.070]  Then on this one subject, that's a huge subject, we'll open the phones up in the second hour
[00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:55.949]  tonight. I'm Alex Jones. The coordinates of freedom is infowars.com and Bandaw Video.

[00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:06.429]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:29.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:36.240]  The biggest banks, the biggest investment firms in the world are cutting off the fertilizer.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.440]  They're cutting off the food and water, and they're funding wars and conflicts at a level
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.200]  never before seen in the history of civilization.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.880]  They're building an angry old world that Klaus Schwab, the WEF talked about.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.000]  So I'm pulling back and looking at the big picture here.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.120]  What comes next, not just in Israel, but around the world, what does this signify?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.520]  Why did Jack Posobick did a great job in the last six months predicting all this?
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.480]  Nintendo did a lot of other people like Mike Cernovich and myself, because you can see
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.700]  what's going on.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.240]  The Pentagon didn't give seven million dollars of weapons to the Taliban slash Al-Qaeda for
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240]  no reason.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.760]  They don't give them billions of months still for no reason.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.440]  They didn't allow these weapons out of Ukraine for no reason.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.920]  Israel didn't stand down for no reason.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.320]  Biden didn't give six billion to Iran for no reason.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.000]  The border is not wide open in the U.S. for no reason.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.440]  In the Texas sector, thousands of Muslims, thousands of Middle Easterners, sometimes a
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.000]  week being caught.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.160]  That's in the local news.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.680]  Military age men.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.180]  Real sleeper cells, real Hezbollah.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:49.600]  This is Hezbollah, Hezbollah, Hezbollah is behind this.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:56.600]  Hezbollah was given six million dollars by Joe Biden last month, Hezbollah, the Iranian
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.400]  special ops.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.960]  They're plainclothes sleeper cells, they're infiltrators.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:11.320]  And when they attack us, and they will, that's the deal the left has with them.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.180]  Iran will get a few of its cities hit, but we'll have all our rights taken and the
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.520]  mullahs will be put more firmly in power because of the conflict with the West.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.200]  There's sick backroom deals going on.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.400]  And Donald Trump warned of it a month ago, saying this six billion will be used for
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.120]  suicide bombers to fund them.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.440]  And you just saw a giant suicide army slam into southern Israel, central Israel, and
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.480]  now they're attacking from the north.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.040]  So all the fools that want to blow up Israel and think it's all just a simple
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.680]  one-dimensional thing, we're all walking into Armageddon here.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.320]  And whether you're a Palestinian or whether you're an Israeli or whether you're a Ukrainian
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.380]  or a Russian or American or Taiwanese or Chinese, it hurts the people, but it helps
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.980]  the new world order for their global destabilization to bring in their planetary rule, their one
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.940]  world currencies, their total police state controls.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.940]  Did our government get in trouble for allowing 9-11 to happen bare minimum?
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.220]  No, they got incredible power and funding.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.740]  And now they admit Homeland Security is for Trump supporters and Christians and Catholics
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.460]  and conservatives.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.900]  And they're getting ready to do it again, and they just did it in Israel.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.580]  So the people of Israel need to march and demonstrate and need to demand to know who
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.900]  stood down and they need to have the whistleblowers go public and expose it because they're already
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.780]  starting to go public.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:34.660]  You had an army preparing all these equipment, all these weapons, all these vessels, running
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.100]  around like army ants everywhere.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.580]  They had their satellites, they had their data collection, they had their surveillance,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.020]  they had their underground spies.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:55.020]  And now you've got Hezbollah and Hamas demonstrators in Florida and New York and California celebrating
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.020]  in the streets.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:02.260]  Because they got the green light from Biden to do this.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.100]  The globalists want a worldwide crisis.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.700]  Here's Jon Bowne's latest report, just went live at man.video.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.700]  It's also on infowars.com, need to share it.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.460]  Biden's Iranian handout threatens national security.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.460]  Think so?
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:18.940]  Here it is.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:36.940]  A beast in the Middle East has been unleashed as a spokesperson for Hamas declared that
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:42.840]  Operation Al-Aqsa flood had begun and that they had decided to, quote, put an end to
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.060]  all the crimes of the occupation of Israel.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.940]  Their time for rampaging without being held accountable is over.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.480]  Five thousand rockets were then fired in a first strike within 20 minutes, landing
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.320]  as far as Jerusalem as Hamas soldiers flooded into Israel, taking hostages and murdering
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.160]  civilians as they went door to door.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:09.540]  As we speak, Palestinian gunmen are inside Israeli cities and towns, something we have
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.060]  never before seen on this scale.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.320]  And they are fighting running gun battles against Israeli ground forces.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.820]  Hamas, the major Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, says they have taken
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:27.280]  Israelis hostage and they have taken them back inside of Gaza.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.620]  Deep State military industrial complex puppet administration's quest to start wars all
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.640]  over the world has hit a new milestone.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.280]  As far as intelligence is concerned, certainly the CIA and other intelligence service around
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.560]  the globe are going to be providing the Israelis whatever information they might be
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:49.500]  able to uncover about external support, whether or not Iran was actually involved in this,
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.840]  as well as any indications about where these hostages may be held or what's going on there.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.660]  In a move to outdo the criminal neglect waged on our military and the foreign policy
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.480]  nightmare that launched Joe Biden's presidency in Afghanistan and to unravel President Trump's
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.500]  historic Abraham Accords that brought peace to the Middle East, Joe Biden's secretary
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.740]  of state authorized the inevitable massacre in Israel.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.540]  On the anniversary of 9-11, the Biden White House just struck a deal with Iran to do
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.340]  a prisoner swap and release $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.020]  They're going to swap five U.S. prisoners for five Iranian prisoners.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.540]  Your reaction to this breaking news?
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:37.340]  If you remember Biden, Obama, the $1.2 billion in cash we sent to Iran, in cash, in order
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.340]  to get us.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.380]  They didn't change their policy and now we're sending even more money.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.020]  Remember, this is a nation that has done recent maritime operations of the Persian Gulf with
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.300]  Russia, with China, and now Iran.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.020]  Their attitude hasn't changed.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.640]  Their conduct hasn't changed.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.300]  This is outrageous.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.940]  This has got to stop.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.580]  This administration is nuts.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.100]  The one thing I'll say, having been formerly the hostage negotiator for the United States,
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.340]  I'm glad to see those Americans getting home to their families and God bless them.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.860]  It's not their fault that the Biden administration cut such a bad deal and they couldn't negotiate
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:17.900]  their way out of a paper bag with the Iranians, but giving the Iranians $6 billion to then
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.820]  invest that in their nuclear program, their ballistic missile program, and their terrorist
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:31.580]  proxies, whether it's Khatib, Hezbollah in Iraq, or Lebanon, or Hamas in Gaza, or
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.580]  the Houthis in Yemen is a bad idea.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:39.260]  Meanwhile, as the American border is overrun, we've known for over a decade that the Lebanese
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:46.460]  Hezbollah network, an arm of Iranian terror, has positioned itself in Mexico with a massive
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.460]  arms stockpile.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:52.060]  It was 2002 when a trial here at the federal courthouse revealed there was a cell
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.860]  of Hezbollah terrorists operating in Charlotte.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:41:00.060]  It was shocking then, even more surprising now that terrorism officials say Hezbollah
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.060]  is still here.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:05.060]  Are you currently investigating Hezbollah cells in North Carolina?
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.060]  Yes.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:11.540]  At this very moment, establishing cells within the United States in lockstep with
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.020]  their Mexican cartel allies.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.020]  This is Mark.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:21.060]  He grew up in South Austin, normal suburbia, he calls it, went to college, waited tables.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.420]  And in his 20s, he ran drugs for one of the oldest, largest, most profitable drug
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:33.700]  cartels in Mexico, a dangerous occupation that earned him a salary of $10,000 a week.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.980]  How does a Mexican drug cartel blend in, in Austin?
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:41.140]  I mean, do I look like what they look like?
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:52.020]  Meanwhile, Iran's parliament chants, death to Israel, death to America, a horrific,
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:57.860]  but obvious outcome made possible by the billions of taxpayer dollars handed over to the Iranian
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:04.140]  regime by a Biden administration that has become a danger to worldwide stability.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.140]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.700]  All right, that report's live at band.video and infowars.com.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.500]  Okay, so let's talk facts here.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:20.900]  What's, what's the next layer of this or the inner circle of it?
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.220]  Russia has won the war in Ukraine.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.780]  Ukraine has totally collapsed.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.020]  China has encircled Taiwan, is doing drills daily to invade, has expanded a thousand miles
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.260]  out from their coast in the Philippines, the South Spratly islands and others, the
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.620]  North.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.580]  And they are saying they may invade imminently.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.740]  This is all a distraction from what's happening in Ukraine.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:49.300]  But the big issue is why was $7 million of weapons given to the Taliban that made its
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.980]  way there by Biden?
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:56.160]  Why was $6 million given a month ago exactly to them?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.740]  Why is this not even being picked up more by the media?
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.580]  What is the larger picture?
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.860]  Why is this being done?
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:08.620]  Because clearly the WEF has had a new talking point, not just one of their members.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.220]  I saw a compilation video a few days ago that I meant to play on Friday.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.980]  I didn't get to where it showed more than eight of the WEF leaders saying we've used
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.500]  COVID to set up our world government, we've used global warming, may I make global warming
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.500]  as a pretext.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.420]  Now we're going to cut the water off and say that, but also they can use Islamic
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.420]  terror.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.900]  So they just recharge the batteries of Shias and Sunnis.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:42.260]  And that makes up 95% of the Muslim world, 80% are Sunnis, close to it, close to 20%
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.260]  are Shiite.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.820]  There's a few percentage points, there are Alawites and other groups that aren't involved
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:52.460]  in all this, the Kurds and other groups, but that's what they're setting up.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.100]  And so you're like, well, why would the government allow this to happen?
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:02.020]  Because when Hezbollah and Hamas that are deeply out on the democratic party and with
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:12.060]  Antifa and with AOC and with the squad, Ilhar Omar and the rest of them, who are
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:17.300]  all basically praising this right now, when they attack folks, it'll be you that loses
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.300]  your freedoms.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.060]  It'll be you that gets spied on.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:26.980]  Remember what came out last week, 12 plus senior, former and current FBI agents said,
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]  we're being trained.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.900]  The main threat is Trump supporters, Christians and Catholics, homeschoolers, people protesting
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.940]  critical race, Syria, school board breaks, and we think it's dangerous and out of
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.940]  control.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.940]  Remember all that this week?
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.100]  So they set up the police state grid to counter Russia and the cold war.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.700]  It was always for us.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:50.380]  They expanded it to fight, quote, radical Islam was always for us, the American people.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:54.300]  And now they publicly say the main focus is the American people.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:59.420]  The most dangerous thing is white supremacist, you know, it's an extremely rare event.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.500]  And now the border is wide open, bringing these people in, in mass and usually talks
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:12.620]  about the enemy within FBI targets, Trump supporters as the 2024 election nears.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:19.740]  Yes, the enemy is people that walked in between the velvet ropes on January 6th.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:25.460]  And the main focus of Homeland Security and the DHS is prosecuting thousands and thousands
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.820]  over 5,000 people right now, including Owen Schroyer, our reporter that tried to stop
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:34.340]  people going to the building about to serve two months in federal prison on the 24th of
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.220]  this month, he'll be in prison.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:43.220]  For free speech, the judge said for free speech, said it in the sentencing, he said,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:49.400]  you still last month, public document, you put the transcript out, you still last month
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.940]  said the election was stolen.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:57.100]  You are going to prison for the misdemeanor of being on the Capitol grounds.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:02.580]  When we had a permit to be there for the stage, try to get people to that stage show
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.300]  Owen Schroyer now has a criminal record, no criminal record before in high school.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.980]  He worked with mentally retarded children through Catholic charities.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:18.340]  The guys, Mr. America, Mr. Boy Scout, he gets to go to jail, but all the criminals pouring
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.140]  across the border, the military age men, 90% of them are military men.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.940]  They're just fine.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:34.540]  That's our bankrupt government because when Hezbollah and Hamas attack, they got tens of
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.700]  thousands conservatively, probably a hundred thousand people that have already been paid
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:44.060]  when they get the cell phone order to go car bomb or bomb or suicide bomb or shoot
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.900]  people or poison a water supply or take hostages.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.180]  They aren't going to wait.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:55.540]  They are going to scream Allah Akbar and they're going to go attack us.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:01.300]  And then we're going to get to see Homeland Security poses a savior, disgusting Barack
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:06.420]  Obama, Biden, the democratic party, the leadership and the justice department, the FBI.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.620]  They are to blame for leaving us wide open.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.020]  They are to blame for giving 6 billion to Iran.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.060]  They are to blame for giving 7 billion to the Taliban of weapons.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.740]  They are to blame for pumping all the weapons into Ukraine and fast and furious.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.140]  Before that, we now went to ISIS.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:24.460]  That was the attorney general under Obama, Eric Holder.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.740]  They run the same play.
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.380]  Remember it came out in government documents that Obama got hundreds of millions of us
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:35.580]  taxpayer money to try to fund that jihad that took over our ally, the Egyptian government.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:40.860]  They blew up hundreds of churches, killed hundreds of thousands of Christians and others.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.420]  And then the Egyptians were able to kick the CIA out and take control of their government
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.420]  again.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:49.180]  They want the jihadis in control of the government.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:54.700]  They don't want Middle Eastern countries to have hotels and tourist meccas and no,
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.320]  they want radical jihadis in control because they need that threat.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.120]  They don't run the jihadis.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.220]  They fund them.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.420]  They protect them.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.940]  They open the door to them.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.940]  Yeah.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.540]  Obama promised 800 million a day to the Arab spring and he did it.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.540]  Reuters.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:18.140]  You can write down everything I say and you can look it up and it's true.
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.140]  Okay.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:25.020]  I have a small margin of error and a lot of times people say, whoa, they're saying
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.820]  it's Hamas yesterday.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.320]  People are on the comments on info wars after the live show.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.320]  We archived it.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.220]  They said, look at Jones saying it's Hezbollah.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.380]  This guy has no understanding.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.380]  It's Hamas.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.420]  Can he read the news today?
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:42.380]  Hamas says the attacks on Israel were backed mainly by Iran, wall street journal.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.580]  Hamas spokesperson says Iran gave support to surprise attack on Israel.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:52.340]  Israel blames Iran for Hamas attack a message from Iran.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.660]  See that this is tomorrow's news today.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:01.180]  I'm not sitting around watching the NFL.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:05.420]  I'm not sitting around playing tiddlywinks.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.180]  All I do is study this.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:12.420]  All I do is look at this and I'm telling you it's crystal clear now.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.340]  They're going to use the environmental fair monger to cut off the energy.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.620]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.000]  They're going to bring in all these people, look, plowed and pivot to break the social
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.060]  welfare net and the social contract, and then they're going to allow Islamic forces
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:30.540]  to launch massive terror attacks across Europe, across the UK, across the United States,
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.500]  across Canada, and there won't be put two and two together.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.020]  Our governments let them in.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.980]  Our governments armed them.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:41.940]  Our governments are hijacked and waging war against us.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:47.020]  And yes, I'm sad for the Israelis that were killed and I denounce Hamas and Hezbollah
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.580]  and I denounce those Biden and others that gave them the money and gave them the
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:54.420]  weapons through Ukraine and through Afghanistan.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:02.180]  And I don't know exactly who's guilty in Israel because I'm not involved in that internal
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.820]  war in Israel.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.940]  Sixty percent of Jews on average don't like Netanyahu.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.940]  They don't like the judicial reforms.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.940]  They say he's a tyranny.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.460]  It doesn't look like freedom to me.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.540]  And they use the Jews as guinea pigs.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.020]  So I stand with the people of Israel and I want a better life for the people that
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.940]  are in the Gaza Strip and other places.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.820]  I want peace, but I'm pulling back looking at the big picture.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.460]  Why did Israel stand down?
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:27.780]  That's guaranteed to happen.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.340]  Why did our government give 7 million weapons to Taliban?
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.140]  Why did they give 6 billion to Iran last month?
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.300]  Why did they pump all the weapons to Ukraine?
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.780]  Why did they ship them to be a fast and furious ISIS?
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.020]  Because it's a replay of the same thing.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.620]  Our government funds al-Qaeda slash ISIS.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:48.860]  They attack Syria and then we ally with al-Qaeda and southern Israel to attack Syria
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.780]  and Assad when they did nothing and try to remove them.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.140]  And Netanyahu is involved in that.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.020]  And so was Obama before it.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:06.180]  And Trump and Vladimir Putin put a stop to it because Trump wants peace.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:11.360]  So whether you're Netanyahu or his opposition, they're just as bad in leadership or whether
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:18.260]  you're Biden or whether you're NATO and Stoltenberg and all of them are the same
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.500]  crisis creators.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.140]  They get power out of the hysteria.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.380]  How did Hitler become a dictator burning up his own government building the Reichstag
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.420]  on February 27, 1933?
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.300]  It's the same tricks, the same playbooks.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.260]  I hate the German government.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.580]  The corrupt globalist they've got in there.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.100]  I hate our corrupt government.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.340]  It's not our government.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.580]  And I don't like what the Israeli government's doing either.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.700]  And I don't like what the Iranian government's doing.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:53.940]  I don't like these governments because they got the same dirty Machiavellian playbooks
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.380]  they use over and over and over and over.
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:06.860]  And it gets worse now for this.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.820]  Biden knows that Russia has won the war.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.380]  Biden knows Americans are tired of the hundreds of billions we've sent to Ukraine while our
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:17.100]  cities rot and our veterans commit suicide.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:22.860]  While the average American goes bankrupt, 60 something percenter hand to mouth right now.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.340]  Overhead shot please.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.980]  Look at this.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:32.900]  Biden may ask Congress for 100 billion Ukraine aid package because he knows support's waning.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:39.720]  So instead of getting $267 million a week, he wants $100 billion for the next year
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.180]  up front.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:46.660]  Biden sent a request $100 billion.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.660]  Putin's being misquoted.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.660]  I actually watched the clip.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.100]  They're saying he says the war will be over in a week.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.500]  Putin said the war could be over in a week.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:59.420]  If the funding's cut, and Trump knows that too, Hamas surprise attack historic failure
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.660]  for Israel.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.900]  Nope, they knew it was coming.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.820]  The compartmentalization, 99 percent of the Jews didn't know it was coming, but the
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.000]  leadership knew.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.740]  And Israel has been basically in a soft civil war, not going along with the beginning
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.300]  guinea pigs and not going along with losing their rights and becoming a governmental
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:24.000]  plutocracy, oligarchy.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.700]  And so now the Jews are going to get in line, aren't they?
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:29.340]  Now they're going to kill the Arabs and Palestinians.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.140]  Now they're going to get in line.
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.500]  Now they're not going to protest and crash the riot police.
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:37.300]  Now they're going to learn their lesson, just like Americans in 9-11, when they
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.340]  let the Islamists be involved and the Globals were involved as well, attack us.
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.900]  And then the same thing's about to be done here.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:49.800]  Mark my words, very soon, Islamists are going to hit Europe.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.400]  They're going to hit Israel more.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.060]  They're going to hit the United States.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.060]  They're going to hit Canada.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:54:00.380]  And in all these countries, the intelligence agencies and the security apparatus is going
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.779]  to use that to take more of our freedoms and legitimize the police state they shut
[00:54:04.779 --> 00:54:06.220]  up that's for us.
[00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:12.250]  Hamas is the same parasitic group.
[00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:18.430]  Hezbollah acts just the same as the Israeli leadership and as the EU leadership and as
[00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:19.430]  our leadership.
[00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.910]  They're all the sick, satanic brain people.
[00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:25.630]  They can be Arab, they can be Jew, they can be German.
[00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:31.450]  These sick politicians act the same and they use crises over and over again to scare us
[00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:32.690]  into submission.
[00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:36.830]  And because the virus didn't make us bow, and because the fake global warming didn't
[00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:41.450]  make us bow, and cutting off the food didn't make us bow, and all the open borders, no.
[00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.770]  Now it's going to be Islamic Jihad.
[00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:51.530]  Tomorrow's news today you just watched and there are plans to take us off the air so
[00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:52.890]  we can't tell you what's going on.
[00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.290]  So let me talk about that.
[00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.970]  We got incredible products you need right now.
[00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:00.170]  If you want to continue to hear this show and you want to continue to hear us fight
[00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.890]  you see how much attack we're under.
[00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.010]  We need your prayer, we need your word of mouth, and we need you to buy products that

[00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:42.330]  the last book was great, all about the globalists and how evil they are and the

[00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:17.810]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:24.870]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. It's simple on the final
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:29.950]  equation complex when you drill into all of it, but it just proves it all. 100%. The globalist
[01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:34.950]  agenda is in trouble. I remember a few years ago the EU had a bunch of states wanting to
[01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:39.110]  leave and they said if you leave that will mean war. Meaning they'll start a war. They'll
[01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:47.570]  start a war with Russia, whatever they have to. So, this is for first time callers. Unless
[01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:52.590]  you're a former caller that's military. I also want to put to the head of the line
[01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:58.510]  anybody calling in from the Gaza Strip, anybody calling in from Israel, anybody calling in
[01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:02.590]  from the Golan Heights, anybody calling in from Syria, anybody calling in from the Middle
[01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:07.350]  East. In fact, maybe I should just at first only take calls and see if they can get through.
[01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:11.910]  Let's do that. I changed my mind live on air. We're going to open the phones up
[01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:15.150]  first and callers, you're really good about this. Don't call in or they'll fill
[01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:19.870]  the lines up and we can't get to people that want to call in. The first round of
[01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:23.710]  calls will probably just get three or four I would imagine. That's usually what happens.
[01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:27.470]  Let's say I want Australian callers get three or four, or I want German callers two or three,
[01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:30.810]  or I want British callers full lines, I want Canadian callers full lines because the big
[01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:34.910]  audience is there. But Russian callers, you know, one or two calls, French callers,
[01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:41.790]  couple calls, Italian callers, Japanese callers. We get calls every time. I want to hear
[01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:49.070]  from people in the Middle East, people in Israel, people in what you call occupied Palestine.
[01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:59.150]  I want to hear from you. Okay? So call your country code and then 877-789-2539,
[01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:05.310]  your country code and then 877-789-ALEX. Some phone systems overseas won't call a toll-free
[01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:22.110]  number, so country code 512-646-1776, country code 512-646-1776, or 877-789-2539.
[01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:27.710]  And I'll skip some of the breaks. I don't skip our local breaks for our stations,
[01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:31.710]  but I'll skip the network breaks. We lose money, but that's fine. The other day these
[01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:35.870]  shows are too important. Any show could be our last. I got the global spirit on my neck here, but
[01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:41.870]  I just, I know, I don't feel, I know. I've got a job to tell the truth about what's going on.
[01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:46.750]  It isn't about being an Arab or a Jew or a German or a Christian or a Muslim or a Buddhist
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:51.710]  or a Hindu or an agnostic or gay or straight or black or white. It's about really studying
[01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:57.950]  it. And so somebody's saying the pieces of what's going on and you cannot, what hits me is
[01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:05.630]  you cannot deny that the West just armed radical Islam or orthodox Islam. You can't deny they've
[01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:09.390]  given Iran all this. You can't deny they gave the Taliban all this. You can't deny Israel
[01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:13.470]  knew this was coming. You can't deny they gave all these U.S. weapons we see being used,
[01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:20.430]  I mean, you know, against the Israelis. You can't deny this will make Netanyahu more powerful
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:25.150]  so he has the motive. You just can't deny it. Well, who's the villain? Hamas or Netanyahu?
[01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:29.790]  It's bigger than that, folks. You are being a slave if you continue to think about this.
[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:33.870]  Who let the islamics do this? They knew they were building up. There's no way.
[01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:45.170]  And we know who gave them the weapons. Our criminal government. And I've got to say,
[01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:52.650]  I've seen CNN and MSNBC attack Netanyahu and say, he stands to gain. And why did he let
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:56.170]  this happen? So maybe they control people in his government. We know half the government
[01:03:56.170 --> 01:04:00.070]  he doesn't control, but maybe it's, I don't know. I mean, I don't know the specifics
[01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:04.050]  and that's why it has to be investigated. It has to be debated. It has to be discussed.
[01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:09.210]  But there are scores of former intelligence operatives from Israel who are well known, who's
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:14.090]  curricula vitae is known, who did work for these intelligence agencies, Israeli military
[01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:19.770]  intelligence, Shin Bet, Mossad saying there is no way with the satellites and all the
[01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:24.770]  digital stuff that they capture and their human intelligence on the ground.
[01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:30.930]  They didn't know this was going down. That is absolutely a fact. And notice they're
[01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:34.530]  saying, Oh, it's the worst failure ever. They're incompetent. Well, then remove them
[01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:38.970]  from office. And I'm not saying he removed from office. I'm saying if that was the case,
[01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:43.410]  they would be removed for ineptitude. But that didn't happen on nine 11 here.
[01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:47.450]  And when Hezbollah and Hamas attacked the United States or Europe, you watch we'll
[01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:51.250]  lose freedoms. Nothing will happen to them. Yeah. The fighters given suicide money.
[01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:54.790]  They'll all be dead. They're just given orders, but who's given the orders. I'm
[01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:59.430]  sick of this crap. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:04.670]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the
[01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:10.510]  insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy. You are crazy. In my view, if
[01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:14.750]  you don't get high quality, swirly food and water filtration and self-defense now
[01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.810]  we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for yourself and
[01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:21.610]  learn how to use if you haven't. And I'm preaching the choir on that, but a lot
[01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:26.050]  of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough swirly food or water filtration.
[01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:30.250]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high
[01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:34.690]  quality water filtration department, the highest quality food, the best water filtration at
[01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:39.170]  the lowest prices. You're going to find and still get quality info war store.com
[01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:44.730]  running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air
[01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:49.290]  filtration. Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal. Our prices are already
[01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:55.130]  the lowest at 10% off. It's an insane deal for a limited time. Go to info war store.com
[01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.730]  and get prepared while you still can.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:18.300]  The last beacon of truth in a world of deception, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:23.220]  All right, listen, it's the middle of the night in the Middle East.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:27.100]  I had said we're just going to take calls from the Middle East.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.980]  Normally we do that on my weekday show.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.300]  We get it because it's nighttime over there.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.140]  It's the middle of the night now.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.140]  And if you call in from the Middle East, you go to that in line.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:38.580]  But we're going to open the phones up just for callers in general.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:44.380]  You heard my analysis the last hour, what we broke down, the clear Israeli stand down,
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.300]  seven million given to the Taliban of U.S. weapons, six million last month to Iran.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.840]  Iran now bragging they're behind the attacks.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.820]  All these Islamists is being allowed over our borders.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.380]  Where do you think this is all going?
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:56.660]  What do you make of what I've said?
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.660]  What's your take on it?
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.660]  What's your view?
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.100]  Open phones for everybody.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:12.220]  First time callers, though, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:16.140]  And if your country code won't work with a toll free number, country code dial then
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:21.540]  512-646-1776.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:28.580]  And we will go to your calls here on this live Sunday broadcast.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.340]  But this is a big deal.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.860]  You can say, I don't care about Israel.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.620]  I don't care about the Palestinians.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.620]  I'm sick of it.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.220]  I'm tired of it going on.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.340]  I'm tired of these wars.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:44.620]  So am I. But the fact that the Western government's empowered and funded all of this is a big,
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.180]  big deal.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.740]  That needs to be discussed.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:55.380]  And we need to talk about it and we need to focus on it, because the war has exploded
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:03.260]  in Eastern Europe on the border of Russia, Central Eastern Europe.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.140]  China's moving against Taiwan.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.780]  Now this is exploding there.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.900]  Why would our government pull out and give 7 million to the Taliban of weapons?
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:17.580]  Why would Obama, Biden, give, oh Biden, give all that money to Hezbollah and the
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.300]  Iranians?
[01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:23.470]  What's the master plan?
[01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:24.470]  Where is this going?
[01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.070]  It strengthens the military industrial complex.
[01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:31.550]  It strengthens all these governments taking our rights and our freedoms.
[01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:33.590]  What should be done about it?
[01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.590]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:40.710]  We've got loaded phone lines we've got to go through and get your name and get ready
[01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:44.190]  to go to where you're calling from, so we're going to be going to you here in just
[01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:45.190]  a few minutes.
[01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:52.830]  It was Obama that funded the Arab Spring with billions of dollars, hundreds of millions
[01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:59.510]  to Egypt to overthrow our ally and put jihadis in that blew up churches by the hundreds and
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:03.470]  set up a police state and the Egyptians were able to remove that Western coup.
[01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:09.830]  Why are Western governments removing secular governments and putting in Islamic dictatorships?
[01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:11.190]  That's the larger plan.
[01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:13.670]  Why is that happening?
[01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:21.350]  Hamas surprise attack, historic failure for Israel, intelligence services, yeah right.
[01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:28.170]  And then you have all the dramatic footage of what's happened and the Israelis are still
[01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:33.790]  trying to repel and kick out the tens of thousands of suicide troops funded by Hamas through
[01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:37.510]  Hezbollah that have poured in.
[01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:40.130]  Israel's having attacks in the north as well.
[01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:46.130]  This whole thing is breaking down very, very quickly and here's the headline, U.S. left
[01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:51.210]  behind $7 billion of military equipment in Afghanistan after a 2021 withdrew Pentagon
[01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:58.170]  report says at least $7 billion and we've got this whole angle.
[01:09:58.170 --> 01:09:59.170]  We're being slaughtered.
[01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:00.170]  Israelis cry for help.
[01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.170]  It's Hamas militants breaking their homes.
[01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:04.290]  It turns out most of them weren't armed because a lot of these are liberals from
[01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:08.890]  around the world, people that never owned guns, Russia, the U.S. moving there.
[01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:09.890]  What are you doing?
[01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:15.050]  You're a mile away from two and a half million people in the Golan Heights in the north or
[01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:23.570]  in the Gaza Strip of the south that want to kill you and you don't own a gun.
[01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:27.290]  Horrible images of people being kidnapped, being drug away.
[01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:30.370]  This is the reality of what is unfolding.
[01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:36.450]  Meanwhile, we have Democrat Socialists of America host rally in Times Square, support
[01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:43.170]  of Hamas attacks in Israel, and then we still have some debate about whether Iran is involved.
[01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:44.650]  Iran has the real organizational skill.
[01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:45.650]  They're bragging.
[01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:49.730]  They were quarterbacking the operation and they're quarterbacking bringing the infiltrators
[01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:55.210]  of sleeper cells across our open border thousands a week, according to Border Patrol,
[01:10:55.210 --> 01:11:00.230]  always a month, tens of thousands of Islamic military men from the Middle East coming
[01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:04.450]  in to the United States.
[01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:05.450]  OK.
[01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:09.210]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:10.530]  Anonymous is in FEMA region five.
[01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:11.930]  We'll go to you in a moment.
[01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:12.930]  Mark in California.
[01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:14.809]  We'll go to you as well.
[01:11:14.809 --> 01:11:19.269]  But first, Tove in Ontario has relatives in the Israeli Defense Force.
[01:11:19.269 --> 01:11:22.930]  What are you hearing from your relatives in the Israeli military?
[01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:30.730]  Well, my sister actually, Alex, was in the IDF during the first Gulf War and she's in
[01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:34.809]  contact with people there and they said it's way worse.
[01:11:34.809 --> 01:11:44.250]  The people are being slaughtered and a lot of them still believe that it was a surprise
[01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.610]  attack.
[01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:48.570]  When I saw it, I knew it was B.S.
[01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.570]  I could tell.
[01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:55.970]  I could tell that Biden, when he was talking about it, he normally says use restraint, right?
[01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:58.550]  This time he's all for the war.
[01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:00.670]  I believe this is going to escalate.
[01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:03.510]  They're going to go after Iran.
[01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:09.030]  And this is the beginning or this is going to head to World War Three.
[01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:15.870]  Well, you know, in the 70s, Israel founded Hamas to be a counterbalance to Iran.
[01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.710]  But but now it basically works with Iran.
[01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.190]  So I think it's hard to tell what's currently happening.
[01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.390]  But absolutely, Israel is one of the most high tech countries in the world.
[01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:29.350]  Massive electronic surveillance, massive human intelligence, massive research going on.
[01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:33.010]  How could they not know this was building up right on their border?
[01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:35.430]  They absolutely knew it was building up.
[01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:36.830]  They just kept it quiet.
[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:40.510]  I believe they facilitated it.
[01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:46.510]  As both of us know, as all the employers know that this goes way above the government.
[01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:52.350]  This is their need to usher in, like you said, the surveillance state or burn us all
[01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:53.350]  down.
[01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:57.910]  It's something that's going to be more effective to get rid of 90 percent of the population
[01:12:57.910 --> 01:13:00.190]  than a thermonuclear war.
[01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:01.190]  Right.
[01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:02.190]  Absolutely.
[01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:03.190]  Any other observations?
[01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:10.350]  Well, I just want people to wake up and not buy into this, you know, that it was
[01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:15.990]  an organic, you know, spontaneous attack.
[01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:17.790]  Here's another point I've got.
[01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:23.309]  My mother and I went to go see a movie called Golda about a month ago.
[01:13:23.309 --> 01:13:26.110]  And that was about the 73 war.
[01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:29.930]  And again, they said it was a big surprise.
[01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:36.630]  But the whole idea of that, I believe, was sort of a predictive program.
[01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:41.350]  Absolutely because it turned out with that war and also with Pearl Harbor that Netanyahu
[01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.610]  is prepared to do, they knew the Israelis knew and we're not saying the Arabs are
[01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:45.610]  good because they did it.
[01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:48.290]  We're just simply saying Israel knew about that.
[01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.650]  It came out and that's why they were ready.
[01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:53.890]  And so did the U.S. or Pearl Harbor.
[01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:55.730]  We're not defending the Japanese doing it.
[01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:57.730]  We're just saying our government knew that.
[01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:00.610]  So they're pretty damn guilty, aren't they?
[01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.610]  Well, absolutely.
[01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:02.610]  Absolutely.
[01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:07.970]  And the other thing was that watching the, you know, the fried fox news or any of them,
[01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:12.410]  they talked about how a drone dropped a grenade into a Merkava tank.
[01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:13.410]  Come on.
[01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:15.890]  Like this didn't happen before.
[01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:16.890]  This is better.
[01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:18.730]  This is all set up.
[01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:24.290]  I was about to say, this is what an aircraft and weapons is laying around with nobody
[01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:25.290]  guarding them.
[01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:26.290]  No, no.
[01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:27.290]  This was planted.
[01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:28.290]  This was absolutely planted.
[01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:31.290]  This, this whole thing states that I have it.
[01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:33.210]  And again, we're not saying the average soldier was involved.
[01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:34.930]  They just give them different orders.
[01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:36.650]  No, no.
[01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:42.650]  And the fact, if you look at the Netanyahu, if you look at you even said this is 9-11.
[01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:43.650]  I'm old enough.
[01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:44.650]  I'm older than you.
[01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:49.090]  I remember him being on TV when they asked about 9-11, he starts saying, Oh no, it was
[01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:50.090]  a good thing.
[01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:51.090]  No, no, no.
[01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:52.090]  It was no, no, no.
[01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:53.090]  I mean, it was really bad.
[01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:58.370]  And then the whole thing with the shots they're into this globalist or whoever knows
[01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:59.530]  really deep.
[01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:01.090]  They want this so bad.
[01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.090]  All right.
[01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:03.090]  Thank you, Tove.
[01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:04.090]  All right.
[01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:07.730]  We're going to go to more calls when we come back, we're gonna go quickly to your
[01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:08.730]  calls.
[01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:09.730]  We return.
[01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:17.410]  We're going to go to anonymous and FEMA region five on Islamic assassins, U S Canada and
[01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:18.410]  Europe.
[01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.970]  And of course the government won't get in trouble and let them attack us.
[01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:21.970]  They'll get more power.
[01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:23.970]  That's really the big takeaway here.
[01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:27.170]  And then we'll go to Mark and we'll go to Steve and we'll go to James and Jordan
[01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:30.130]  and Ferris and everybody else.
[01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:32.610]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam.
[01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:36.809]  We're not going to skip the break cabinets, but we'll skip the last break of the hour.
[01:15:36.809 --> 01:15:42.370]  And then we've got Sunday live two hours live as well, six to 8 PM with only six minutes
[01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:46.530]  ads an hour to take your phone calls and give analysis as well.
[01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:51.010]  We've still got two hours and 45 minutes left tonight.
[01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:52.610]  The truth's getting talked about here.
[01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:54.370]  So everybody, you know, tune in now.
[01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:55.370]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:56.370]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:57.370]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:02.730]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported info Wars financially with
[01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:04.690]  word of mouth and prayer.
[01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:08.130]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists, and the fact that we're not
[01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:14.090]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you humanity has a real fighting
[01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:15.090]  chance.
[01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:18.370]  That's why I want to thank you all for buying products and then for short.com like
[01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:22.450]  books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:25.450]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation, so we get almost
[01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:29.330]  a hundred percent of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to

[01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:43.090]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:46.850]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action
[01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:51.090]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new Renaissance that's encountered the
[01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:56.010]  great reset by going to info war store.com and clicking on the donate button and giving
[01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:57.010]  today.
[01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:58.010]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.530]  Please take action.
[01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:06.809]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[01:17:06.809 --> 01:17:07.809]  diet.
[01:17:07.809 --> 01:17:12.930]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:13.930]  it.
[01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:18.809]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[01:17:18.809 --> 01:17:24.610]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:29.090]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil.

[01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:32.690]  This just broke.
[01:20:32.690 --> 01:20:33.690]  Associated Press.
[01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:37.890]  The U.S. will send a carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean in support of
[01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:44.970]  Israel, obviously, for a potential attack on Iran or perhaps even into the Palestinian-held
[01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:45.970]  areas.
[01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:48.250]  So a lot of big developments happening fast.
[01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:50.890]  Jordan and California, you were in Israel last month.
[01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:52.450]  Jordan, give us your observations.
[01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:55.850]  Hi, Alex, first-time caller.
[01:20:55.850 --> 01:21:02.890]  I was there with a prominent group, with a private tour, and I noticed a lot of breaches
[01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:09.610]  in security, and a lot of laxed attitudes about the Arabs.
[01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:16.050]  And I saw a lot of weakness, and I asked about the nuclear power station in Tel Aviv.
[01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:18.210]  I said, how come it's not surrounded?
[01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:19.870]  How come it's not protected?
[01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:22.910]  It just seemed like it was very exposed.
[01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:28.050]  And one of the security officers told me they were very disappointed that this woke
[01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:34.950]  attitude in Israel, these liberal Jews, their kids are in the army and they're very weak.
[01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:37.890]  They're not the same kind of soldiers that they had in the 70s.
[01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.650]  These are, you know, it's a different breed of Israeli soldiers.
[01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:43.010]  Well, yeah, it's the same problem everywhere.
[01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:48.970]  Yeah, well, it was very apparent there, and I have a friend in a bunker right now,
[01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:53.050]  and she told me there's literally raping going on in the streets.
[01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:57.010]  Oh, that's all confirmed, and it's much worse than the media saying that's all confirmed.
[01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:59.610]  Tens of thousands have taken over large areas.
[01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:01.530]  You heard me give a wide spectrum analysis.
[01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:03.410]  What do you think?
[01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.750]  I think the Chinese are involved because they control the ports there, and they've
[01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:13.410]  got interest in all the high technology this Israel kind of sold out to China.
[01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:16.990]  And China controls Iran and even controls Russia.
[01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:19.050]  So I think they're behind all this as well.
[01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:23.610]  I totally I should have absolutely China is the big mover here.
[01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:28.290]  And then why do you think Biden, who's controlled by China and his son, is giving all these
[01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.370]  weapons to the Islamic system?
[01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:35.570]  I mean, that is he should be impeached right now instead of absolutely.
[01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:40.170]  And also, Alex, I thought it was eighty six billion dollars in the war.
[01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:42.530]  No, I agree.
[01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:47.330]  It's at least the infrastructure, all of it that we built are saying is 80 billion.
[01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:48.650]  CNN's number is seven.
[01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:49.650]  I agree.
[01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:50.650]  It's much higher.
[01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:53.690]  Eighty six billion.
[01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:56.450]  And that's all being that's all coming down in there.
[01:22:56.450 --> 01:23:02.730]  And how Hamas did this, there's no way they did this on without anybody.
[01:23:02.730 --> 01:23:05.210]  Well, that's just I mean, I study it because it's so interesting.
[01:23:05.210 --> 01:23:09.610]  But you sound like you don't want to the Arabs on average are not that organized.
[01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.970]  The Iranians are.
[01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:13.610]  This looked Iranian the minute I saw it.
[01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:18.650]  The other thing is, if you look at who's actually coming across those wires, those
[01:23:18.650 --> 01:23:22.730]  aren't necessarily they're not Palestinians.
[01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:23.730]  Those were Egyptians.
[01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:25.530]  They had Afro.
[01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:26.530]  They have Afro.
[01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:27.530]  Those are not.
[01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:32.410]  I saw that a lot of the people taking hostages were black.
[01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:33.410]  They're black.
[01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:34.410]  They have Afro.
[01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:35.410]  They have Afro.
[01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.410]  That's who they sent in.
[01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:43.010]  And those planes, those the glide plane, they don't have those there.
[01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:48.130]  I mean, those are those are you've never you never see those in Israel.
[01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:51.490]  So I just don't know how this whole thing got away from everybody.
[01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:55.730]  But the Israeli the average Israeli trooper there is there.
[01:23:55.730 --> 01:24:01.490]  There's the liberal Jews and the weak, unfortunately, and I'm a Zionist, I'm a Jew.
[01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:07.450]  And, you know, I remember we had Jews tank commanders stay at our house and during
[01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:11.010]  the 73 war, our family bought a tank.
[01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:14.530]  And we have that the tank crew stayed at our house.
[01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.690]  One summer, we got to meet them.
[01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:19.890]  And these were tough guys, tough, tough guy.
[01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:22.610]  I was 10 years old, 11 years old.
[01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:29.010]  And the soldiers you see now, they're and it's also Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:33.210]  It's also Sodom and Gomorrah over there, a rave.
[01:24:33.210 --> 01:24:34.210]  That's unbelievable.
[01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:39.810]  Well, is that not biblical to have men coming down in empowered hang gliders, attacking
[01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:42.810]  and killing people while the Israelis party?
[01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:43.810]  Absolutely.
[01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:46.090]  I'm just in shock.
[01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:47.570]  And I have a lot of friends and family.
[01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:52.650]  Look at the message on the quote Sabbath or church day, they're out there partying.
[01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:53.650]  It's unbelievable.
[01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:54.650]  It's Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:59.370]  And my friends here in L.A. were disgusted with these Jews, with these liberal Jews
[01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:03.690]  that all they want to do is shake their ass and party and dead.
[01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:04.690]  And they're weak.
[01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:05.690]  They're weak.
[01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:08.730]  And you can't be surrounded by enemies like this and be weak.
[01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:12.210]  And those those parents that were tough raised weak children.
[01:25:12.210 --> 01:25:13.210]  All right.
[01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:15.330]  Thank you for the call, Jordan.
[01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:16.330]  Very powerful information.
[01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:17.330]  We got to move quickly, everybody.
[01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:20.650]  By the way, Owen's coming in the next two hours, everybody that's on hold, then we'll
[01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:21.650]  get to you.
[01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:22.930]  And I think we'll get to all these calls before that happens.
[01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:26.610]  Everybody else that calls in after these callers, you'll be on with Owen tonight.
[01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:27.610]  Huge audience tonight.
[01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:29.970]  Obviously, this is very dangerous.
[01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:30.970]  Who's up next year?
[01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:33.330]  Who's next in order?
[01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:34.330]  That's tell me who's next here.
[01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:35.330]  I got to get glasses.
[01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.490]  My eyes are going out.
[01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:38.530]  Mark in California.
[01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:39.530]  You're on the air.
[01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:40.530]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:41.530]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:42.530]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:43.530]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:44.530]  Go ahead.
[01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:45.530]  Yes.
[01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:46.530]  I would like to just plug the iodine.
[01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:49.770]  My wife's having inflammation issues, and it's really helped.
[01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.770]  So thank you for that.
[01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:57.210]  So I want to talk about Revelation chapter 12, it's a Bible prophecy being fulfilled.
[01:25:57.210 --> 01:26:00.990]  It says, War broke out in heaven, and Michael and his angels went forth to battle
[01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:05.930]  with the dragon, which could be interpreted as China, because they, you know, use
[01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:10.210]  the dragon in their symbology, and the angels fought and the huge dragon was cast
[01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:15.690]  down, and the angel serpent, it's called the devil thing, came down to the earth.
[01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:19.310]  But I'm skipping several verses, because I don't want to take too much time.
[01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:24.930]  But then he goes after the believers, and it says, And they have overcome by the
[01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.810]  means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony, for they
[01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:33.010]  did not love and cling to life, even when faced with death and holding their lives
[01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:35.330]  cheap till they had to die for the witnessing.
[01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:38.930]  So this is an all-out attack against Jews and Christians, with the FBI calling
[01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:43.730]  terrorists, most of them are Christians, and this attack, there was a false flag
[01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.490]  by our own government against Israelis.
[01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:48.290]  All right, I appreciate your call, we're going to move quick now.
[01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.450]  Anonymous in FEMA Region 5, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:55.090]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:56.250]  Go ahead.
[01:26:56.250 --> 01:27:00.150]  So the Islamic Assassins, that's one of the oldest secret societies in the world,
[01:27:00.150 --> 01:27:05.210]  going back to the first Crusades, when the Templars took Jerusalem, and the
[01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:09.930]  Assassins, they, Leo Zagami did a good episode on drugs and the Illuminati, and
[01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:13.930]  they brainwashed our members with cannabis and all sorts of drugs, like
[01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:17.770]  today, they operate the same way today, creating the perfect suicide.
[01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:22.130]  No, you're right, a lot of these Islamist fighters are on a bunch of drugs.
[01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:26.130]  Yeah, exactly, and I agree with your widespread term analysis, I just want to
[01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:30.570]  add that the Vatican and Jesuit Pope Francis put in place a cardinal in
[01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:35.730]  Jerusalem a few days before this all happened, his name is Cardinal Pizzapalla,
[01:27:35.730 --> 01:27:39.410]  some Italian name, he's the Knight of the Holy Sepulchre too.
[01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:41.370]  We'll look into that, thank you.
[01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:44.690]  Paul in Florida, Palestinians protesting in Florida, go ahead.
[01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:51.090]  Hi, hey, Alex, I just wanted to talk about a couple of things real quick.
[01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:57.610]  Number one, the explosively formed penetrator that killed that Israeli
[01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:01.210]  tank, if that's real, that's a major problem.
[01:28:02.770 --> 01:28:09.370]  Number two, I just saw about 350 Palestinian protesters clashing with Israeli
[01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:12.090]  protesters in Tampa, Florida.
[01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:15.730]  I didn't know that, guys, look up, look up a protest, Florida Palestinians,
[01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:17.330]  wow, so they just clash with them?
[01:28:18.370 --> 01:28:24.450]  It's, well, they were about to, it's on my Facebook page, I just uploaded it.
[01:28:24.450 --> 01:28:26.050]  OK, what's your Facebook, what's your Facebook?
[01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:35.330]  It's Doug Snutsky, D-O-U-G-S-C-H-N-U-S-K-I.
[01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:39.250]  Doug Snutsky, and where do they clash with them, where do they clash with them in Florida?
[01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:44.130]  Right in Tampa, I just moved here from Connecticut.
[01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:49.050]  Hold on, I'm going to put you on hold, tell the crews, because I missed
[01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:52.130]  part of it, where we find this and we'll pull it up next segment.
[01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:53.170]  We'll be right back, folks.

[01:31:58.490 --> 01:32:00.010]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:00.890]  Thought it was next week.
[01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.610]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:06.650]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:09.890]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:12.290]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:16.090]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:18.850]  Right to the top, folks.

[01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:37.930]  This is 95%, super constant.
[01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:40.930]  So like taking one pill, it's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:43.730]  It's that powerful or more.
[01:32:44.410 --> 01:32:46.730]  So they're available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:52.010]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out for almost eight months back

[01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:06.610]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:34.140]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:55.620]  The situation in Israel is a lot bigger than just Israel.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.780]  China's moving in on the South China Sea in Taiwan.
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:00.080]  They're moving in all over the place.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.080]  Our borders are wide open.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.740]  We've been totally infiltrated.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.540]  We've got the insanity going on in Ukraine.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.460]  This is the season of destruction.
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:12.660]  Now U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups moving into the area.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.300]  War is already exploded.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.460]  It's much worse than what you're hearing on the news in Israel.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.500]  This is a big deal.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.500]  All right.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.660]  Were you guys able to get to Paul's Facebook page?
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:30.340]  Because we were talking to Paul and he said he was just in Tampa and saw a bunch of
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.220]  Palestinians and Jews clashing.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.980]  Yeah, here's the footage right here.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.860]  So yeah, this is going on.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:38.220]  And so thank you, Paul, for that tip.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:43.100]  We'll get that video and air it coming up next hour with Owen Schroyer.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.380]  Make a note for Owen to air that.
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.820]  This is powerful stuff, but I want to be able to get to your phone calls right now.
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.820]  We have the New York footage.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.000]  We can B-roll all that and what's going on.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  This is powerful.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.100]  Thanks for the tip, sir.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.100]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:59.380]  Owen will air that coming up start of the next hour.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:00.420]  OK.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:01.420]  Write it out, guys.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.420]  We're going to do that.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:03.420]  I told them we are.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:07.780]  Let's go to Steve in South Carolina.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.780]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780]  You're on the air.
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:19.160]  Yeah, Alex, three words, problem, reaction, solution, quoted from your friend David Icke.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:25.680]  They create the problem, they get the reaction, and then they come in as the saviors.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.680]  This is a total distraction from the destruction that Russia is wreaking on NATO.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:42.880]  My gosh, there's been, what, 400,000 Ukrainians killed, and this is good against evil.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:50.120]  Your 100 percent analysis is right, correct to the T. I mean, they're leading us into
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:57.280]  total destruction, and if everybody would just go read Revelation 18 over and over
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:06.200]  and over, or in one hour as I judgment come, or in one hour as she may desolate, desolate.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:18.900]  And my interpretation of this chapter is we're going to see New York burn to the ground.
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:19.900]  I agree with you.
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.660]  Put some footage, a little bit of audio while you talk.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:22.660]  Keep going.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:26.500]  I mean, look, our government has opened us up for this thousands a week coming across
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.360]  the Texas border or military command from the Middle East.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.180]  That is in the war patrol reports.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:36.380]  Yes, and China's coming over.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:43.460]  Michael Young's reported 50, 100 Chinese nationals coming over a day.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.340]  We don't know who these people are.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:51.180]  And I mean, we're pretty much screwed.
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:56.000]  And people, I'll say the funding of the police, incredible crime exploding.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.980]  It's all part of the you don't know what one angle hit you.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:36:59.980]  Millions dying from the shots.
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.980]  Yeah.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:01.980]  This is the New World Order.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.300]  This is the post-industrial world, an angrier world, wreck society, tear it down, break
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.300]  it down.
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:09.460]  And they're using every angle they can.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:16.060]  And you know, people just they've got to get back to the word of God.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:23.220]  There's Steve Quayle, how many times you had him on say there is no political solution
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:25.420]  to a spiritual problem.
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:27.220]  We've got to get back to God.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:31.900]  I pray for you and the info wars through every day.
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:38.840]  People, we've got to get ready, because in my honestly humble opinion, I'm excited
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.420]  because we may be able to see Jesus Christ.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.820]  I mean, that's that's exciting.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:54.540]  But all of this death, all of this killing, all of this hate, you know, I don't know.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:57.740]  We just say this, brother, and I appreciate your call, Steve.
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:02.420]  When I see this footage of North Africans was a large part of the group invading.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.820]  They got paid hundreds of thousands of peace by Hezbollah.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:08.300]  It's all coming out by Iran to come there and risk their lives to do this.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.340]  They were given bounties that that's what the main security fence in the Gaza Strip
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:16.580]  is, is to stop the, quote, African migrants that also use it coming in.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:20.740]  And so they brought in Islamists out of Libya, other places, the same ones that went
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.700]  and murdered the Islamists that weren't under a globalist control, and they're now using
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:27.700]  them to bring them in.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.100]  That is the bottom line.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.100]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:31.100]  All right.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.100]  Let's take calls.
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.100]  The order received.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.100]  Steve in Tennessee says, what's the goal?
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.100]  What is the goal?
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.100]  Steve?
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.100]  What is the goal?
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.100]  James?
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.940]  It's always been about globalism.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.620]  I'm 28 years old.
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:49.420]  I've watched nothing my entire life, but the rise of the police state and globalism.
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:50.980]  And they're they're all coming for us.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:54.660]  No matter who we are, no matter how small you are, no matter where you are, reach
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.280]  you are, doesn't matter.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.300]  They're all coming after us.
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.300]  I agree.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:03.780]  I mean, look, look, look, oh, Biden has to be impeached now.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:07.420]  He gave them the tens of millions and some say 80 something million, but the conservative
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.780]  numbers seven million.
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:09.780]  That's enough.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.660]  The Pentagon report says of weapons he gave Iran six billion.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:16.140]  They use it to pay for these suicide squads.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.140]  Boom.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.140]  Done.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.140]  Impeach Biden for this now.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:20.140]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:25.500]  And like I said, I've watched my entire life, my freedoms being eroded, my country being
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.500]  right.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:31.660]  And it's like you said decades ago, they want 30, 40 million people dead, black uniforms,
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.180]  war, whole cities on fire.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.380]  They want it all.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.860]  They want our souls.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:38.860]  It's an assault.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.340]  They're going to break eggs to make their satanic omelet powerfully said.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.340]  Thank you, James.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:44.340]  I'm moving quick.
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.340]  Get all you hear on air.
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:47.580]  Let's talk to Ferris in California.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.140]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.500]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:51.820]  First time speaker.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:55.660]  First of all, I just want to say I recently started to listen to you about three, four
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:56.660]  months ago.
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:01.940]  I mean, beforehand, I was a Bernie supporter, you know, AOC, all those people.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:06.220]  And, you know, that's been changed.
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:10.540]  And I'm a Christian and I'm a Palestinian also.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:17.220]  And I just want to say, like, how can people just be openly expressing and saying that,
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:21.140]  you know, the Palestinians, you know, whatever it is they're going through in this situation
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:27.740]  that's going on right now, that it's unjustified for them to rise up and all that stuff.
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.940]  And let me say, obviously, I'm not condoning.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:35.980]  I'm not justifying killing innocent women, men, children, things like that, frankly,
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:39.700]  to be honest, it's disrespectful that I feel like I have to preface that before anything
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:48.460]  I say, you know, I mean, there's been so much conflict and so much trouble that's been
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:51.340]  going on between the two of them, even leading up, you know, they get their water
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:52.340]  cut off.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:56.060]  You know, there's a lot of discrimination, humiliation, you know, Palestinian children
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:58.620]  getting killed all the time.
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:04.420]  You know, these people, they've they're in a boiling pot and a pressure cooker and
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.980]  Sir, I want to be 100 percent clear.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:10.580]  You're born in the 70 years since this went on into the Gaza Strip.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.700]  You're raised by your mother.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.140]  You're told all this stuff.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:16.260]  And then your family gets 100 grand for you to go suicide bomb.
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:18.820]  I get they believe they're doing the right thing.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:25.260]  I'm saying it's a larger operation against humanity that's going on here.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:26.900]  Yeah, and I think you are right about that.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.820]  And I'm with you.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:33.220]  You know, I'm not I'm not for any of the suicide bombers or, you know, the terrorists,
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.340]  anything, anything like that.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.340]  All I'm saying is this.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:37.340]  Listen to me.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:42.540]  Look how the left is allied with this invasion and selling it is OK.
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:44.860]  I'm saying yet young against power out of it.
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:45.860]  The Israelis stood down.
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.260]  There should be an investigation.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:50.020]  Whoever did it should be impeached, fired, removed.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:54.340]  Biden needs to be removed for giving seven billion weapons, seven billion dollars.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.340]  That's the conservative number.
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:56.340]  Not debated.
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:00.860]  I know it's 80 plus billion, but the point is seven million Pentagon events for the subject
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:01.860]  of debate.
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:06.540]  Whether it's a billion or a hundred billion, it's obviously more than it's a lot.
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:10.540]  And then six billion to Iran a month ago, they did this.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:11.540]  Why did they do it?
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:13.580]  They knew Iran would do this.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.980]  So I'm talking 35000 foot view here.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.980]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.980]  That's what I'm at here.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:20.980]  All right.
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:21.980]  Next up, Brian in North Carolina.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:22.980]  Thanks for calling.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:23.980]  You're on the air.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:30.660]  Hey, Alex, thank you for everything I want to thank my wife for.
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:31.660]  Forget me.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.660]  The watch her show.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.660]  OK.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:39.740]  The reason why I'm called is member Obama in the plane's loads of money him and Obama
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.780]  and Biden brought to Iran.
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:47.220]  Yeah, they do it over and over again because they need somebody to fund destabilization.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:50.580]  The Iranians do it.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:56.420]  And the drone that just landed without a problem so they can take a look at it.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.140]  That just teed me off.
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:01.380]  That's all I got to say.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.020]  I hear you, brother, and it's very upsetting to watch all this happen.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.380]  Play the audio of the rave here.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:09.860]  Play it while the while the while Cobra flies in.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:10.860]  It's like right out of a G.I.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.860]  Joe show from the 1980s.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:19.620]  The Israelis are out there partying and stuff, having no idea they're like completely surrounded
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:23.160]  and a whole bunch of liberals have moved in.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.780]  They're saying like two thirds didn't have guns on the border with the Gaza Strip.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:32.580]  You live next to two plus million people want to kill you and you don't have a gun.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.300]  Like, oh, we're protected.
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.140]  No, you're not.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:44.340]  Look, they keep dancing as the shots are being fired and missiles at a distance.
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.460]  There's longer footage of this.
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:49.780]  It is crazy as they finally figure out a bunch of them got kidnapped, got killed.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:51.900]  I mean, this is just disgusting.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.900]  Carlos in Texas.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:54.940]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:55.940]  Alex.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.100]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.100]  I am from Bolivia.
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:04.660]  I was the first independent presidential candidate for the 2020 elections.
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:10.100]  And of course, the party of Gracia didn't allow me to do so, to participate.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:17.100]  But anyway, the thing is that Biden cannot win in 2024.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:19.180]  They have to rig the elections.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:20.380]  That's not going to be enough.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:24.780]  They're letting seven million people say we got to have a they got to have a big
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.820]  crisis to divert us.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:27.820]  And that's what we've been saying.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.820]  And here it is.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.820]  Right.
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:36.140]  And so since they're losing the war in Ukraine, they need to have a different war.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:42.700]  And Netanyahu is low in the polls, 60 percent are opposing him, as I think you stated
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:45.340]  that to the camera.
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:50.700]  So Netanyahu is going to use this and the Ayatollah pro-nuclear.
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.660]  I'm sure they have nuclear weapons now, too.
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:56.660]  They are low internally.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.060]  So everybody wants a war.
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.660]  And that's where we are going to.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:07.640]  We need to do something to stop this, this human side against people.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:15.860]  And I thank you for risking your life and being upfront, talking about all this.
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:16.860]  Thank you so much.
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:20.620]  I'm passing by San Marcos, maybe I'm going to be nousing at some point, but thank
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:21.620]  you so much.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.620]  Keep on doing it.
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:24.660]  The great job.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:25.660]  Well, no, thank you.
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.660]  You sound like a really interesting fellow.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.140]  I believe that you ran for president down in Bolivia.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140]  You have a website.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140]  You have a name.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.700]  I mean, is there a place where people can find you?
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.700]  Yeah.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:37.860]  My name is Carlos Aliaga Urria.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:46.100]  I am the first independent candidate that tried to run in the 2020 presidential elections
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:50.340]  in Bolivia without political parties, because from right and left.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.340]  Sure.
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:54.860]  I mean, do you have a Twitter account or do you have where people find you?
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:58.860]  Oh, I mean, I am in Facebook.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:45:59.860]  Let's see.
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:00.860]  Okay.
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:01.860]  I'll give you my notes.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.860]  I'll give you my email.
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:08.060]  No, my new email, but I appreciate you, brother.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:09.060]  Thanks for calling.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.060]  All right.
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:11.060]  Jay in Georgia.
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.060]  Jay, you're on the air.
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:13.060]  Go ahead.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.060]  Welcome.
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.060]  Alex Jones, man.
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:16.060]  God bless you, brother.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:20.260]  Listen, I could talk about the end time eschatology of what I see going on in Israel
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:25.540]  with Ezekiel 38 and Matthew 24, but I think from that 30,000 square foot view, what's
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:30.060]  really going on when, you know, you look at 9-11 and what did it bring to the United
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.060]  States?
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:33.540]  It brought forth the Patriot Act, which is what we see now.
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:38.000]  The full effect of that lockdown, that surveillance grid, you know, what they're, I believe
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.940]  they're using this as like a Pearl Harbor 2.0 and 9-11.
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.080]  And out of that, yes, there's biblical things that are taking place that we see, but they're
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.660]  going to use this chaos.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:53.940]  When Israel strikes back, Alex, they're going to use this chaos to then make all of Israel
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:58.940]  the enemy of the world, which is going to bring in them to talk about the Abraham Accords,
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:02.780]  the peace deals that Jared Kushner and all of them, you look at all of the African
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:06.960]  nations who are coming under bricks, but how are they going to bring that peace deal?
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.980]  So how are they going to bring that new Patriot Act at a global level?
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:15.880]  This is what the elite, I believe, are using for that very trigger in order to go ahead
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:21.760]  and pull the Abraham Accords, the Abraham House that's already been the Abu Dhabi,
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.600]  you know, the one-world religion.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.920]  And we could get into the end-time eschatology, but just from a real-time law, the only
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:33.820]  thing, Alex, that's ever kept Israel and the Palestinian state becoming, you know,
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:36.200]  that two-state solution has been the law.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.440]  Well, this would give them the opportunity through this chaos, through this unnecessary
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:46.920]  destruction, and we see all of the nations of the world coming against Israel.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:50.960]  They're going to bring in this Abraham, this new world peace deal, and this is what
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.480]  I think they're setting all this up for, brother.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.520]  I don't know what your thoughts are on that.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.240]  We certainly pray for Israel.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.420]  We need to pray for the Palestinian nation.
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:00.420]  We need to pray for America.
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:03.520]  This is a serious deal at the end of the day, but I believe...
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.200]  Well, you know the Antichrist tries over and over again, but I believe the Bible
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.960]  says there's been an Antichrist, but it's the one big one, I agree.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.560]  They're trying this, they're setting the pattern up now, whether this is it or whether it comes
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.720]  in 20 years or 100 years or five years or right now, we need to be ready for the
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.720]  return of Christ.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.720]  Thank you so much, Jay.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.080]  Let's talk to Bart in Florida.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.080]  Bart, you're on the air.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.080]  Go ahead.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.080]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.080]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.600]  I'm looking right at my screen right now.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:35.420]  I'm talking about weapons that were intended for Ukraine are being sold or shipped to Iran,
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:37.120]  which we know is the proxy state.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.120]  Oh, it's all confirmed.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:39.600]  It's U.S. weapons.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.600]  That's confirmed.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:47.600]  Yeah, and I'm smelling an attempt to put us into martial law under the War Powers Act.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.040]  Oh yeah, they get 10,000 Hezbollah and there's at least that much here in the U.S.
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.800]  to go out and kill a bunch of people.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.940]  We're in martial law, brother, and you know they'll use that martial law to disappear
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:56.940]  to you and I.
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:57.940]  I just showed the documents.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:00.280]  FBI says the main threat's the American people.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.280]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:06.840]  The last thing I have to say, if everybody could go to Bart Fine on Rumble and bitch
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.600]  you and even screw to thank you, Alex, it's been an honor.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.680]  God bless you, sir.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:13.680]  Next caller.
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:14.680]  Chris in North Carolina.
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:15.680]  You're on the air.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.680]  Hey, Alex.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:17.680]  Long time.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.680]  God bless you.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:28.360]  I just would like to know what Israel would think about doing when they find out after
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:35.520]  this war escalate that most of the weapons came from that Afghanistan withdrawal.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.520]  We now know that.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:42.200]  It's that Ukraine.
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:51.800]  And I think we should also just go straight to charges of treason against Biden for basically
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.440]  making a donation to it.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:56.100]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.520]  No one's saying this.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.880]  Biden must be impeached for giving tens of billions of dollars in the Afghan withdrawal
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:09.100]  and six billion last month to Asmala, to the Iranians that they admit are running this.
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:10.100]  They now admit it.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.000]  Wall Street Journal, you know, the Iranians are bragging.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  So there.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Boom.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.640]  Why did our government do that?
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.600]  Because they want this destabilization and they think we're so stupid, we won't know
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:22.600]  it's them.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:26.100]  And then when Hezbollah launches attacks, they might blame Trump supporters.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:28.000]  They might use Hezbollah groups to do stuff.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.720]  They'll claim they're Trump supporters.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.720]  No, definitely.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.720]  I'm telling you, it's on.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.560]  This is just another sign.
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:35.560]  We've gone over the edge, brother.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.560]  God bless you.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.560]  Appreciate your call.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.900]  We're moving quick to get to everybody as fast as we can.
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:40.900]  People I don't get to.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:44.280]  Owen Schroyer is coming in for two hours to take your calls and cover the news.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:47.320]  Sunday Night Live, 6 to 8 p.m. Central.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:51.080]  Eris Smith, 8 a.m. tomorrow with American Journal and Full words dot com.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:53.680]  For show myself, 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:54.680]  Big stuff this week.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.440]  I'm leaving it that I keep telling you big stuff this week and now this has happened.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.360]  Let's go to Droopy Drew in Oklahoma.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:02.520]  Thanks, Droopy Drew.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.520]  Thanks for calling.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:12.720]  Hey, AJ, long time first time I feel that all of this is a distraction.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:18.280]  You know, they lost in the Ukraine and now they're, you know, bringing this up
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:22.000]  and then everything happens over there a year before.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.720]  I agree that in the covid introduce Ukraine, Ukraine and NATO's loss.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:27.720]  Now they bring this in.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.440]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.360]  So everything is about to come here.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:38.720]  And I just want to let everybody know to get ready and, you know, be prepared.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:43.680]  And please, please trust in the Lord.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680]  I agree.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.680]  Let me say something.
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:49.800]  Six weeks ago, seven weeks ago, I gave you the intel they're planning new covid protocols,
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:53.160]  which they rolled out, but overall failed because we got ahead of it.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:57.580]  If we go to city council, go to state houses, call Congress, call C-SPAN tomorrow
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:59.380]  Get Republican leaders to talk about it.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:00.380]  Trump's already doing it.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:05.260]  To point out when there's terror attacks by Hezbollah and by Hamas, they let him in.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:08.160]  It's the globalists and Biden and the Democrats that are blamed.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.140]  They might back off activating those cells if we get ahead of this.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:15.300]  But we just sit here waiting for the obvious next attack.
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:18.780]  They're going to carry that out and use it for a police state here domestically.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:19.780]  Amen.
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:20.780]  Amen.
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:21.780]  I love you, brother.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.780]  I love you too, brother.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:24.780]  Thank you.
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:25.780]  Thank you.
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:28.820]  That's the big takeaway tonight, folks.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.820]  That's the big takeaway.
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.420]  It's not who's good and who's bad.
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:35.220]  It's the bigger picture of who's pulling this.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:37.020]  We're going to take a few final calls here.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:42.220]  I'm going to go ahead and talk about a sponsor that keeps us on air that are also great
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.220]  folks.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:47.060]  Now, I agreed to do this a year ago because they're listeners, they're patriots and they're
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.060]  amazing people.
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:52.600]  When they agreed to do it, one of these guys owns a major company and when he tried
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.780]  to do it, they shut it down.
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:55.580]  Then I said, let's just not do it.
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.260]  It took them a year to do this.
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:02.300]  It's very hard to break into this market and George Washington funded a third of their
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:08.100]  war with Sam Adams selling beer and whiskey.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:09.100]  Use responsibility.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.100]  You're an adult.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:11.100]  Whole nine yards.
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:17.340]  I don't always drink, but when I do, I drink Conspiracy Bourbon at conspiracyburbin.com.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.340]  Here it is.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:22.060]  I'll probably host a little with Owen coming up because this is such a hot show tonight.
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.060]  This is important.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.740]  Let me get a wider shot so people can see this, please.
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.540]  Let me take that down.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:28.540]  You see this?
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:33.020]  This is smooth Kentucky bourbon made in Kentucky.
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:36.700]  You put a black light on this, it's got secret messages on it.
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:38.480]  These will be collector's items.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:41.660]  They only produce 10,000 bottles of this.
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:42.980]  And I did it to fund the operation.
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:45.940]  I've had a lot of other big offers to do this.
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:47.940]  I didn't do it, but these guys are great.
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.380]  This is amazing.
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:52.100]  And this is just something you put on your shelf, you collect, you keep.
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.180]  I would bet my bottom dollar that this would be something that years from now you can sell
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:59.540]  for five, 10 times what you bought it for, but that's unprovable.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.880]  That's in the future.
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:08.420]  But conspiracyburbin.com, there are 10,000 bottles of this and this is a part of Americana.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:12.500]  It funds the operation conspiracyburbin.com.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:16.500]  It is super smooth, amazing Kentucky whiskey.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:21.060]  And it funds this operation conspiracyburbin.com.
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:23.940]  All hell is going to break loose.
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:28.820]  Rumors of this six months ago came out and they shut down our distributors, harassed
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.420]  everybody, tried to stop it.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:35.460]  I mean, and so I was just like, wow, because I said, yeah, you guys are great patriots.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.740]  You got great Kentucky whiskey.
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:38.660]  You're funding our operation.
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.140]  We'll do it.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.580]  They went through hell to get this done.
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.140]  So who knows if it'll even be back after the first 10,000 bottles?
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:50.020]  We may just cut bait after this, but the folks that invested in this are sponsors.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:52.020]  So we're going to get these 10,000 bottles out.
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:54.660]  These will probably go in a couple of days if I had to guess.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:56.100]  This is something really special.
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:56.980]  It's amazing.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:58.260]  You put a black light on this.
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:54:59.060]  I designed this.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:02.180]  It's got all these little patriot messages on it.
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:04.980]  We'll have some closer shots for you.
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:06.660]  Maybe you guys can zoom in.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:07.700]  Let's do a document cam shot.
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.460]  We got that here, but here is the overhead shot of this.
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.460]  And you put a black light on that.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:18.020]  It's got a lot of amazing information on a conspiracyburbin.com.
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:20.500]  You notice that's all supposedly blacked out redacted.
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:20.900]  It's not.
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:24.180]  This is something that is an incredible collector's item.
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:27.460]  This will probably go, I would guess in the next week, conservatively.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:33.780]  And I don't know what the attacks it's under if it seemed to have a license and sell this
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:38.020]  and deliver this in all 50 States is a Houdini operation.
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:40.100]  When they found out that we were involved.
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:42.580]  So if you want this, this is your chance.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:44.180]  They have it in their warehouse.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.500]  It's ready to ship anywhere in the United States.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:53.860]  If you want this one of a kind operation above Americana conspiracy, American bourbon,
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.780]  you can go to conspiracyburbin.com.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.460]  Can't get it in full war store.com.
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:01.300]  Can't get it anywhere else.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:07.140]  And obviously again, you've got Anheuser-Busch on the left and all the rest of it.
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:12.820]  So I don't always drink whiskey, but when I do, I drink conspiracy bourbon.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:15.140]  You know, that's a joke off of the whole Dos Equis thing.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.740]  So imagine if we connected the Liberty movement to this.
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:19.780]  He said, Oh, that's evil.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.500]  That's alcohol.
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:24.820]  Well, George Washington funded about a third or more of their operation with Sam Adams
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.100]  and with beer and whiskey.
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:29.540]  Most revolutionaries kidnap people and rob banks.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:30.820]  George Washington do that.
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:36.900]  He sold little American flags for the war effort and France and the US and everywhere.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:39.540]  And they sold whiskey and beer.
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:42.020]  So I'm following the example of George Washington.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:43.060]  Got a problem with it?
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:44.740]  That's just the way it is fine.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.900]  The point is, is that drink responsibly.
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.060]  It's really a smooth, amazing whiskey.
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:50.420]  I'm really proud of it.
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:53.220]  And it is a very special bottle and collector's item.
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:56.180]  Get your whiskey now at conspiracy.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:57.380]  Bourbon.com.
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:00.260]  And I would suspect they're going to all hell's going to break loose tomorrow.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:02.420]  This is going to shell out very, very quickly.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:06.660]  So if you want to make sure you get it now is the time at conspiracy.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:07.940]  Bourbon.com.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:08.260]  Okay.
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:11.620]  This is too important of a show tonight.
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.820]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:18.660]  So Owen will take second chair for the first 30 minutes, set him up right there.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:23.780]  And then after that, after we get to some calls to cover all this,
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:28.420]  we will, I will hit the eject button and make the jump at the hyperspace.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.140]  So I'm about to fly out tomorrow morning on a very important mission.
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:32.900]  You'll be hearing about the next 48 hours.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:36.820]  So a lot of big puzzle pieces moving right now.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.100]  The enemy's got their operations.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.220]  We've got our operations.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:40.580]  So please pray for us.
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:41.140]  Conspiracy.

[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:53.520]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.520]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.520]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?

[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:24.520]  This is my second book, part two of the great reset in the world for the world.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:27.520]  It's a longer book, quite frankly more powerful book.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:32.520]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to sense the number one right now.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.520]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists and it funds the Infowars.
