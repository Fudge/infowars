[00:40.080 --> 00:45.200]  Get ready for real talk radio. This radio transmission has always been about
[00:46.960 --> 00:50.800]  truly the original name of this radio show. It's also been called the final edition.
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.000]  Yeah, when I would do the last live show at a local station. Okay, we got Mark Dice with us.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.440]  This is Van Festo. We're going to have him back on. Get it at markdice.com.
[01:01.040 --> 01:06.960]  I want to shift into 9-11. Burmese, what do you think of Mr. Corsi and what do you think
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.680]  Mark Dice, what we just heard with him? It's throwing me under the bus. Oh, he's definitely
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.400]  throwing you under the bus a wee bit. But also, you know, I think Combs is throwing you under the
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.440]  bus. He also was contacted by you, has been on the show. And, you know, he's the little Democratic
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.920]  cheerleader there. They're a little sigh up on that end of the spectrum. And he just loves to
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.320]  use you to discredit people when in fact, Corsi, a couple of times just try to say, look, I'm looking
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.720]  at the physicist's evidence. And of course, he did have to back paddle and say, maybe there were
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.720]  some unanswered questions. But I'm saying that, you know, there's no way that the government
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.840]  helped cause 9-11. And by the way, Corsi says his publisher will quote, not let him come on the show.
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.320]  And he's under contract. Well, I mean, you got snubbed on Geraldo the other day and other Fox
[01:48.320 --> 01:51.680]  News. Yeah, they drove me down there, had me sit there. Well, that's why I've always refused to
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.400]  fly there. They're always trying to get me to fly to New York. Like at some Murdoch joke. And the
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.480]  last guy sent up there, the plane almost crashed. It was like dropping 2000 feet in thunderstorms.
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.960]  And I'm sure that's a coincidence. Of course it is. Yeah. You've probably got some new
[02:04.960 --> 02:10.640]  older person down there on the witches hat and the thing like, ah, Saruman, that'll get you, Jones.
[02:11.280 --> 02:16.560]  Anyways, it's crazy. Mark Dice, final comments. I want to announce, and I'll do this when I'm
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.080]  back on your show in a couple of weeks for, you know, 9-11, the anniversary is coming up here
[02:20.080 --> 02:23.840]  in about three weeks. And for those who can't make it to New York or who can't go out to a local
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.160]  rally or who just want to get involved, but don't know what to do, I want to just announce
[02:28.160 --> 02:35.200]  Operation Phone Mob. So I think on 9-11, it's a Thursday. Details will be posted at markdice.com.
[02:35.200 --> 02:38.880]  I'll email that out to everybody. I think that we need to get hundreds of people to call into
[02:38.880 --> 02:44.720]  the radio talk shows on that day. And let's get every single phone call to Geet to be one of us.
[02:45.280 --> 02:48.640]  Let's address the issues. Let's use this as an opportunity. What do you think of Corsi? I mean,
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.680]  this is becoming a big issue. You know, there was some cross talk there between him and Colm,
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.600]  but he said, I don't know if people made it out that he said he's never written anything in support
[02:57.600 --> 03:04.800]  of the 9-11 truth movement. So he's in a rough position, but again, he's got a lot of responsibility.
[03:04.800 --> 03:11.120]  He probably knows that he's the darling of the hardcore neocons. And then he's saying,
[03:11.120 --> 03:16.160]  he's looking at Evans of Inside Job, and they're saying he's delusional about the North American
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.040]  Union. You know what it is? It's almost like when Ron Paul was initially interviewed by
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.960]  student scholars and he said he would support a new investigation, although he didn't believe
[03:24.960 --> 03:28.880]  that it would really tell the truth. And then he'd even have to backpedal from that position
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.560]  when he got bigger. Well, of course, he was able to come on your show, talk about there,
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.400]  but now that he's a New York Times number one bestseller, and he's on all these shows,
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.640]  it's time to back off a bit because 9-11 truth is just still too hot for some people.
[03:41.280 --> 03:44.480]  Oh yeah, they all know. They all know every single one of them.
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.400]  His book's already a bestseller at this point. I think he has nothing to lose. He should just
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.680]  come out hard hitting and just state the facts. You know, I understand that his publisher is trying
[03:53.680 --> 03:59.200]  to backpedal and protect their financial net. I mean, he's always asking to come on the show
[03:59.200 --> 04:03.520]  because he knows my audience, with a few other shows, can push it up the New York Times bestseller
[04:03.520 --> 04:07.680]  list. And I think his book's important, and he's being attacked or saying it's disinfo.
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.520]  No, they're not attacking him on the book itself. They're attacking him on North American Union or
[04:13.520 --> 04:21.120]  9-11. And so that's another issue. Why aren't they attacking him on the issues the book covers,
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.440]  Bernie? Well, I mean, they got some of my new errors in there and they blow them out of proportion
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.520]  for the book. But like you said, they don't want to address the main stuff. I mean,
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.840]  he does get in the SPP right after the discussion about you on Hand of the Incombs,
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.760]  you know, securities and prosperity's partnership. So the guy's obviously very, very smart.
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.240]  He's very, very hip to what this movement's doing. I do hope he comes out a little stronger
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.440]  for 9-11 truth. I don't expect it. His words can't be taken back. That interview with you
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.560]  is monumental and should be played all over the place. I mean, let's be honest, without 9-11
[04:52.560 --> 04:55.360]  truth, we're never going to take this country back. They're going to keep staging more. Yeah.
[04:55.360 --> 04:59.360]  And he can vote for Chuck Baldwin all he wants. It's not going to help us. And
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.040]  Chuck Baldwin isn't admitted 9-11 truth, or he knows all about the new world order. So
[05:03.600 --> 05:07.520]  Oh, that's an excess point. Yeah, of course. Let's just go ahead and do it.
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.960]  Dr. Corsi denies 9-11 truth, but supports 9-11 truth candidate. Hey, Mark Dice, thanks for
[05:12.960 --> 05:16.880]  coming on with us. No problem. Good to have you. We'll have you back up in two weeks. We're going
[05:16.880 --> 05:22.960]  to have. There he goes. Great guy. Mark Dice, resistancemanifesto.com, markdice.com. My website
[05:22.960 --> 05:28.320]  is infowars.com. Burma's, this is Burmy.com. We'll be right back with Derek and the whole crew.
[05:29.760 --> 05:35.600]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here,
[05:35.600 --> 05:41.760]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[05:41.760 --> 05:49.920]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the
[05:49.920 --> 05:56.640]  18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum
[05:56.640 --> 06:02.000]  of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.080]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off,
[06:06.080 --> 06:12.000]  and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency
[06:12.000 --> 06:19.200]  transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it

[06:25.360 --> 06:28.000]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[06:28.000 --> 06:35.920]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine. Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of
[06:35.920 --> 06:41.760]  international communism was to have America become involved in free trade? Without tariffs
[06:41.760 --> 06:46.960]  on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete,
[06:46.960 --> 06:52.240]  would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico. This would throw
[06:52.240 --> 06:57.520]  millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America
[06:57.520 --> 07:02.240]  great. We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering

[07:30.640 --> 07:35.440]  factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you
[07:35.440 --> 07:41.600]  drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the
[07:41.600 --> 07:46.320]  most alkaline minerals and elements. This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength
[07:46.320 --> 07:52.320]  and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[07:52.320 --> 07:57.440]  while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy. With just 10 drops,
[07:57.440 --> 08:03.760]  you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10. Alkalizing water helps the body
[08:03.760 --> 08:09.040]  rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.160]  like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment. Order your bottle of

[08:30.240 --> 08:37.280]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. We have Professor
[08:37.280 --> 08:43.280]  Francis A. Boyle joining us in about five minutes. By the way, I'm on in Toronto tonight for an hour
[08:43.280 --> 08:45.760]  with Richard Serra. I'm going to plug that for the listeners. I want to hear that.
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.200]  Francis Boyle with huge anthrax news in two minus five minutes. Finishing up with Jason
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.080]  Burmes. There's new film Fabled Enemies coming out in 10 days. You can see it at prisonplanet.tv
[08:56.080 --> 09:03.440]  first. Pre-order the DVD now. Ship's out September 1st. Going to Shane Geiger, who I appreciate
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.480]  holding. Shane just popped by and said, can I say I'm an Info Wars freelance reporter. We said, sure.
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.800]  They called and checked with NIST that he really was going. They had their little meeting. He got
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.480]  his question out and they shut him down. Just giving some background to Shane Geiger. Tell
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.120]  listeners what happened, where this was, how you got the question in, and what happened.
[09:24.640 --> 09:27.360]  Hi Alex. Thanks so much for having me on the show. Oh, thank you.
[09:28.640 --> 09:36.560]  It's a pleasure. I was basically making some statements that were backed up. I mean, this is
[09:36.560 --> 09:44.880]  fact. I was just stating what had been in the Twin Towers report and then I stated some things
[09:44.880 --> 09:52.560]  about the back and forth between the Stephen Jones camp and NIST. Stephen Jones did a data
[09:52.560 --> 10:00.400]  quality assurance act request and NIST replied back in September of 2007 stating that they are unable
[10:00.400 --> 10:08.080]  to provide a full explanation of the total collapse and they also stated that they did not conduct
[10:08.080 --> 10:13.920]  tests for explosive residue. Yeah, they won't do mathematic equations. They'll just show us
[10:15.120 --> 10:22.000]  video computer composites that any 14-year-old with a case of hot pockets and jolt cola could make.
[10:23.040 --> 10:28.080]  Right, so this should sound very familiar to NIST because they were involved in the back and forth.
[10:28.080 --> 10:36.640]  And yet, this was at the point in my questioning where I was basically shut down. And I had a
[10:36.640 --> 10:41.600]  few other things I tried to get out after that. I'm very interested in the scientific method
[10:42.400 --> 10:50.400]  being applied to the research of all the 9-11 truthers and the other people who are looking at
[10:50.400 --> 10:53.200]  the location. Well, describe where this was, how you were able to get the sound. I mean,
[10:53.200 --> 11:00.080]  tell us the locale, tell us what it was like, tell us. You were there. Yeah, we were in this
[11:00.080 --> 11:07.360]  11-story nondescript building on the NIST campus. I'm glad it didn't collapse on us. It probably
[11:07.360 --> 11:10.320]  would have collapsed in about two or three seconds. Well, if somebody would have put a
[11:10.320 --> 11:17.600]  big line up against it, it would have jumped a steel column. Yeah, it was just kind of surreal.
[11:17.600 --> 11:25.920]  I was there among reporters from the AP, New York Times, Fox, the ZDF, which is the
[11:25.920 --> 11:32.160]  second station in Germany. I was actually talking after the event with somebody who's
[11:32.160 --> 11:38.960]  involved in the making of the third tower. So he's working with Mike Rudin of the BBC.
[11:39.840 --> 11:45.360]  So it got a lot of, it was really great to get some media contacts. Thanks so much for that,
[11:45.360 --> 11:54.800]  Alex. And I was just, I was surrounded by all these people who obviously have an
[11:54.800 --> 12:01.840]  axe to grind. These people were sort of in a standoffish and it was not really a friendly
[12:01.840 --> 12:08.560]  environment. In fact, I think it was somewhat telling that as soon as I started calling
[12:08.560 --> 12:16.240]  NIST on these bare assertions, the lights actually went out in the room. So it felt a
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.440]  little unfriendly from that second on. And the microphone started moving away from me.
[12:23.520 --> 12:29.120]  This was just totally ridiculous. I travel halfway across the country to ask questions.
[12:29.120 --> 12:35.280]  And I have to show up under the pretext of being a reporter when it's not enough to be a
[12:35.280 --> 12:39.920]  concerned U.S. citizen to show up here. Well, you are an important reporter and you did a great
[12:39.920 --> 12:44.240]  job. Now, Bermas, you've been analyzing this. You've seen what happened. They're also backing
[12:44.240 --> 12:47.680]  away from their lives. We have the video. The front of the building has some windows knocked
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.040]  out, but they say on their report, a third of the building knocked out on the front.
[12:52.480 --> 12:55.680]  Yeah, yeah, the south face of the building. And we have the videos where there's a few
[12:55.680 --> 13:00.080]  windows blown out, but we obviously see the guy walk into the building and then go up the escalator
[13:00.080 --> 13:04.160]  into the main lobby. So there's not, well, I believe what they said was a quarter of the building
[13:04.160 --> 13:08.240]  or somewhere between 10 and 12 stories scooped out of the building. Well, their new model
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.840]  has no scoop out and they don't. Oh, so no new lives for old. Yeah. Yeah. There's no scoop out.
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.880]  They don't even mention the quote unquote scoop out. So they've retracted that statement. Now,
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.120]  they're also saying it wasn't the fuel oil tanks. And they're also saying it's, it's unbelievable
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.280]  with this. Well, they're saying that although no other building has even come close to this kind
[13:29.280 --> 13:34.400]  of structural damage, I guess, from hundreds of degrees less than known fires, that's what
[13:34.400 --> 13:39.280]  they did. It was the thermal expansion of columns located near the center of the building.
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.400]  They're also claiming that that's why the rooftop, the line falls first. Okay. And then they say the
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.440]  facade falls with it. Now they say in the very beginning that they did test for explosives,
[13:49.440 --> 13:54.400]  but later in the press conference, they backtrack and Shane, I believe is the one that talked about
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.360]  this. And they backtracked and said, Oh, well, we never even consider thermite. It's just such a
[13:59.360 --> 14:04.800]  ludicrous hypothesis that we never tested for it. Of course, this guy's all happened to be top
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.800]  experts in explosive thermate. When no one else is, just so happens, they're top experts. Yeah.
[14:10.800 --> 14:15.440]  And, you know, remote metal is never addressed. It's not addressed in this. And now they're
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.960]  making it into a standards issue and saying that skyscrapers need to reevaluate how they've been
[14:20.960 --> 14:26.400]  built. Oh, it's a total lie. I mean, plus this thing had a special bunker built inside of it
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.400]  to withstand nuclear attacks, but it magically, you put a big lighter to it and just comply.
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.560]  You know, what's really upsetting is that again, this was New York's number one spookhouse located
[14:36.560 --> 14:42.240]  in the center of Manhattan, largest CIA base outside of Langley, Virginia, FBI, largest secret
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.440]  service office in the world. Armored bunker and the office of emergency management. But now the
[14:47.440 --> 14:52.000]  building has a small fire. It's falling. Well, the office of emergency management was also hooked
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.880]  into the Pentagon 24 seven. We show that in fabled enemies and it had blueprints of every
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.600]  single building in New York City and in fabled enemies. We show you how immediately after the
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.840]  building collapsed, the FBI set up teams with binoculars, watching the rescue workers to make
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.760]  sure they didn't take anything out of that building that was incriminating. Now, Jason,
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.760]  I want you to set up info wars reporter Shane Gager for 30 minutes tomorrow. You're sitting
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.480]  in for me as I get ready to go to Denver. We need to go to Professor Francis A Boyle here in just
[15:20.480 --> 15:26.240]  a moment. Do we have him? Okay, good. I don't want to make him hold anymore. We just got overbooked
[15:26.240 --> 15:30.560]  today and his information is so important. Shane, let me set you up because you went to this report
[15:31.120 --> 15:37.840]  for 30 minutes tomorrow at least with Jason. So let me have a tray and Jason right now call you
[15:37.840 --> 15:41.760]  and get that set up. Thank you, Jason Burmans for that information. Thank you. All right. This is
[15:41.760 --> 15:46.400]  a very, very serious issue. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. I was screwing around earlier here
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.000]  in the studio of Jason's about to leave town and been with us for five months. We're just having
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.120]  some fun. Very, very dark times, very, very serious things that we are dealing with here.
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.840]  Thank you, Shane Gager. We'll talk to you tomorrow. It was a pleasure, Alex. Thank you. You bet.
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.000]  Thank you. You can go through it all tomorrow with people. Okay, for the next 45 minutes,
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.280]  I am very honored. We're going to skip a few of the breaks for prisonplanet.tv viewers and
[16:07.280 --> 16:12.400]  info wars.com stream listeners because this is too important information and the time we have left.
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.400]  If I went over Professor Boyle's bio, it would take hours, but he's written international weapons,
[16:18.400 --> 16:23.920]  bio weapons conventions. He's been a top level analyst for the federal government in that capacity.
[16:24.960 --> 16:31.680]  It just goes on and on with his lengthy bio. And last time he was on with us, I guess about a year
[16:31.680 --> 16:36.240]  and a half ago, an article that Steve Watson wrote about it was published in scores of newspapers
[16:36.240 --> 16:41.600]  and one of the largest magazines in the country and some foreign newspapers as well dealing with
[16:41.600 --> 16:46.000]  the fact that he was saying the anthrax was an inside job. Now I've got my mother-in-law that
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.080]  doesn't even believe my show, calling up, thinking the government did it. Should we put on the list
[16:50.080 --> 16:56.480]  now, I'm sure. Now I've got just all over everyone saying it's complete bull, mainstream media saying
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.480]  it's complete bull. You look at the whole story. They grabbed this other, this other patch. He put
[17:00.480 --> 17:04.880]  him in the hospital murdering, clearly. Didn't say that he was always who they knew did it. While
[17:04.880 --> 17:10.000]  they persecuted Stephen Hatfield, we have this other guy, Dr. Phillip Zach, breaking in to the
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.480]  bio weapons lab when he didn't even work there, not getting in trouble, still at another bio weapons
[17:14.480 --> 17:19.760]  lab. It's the most weaponized US anthrax ever seen. The FBI destroys the original samples so that
[17:19.760 --> 17:26.800]  they can't be proven and so they can claim that this Dr. Ivan's cooked it up in his bathtub or in
[17:26.800 --> 17:32.240]  a basement. Just the miniaturization process takes over $100 million worth of equipment. It's the
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.440]  size of a gymnasium. It just goes on and on, but we have a bio weapons expert on with us.
[17:37.440 --> 17:40.560]  Sure, I know you don't like talking about yourself, but we're about to break. Well,
[17:41.120 --> 17:44.880]  give us some of your background, though, and your expertise on this and your bold stance
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.840]  a year and a half ago that's now being echoed by people at Fort Dietrich saying Ivan's couldn't
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.800]  have done this, then as the plot really thickens and as their cover up implodes.
[17:54.800 --> 18:05.040]  Right. Well, the day the technology on the dashel letter was revealed in the New York Times,
[18:06.000 --> 18:13.680]  I immediately called Marion Spike Bowman, who is a high level counter intelligence official
[18:13.680 --> 18:23.200]  at the FBI. And in fact, it turns out was also the person who spiked the FBI's warrant for the
[18:23.200 --> 18:29.840]  Masawi computer. But that's another issue. But before we go, tell folks who you are.
[18:30.960 --> 18:40.160]  Well, I'm getting to that. He knew me because I had drafted the United States biological weapons
[18:40.160 --> 18:48.720]  anti-terrorism act of 1989 that was passed unanimously by both houses of the United States
[18:48.720 --> 18:56.560]  Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr. That legislation was the U.S. domestic
[18:56.560 --> 19:03.680]  implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention. And Mr. Bowman and I had
[19:03.680 --> 19:10.480]  met each other at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School.
[19:10.480 --> 19:21.680]  In any event, I told Mr. Bowman, this was in October of 2001, that the only people who had the
[19:22.400 --> 19:30.800]  capability to do this would be those individuals working at either United States government labs
[19:30.800 --> 19:40.560]  or private contractors and things of this nature. And that it obviously seemed to me,
[19:40.560 --> 19:51.840]  this was U.S. government related. He took the information down and said he would pass it
[19:51.840 --> 19:58.320]  on to the appropriate people handling the investigation I hung up. And then it occurred
[19:58.320 --> 20:04.160]  to me that I had a complete list of who all these people were and what these labs were
[20:05.120 --> 20:09.200]  going back to my work on the getting the legislation through.
[20:09.200 --> 20:15.280]  Absolutely. We're going to skip this break for stations out there and then just come right back
[20:15.280 --> 20:20.800]  in to the main segment in four minutes with our guest, a really top bioweapons expert,
[20:20.800 --> 20:24.640]  helped write some of the major international treaties for the United States. Francis A.
[20:24.640 --> 20:30.000]  Boyle and we are continuing skipping this break.
[20:30.000 --> 20:36.240]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, Friday, August 29, 2008. Gold opened at $832 an ounce.
[20:36.240 --> 20:42.480]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $856.80, $422.20 for half ounce, and $211.10 for quarter
[20:42.480 --> 20:49.280]  ounce. That's $856.80, $422.20, and $211.10. 70% of China's one trillion reserves are in
[20:49.280 --> 20:53.680]  dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in Europe. Japanese
[20:53.680 --> 20:58.960]  refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen. Bad news for U.S. currency. China and Japan
[20:58.960 --> 21:04.000]  hold large positions in dollar. Trading equals permanent loss. Dollars fall into 65% of euro,
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.960]  erosion accelerates. Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S. loss of confidence causing
[21:08.960 --> 21:13.120]  more selling. GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control. Why attack Iran?
[21:13.120 --> 21:17.520]  Jerome O'Corsies, Iran leads attack against the U.S. dollar document spells it out.

[21:29.440 --> 21:35.280]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[21:35.280 --> 21:41.200]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[21:41.200 --> 21:45.920]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled
[21:45.920 --> 21:50.400]  Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[21:50.400 --> 21:55.200]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[21:55.200 --> 22:02.560]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[22:02.560 --> 22:08.080]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[22:08.080 --> 22:12.320]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[22:12.320 --> 22:18.960]  and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality,

[23:29.680 --> 23:36.000]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.720]  suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection? You may be one of millions of people
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.520]  suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your
[23:45.520 --> 23:51.200]  doctor would never know it. In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all
[23:51.200 --> 23:56.480]  cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis. Now you can fight internal parasites,
[23:56.480 --> 24:01.360]  heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized

[24:28.800 --> 24:39.760]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[25:00.400 --> 25:06.000]  Just had a bio, it's too long to go over, but he's written International Bio Weapons Conventions
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.400]  for the Federal Government Advice Congress, written by some of the biggest publications
[25:10.400 --> 25:17.120]  out there. The list just goes on and on. He's currently a member of the Nobel Prize
[25:18.160 --> 25:26.400]  for Governor George H. Ryan Committee. Okay, continuing, sir, with the FBI covering up this
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.200]  evidence, covering up the original aim strains, destroying them, then they find other samples
[25:31.200 --> 25:36.880]  that other people had that they gave them, they destroy it immediately. You're saying crimes,
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.760]  obstruction of justice, why are they covering it up? Well, then we have the White House on
[25:41.760 --> 25:46.240]  Cipro, the anthrax fighting antibiotic, weeks before the anthrax letter show up, admitting
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.680]  that arrogantly. We have political enemies of the Bushes getting it, they use it as a smoke screen to
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.640]  pass the Patriot Act, they're pressuring the FBI, now public ordering them to say al-Qaeda,
[25:56.640 --> 26:02.880]  Al-CIA did it. I mean, this is the most open and shut case ever for the federal government,
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.040]  criminal elements of it, launching the anthrax attack, then you have to cover up the Patsy's.
[26:07.680 --> 26:14.880]  I mean, break that down for us. Yeah, I think it's all clear. On the first weekend in November,
[26:14.880 --> 26:24.560]  I went out to Harvard where I was running a workshop on biological weapons and I publicly
[26:24.560 --> 26:31.440]  stated at the time that in my opinion, my professional opinion, it was either elements
[26:31.440 --> 26:35.680]  of the United States government itself or contractors working for the United States
[26:35.680 --> 26:43.120]  government that was behind the anthrax attack. And my colleague at the time, Professor Jonathan
[26:43.120 --> 26:52.560]  King of MIT, who's a microbiologist and runs their electron microscope lab, independently
[26:52.560 --> 27:00.800]  said the exact same thing I did. And I gave interviews on Fox and the BBC and Pacifica
[27:01.920 --> 27:10.960]  saying this the first week in November. So it's been very clear and the reason is that
[27:10.960 --> 27:22.000]  for the FBI cover-up, it would lead back to a secret covert, illegal, and criminal
[27:23.360 --> 27:30.080]  offensive biological weapons program involving anthrax. And I say it's criminal because I was
[27:30.080 --> 27:38.960]  the person who drafted the statute making it a crime. And that's what's going on here. That's why
[27:38.960 --> 27:46.800]  all the lying and covering it up all along. And they're still doing it today. If you read the
[27:48.080 --> 27:55.440]  investigation, the press conference they heard earlier this week, by the FBI, it does not add
[27:55.440 --> 28:02.000]  up at all. If you read the article in Today's New York Times, it doesn't add up. Indeed,
[28:02.000 --> 28:15.520]  it appears from Today's New York Times, the FBI, for example, then set the investigation up by
[28:15.520 --> 28:23.360]  scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing and could not communicate
[28:23.360 --> 28:30.000]  with anyone else and only communicated with the FBI and only looked at samples provided to them
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.200]  by the FBI and had to take on good faith from the FBI what the samples were. So you have the case
[28:37.200 --> 28:46.960]  where the FBI completely controlled, dominated the scientific investigation, including the timing.
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.120]  Well, Dr. Boyle, I want to go through that and as best we can be together,
[28:51.120 --> 28:56.640]  who exactly did it and why they did it. But when the mainline public on the street at coffee shops
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.880]  are saying, can you believe the government launched the anthrax attack, they're in trouble.
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.400]  I mean, the words out, the White House was on the drug that fights it. The words out,
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.720]  it went to their enemies. The words out, they set this last guy up. I mean, I think we have
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.160]  a crisis of confidence here. Do you think the FBI knows just how ridiculous they look right now?
[29:15.520 --> 29:22.880]  Well, Alex, I think the important issue to realize now is this. The FBI has been lying
[29:22.880 --> 29:32.560]  and covering up on this at least since the time I called Bowman. But there is today in existence
[29:32.560 --> 29:44.000]  a stockpile of super weapons grade anthrax that is under the control of the original perpetrators
[29:44.000 --> 29:55.600]  of the anthrax attacks of October 2001. And that stockpile can and will be used again
[29:56.960 --> 30:06.480]  when their masters decide that it would be politically convenient to scare and terrorize
[30:06.480 --> 30:09.840]  the American people. All right, we're going to skip this break, too. Hold on. I just want
[30:09.840 --> 30:14.000]  to station us to know that info wars.com listeners, we're going to continue everybody else. We'll be
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.640]  back in three minutes. Got to tune over to info wars.com. Here we go with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[30:19.760 --> 30:26.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:29.920 --> 30:34.720]  Now from the makers of loose change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes the

[33:40.480 --> 33:44.640]  experts for the federal government helped write some of the major bio weapons conventions
[33:45.360 --> 33:52.000]  internationally for the United States. Day one he tried to help with the investigation and found
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  out who was really behind it. These are hardcore killers and they'll do anything to scare you
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.200]  into submission after their little event they pulled off on 9-11. They weren't done. They
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.760]  launched their anthrax attack and they did their dark winter scenario a few years before that
[34:07.760 --> 34:14.800]  congressional funded drill of massive anthrax spraying in Texas, in Oklahoma, and martial
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.920]  law being declared. And you better believe, ladies and gentlemen, they got private contractors ready
[34:19.920 --> 34:24.560]  to spray it on your cities and then they'll grab some guy with a beard and put him on TV
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.760]  and say he did it. It might even be a hologram. I mean these guys are just, there's no end to what
[34:29.760 --> 34:37.360]  they'll do and Dr. Boyle is our guest. During the last, you just started calling for a congressional
[34:37.360 --> 34:42.400]  investigation. The country's being held hostage by the real terrorist. You've got the floor. I'd
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.240]  like you to talk more about that and then go back into evidence because it's so voluminous and
[34:46.240 --> 34:52.720]  anything else you'd like to talk about. Right. Well, we need hearings along the lines of what
[34:52.720 --> 34:59.840]  we had in the Watergate hearings under President Nixon where we have open public hearings
[35:00.720 --> 35:08.240]  by a joint committee of Congress because this attack was designed to shut Congress down
[35:08.800 --> 35:14.320]  and to which it did. It succeeded to the best of my knowledge at the first time in the history
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.720]  of our republic where Congress was actually shut down and rendered inoperative. The House
[35:21.360 --> 35:26.720]  went out of business. The Senate said it would stay in session, but with the House out of business,
[35:26.720 --> 35:36.000]  you can't do business. So this is a political crime of the first magnitude. The Supreme Court
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.480]  as well also shut down and the media were attacked, our Fourth Estate. Of course, the
[35:42.480 --> 35:48.880]  presidency and the executive branch was not attacked. I leave that to you to figure it out,
[35:48.880 --> 35:56.000]  but we do know the White House was on CIPRO. So that's really what we need and maybe if there
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.040]  are open public hearings by Congress, people put under oath with subpoena power, members of Congress
[36:03.040 --> 36:11.600]  then might feel some protection from further threats by the people currently under control
[36:11.600 --> 36:20.480]  of the anthrax. You also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have
[36:20.480 --> 36:30.960]  appeared since around the summer before these events when the New York Times revealed the
[36:30.960 --> 36:40.880]  existence of the covert anthrax weapons programs run by the CIA and Battelle. And that too is in
[36:40.880 --> 36:49.440]  the public record. The list keeps going. Ivan's is only the latest dead microbiologist. So you
[36:49.440 --> 36:57.360]  are correct. These culprits are playing for keeps. They are prepared to kill people. They've
[36:57.360 --> 37:02.720]  tried to kill people. I think they have killed people. Well, there's no doubt under PDD 51,
[37:02.720 --> 37:07.760]  the cognitive government system has taken over the government. Congress knows they were hit
[37:07.760 --> 37:12.240]  by a biological attack from the executive branch and the shadow government controlled by foreign
[37:12.240 --> 37:17.920]  agencies, foreign intelligence operations, British and Israeli predominantly. And they have now
[37:17.920 --> 37:24.960]  bullied the media and the Congress into full submission. They are hopping mad at the Russians
[37:24.960 --> 37:30.240]  for not submitting. God knows what they'll pull on them now. And we are to completely controlled
[37:30.240 --> 37:37.360]  by megalomaniacs who have limitless will, dark will to do God knows what. Mr. Boyle, I mean,
[37:37.360 --> 37:43.200]  I can't imagine a more nightmare scenario and it's so transparent because they want it to be
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.840]  transparent, don't they? Well, I think it's transparent for people who are really following
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.280]  what's going on and adding it up. But I don't think for the vast majority of the American people,
[37:55.280 --> 38:02.080]  I do think you are correct in your analysis that the presidential doctrine for continuity of
[38:02.080 --> 38:10.160]  government was put into effect on September 11th and it's still in operation today. And that we
[38:10.160 --> 38:16.400]  do have, in fact, the secret government that, you know, is really running things behind the
[38:16.400 --> 38:22.560]  scenes, probably Cheney is in charge of it. And so there are really two governments out there.
[38:23.440 --> 38:30.160]  And that can account for a lot of anomalies. For example, what happened at the Minut Air Force base
[38:30.160 --> 38:38.880]  with the nuclear cruise missiles, that decision to deploy those nuclear cruise missiles had to
[38:38.880 --> 38:46.320]  come directly from a chain of command. It was not a mistake. And with the continuity of government,
[38:46.320 --> 38:53.760]  then there are now two chains of command. So I think you can add up a lot of things by realizing
[38:53.760 --> 39:01.200]  that, you know, there's the open government and then there's the COG in operation, right?
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.720]  Professor Boyle, a lot of people that don't understand history or the way subterfuge works,
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.680]  they wonder why you're alive, why I'm alive, why so many others are alive, if this is all true.
[39:12.720 --> 39:15.920]  And I would just say it's because they don't want to validate what we've said. They don't want to
[39:15.920 --> 39:20.800]  put a lot underline our words. They don't want to highlight what we've said and done. But I do
[39:20.800 --> 39:24.400]  feel that the wings of death flapping about, I've been threatened, I've had all sorts of other stuff
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.640]  happened. A lot of other people have been killed, so it's not a joke to me, but I just think my
[39:28.640 --> 39:34.960]  lucky stars, thank God, every day, I'm still here. But I mean, what's your take on why other
[39:34.960 --> 39:40.080]  whistleblowers and other prominent people are still alive, if these guys are such murderers
[39:40.080 --> 39:48.000]  and such killers, why they haven't come after us? Well, Dr. Ivins is not alive. He joins the
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.640]  growing list of microbiologists who are now dead. I can't recall the last time I looked at that list,
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.800]  but it was somewhere in the area of 15 to 20 microbiologists that have died.
[40:00.800 --> 40:04.240]  It's a lot more than that. Yeah, maybe 20 or something like that.
[40:04.240 --> 40:10.800]  Well, if you look at it globally, it's like 20 in the US being shot in the back of the head,
[40:10.800 --> 40:13.840]  being tortured to death, being drowned. It's hundreds worldwide.
[40:13.840 --> 40:22.720]  Right. So, you know, they are, I think, disposing of people who, you know, directly know what's
[40:22.720 --> 40:32.560]  going on. I know Senator Wellstone disappeared, too. So, you know, I take it, the reason others
[40:32.560 --> 40:37.280]  are around is that they don't really care. They have all the leaders of power there.
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.760]  No, they're actually glad we're here saying they control the Congress and murder whoever
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.160]  they want. They enjoy it. And all the big gorillas that work in Army Intelligence think it's real
[40:46.160 --> 40:50.800]  funny. They love their cocaine money. They love their houses in Maui. They love Butcher in this
[40:50.800 --> 40:56.720]  country wide open. Good job, guys. Please continue, Dr. Boyle. Well, I don't, you know, I don't think
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.760]  they, they think we're very effective one way or the other. Otherwise, they would take us out. Sure.
[41:03.040 --> 41:06.880]  It's just so, and they're just looting everything. This is only one little area of crimes they're
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.960]  committing. I mean, I look at it, Dr. They are just raping the country, the world end to end.
[41:13.520 --> 41:19.680]  And then I just, I just can't believe we've gone this bad. Do you ever pinch yourself
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.680]  when you're seeing these type things happen? Well, you know, it could be the twilight of
[41:26.640 --> 41:34.160]  the American Republic. I hate to say that, you know, I've been a lawyer since January 10, 1977,
[41:34.160 --> 41:39.760]  taking an oath to uphold the constitutional laws of the United States as my father was before me.
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.920]  And it could be we're, we're at the end of the line here for democracy in America.
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.440]  That's right. You're a top constitutional law scholar as well. We just can't cover all of
[41:51.440 --> 41:57.280]  your illustrious background. Let's, let's go over more of the evidence, more areas with the curious
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.480]  case of Dr. Ivins. I mean, the media, you notice it was so hard to find that he died in government
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.960]  custody. And then supposedly he gets these pills while locked up when he was about to be released.
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.080]  And then this doctor that said he was crazy and sell these things, turns out is a literal PCP
[42:12.080 --> 42:17.840]  head who isn't even a doctor and is some kind of stuelly bird. I mean, it's just getting shottier
[42:17.840 --> 42:24.000]  and shottier. It is. I mean, if you just read any of the accounts, I mean, now surprisingly,
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.960]  you even have people in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal experts,
[42:30.960 --> 42:36.960]  microbiologists, former bio warfare people saying they don't believe Ivins did it.
[42:37.600 --> 42:46.080]  That's correct. That's how flimsy the cover up has become me. Again, just read today's New York
[42:46.080 --> 42:54.000]  Times. The more facts come out, the harder it comes to explain any of these things.
[42:55.440 --> 42:57.280]  Why did they rush out? I really don't know what to say.
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.840]  Why did they rush out and grabbed Ivins and killed him and then made the ridiculous story
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.000]  up about, oh, he's been our main suspect for four years when just a year ago they were saying the
[43:06.000 --> 43:12.320]  only suspect was Hatfield? I mean, is that a total contempt for the public's memory or what is that?
[43:14.320 --> 43:20.720]  Well, yeah, I think so. I don't know if Ivins was killed one way or the other,
[43:20.720 --> 43:29.600]  but they first blamed it on Hatfield knowing he wasn't responsible, but that could stall
[43:29.600 --> 43:35.040]  and delay everything for a long time and see if they could get Hatfield to crack up and he didn't.
[43:35.920 --> 43:42.960]  He fought back. Ivins, so then they moved to him and they got him to crack up and either,
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.840]  he was off by himself or we still don't know the circumstances one way or the other.
[43:49.840 --> 43:55.040]  So now they have a dead man and the dead man tells no tales, so they just pinned it on the
[43:55.040 --> 43:59.360]  dead man, the dead microbiologist. Yeah, it's easy. They have a dead defendant.
[44:00.320 --> 44:03.920]  Talking about the FBI, they've always been hooked in with the mafia since their conception,
[44:04.800 --> 44:10.320]  their prohibition being paid off. So from their zenith or really birth, I should say,
[44:10.320 --> 44:17.920]  from their genesis, they have been mobsters. Now, I mean, I've seen the FBI out on the streets
[44:17.920 --> 44:22.560]  and they're really scary people. I mean, do you think the average FBI agent really understands
[44:22.560 --> 44:29.520]  they're working for basically a Gestapo organization? Well, actually, a Mr. Swearingen
[44:29.520 --> 44:38.160]  who had been an FBI agent and retired and was decorated, wrote a book on the FBI and called
[44:38.160 --> 44:45.520]  it the American Gestapo repeatedly. He was a veteran FBI agent. I think that is correct.
[44:45.520 --> 44:52.800]  The last time we discussed the matter, I think I told you that two FBI agents,
[44:52.800 --> 44:58.480]  well, an agent for the FBI and another for the FBI, CIA Joint Terrorism Task Force,
[44:59.120 --> 45:05.840]  showed up at my office, interrogated me for an hour, tried to get me to become an informant on
[45:05.840 --> 45:13.840]  my Arab and Muslim clients, which would have violated their constitutional rights and my
[45:13.840 --> 45:20.320]  ethical obligations as an attorney. Of course, I refused to become an informant for the FBI,
[45:20.320 --> 45:26.480]  but I did tell them that I was trying to cooperate with the FBI on the anthrax investigation
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.760]  and told them of, you know, my phone calls there to Mr. Bowman to try to do something
[45:33.760 --> 45:42.880]  on the anthrax investigation. And then the FBI, CIA went out and put me on all the United States
[45:42.880 --> 45:47.760]  government's terrorist watchlists. Every one of them, my lawyer says there are five or six of them,
[45:47.760 --> 45:53.040]  and as far as he could figure out, I'm on all of them. So that gives you a pretty good idea of
[45:53.040 --> 46:02.000]  what's going on here, that one guy trying to help unravel the anthrax investigation gets put on the
[46:02.000 --> 46:08.320]  terrorist watchlist. Well, you know, I know it's all about power and who wins, but there's no doubt
[46:08.320 --> 46:13.280]  that I'm trying to defend this country, what's left of it. So are you. And you know, guys, we
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.160]  don't expect you to quit the FBI or even stand up for the country, but at least you can passively
[46:18.160 --> 46:23.200]  not join the evil. I mean, is it that much fun to destroy America? I mean, I don't understand the
[46:23.200 --> 46:29.280]  enjoyment. Where do they find these people? Well, there were, we have to remember there were some
[46:29.280 --> 46:35.840]  good solid FBI people there up in Minneapolis trying to get that warrant. But notice they're
[46:35.840 --> 46:41.120]  always off in a field office. I understand it's compartmentalized. Yeah. Right. But they tried,
[46:41.120 --> 46:45.840]  those in the field, Crowley and the rest of them tried very hard to get that warrant into
[46:45.840 --> 46:53.280]  Mussali's computer that very well could have unraveled 9-11. And that was killed by Marion
[46:53.280 --> 47:00.000]  Spike Bowman, who was the same guy I was dealing with in good faith. And then by the way, the FBI
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.280]  agents that blocked the anthrax and the 9-11 investigation even before, they all got record
[47:05.280 --> 47:14.320]  cash bonuses. And those that tried to stop the attacks, they got demoted. Right. The people who
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.640]  were in charge of the coverups on both 9-11 and the anthrax have all been promoted, which indicates
[47:20.640 --> 47:30.240]  they've done what their masters wanted them to do. And I think the reason why, you know, eventually
[47:30.240 --> 47:36.240]  if we can unravel who was behind the anthrax attacks, we're going to find out who really was
[47:36.240 --> 47:43.760]  behind 9-11. Well, I know you have a lot of, you know, they're so desperate to cover everything up
[47:43.760 --> 47:47.040]  and lie about it. I know you have a lot of gravitas, sir. So you'd like to be very careful
[47:47.040 --> 47:50.800]  of what you say. But do you think a person of interest needs to be looked at as this Philip
[47:50.800 --> 47:57.120]  Zach person or is he another red herring? I really don't know much about Mr. Zach,
[47:57.120 --> 48:01.680]  just what I've read in the public record, but certainly at the top of everyone's list
[48:02.800 --> 48:10.960]  should be Mr. Patrick, who did this type of work for the CIA, and Ken Alabek, who did this type of
[48:10.960 --> 48:18.000]  work for the Soviet Union. Indeed, Alabek has made statements in the public that are inconsistent
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.800]  and simply not true. Alabek was brought over here by the CIA, so he's on their payroll,
[48:24.800 --> 48:31.280]  and Patrick was on the payroll. So I would, you know, certainly identify them at the top of the
[48:31.280 --> 48:36.720]  list. That's right. Alabek wrote about and was over a accidental release, remember, in the Soviet
[48:36.720 --> 48:45.040]  Union on that, you know, was it the Khamchakya Peninsula? Right. Well, Spurt Loth, which is in
[48:45.040 --> 48:51.280]  Central Russia. But what was the other one? You have to understand that it's just not for Dietrich
[48:51.280 --> 48:58.560]  here that could have done this. The culture from what I can see came from Fort Dietrich, but again,
[48:59.200 --> 49:05.680]  assuming any of this information coming out is correct, 25% of it came from Fort Dietrich,
[49:05.680 --> 49:13.440]  and 75% of it came from the Dugway Proving Ground run by the Army and with the CIA and
[49:13.440 --> 49:22.480]  Betel working there. So my guess is that the culture itself came from Fort Dietrich, and then it
[49:22.480 --> 49:33.360]  was shipped out to Dugway to be weaponized. That is to turn it into a trillion spores program,
[49:33.360 --> 49:43.600]  the aerosolization, the etiquette on the silica covering, which involved nanotechnology,
[49:44.320 --> 49:51.600]  and then the electrostatic charges. How ridiculous is it? I believe it was weaponized
[49:51.600 --> 50:00.400]  at at Dugway. I don't believe it was weaponized at Fort Dietrich per se. How ridiculous is it
[50:00.400 --> 50:07.280]  for them to... So we have a team of people here working on this. It's not simply a question
[50:07.920 --> 50:14.640]  of one or two or three people. And that's why we have all these big top bio weapons scientists
[50:14.640 --> 50:22.960]  saying you're claiming that that Ivan's was able to make this in his basement, that he was able
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.040]  to get something and then weaponize it. They're saying that's ridiculous because they know what
[50:27.040 --> 50:32.400]  it takes, don't they? Sure, it's completely preposterous. Even Mr. Spurzel used to head up
[50:32.400 --> 50:41.120]  Fort Dietrich said it can't be done. I think both of these scientists involved in the investigation,
[50:42.480 --> 50:48.480]  like me, probably assume the FBI was dealing with them in good faith, but that simply isn't the case.
[50:48.480 --> 50:53.360]  Has this changed your view of the world working on this case, seeing this and seeing how the
[50:53.360 --> 51:00.080]  federal government's been behaving? No, not really. You know, I'm 58 years old. I've seen
[51:01.360 --> 51:09.040]  going back to the Kennedy assassination, the two Kennedy assassinations and the King assassination.
[51:09.760 --> 51:16.240]  This doesn't surprise me at all. I was just saying because you said that you thought the
[51:16.240 --> 51:19.920]  FBI would do something, but I guess you weren't thinking they were involved. We're going to skip
[51:19.920 --> 51:24.320]  this break too with our guest to be back in the final segment. The only place to listen to the
[51:24.320 --> 51:28.720]  behind the scenes is the infoawards.com stream. You've got to go over to the site and click on
[51:28.720 --> 51:35.280]  that stream. The day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[51:35.280 --> 51:41.600]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[51:41.600 --> 51:46.320]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled
[51:46.320 --> 51:51.360]  Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[51:51.360 --> 51:56.640]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[51:56.640 --> 52:03.760]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:03.760 --> 52:08.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:08.960 --> 52:13.200]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[52:13.200 --> 52:19.280]  much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infoawards.com or see it in super high quality,
[52:19.280 --> 52:25.680]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[52:25.680 --> 52:33.920]  terrorists. Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[52:33.920 --> 52:38.000]  Is a dismal growth rate or rampant inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.400]  savings accounts? Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out
[52:42.400 --> 52:46.480]  some or all of your hard earned savings? You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[52:46.480 --> 52:51.600]  Digital retirement accounts and most 401K's, 403B's, CEPs, and other retirement plans
[52:51.600 --> 52:55.600]  can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver. There are definitely
[52:55.600 --> 52:59.920]  some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.

[53:11.920 --> 53:16.480]  a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.

[53:21.120 --> 53:42.800]  the same. Call us today at 1-866-323-5665. Every week, thousands of violent crimes are committed.

[54:33.600 --> 54:38.880]  Dr. Francis Boyle has a book out on the anthrax attacks, a scholarly detailed book that everyone
[54:38.880 --> 54:44.320]  needs to get and get out to their friends and family. This is Life and Death. We don't expose
[54:44.320 --> 54:47.680]  these people, they're going to use terror attacks to completely overthrow the country
[54:47.680 --> 54:50.720]  and have a continuity of government system that even dominates Congress.
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.360]  Hell, Bush has even taken authority away from Homeland Security to himself. It's unprecedented
[54:57.360 --> 55:00.640]  at dark times and I don't take pleasure fighting these people. I know, I mean it is,
[55:01.360 --> 55:06.080]  and I don't even have fear. I just know, man, this is serious. I don't like messing with these
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.040]  people, but I have to. You can't give in to them. And Dr. Boyle, we just commend you.
[55:11.840 --> 55:18.080]  The old 5,000-year-old system of sacrificing pawns, going back to being invented in India,
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.880]  generals will sacrifice a thousand, 10,000, 20,000 troops to draw an enemy in over a ridge,
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.320]  thinking it's a larger force to then have their army behind the hill crush them,
[55:28.320 --> 55:33.120]  knowing it's going to kill their own force. In archery training, it's not just in the movie
[55:33.120 --> 55:38.080]  Braveheart, but it's historical cases of where different armies in Japan, in Europe,
[55:38.080 --> 55:44.960]  proper in Africa, the Egyptians would fire on their own troops to kill some of the other troops.
[55:44.960 --> 55:50.400]  That's an idea, collateral damage. And it's nothing to the war planners running our country
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.120]  for the big banks to mail out some anthrax and kill some people. It's nothing for them to kill
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.760]  kids now, to kill a million two Iraqis, as I said. And we better realize that what's done to the
[56:01.760 --> 56:07.360]  Iraqis will be done to us. You report yourself. Dr. Boyle, can you speak to that idea and then
[56:07.360 --> 56:15.200]  plug your book? Well, sure. I went to the University of Chicago with all these neo-conservatives.
[56:16.240 --> 56:23.440]  Wolfowitz was there, Chalabi, Kalilzda, Chosky, all the rest of them. They were getting their
[56:23.440 --> 56:29.920]  PhDs, and I was getting my undergraduate degree, later got my PhD from Harvard.
[56:29.920 --> 56:35.920]  I went through the exact same program that produced all these neo-cons, the political science
[56:35.920 --> 56:44.800]  department, Leo Strauss, the godfather of the neo-cons. His mentor and sponsor in Germany
[56:45.520 --> 56:54.480]  was Professor Karl Schmidt, who went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor of that
[56:54.480 --> 57:03.040]  benighted era and justified every hideous atrocity the Nazis inflicted on anyone, including the Jews.
[57:03.040 --> 57:09.600]  And now his grandchildren are Alberto Gonzalez and Attorney General, the current Attorney General,
[57:09.600 --> 57:18.000]  Mukasey, and John Yu. That's correct. We have to understand, Alex, that and they tried to train
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.480]  me to become one of these people. Don't you have the special PhD? They only get one a year
[57:22.480 --> 57:28.320]  from Harvard. Don't you have the Kissinger PhD? Yeah, I went through the same program that Kissinger
[57:28.320 --> 57:34.720]  did. Indeed, at the Center for International Affairs, they gave me Kissinger's old office. His
[57:34.720 --> 57:40.960]  file cabinets were sitting there when I moved in. But the point is, we have to understand these
[57:40.960 --> 57:51.520]  neo-conservatives, then, are in fact neo-Nazis. And this is a neo-Nazi mentality that has taken over
[57:51.520 --> 58:00.320]  our government. And these are the people making these decisions. And that then gets back to why
[58:00.880 --> 58:06.800]  they have no problem unleashing an anthrax attack on the American people in Congress. Indeed,
[58:06.800 --> 58:12.400]  they're anti-democratic. Professor Boyle, I can go into overdrive on this radio show, but I don't
[58:12.400 --> 58:18.160]  want to keep you, the show's over in one minute. But I want to extend the show for 10 minutes
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.640]  commercial-free, just for the internet screams, but that's hundreds of thousands listening on the
[58:22.640 --> 58:28.720]  internet and on tens of thousands that later spread out on video. Can you do 10 more minutes
[58:28.720 --> 58:33.440]  right now just so you can finish this statement? Sure. Okay, we're going to go into overdrive.
[58:33.440 --> 58:37.520]  I want to thank the Genesis Network and all the affiliates. If you go to infowars.com,
[58:37.520 --> 58:42.240]  only on those audio streams and prisonplanet.tv on the video, we're going to continue with an
[58:42.240 --> 58:48.880]  addendum, not just the anthrax attacks, but who they are, the mindset that allows them to engage
[58:48.880 --> 58:56.320]  in this type of behavior. And so again, you need to go to oneplace, infowars.com, to click on those
[58:56.320 --> 59:02.880]  streams right now with Dr. Boyle. Don't forget my new film, Fabled Enemies, that I produced,
[59:02.880 --> 59:07.920]  the Jason Bermas is directed. You can pre-order it now. It comes out in 10 days, infowars.com as
[59:07.920 --> 59:17.600]  well. Great job everybody. Stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:19.920 --> 59:24.880]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[59:24.880 --> 59:29.360]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.400]  New World Order? I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage. It was engineered by you,
[59:34.400 --> 59:41.680]  David Rockefeller, the collateral commission, the CAF. The day that we stop asking questions
[59:41.680 --> 59:46.320]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[59:46.320 --> 59:53.520]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job?
[59:54.960 --> 1:00:02.080]  How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason
[1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:07.440]  yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:12.720]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11. Please rise. Download the film at
[1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:18.560]  prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com. It's now time to take the revolution
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:34.480]  to the next level. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:44.160]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:50.960]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:54.960]  We've only got five minutes left, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, very thankful for him joining us today.
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:02.640]  With his analysis of what's happening. In closing, Dr. Roberts, two final questions. A,
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:11.040]  why are the neocons 5th and all of these guys crystal running around saying, you know, in Circle
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:15.120]  of Russia, Cheney called him and said there will be a response to this and basically threatened
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:20.560]  their president Sunday. That was in the Associated Press. His quotes were incredibly incendiary.
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:25.440]  They've launched a sneak attack on him and now they're acting like Russia caused all this.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:32.400]  A, it does look like they're delusional and engage in megalomania with all these little
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:37.200]  stunted nobodies. You've never even been in the military wanting to flex their muscles. A,
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:42.160]  and then B, where do you see this going now? How do you think this worked out for the US,
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:49.440]  NATO versus Russia? Well, I think probably we've scared our NATO allies to death if we're actually
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:56.880]  issuing these kinds of threats to a nuclear power who hasn't done anything except try to get along
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:05.520]  with us. So it may be unless we have actually purchased and blackmailed all the leaders of
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:11.920]  the European countries. It may mean that they don't want to be in NATO. It's too dangerous because
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:18.000]  it's run by insane people in Washington. That could be one fallout. The other fallout, well,
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:25.040]  it'll have to certainly wake up the Russians that trying to get along with us and cooperate
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:32.800]  with us. It just means they get stabbed in the back repeatedly. And so I would imagine we'll see
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:42.400]  a more aggressive stance on the part of the Russians. And since all of our European NATO
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:49.440]  allies are dependent on Russia for natural gas, they've got probably as much leverage
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:56.640]  over our allies as we do through blackmail and illegal payments to foreign to European leaders.
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:07.360]  So I think that because they are insane, the neoconservatives and Cheney, and because Bush
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:16.000]  is an imbecile, like Providence says, an imbecile, we are in risk of enormous, horrendous events
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:21.840]  that could essentially end life on earth. I think that...
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:28.080]  And call it the reign of the cockroach. That's right. That's what I called it when I wrote
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:35.760]  about it some time back. And I think that the American people have been just completely
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:44.640]  irresponsible and they've let this criminal regime get in office and stay there for essentially
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:51.840]  eight years, run Russia over their rights, their liberties, the Constitution, and other countries.
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:59.040]  I mean, Bush has destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan. The infrastructure is everything.
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:00.000]  Well, I was in a...
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:05.840]  Huge numbers of people. The man is... These are the greatest crimes the world has seen.
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:14.160]  It's an amazing criminal regime. And every time they open their mouth, they'll lie. We now have
[1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:23.680]  all the evidence of the lies everywhere. So I think there seem to be determined to propel us
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:26.720]  into some sort of major conflict.
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:29.760]  Well, it's like PNAC said, we have the power. We're going to use it.
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:39.920]  Yeah, but like you and I, I think greed, the estimates of the power they have is a great
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.880]  exaggeration. The United States just doesn't have the power that these people think it's got.
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:47.920]  Except for nukes, which they're menacing everyone with.
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:50.720]  Yeah, but the Russians have nukes. The Chinese have nukes.
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:51.600]  I know it's insane.
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:53.120]  The Israelis have nukes.
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:03.760]  What you have told me on this program about these behaviors is really frightening. This is actually
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:09.200]  what our so-called leaders are doing and saying. They're clearly insane.
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:12.000]  Clearly insane.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.680]  They've all been saying it. Well, as this develops, we'll talk to you again, Dr. Roberts. Thank you
[1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:16.400]  for all your time.
[1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:18.880]  All right, Alex. Good luck here.
[1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:22.880]  You too, my friend. Say hi to your family. Okay, we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarplin.
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:26.000]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.360]  Are the websites my new film, Truth Rising, is now available on DVD.
[1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:35.840]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:36.720]  this country.
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:40.960]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:41.760]  bin Laden.
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:42.800]  This is his MO.
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:46.080]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:50.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:53.280]  networks inside the United States.
[1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:58.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:05:59.520]  in and on the U.S.
[1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:03.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:09.120]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:13.360]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:14.080]  much more.
[1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:19.920]  Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with
[1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:22.960]  hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:29.760]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:17.440]  If the body has the proper nutrition, it will heal itself.
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:21.520]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:24.080]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:29.040]  Call 908-69-126-08 or go to hempusa.org today.
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:36.160]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:38.480]  already destroying millions of American families.
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:42.560]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:46.560]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:52.640]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:56.000]  that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:01.040]  Get on the web at eFoodsDirect.com and find a two month grab and go kit.
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:05.840]  This easy fix supply gives you two months worth of three great meals a day.
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:08.240]  The cost about five dollars a day.
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:14.960]  eFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:18.960]  groceries. Call 800-409-5633.
[1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:24.000]  The rest of the world is starving but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.120]  Call 800-409-5633.
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:34.720]  We interrupt this program with a special bulletin.
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.840]  America is now under martial law.
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:45.840]  All constitutional rights have been suspended.
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:55.440]  Stay in your home. Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:02.480]  Shut up. Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:09.360]  Stay in your home. Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp after work.
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:18.480]  Anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:29.200]  Remain calm. Do not panic. Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:38.560]  the morning. Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:48.080]  Stay in your home. Remain calm. The number one enemy of progress is questions.
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:54.400]  National security is more important than individual will.
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:04.560]  All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal. No more than two people may gather anywhere
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:10.880]  without permission. Use only the drug prescribed by your boss or supervisor.
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:14.320]  Shut up. Be happy.
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:22.800]  Obey all orders without question. The comfort you demanded is now mandatory. Be happy.
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:29.120]  Now, in England and many areas of the U.S., they do not allow more than groups of two to three people
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:33.600]  to gather. The martial law is being put into place. Most of your local departments have been
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:37.680]  covertly federalized. Your police have been corrupted. Your police chiefs have been covertly
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.800]  paid off. A few have gone public and talked about the attempted bribery by CIA Army Delta Force.
[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:48.320]  And I just wanted to briefly play the first part of the CNN piece again, where in a town,
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:51.520]  I'm guaranteed it is federal, folks. This is where they're getting the ideas,
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:54.720]  where they're getting the training. Oh, there's been a few shootings, so don't leave your house
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:00.800]  even during the day. Don't even be in your yard. Forget what Jellaby Opera joked about,
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:06.000]  you know, 15 years ago about don't leave your subdivision sectors. No, no, no, no.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.240]  And of course, under Homeland Security, it is neighborhood watch spying on you watching you.
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:15.440]  So here it is. Because of all the recent crime in Helena, West Helena, we're talking about robberies,
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:19.520]  home invasions, loitering, shootings. The mayor of Helena, West Helena,
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:24.560]  has decided to impose a curfew, but only in certain areas. And that applies for everyone,
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:28.800]  no matter the age and no matter the time. If you're caught violating curfew,
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:33.120]  there's a chance you could wind up behind bars. We're afraid that somebody's going to get seriously
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.520]  hurt by what was going on. This curfew is for all people. Everybody's subject to stopping
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:45.680]  investigation. It's almost akin to martial law. And that's exactly what some are calling it. For
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:50.800]  now, Second Street and several streets surrounding it will look just like this. And if you're caught
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:55.680]  outside without a good enough excuse, zero tolerance, they're going to jail. An idea that's
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:00.080]  fined by Martha Coleman. You never know where a bullet is going to go. All right, there we go.
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:04.400]  Stop it there. Now, where a bullet's going to go, like these magic bullets are flying around
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:08.640]  like the Kennedy assassination. I looked it up. There's been a couple murders the last few months
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:12.080]  there, drug dealers shooting each other, the government ships in the drugs to create the
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:17.360]  crisis to begin with. And they will selectively day or night decide if you're allowed to be out
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:21.520]  or you'll be taken into the FEMA camp. And they train your children going back for a decade,
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:25.200]  had a load on the bus during a FEMA drill. They don't tell the parents about it. They make them
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:30.560]  defecate staying in the classroom for eight hours in trash cans in front of everyone. No lunch is
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:36.240]  given to them under federal grants to quote, teach them what martial law is like. In 1998,
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  Swansboro happened up there. It also happened in the Hobbs Middle School in Pensacola. That happened
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:46.800]  in 1998. The Marines came in and said, put the kids against the wall with guns, wouldn't let them
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:51.040]  have food all day and said, the federal government wants you to know what martial law is like.
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:56.160]  And I've got those articles. I, of course, covered that back in 1998. This is going on everywhere.
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:00.320]  And it's incrementally training you how to live in a total police state.
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:05.200]  I was asked by an Austin police officer what I was doing in the mall yesterday.
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:08.720]  He walked over and said, Alex, what are you doing them? And what are you doing here? I
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:12.240]  spoke on the radio and I thought he was joking. I smiled at him. He kind of looked at me like,
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:18.880]  what are you doing here? I said, I'm buying a pair of sunglasses. So that's America,
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:24.160]  ladies and gentlemen. That's what things have turned into in this country. And they've built the
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:29.120]  FEMA emergency management centers, the fusion centers, the local emergency centers are really
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:35.280]  federal, moving the National Guard into them. This is the last decade plus a long curved operation.
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:40.000]  Doesn't matter what administration's in this, they use the neocons as fronts. There's a darker
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:45.040]  military industrial complex owned by the private banks above us. For the next hour and 45 minutes,
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:50.080]  we're joined by Webster Griffin Tarbley. I wanted to get his take on what happened in Russia and
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:54.960]  Georgia. I wanted to get his analysis of the ongoing political campaign. Now that looks like
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:58.320]  Hillary's going to be the running mate of Barack Obama. How can that be the woman and shining
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:03.920]  armor with the evil Barack Obama? It's all staged, folks. And I also want to get his take on the
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:09.200]  martial law. In fact, let's talk about this gearing up into the police state, this martial law being
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:14.720]  incrementally accelerated and ratcheted up here in the US. Webster, good to have you on. Hello,
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:19.280]  Alex. How are you? You bet. I should have. We're also carrying your new book, Obama, The Post,
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:24.160]  Modern Coup. We have a few left. The first edition is almost sold out. The second and about to come
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:28.800]  out, but we have it available at infowars.com. Webster, first, what you heard seeing in,
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:33.440]  you know, it's not just the point of the martial law in the town, but the fact that they're just
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:40.240]  announcing it like it's a good thing and normal on national news. I would recommend that we supplement
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:45.600]  awareness of everything that you've said, which of course is real and valid, with another dimension,
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:52.400]  which is not the top down police state dictatorial totalitarian dimension, but the fascist dimension.
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:58.480]  And this is fundamentally different. This is a grassroots, anti-authoritarian movement
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:07.680]  of goons, thugs, hooligans, and fervently idealistic students. A lot of them left liberals. Lemmings,
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:14.080]  zombies, Kool-Aid drinkers, Manson cultists, Hare Krishna's, whatever you want to call it.
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:21.920]  That is the Obama campaign. The history of fascism indicates that a point is reached where
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:29.840]  the army, well, first of all, where the police are not enough to quell a mass upsurge. The army
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:35.440]  cannot be relied on because the history of rulers is that you send in a division and it goes over
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:40.320]  to the revolutionary side. And you've got to bring in the youth brigade. You've got to give the petty
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:46.800]  masses petty power. And that's exactly, but my point is, is that we can blame this on Obama.
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:51.200]  I'm not saying he's good, Webster. The point is, going back at least 25 years, they've had a slow
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:56.960]  creep into getting citizens involved in the Tattletale squads, into the enforcement squads.
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:01.280]  Now they're co-opting the environmental movement to be their enforcement squads.
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:08.560]  We're absolutely right. My point is, you're saying Obama, Obama, and I agree he's the figurehead
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:14.960]  for a very, very long form of this, but going back to George Bush senior, Bill Clinton,
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:18.480]  they've been setting up, McCain's called for youth brigades now. Go ahead.
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:22.880]  I would just say that Obama is, if you look at the political landscape,
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:29.040]  there's only one political figure with a mass-based fascist movement. And that's Obama.
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:33.520]  McCain doesn't have one. Bush doesn't have one. It's a joke. Clinton doesn't have one.
[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:38.640]  No other Democrat has one. I've just spent the weekend at the Puma Convention here in Washington,
[1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:44.800]  D.C. This is the anti-Obama Democrats. And I think this is an extremely useful thing
[1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:49.360]  to fight Obama up to the time of the convention, to try to stop him at the convention,
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:55.040]  and if he gets the Democratic nomination, then to defeat him. I think this is a real distinction.
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:17:00.560]  History shows that there's a huge difference between just another bourgeois politician,
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:04.960]  no matter how bellicose, no matter how oppressive, no matter how corrupt,
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:11.520]  and something that gets you into fascism. With Obama, you've got something like a green core.
[1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:17.520]  You've got a Homeland Security core. And you've got Al Gore's famous green army.
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:22.080]  So the difference is one way the FBI comes and harasses you or the kinds of things you were
[1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:27.360]  talking about. The other side is a gang of goons and thugs come and burn you out and kill you
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:35.600]  or lynch you or whatever it is. And the idea is that the police state gets popular cover,
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:40.480]  anti-authoritarian or even left or radical cover, out of the fact that you've got these
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:46.640]  Obama bots that are in action. I heard stories from people who had been in the Texas Democratic
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:53.280]  caucuses, as well as the Iowa ones. The way that Obama won those caucuses is with intimidation,
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:58.800]  with threats, with locking the doors, with pushing people, beating them up in some cases,
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:04.800]  threatening to beat them up. And when you go to the internet, people who have been blogging against
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:10.880]  Obama report that they're getting massive cyber warfare, denial of service attacks, attempts to
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:14.960]  overwhelm their cell phones, and so on down the line. And then in Germany, they ordered the
[1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:20.640]  Germans to not allow any signs, pro or con, and the police did beat up people with signs
[1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:26.560]  that are under Obama's orders. Yes, right. And this is just amazing. So I would say,
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:31.760]  you basically have two classes of politicians. You have the old-style ones, however bad they are.
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:36.080]  Of course, they're very bad, as you're pointing out. But the bushes, the McCain's, the Clinton's,
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:41.760]  that's one thing. That's bad enough. But then when you get into the area of this scurrilous,
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:49.440]  gutter, snipe, thug, goon, and permanently idealistic student, a swarming adolescent,
[1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:54.560]  rent-a-mob, duper mob, then you've crossed a qualitative dividing line. The people who lived
[1:18:54.560 --> 1:19:00.720]  in Italy in 1922 or Germany 1933 kept saying, gee, we thought we were under fascism, but now
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:05.600]  we realize we weren't, and now we are, and this has been a tremendous deterioration,
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:11.120]  and now it's too late to roll it back because the genius of fascism, of course, is that it goes out
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:16.960]  and destroys the institutions that might resist the things that you're talking about. So far,
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:20.880]  not that many institutions have been crushed by the measures that you're talking about,
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:24.640]  but with Obama and the Green Corps, that will begin. Well, let's try to say the mainstream
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:31.440]  media, the corporates, have been behind him, so that's the big strike against him, and you are
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:38.720]  right in saying that he's the only one that gives any support to the government and the corrupt
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:45.360]  system, and I've heard mainstream pundits say that we need Obama to bring people back into
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:50.800]  government, back into trusting the state, into infusing it with new blood, and so he would
[1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:55.840]  give a new lease on life to the New World Order. They also say that right now they complain that
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:20:00.960]  Andrew Sullivan complained in the Atlantic Magazine last December in an issue with Obama on the cover
[1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:06.560]  that we can't have any false flags because nobody believes Bush, and if Bush tries to false flag,
[1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:11.840]  they'll think he's lying, or that he did it himself. We need Obama to refresh the credibility
[1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:18.080]  of false flags so we can have new ones. And then the White House said that Obama will be tested
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:23.280]  by, quote, an attack. Then he composes a savior when we're hit by a nuke or a bio weapon, and then
[1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:28.560]  be our new dictator, and after all, he's black, so blacks can do no wrong. Everything's going to be
[1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:33.600]  fine, Webster-Tarbles. On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:38.800]  enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.080]  cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:48.720]  line. Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:54.000]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.800]  be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron
[1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:04.080]  Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power. A gripping adventure

[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:50.400]  and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reining them in and bringing
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:55.680]  them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over. They are called
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:23:02.240]  Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:07.200]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.680]  centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of
[1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:16.560]  the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind. We will undo through the authority

[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:01.200]  All right, Webster. Let's keep going with Obama. I want to break down what elite is behind him.
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:05.600]  But I really want to get your expertise because you know a lot about Eastern Europe,
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:12.640]  Central Asia, the Caucasus. What we just saw in the last five days with the sneak attack
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:19.520]  by the Georgians, backed by NATO, the U.S. and the Israelis against the Russians and
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:25.440]  what's unfolding there. But continue with Barack Obama accelerating towards the convention where
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:32.160]  Herr Hillary is scheduled to be his running mate. I really doubt she'll be his running mate. I don't
[1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:38.160]  see much indication of that. Really, Bill Clinton is going to be introducing the VP? Well, I don't
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:45.680]  believe so. I think there's a profound hatred by the Wall Street groups themselves of Mrs. Clinton
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:50.960]  because they've put all their money into Obama. It's about a third of a billion dollars so far
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:56.240]  and they've been stabbing Clinton in the back. Clinton up until about December had seemed to be
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:00.960]  the candidate of Wall Street. But that turned out not to be the case. So what you've got now
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:08.240]  is the Rockefeller, Soros, Bilderberg, Trilateral, Rand Corporation, Council on Formulation,
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:17.600]  Skull and Bones, Chicago School Foundations, all of this aligning. You can hear the foundations,
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:21.680]  by the way, on National Public Radio. If you want to know what the foundations think,
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:28.880]  we have Foundation-funded oligarch radio, NPR and PBS on the TV. Whatever Bill Moyers does,
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:34.560]  he's the spokesman for this huge power of the family fondly that are now in constant
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:39.280]  in the foundations. So you're saying Bill Moyers is bad?
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:45.040]  Yes, absolutely. He was the spokesman for Johnson. He was selling the Vietnam War back then
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:51.200]  and he is, I think, one of the leading operatives of this Foundation universe, which is what has
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:58.960]  produced Obama. Obama is a racist provocateur, a race-bater or race-monger or, I would say,
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:04.240]  poverty pimp when Obama says he was a community organizer. What in the world
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:12.240]  does that mean? He was a race community organizer for the Gamaliel Foundation,
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:18.000]  which is funded by the Ford Foundation using Alinsky doctrines. What does that mean? It means
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.960]  that he's a counterinsurgent. He's a wrecker. He's a police agent sent into those communities
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:26.000]  to fragment them, to pit one group against another.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.040]  Well, I agree. Look at what the Great Society did. It basically destroyed, you had Black
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.080]  Hill legitimacy at 10 percent. Now it's over 90 percent. It's totally wrecked those communities
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:41.680]  and we know, going back to Margaret Sanger with the letters to the Colgate's and others,
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:46.160]  saying we've got to hire Blacks to go in so we can sterilize them and kill them.
[1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:50.640]  These Black weeds only trust other Blacks. So we've got to create a cadre of Foundation Blacks
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:56.240]  that serve us. Yeah, this is a factor I would however point to the great turning point in
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.200]  the United States history. The great U-turn is under Carter and the Carter, of course,
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:06.320]  is a trilateral puppet, selected by Brzezinski personally, approved by David Rockefeller.
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:09.840]  A similar operation to what we have today. Jimmy, who comes out of nowhere.
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:12.640]  Why did they destroy him then? I mean, I don't think Carter himself's bad.
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:18.240]  Carter is bad, yes. Carter, we look at those speeches. Go back and look at the Maledi speech.
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:23.680]  Go back and look at Carter's rage at the American people, saying the energy crisis is real
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:28.400]  and you better believe it. Now, this is also very interesting in terms of trilateral mentality.
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:36.720]  Carter's famous Maledi speech, The Crisis of Spirit of July 1979, is essentially an incompetent,
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:43.920]  failed president, blaming the American people for the fact that we have an incompetent ruling elite.
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:49.840]  The Wall Street ruling class is incompetent. They're incapable of governing. They have destroyed
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:55.520]  the greatest economic power in the world. And this is precisely the point. Under Carter,
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:02.560]  you have Brzezinski running this lunatic, adventurous, anti-Soviet, pro-Islamic fundamentalist
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:07.040]  foreign policy featuring Khomeini. That's one side. The other side, of course, is Paul Adolf
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:13.200]  Volker at the Federal Reserve with a 22% prime rate, the highest in American history, at least
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:18.800]  recent history. And of course, for most of us, 22% is the prime rate. We don't get that. We get
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:24.640]  30% or 35%. And this is, of course, when the racket of credit card usually began.
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:30.240]  And it is when the United States began to deindustrialize, the factories that could not
[1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:36.080]  be destroyed by Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Stalin, and Mao were destroyed by Volker.
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:41.120]  That's the only deindustrialization for control of the population, neocertum.
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:48.320]  And the idea of a low wage economy, union busting, the labor movement in full retreat.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:53.360]  But all covered with an envelope, all covered with an envelope of liberalism.
[1:29:53.360 --> 1:29:59.600]  And left cover. This is exactly it. Under environmentalism, the limits of growth,
[1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:05.520]  the era of scarcity, and, of course, in foreign policy, human rights and humanitarian concerns.
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:08.880]  Let's stay there. I totally agree with you on the analysis and we want to get all your
[1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:13.760]  perspectives on it. Let's explain to people this whole Malthusian, social Darwinistic
[1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:18.560]  world system and how it controls both the left and the right and break that down.
[1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:26.880]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:36.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:41.120]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:46.320]  Ben Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben Laden.
[1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:50.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:55.360]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[1:30:55.360 --> 1:31:02.160]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:07.840]  citizens have been detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:12.080]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:17.840]  the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com

[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:39.520]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more? Even fragrance
[1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:44.560]  can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients. Most of which are synthetic. Hi,

[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:48.080]  the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude. People can be made to
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:54.960]  enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:56.960]  Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:02.480]  Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:16.960]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse. A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools. They
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:19.360]  don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:26.800]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:31.760]  Pediatric. These new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually be
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:36.400]  associated with improved behavior and mental performance. Fluoride in water is supposed to
[1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:42.640]  fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer? For now the government have the right under U.S.
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:47.280]  law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition. We have to
[1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:53.280]  work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows. Any attempt to achieve world order
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:58.960]  must be the work of the devil. Well join me and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:08.960]  That's the need for new world order. Sunday in the next few years. A solution will emerge.
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:54.720]  He's got the new Barack Obama the postmodern coup available at info wars.com or by calling toll
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:36:03.920]  free 888-253-3139. I'm going to turn the mic off here and give you the floor. I think we should
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:08.720]  start at the beginning here about where this new world order comes from. Who they really are
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:13.120]  so people don't get confused by all the left cover, right cover to bring us up to today
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.480]  with Barack Obama. Who I agree with you is probably the biggest threat to liberty only
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:22.880]  because of the figurehead and the cover he gives them. Not that he actually runs anything or not
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:27.040]  that I'm saying McCain's a good guy. So start at the beginning if you can.
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:34.720]  And because of the fascist mass movement or again reasonable facsimile of a fascist mass
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:40.800]  movement which Obama has been able to mobilize and no other. This is the qualitative distinction.
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:47.120]  This is why Obama is far and away the worst possible outcome and needs to be opposed
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:52.640]  in any possible way. I wouldn't call it the new world order. I call it Anglo-American world empire.
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:58.000]  U.S.-British world domination. This is what it is. There are of course-
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:03.120]  But it rose by any other name Webster. I've been erupt here. That's what they call it.
[1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:09.120]  It's branded as that. So yes, world empire run by the Anglo-American power axis is the
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:12.320]  proper term. But I mean, new world order is what it's known as.
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:17.600]  Well, again, let me call it Anglo-American world empire because I think it gets the idea.
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.320]  There are of course others that are allied with it. The European Union, the Eurogarchs,
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:27.520]  are largely submissive to this. Russia is not submissive. I think it makes no sense at all
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:32.960]  to say Putin and Medvedev now are figures of the new world order. They are not. They are opponents
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:39.760]  as much as they can be of this Anglo-American world empire. China is in a somewhat more
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:45.840]  ambiguous position in terms of what you see. But we have reliable reports that underneath it,
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:52.560]  the Chinese are even more hostile to the continued Anglo-American world domination and
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:58.640]  they're biding their time. So I regard these two countries as allies. I welcome the existence of
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:06.000]  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which has posed a counterweight to the U.S. and the British.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.800]  I would say without Putin, we would have had a police state here already because it is the
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:16.720]  existence of this international opposition that prevents the Wall Street group from imposing
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:22.240]  what they want here. The problem you have right now, the strategic constellation that Obama comes
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:29.280]  out of, is that we've had the incompetent and disastrous administration of Bush Cheney and
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:35.600]  the Neocons. Now, their approach is the world is focused on the Middle East. Everything revolves
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:39.840]  around Israel. You've got to destroy the leading Arab state. You've got to destroy the leading
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:48.480]  Islamic state. I guess Iraq and Iran. You've got to go into Afghanistan primarily on an anti-Islamic
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:53.760]  mission. There's a... the Brzezinski would say, do go there, but not for that. And therefore,
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:39:01.280]  this has been played out now under the bankrupt and idiotic mythology of 9-11, which you've
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:08.000]  done so much to expose. And some of the rest of us have also tried to do this. The thing is,
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:13.040]  you're getting to the point of diminishing returns with that. It is simply impossible to keep going
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:19.040]  with the 9-11, Islamophagism, bin Laden, al-Qaeda, war on terror. There's even this report from the
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:25.120]  Rand Corporation where Brzezinski is a bigwig saying that the war on terror is now counterproductive.
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:30.320]  Forget this. You need something new. Now, here's an interesting case. Normally,
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:35.200]  when people talk about the Hegelian dialectic in politics, I think this is much overstated.
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:40.400]  The British are really not students of Hegel there. Students of the Venetians, it's very crude,
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:45.920]  divide and conquer. But now, with Brzezinski, there is a Hegelian element. Brzezinski is the
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:51.920]  student of a guy called Karl Friedrich, who was a professor trained in Germany. He wrote a book
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:58.640]  about the 17th century, The Age of the Baroque, and with Brzezinski co-authored some books about
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:04.800]  totalitarianism, targeting, of course, the Soviets, anti-Russian. He is a student of
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:12.720]  Alfred Weber. Alfred Weber is the younger brother of Max Weber. Max Weber, the German
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:20.000]  sociologist from about 1890 to 1920. He was extremely influential. The guy wrote books
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:26.560]  about the Protestant ethic and all kinds of other things. In Alfred Weber, there is a strong
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:33.120]  Hegelian philosophy of history element. The idea simply is, you cannot be Johnny OneNote.
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:39.440]  You cannot do your operations always under right-wing, militaristic, top-down cover.
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:45.520]  You've got to modulate that, and we're now in the middle of a modulation. Carter was a similar
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:52.240]  phase. Carter dropped the usual Cold War stuff, but he continued it in the more ferocious form
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:57.280]  under the guise of human rights, humanitarianism, and interfering in the internal affairs of
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:03.920]  countries. Carter was also on a worldwide vendetta to shut down peaceful nuclear energy development,
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.320]  but under left cover. Not saying we want you to be puppets of our empire,
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:15.200]  but saying we don't like nuclear energy. We reach a point by about 2006, 2007,
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:21.440]  where the Anglo-American ruling class says, Bush and Cheney are crazy. The neocons are bankrupt.
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:26.720]  We're not getting anywhere. We cannot have the U.S., the British, and the Israelis at war with
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:32.320]  the world forever. It doesn't work. We're too bankrupt. We're too isolated. Our armies are
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:38.560]  defeated and demoralized. Our populations are extremely rested. We've got a possible mass upsurge
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:44.480]  around impeachment and anti-Bush, anti-Cheney, and the war, and all this. So basically they say,
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:51.040]  let's repeat the Carter operation. They had been grooming Obama, in my view, since about 1981
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:56.960]  to 1983, when Obama and Brzezinski were together on the campus of Columbia University,
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:03.600]  Morningside Heights in Manhattan, and recruited them, as far as I can see. I would hope that
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:08.800]  you know that Obama would comment on this, if he doesn't like this particular view of his
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:15.600]  background. But he's one of a series of controlled assets. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts,
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:21.200]  who spouts the self-same rhetoric, is another one. And there are undoubtedly other options,
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:26.480]  not all black, to be sure. Others, you know, Southern governors or Northern
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:32.240]  gritty populists or whatever, but all controlled by this trilateral commission.
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:38.960]  So now the idea is that basically twofold. If you're going to continue Anglo-American
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:44.800]  world domination, the U.S., U.K., world empire, you've got to deal with the fact that you've
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:49.680]  got this Shanghai cooperation organization, Russia-China. Russia, of course, the greatest
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:55.040]  military power and a tremendous energy power. The Chinese, the greatest demographic power
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:00.960]  in terms of people, and the highest rates of economic development. The Shanghai cooperation
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:06.800]  organization is a magnet. It's the counterpoll. Anybody who doesn't like the Anglo-Americans,
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:11.040]  for example, especially in Africa, if you're an African state, you have the International
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:16.480]  Monetary Fund and the World Bank trying to crush you, destroy you, loot you. The Chinese come
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:21.920]  along and say, let's make deals 50-50. It's not humanitarianism, but it's business, and it's
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:26.720]  much better to have an alternative, right, as it was possible during the Cold War.
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:31.840]  So Brzezinski basically says, we've got to crush Russia and China. How do you do that?
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:36.960]  Well, it goes like this. First, kick the Chinese out of Africa. That's why you've got the U.S.
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:43.360]  African Command. You've got the destabilization of Kenya by Obama's cousin, Odinga, who is the,
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:49.760]  I call him the killer, Luo. He's the necklaceer of Kenya. The Luo, by the way, with the Luo,
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:56.240]  it's a little bit like the Kurds. You can destabilize Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda,
[1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:02.880]  and Congo. You can destabilize five countries using these Luo's that Obama happens to represent.
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:07.840]  So you've got to kick the Chinese out. The interest in Zimbabwe is, of course,
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.000]  that's where the Chinese get their minerals. So the U.S. and the British say, oh,
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:17.440]  it's a humanitarian emergency. Mugabe is a bad man. Let's get rid of him. Real reason,
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:23.040]  Chinese minerals. Sudan, the best example, the biggest country in Africa. That's about 7% of
[1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:29.600]  the Chinese oil. Therefore, the Anglo-Americans gin up this Darfur crisis, which is real, but not
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:34.800]  created by the Sudanese government. It's partly a feature of the world oil price and starvation,
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:40.160]  and so forth going on there. The first phase, therefore, is try to destroy every Chinese
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:47.520]  ally you can in Africa, kick the Chinese out, cut off the oil and the minerals, destroy places like
[1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:54.560]  Burma, Chinese ally, and destroy Pakistan, carve Pakistan into four to five pieces. Even though
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:45:01.120]  the current government of Pakistan is Anglo-American puppets, the conducting of the Afghan war
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:07.200]  is now only targeting, really, Pakistan, bombing Pakistan, humiliating the government,
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:13.200]  and preparing the breakup of that country. Why? It is a natural ally of China against India,
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:19.200]  always has been, and it's important commercial partner. The end game is, once you've got China
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:26.000]  stripped of allies and isolated. Brzezinski says to the Chinese, look, you want oil, you want minerals,
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:32.080]  go and get them in Siberia. Go to war with Russia, invade Siberia, and you can get everything you
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:38.000]  want. Siberia has lots of minerals, lots of oil, very few Russians. Let's have World War 3. Now,
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:44.320]  it means, therefore, play China against Russia, destroy them both, get rid of them both, and the
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:50.000]  U.S. and the British can have another 100 years of world domination. This is exactly the same
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:57.680]  project we had with Lady Astor, Lord Astor, the Cleveland set in Britain. It's the great game
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:03.360]  of divide and conquer, simply put. Lord Lothian, Lord Halifax, Lord Brand, Prescott Bush,
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.080]  John Foster Dulles, Lord Montague Norman of the Bank of England, Sir Henry Deterdinger,
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:13.120]  Royal Dutch Shell, and they basically said, we'll call this appeasement, but it's not appeasement,
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:18.640]  it's war. Let's build up Hitler and we'll point him east. We'll encourage him to go here.
[1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:21.120]  And that's all on record with Lord Milner and the Milner group.
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:27.360]  Oh, absolutely. That's exactly it. The Milner group is the Cleveland set. That's a different name
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:32.960]  for it in the later phase. And this is Carol Quigley and many others, right? He was a historian for
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:38.080]  the British Round Table group. Yeah, but he does tell you the story, and he presents it as bad,
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:43.920]  because of course it didn't work. So their idea is play Hitler against Stalin and get rid of both
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:49.200]  of them that way. And we can have another hundred years of the British Empire. Now, it didn't work
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:54.080]  because, of course, you get Hitler making the Hitler-Stalin pact and then turning west and
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:59.920]  destroying the French and the Scandinavians and the low countries and so forth. And the British
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:04.240]  kept themselves into a fix. They're going to be destroyed unless the US comes to save them.
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:09.840]  So that's one of the reasons that Winston Churchill was the main beneficiary of Pearl Harbor,
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:14.400]  and I believe did the most to make sure that this was a surprise attack. Yeah, but then you see
[1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:20.640]  Tarberly, I agree with all this analysis, but then you throw in that Roosevelt was a good guy when
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:28.000]  we know he put in the oil embargoes. And let me just throw this out, though, and then get your take
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:35.920]  on it. You have Roosevelt putting the oil embargo on the Japanese. Right. You have a Roosevelt
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:43.760]  intensifying military action through the groups they'd set up after the Boxer Rebellion into the
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:50.640]  Flying Tigers to engage militarily the Japanese US-trained forces and even US pilots, quote,
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:59.280]  as contractors, start engaging and start shooting down Japanese bombers, Japanese officers.
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:03.600]  They start attacking Japanese airfields. So for those who don't know, the US threw
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:11.200]  basically the Halliburton or the Blackwater of the day attacked in Southern China and in
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:16.880]  surrounding areas, Japanese forces. Then, of course, a week before they get the codes,
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:20.960]  they know they're about to launch the attack. The British know, wait a minute, the British
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:26.400]  know the US does not know. This is the point. The British have... Oh, really? Is that why the four
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:31.520]  submarines attacked Pearl Harbor and they were ordered to still stand down? The Japanese Naval
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:37.280]  Code, JN-28, had been broken by the British. The purple code, the diplomatic code had been
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:42.960]  broken by the US. So the US knew an attack was probably imminent, but not where or when...
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:48.240]  The Honolulu advertiser, Webster, ran a headline a week before saying the Japanese will attack
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:52.960]  Pearl Harbor on December 7th. Yeah, and then that's... Our military didn't know though. Here's the
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:58.320]  problem, Tarpley. I wonder why the commanders didn't send out some picket boats, you know,
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:03.760]  some trawlers. Listen, stop, stop, stop. Just for a second, Tarpley. I totally... Look, I know
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:07.600]  you're a great historian, smart guy. That's why we have you here. That's why I sell your books. I like
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:14.720]  you. But I'm really trying to get down to fundamentals here because you have this historical
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:20.480]  perspective that Roosevelt's a great guy, and we do have on one end the Bush Nazi Milner angle
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:26.080]  trying to overthrow him as they brought Hitler to power right around the same time in 35, 36
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:31.040]  here in the United States. So there's truth to what you're saying, but there's a subtler, just
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:35.520]  like you said, left cover. The same interests were also hedging their bets with Roosevelt.
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:39.120]  And so this whole thing about Roosevelt being a good guy, I just don't buy into it.
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:44.800]  Remember that the relation of the Morgan group to Roosevelt is that they tried to kill him
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.760]  in Miami before he was inaugurated. They tried to organize a coup against him
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:56.160]  in the form of the Morgan coup, the Mussolini style march on Washington, this medley butler,
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:00.720]  revelations, and so forth, the Dick Stein committee. And according to Eliot Roosevelt,
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:06.480]  the Churchill gang poisoned Roosevelt and killed him so that the British could launch the Cold War
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:11.760]  in the wake of this. Just on the Japanese question, the argument that you make depends on the idea
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:17.120]  that the Japanese are a benign power. The Japanese are not saying they're a benign power. I'm not
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:21.280]  saying they're a benign power. I'm saying they were, but that's what brought the U.S. into the war.
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:27.360]  That's what I brought up, Japan, was the British screaming for help. And now the U.S. comes in
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:34.880]  after the Pearl Harbor attack. I'm saying there was total coordination between the Anglo-American
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:40.880]  establishment, the British, and the U.S. government through Roosevelt, bringing the Imperial Japanese
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:47.520]  into that. I recommend the book by Russ Bridger and Nave, which explains this question of the codes,
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:53.840]  that the British had broken the Japanese naval code, but did not share the details of where
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:51:00.480]  the attack would come. But the British, therefore, the other problem is, the people who were
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:05.520]  controlling the intelligence were Stimson of Wall Street and the invisible government,
[1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:10.640]  and Marshall, similarly. The question is, they cut off intelligence to Roosevelt. It's not that
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:17.600]  Roosevelt didn't give the Navy the intelligence. This is crazy. It is that the commanders and
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:24.800]  the bubble, there's a guy called Admiral Richmond K. Turner in the Navy Department, who is the
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:29.120]  Marplot, the inside operative and all this. He is the one who withholds the...
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:35.840]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra,
[1:51:35.840 --> 1:51:39.200]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:44.640]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform

[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:54.080]  Webster Tarbling is our guest, author of the new book,
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:55:03.520]  Rock Obama, Postmodern Cove, available at infowars.com. His historical analysis is spot on.
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:11.280]  I agree with him. I trust but verify. I just disagree, Webster, with your analysis. It's all
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:15.120]  rancid. They're all bad. Hillary's bad. John McCain's bad. I know you know that,
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  but saying that we have to throw support in behind Hillary or then McCain later,
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:29.760]  which is the same thing that so many others are saying, I just can't do it. I can't support
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:34.240]  the false paradigm of the left-right or any of these people. And if fascism's to come,
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:39.600]  let Barack Obama and his greenie meanies bring it, let them try to come burn me out. We got guns
[1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:46.000]  in this country. And maybe that's what we need is to go ahead. Worse is better. Bring this thing
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.800]  to a head. What do you expect to see the way the land is right now? Let's hear some predictions
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:56.880]  from Webster Tarbling. One of the obvious things built into an Obama presidency is the possibility
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:04.880]  of domestic civil war coming through a number of scenarios. I would just say I have a great
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:10.240]  grandfather who fought at Gettysburg in the Valley of Death there by the Devil's Den and
[1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:17.680]  Little Round Top in the 11th United States regulars of the Sykes Fifth Corps Second Division.
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:26.640]  Civil war is the worst possible outcome. Nothing but nothing is worse than civil war. And I think
[1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:31.520]  that is, that's the problem. No, the CPS taking people's children and putting sodium fluoride in
[1:56:31.520 --> 1:56:35.760]  the water. We're all under total war. You know about the eugenic system. Webster, you're an
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:40.640]  expert on that. Yeah, sure. But again, I think that there are peaceful ways out of this. Well,
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:47.280]  I want a peaceful way out of this too. The method that I recommend is to build a mass movement
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:53.440]  through mobilization. And mobilization has to involve the choice of intermediate goals.
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:59.120]  In other words, things that people can do right now, it is to stop Obama. And that means, you know,
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:05.680]  practically speaking, blocking with other forces that might oppose Obama. And again,
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:12.480]  this is based on the history of Italy 1922, 1933. For example, in the German case,
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:17.920]  you had a lot of people saying, why don't the Communists and the Social Democrats form a block
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:22.400]  and stop Hitler? For many reasons, they didn't do it. They had all good reasons. They said the
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:28.400]  other side is really bad and really corrupt and really awful. And then once Hitler came to power,
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:34.800]  they kept saying, well, I wish we had done it. But let me just continue the thing I was trying
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:41.280]  to do about the world situation. Part of it is now this question of attempting to repeat the
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:46.320]  maneuver of the appeasers, right, the Nebel Chamberlain policy, which was not appeasement,
[1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:51.040]  but war. In other words, when Obama says he wants to negotiate with Iran,
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:56.320]  he wants to use Iran exactly the same way that Brzezinski is now using Georgia. In other words,
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:01.600]  play Iran against the Russians. That's his future for Iran. Brzezinski says, why should I attack
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:07.200]  them? I can use them to attack the Russians and get rid of all of them that way. And ultimately,
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:12.880]  the crowning achievement is China against Russia, except it won't work. The other side now.
[1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:18.880]  But Iran's getting along with Russia. Who? Iran has been getting along with Russia.
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:25.520]  Uh, look, if you know any Iranians, ask them the following question. What country is most hated
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:31.840]  in Iran? And every time I've asked this question, which I ask habitually, it's always Russia.
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:37.840]  Russia, remember, uh, occupied Northern Iran during World War II as part of the Lend-Lease
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:44.080]  program. There was a military corridor going through Iran. The British occupied the South,
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:49.920]  the Soviets, the North. Now the Soviets behaved badly. They were very angry about Hitler and so
[1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:57.360]  forth. No, the Soviets did bad things. They were sweet. And the residue of that is a hatred
[1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:01.520]  that Brzezinski thinks he can build on. Well, I mean, you got Russians in there with the Chinese
[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:06.240]  building the reactors. I don't, I don't know. All right. Well, I know they think that Webster's
[1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:22.720]  just all delusional. Well, we'll be right back. A day unlike any other in the long course of
[1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:28.800]  American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:34.720]  11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have
[1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:40.240]  to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:45.200]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[1:59:45.200 --> 1:59:52.320]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:59:52.320 --> 1:59:58.000]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:02.240]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:08.000]  the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:54.240]  Alex Jones. You know, there's so many subjects. I want to talk with Webster
[2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:57.680]  Tartley about very thought-provoking discussions. We're just keeping for two more hours.
[2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:02.480]  He's agreed to do that. We appreciate that. Author of Obama the Post-Modernist Coup,
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:08.080]  available at infowars.com. We're going to open the phones up in the final hour today. For the next
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:13.120]  hour, I want to get his analysis, which he really is an expert on Eastern Europe, Central Asia,
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:18.800]  the Caucasus, Russia, the Middle East, Central Asia. I want to get about 30 minutes of analysis
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:23.040]  from him on that. And then I want to, he is one of the few people, the reason I really recognized
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:27.520]  him in my own research a decade ago, was he got into the eugenics, the driving force,
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:32.240]  the social Darwinism of the elite, their true propulsion system. So we'll talk with him the
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:36.800]  last 30 minutes of the shower and then open the phones into the last hour. Take a lot of your
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:42.160]  calls coming up in about 58 minutes. But Webster, you wanted to finish up with the austerity movement,
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:46.800]  how they have the environmental movement, the austerity movement, the secret police system
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:53.520]  they're setting up, all of this massive decades-long planning coming to a head with the Golden Boy,
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:57.920]  literally, there to save us all and bring the left in for the final police state.
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:03.680]  We've talked now, I guess, about the foreign policy. In other words, this Brzezinski plan in
[2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:08.800]  many world capitals, especially Moscow, especially Beijing, if you say Brzezinski plan,
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:17.040]  it's a plan, therefore, that has an end game. China reduced to warlords, 20 to 25 centers
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:25.120]  of power, as it was in the 1920s. And Russia also divided up as it was during the Russian Civil War
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:33.280]  of 1919 to 1920, ultimately coming in with about four to five different states, different countries.
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:40.560]  So we had the Bernard Lewis plan for the Middle East, right-carb Iraq three ways, Iran six ways,
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:45.680]  Lebanon several ways, Turkey three or four ways, Sudan at least two ways, there would be more.
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:51.280]  But then to apply that to Russia and China, so that's one thing. Now the other side is the domestic
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:03:00.160]  and the austerity. When you see Obama giving this speech in Oregon, when he had his outburst there,
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:08.000]  he said, you're not going to be able to drive an SUV, genocidal austerity, a further cut in the
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:15.440]  U.S. standard of living of 30, 40, 50 percent as much as he can do. Imagine a government policy
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:20.560]  of not having a good standard of living, which has always been what the eugenicists have craved.
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:26.240]  Absolutely. But now it's also complicated by the fact we, of course, we have this
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:31.120]  worldwide financial crisis. We have the death agony of the dollar as a reserve currency. We
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:36.960]  have banking panic going on. We had countrywide, then we had Northern Rock, we had Bear Stearns.
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:43.760]  Now we've had IndieMac. We basically have banking failures every week. We've got hyperinflation,
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:50.240]  which you see in fuel, but also in food and many other areas. So you're heading towards an extreme
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:56.880]  world economic breakdown crisis, the end of the post-1945 era, as Soros himself says. So when
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:03.520]  Soros says, this is what it is, what does he want? They've got to increase the looting pressure
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:10.960]  on the U.S. population to allow the bailout of JPMorgan Chase, the Soros interests, Goldman Sachs,
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:14.880]  and so forth. How do you do that, though? Bush and Cheney would come out and say, well,
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:19.840]  we're going to tax you for the war on terror, and that would lead to an explosion in their face.
[2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:24.960]  Obama will come and say, we're going to save the polar bears, we're going to save the planet,
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:31.760]  we're going to save the ice caps, we're going to have carbon tax, cap and trade on carbon,
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.920]  we're going to have a green tax, we're going to have a third world solidarity tax. The only
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:40.880]  problem with this is all the money goes to Rockefeller, Soros, and Goldman Sachs.
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:53.200]  All right, Webster, when we get back, we will break this all down in detail and finish up the
[2:04:53.200 --> 2:05:17.200]  story you're breaking down for us and then get into what's happened in Russia.

[2:06:07.920 --> 2:06:14.560]  government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:20.640]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:25.120]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:33.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:29.520]  Webster, let's go through the detailed analysis from your perspective
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:35.440]  on what happened with the Georgian sneak attack last Thursday night into Friday morning on the
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:43.120]  eve of the Olympic Games on 888. The Russians moving nuclear weapons in and repulsing the
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:49.920]  Georgian slash U.S.-British-Israeli attack. And what do you think this means geopolitically now?
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:55.680]  In the words of Lieutenant Colonel Sam Gardner, Air Force expert on these regions and that area,
[2:08:55.680 --> 2:09:00.000]  that region, and these type of weapons systems. So the Russians undoubtedly brought nukes into the
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:07.440]  area and that their stated default position is to nuke with tactical weapons, any U.S. forces
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:12.560]  that attack them on precision-guided conventional munitions. And he called this the greatest
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:17.760]  military escalation in modern history since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The neocons have been running
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:22.880]  around on TV, Crystal and others saying they want war with Russia. The New York Times called it the
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:28.080]  beginning of what could be World War III. The Russians reportedly stopped attacking last night,
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:33.120]  but then the Georgians started shooting back at them. That's their tactic. Attack, and then when
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:37.840]  the Russians attack, scream bloody murder and say that they're being attacked. And I did hear a lady
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:42.400]  in a story yesterday talking about, did you hear about the Russians attacking Georgia in the U.S.?
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:47.760]  You have a public, completely dumbed down, not knowing which end is up. I mean, how does this
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:56.160]  all play together? Well, I have tried to argue for the past eight or nine months. The situation
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:01.520]  in Washington, first of all, has fundamentally changed. The neocons are out. They have no power.
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:06.800]  We'll see why they're trying to get back on TV now. But the neocons have been broken as a
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:13.360]  faction. You've got Libby out, Rumsfeld out, Wolfowitz out, out at the World Bank. Lord Black,
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:19.440]  Lord Conrad Black, a top world neocon, is actually now in jail. You've got Lideen under attack by
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:26.480]  the Rockefeller Committee for his activities with his old Iran-Contra network. So the thing
[2:10:26.480 --> 2:10:31.040]  that you're facing now, I would not call it neocon anymore. It's not the neocons. It is the
[2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:36.320]  Rockefeller, Brzezinski, trilateral Bilderberg group. Okay, so that's who NATO and Israel are
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:40.880]  taking orders from. I'm sure you're aware that... That is who is running the U.S. government at
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:45.440]  this point. I understand that, Webster, but let me bring up this caveat. I mean, it's pretty darn
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:51.520]  neocon when you've got the military head of the Georgian military, not even being Georgian,
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:56.640]  being an Israeli, and the foreign minister being an Israeli. Go ahead. Yeah, the point of this now
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:03.040]  is that the neocons are essentially a group of stragglers and fugitives that are tending to attach
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:08.960]  themselves to the Brzezinski machine, trying to save themselves and maintain their positions
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:16.080]  in their careers in this new era. But notice the emphasis, the epicenter of world confrontation
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:22.720]  has shifted radically out of the Middle East, out of the Persian Gulf, and to the borders of Russia,
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:27.280]  and also China. Because the other thing, what I was actually looking for to happen on 8808
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:31.680]  was some kind of a terrorist stunt at the Beijing Olympics. This could still happen,
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:37.600]  which could also then heat up the world, and I would urge people to be aware of that, and we
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:43.840]  can maybe talk about that in a minute. The kinds of things that you're seeing now are typical
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:49.840]  classic Brzezinski. Remember, Brzezinski says, you can't attack these countries yourself. If you
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:54.880]  want to destroy Venezuela, you can't attack them. You use surrogates. Play Colombia. You want to
[2:11:54.880 --> 2:12:00.720]  destroy Somalia? Stay out of there. Let Ethiopia go in. In this case, he's got a little Hitler,
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:07.840]  Sakashvili, is a little Hitler, created by Brzezinski. This process of the color revolutions,
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:13.200]  the so-called CIA people, and we'll go back to how they financed the takeover there.
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:18.640]  But did you see the video of a plane flies overhead, and he starts cowering and crying,
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:23.520]  and then running, and then they cover him up with armored vest, and he's screaming like a little girl?
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:28.560]  I mean, I've never seen a leader act like that, an ultimate little coward, and he's wild eyed,
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:34.080]  and always lying, and these people are nuts. I would compare him in many ways to Obama. A
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:39.840]  megalomaniac drunk with power, indulging in illusions of infantile omnipotence,
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:44.960]  and really thinking, he probably, I believe that Brzezinski has played him. In other words,
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:49.760]  Brzezinski has promised him. He told him he'd win, and not that it was really meant to bring
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:53.920]  Russia in and escalate things. And not that it, not that he was, you don't tell your expendable
[2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:59.200]  pawns that they are expendable pawns on a kamikaze trip. You don't tell them that. You let them go
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:02.160]  ahead and think that they're coming back. Now, a lot of analysts are saying, and it does seem to
[2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:07.840]  be true, that people see McCain as a stronger military leader, and that this Georgian-Russian
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:13.200]  crisis actually strengthens McCain's hand. Why would Brzezinski do that? Yeah, I think it may
[2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:18.000]  have happened too soon. The problem is when you're dealing with somebody as unstable as Sakashvili,
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.760]  he's also got to respond to his own internal conditions. One obvious fact, if you want to
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:28.240]  have an attack in that part of the world, you got to do it during the summer. You can't do it
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:34.960]  during the autumn when the rains come. So really, there are competing considerations. Our election
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:39.520]  is in November, but if they're going to attack this year, they more or less got to do it. Now,
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:45.040]  there's a lot to be said about that. The principal idea, though, is that Georgia is the aggressor.
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:51.680]  They launched a genocidal sneak attack in the middle of the night with massive rocket attacks,
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:59.200]  air bombardment, and heavy artillery to kill the civilians of South Ossetia. And CNN and Fox,
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:06.560]  now confirmed, showed video of the Georgians attacking South Ossetia and the Gorge over by
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:12.320]  Abkhazia, and then lied and said that was Russians doing it. I mean, this is unprecedented media
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:18.320]  lying. Yeah, it's probably the biggest media hysteria, but you can compare it to 9-11 or the
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:23.600]  Iraq war or Obama. It's the same media that have been telling you Obama is the savior,
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:30.320]  are now telling you that Putin and Medvedev are the devils. The Russian response, of course, is
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:37.120]  then a powerful counter-stroke, and they've got to destroy the Georgian second echelon. In other
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:41.600]  words, the second attack wave that would have come in there. Yeah, the main forces that were
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:47.440]  built up to come in behind the shockfribs. Now, the military infrastructure all over the country,
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:52.080]  and they just come in on this. This is largely built up by the U.S. With your tax dollars,
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:57.440]  this 10-part little Hitler, Sakashvili. Increase their defense budget by 30 plus times in five
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:00.640]  years, but I want to stop there because I want to go back and then you can go forward. But I want
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:06.240]  to cover every point here and get your take, Webster. Dealing with this, do you think Brzezinski and
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:12.000]  the Anglo-American establishment and the neocon followers, and I agree with you, they're now,
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:16.240]  like the birdcage line are being removed, new ones being put in as a front for the oligarchs,
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:19.600]  do you think they miscalculated or is this what they expected?
[2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.800]  I think they miscalculated the timing. However, remember, on the McCain side, you've also got
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:32.560]  a tentacle of Brzezinski, and indeed, also in the U.S. government. Ian Brzezinski is the other
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:39.120]  son. He has three kids. Mark Brzezinski, Clinton National Security Council, works for Obama.
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:45.360]  Mika Brzezinski, you see here every morning this airhead with Scarborough on Morning Joe, MSNBC.
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:52.080]  But then we have Ian Brzezinski, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:57.360]  for NATO and Eastern Europe. He is undoubtedly one of the people who got this thing going,
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:03.840]  Ian Brzezinski. And of course, he's also a top advisor to McCain. So in a certain way,
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:08.640]  between McCain and Brzezinski and Obama, you're going to get Brzezinski anyway.
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:14.720]  The difference of course is that with Obama as the face of imperialism, as we saw in Berlin,
[2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:19.200]  Obama basically says, I can get you the European troops and the European money
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:23.760]  that with McCain you can't get. That's right. He can sell the suckers one more time.
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:28.640]  Right. And he can get the Europeans to go and die in the apocalyptic war against Russia,
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:32.960]  whereas McCain's chances of doing that are inferior. Also, Obama's going to be a better
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:38.400]  strike breaker than McCain because he'll do it with left cover. And he can even use his goons,
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:42.960]  which even somebody like Clinton does not have. She does not have an army of goons in the way
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:46.240]  that Obama thought. I want to continue with Obama, but let's get back into Russia.
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:54.080]  I mean, this was a very dangerous, reckless move by the oligarchs, by the New World Order,
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:59.920]  to do this. Certainly. Let's just look at the ways this could escalate into World War Three.
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:05.440]  One obvious one is you've got these 2,000 Georgian troops that have gone into Iraq
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:09.760]  at the behest of the U.S. And they wanted to go back to Georgia. Now, I would say to them,
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:15.520]  fine, do it on your own power. But no, we've had C-17 U.S. Air Force transports
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:22.240]  ferrying them back. Now, this is a very unfriendly act towards the Russians. Putin has
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:25.440]  complained. You just started two days ago bringing them into a hot battle zone.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.760]  Right. And according to NBC News, there were contacts between
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:34.560]  the State Department and the Russian foreign ministry to avoid an incident. And it was the
[2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:38.800]  Russians, they said, well, we're going to shoot down these planes because those Georgian troops
[2:17:38.800 --> 2:17:43.680]  are going to start killing Russians and civilians as soon as they get here to the fighting front.
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:48.560]  That's one dimension. The other thing is, you have, it's difficult to know how many, at least
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:56.240]  125 or maybe several hundred U.S. advisors are attached to the Georgian Defense Ministry to go
[2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:01.440]  with all of this hardware that the U.S. has been pouring in to Georgia, which the Russians,
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:07.360]  I hope, have now largely destroyed. But the possibility of some of those U.S. advisors
[2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:13.440]  getting killed and then a huge media spectacle around that has got to be factored in.
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:20.000]  Another point, the Black Sea, the Russians have put up a naval blockade on the Georgian ports
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:28.320]  in the Black Sea. Suppose the U.S., the British, the French, or the Ukrainian hotheads, also possible,
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:34.480]  or Romania, Bulgaria, we don't know. Those are now NATO states, right? Poland and the Balkans
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:40.400]  are basically in NATO. If they try to run the blockade, break the Russian blockade, and deliver
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:45.440]  ammunition and go, or even humanitarian, they would say, what really ammunition, I'm sure,
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:48.240]  then that could lead to an international incident.
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:51.040]  Hey, Lusitanyan type, the older Gulf of Tonkin.
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:53.840]  It would be, I guess, a Cuban missile crisis in reverse,
[2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:56.960]  because the Russians would be there with a picket line, and if you don't stop
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:00.000]  and you don't submit to a search, they're going to blow you up.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:06.320]  Now, here's the most dangerous. Not only is Sakashvili and this Georgian regime the product
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:11.440]  of People Power Coup, Color Revolution, in this case it's the Roses Revolution, run by
[2:19:11.440 --> 2:19:17.360]  Brzezinski, financed by Soros, National Endowment for Democracy. Call this the left CIA. This is
[2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:22.080]  something you haven't seen that much. Well, you've seen it, but it hasn't been prominent internally.
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:28.000]  If you go to Ukraine, the group in Kiev, Yushenko and Timo Shenko, the ice princess,
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:33.920]  right, this blonde with her braided blonde hair, she's a kleptocrat. She's a NATO agent
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:39.520]  and a kleptocrat. The Ukrainians are supporting Georgia. Now you've got one of these two Kaczynski
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:45.520]  twins in Poland, and what they've got is the front of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:53.280]  Poland, Ukraine, supporting Georgia. So we can see a ring around Russia starting
[2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:57.760]  similar conflicts. This can only be the start of a larger brush-fire war. Stay with us.
[2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:05.280]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[2:20:05.280 --> 2:20:11.200]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[2:20:11.200 --> 2:20:15.520]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:20:15.520 --> 2:20:20.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:25.200]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:32.560]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[2:20:32.560 --> 2:20:38.080]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:42.320]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:48.960]  and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality,
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:55.360]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[2:20:55.360 --> 2:21:03.680]  terrorists. On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:08.640]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:14.080]  of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:18.160]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:23.520]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:28.240]  be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron
[2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:33.520]  Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power. A gripping adventure
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:38.400]  into the secret world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give

[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:44.160]  a scarf and your breath as hard as kerosene. You weren't your mama's only boy, but her favorite
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:57.440]  wanted sea. She began to cry when you said goodbye. It sank into your dream.
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:08.880]  Webster Darbley's our guest today. Your calls are coming up in about 35 minutes,
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:16.800]  talking about any subject you want with our guest, any other issue. Okay, we've gotten into the third
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:24.880]  when you were saying most dangerous scenario with these now NATO or sub-NATO states. They all have
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:32.240]  different ethnic partitions right along the borders with Russia proper, Mother Russia.
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:38.320]  Perfect to start these Balkanization and divide and conquer conflicts continue.
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:43.680]  Of the ones that I've mentioned, Poland is a full member of NATO. This should never have been done.
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:51.920]  The Polish regime is a collection of anti-Russian hotheads created in the image of Brzezinski.
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.600]  Brzezinski even says that he considered going back to Poland in the late 1990s and becoming
[2:25:57.600 --> 2:26:06.480]  president of the country and leading the anti-Russian assault himself. Right now you have these two
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:11.920]  comical Kaczynski twins. There's a whole new world that people need to become familiar with,
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:18.400]  but it simply will not do to know about Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Iran and the Persian Gulf
[2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:23.200]  and Afghanistan. The world is now much, much bigger. Brzezinski plays on an immensely bigger
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:30.880]  chessboard. Tremendous adventurism, because look at this. When you have these clashes, right, the US
[2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:36.720]  advisors on the ground in Georgia, US ships in the Black Sea, US planes coming in, ferrying in,
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:42.560]  military supplies, you go immediately to superpower confrontation. You immediately have
[2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:48.240]  intercontinental ballistic missiles ready to go, H-bombs on them. This may or may not happen
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:52.320]  in the near future. It's no longer toying with Arabs, you're genocide-ing and slaughtering who
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:57.520]  are fighting you with AK-47s. Exactly. You're not dealing with defenseless states, right? Iran,
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:02.240]  of course, is not defenseless in the sense that it can project power to the Persian Gulf and maybe
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.800]  cut off the world's oil supply, but there's virtually no way they can strike into the
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:10.960]  United States. Now, with Russia and indeed with China, this is totally different. I would urge
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:20.320]  people to mobilize on this issue. We cannot have any US money, soldiers aid, stop this diplomatic
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:26.240]  support. Let me point out, in addition to the bellicose nonsense that you've heard from McCain,
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:31.280]  you know, he wants to kick the Russians out of the group of eight, and he looks into Putin's eyes
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:39.280]  and sees KGB. That's all very witty. I'm sure. Notice that Obama says he wants Georgia to become
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:46.640]  a NATO full member. So Obama, having seen the insanity of his fellow Brzezinski puppet,
[2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:52.560]  Sakash Vili, the little Hitler, Obama says, yes, let's put the entire weight of the North
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:58.240]  Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US, Canada, Turkey, and all these Europeans. Let's throw that
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:04.960]  into the scales behind a lunatic like Sakash Vili. This disqualifies Obama. Obama also says,
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:11.040]  the Russians have violated the sovereignty of Georgia and encroached on the sovereignty of
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:19.600]  Georgia. No, Senator, that's called hot pursuit. As soon as those Georgians murdered 2,000 civilians
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:25.920]  in the night of the eighth and the ninth, at that point, the countermeasures of the Russians
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:31.280]  are pure self-defense under the UN Charter. That's allowed under the UN Charter. And it becomes
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:36.320]  hot pursuit because you're chasing people that are trying to kill you. They couldn't run the
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:40.960]  main armies out and then let them regroup, which they were doing for a counter assault.
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:45.680]  Once they were routed, they had to destroy them. Yes, and remember that Sakash Vili,
[2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:52.480]  this petty, this tin pot little Hitler, he tried the same thing back in 2004, and he was defeated.
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:57.600]  Also remember, he's not democratic at all. There was a large mass movement against him.
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:04.000]  It was basically a color revolution in reverse, this time with real popular support. And Sakash
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:09.760]  Vili immediately declared martial law, shut down the TV, kicked out the foreign journalists,
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:15.360]  rounded up the opposition. Yeah, he tortured and killed them with US support. They even used
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:21.360]  Georgia reportedly as a black site to take some of the torture victims to. They're full NATO
[2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:27.200]  puppets. The Russian position, of course, is that South Ossetians are Russian citizens.
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:31.680]  So you've killed 2,000 Russian citizens and several dozen of their troops. It's comparable
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:36.640]  to 9-11. And by the way, the numbers going up, as you know, Webster, they're now digging a bunch
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:41.680]  of people out of the rubble. So it's going to be more than 2,000 dead civilians. Webster,
[2:29:41.680 --> 2:29:45.440]  Tarpley, stay with us. We're going to go to Bright, come back, continue with this, then get
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:52.960]  it into the social Darwinism, but drives the evil minds. We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:56.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:04.800]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:09.200]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from
[2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:13.840]  the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by
[2:30:13.840 --> 2:30:19.680]  you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the C4? They said that on the show. The day that
[2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:25.520]  we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own
[2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:33.040]  door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside
[2:30:33.040 --> 2:30:41.440]  job? How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable
[2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:46.720]  for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told
[2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:50.720]  the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...

[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:34.000]  Bottom line, we have an out-of-control elite who play with the world like it's their little toy.
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:40.240]  My saying, Putin's good. No, he was caught staging bombings in 1999
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:46.720]  so that he could create political support to come into office under a popular war with the
[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:54.560]  Chechenians backed by, again, the United States. You always find the Muslim extremists on a very
[2:33:54.560 --> 2:34:00.480]  short leash to this government. That's why it's so sick that they use them as cover, as decoys,
[2:34:01.040 --> 2:34:08.480]  in the drills for the 9-11 attacks. Let me bring this up. In Brzezinski and the Rand
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:14.240]  Corporation and the Rockefeller Klam, mimicking what the British had done in the region at the
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:20.160]  turn of the last century, creating most of the nations in the Middle East, their modern borders,
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:25.120]  they've always been used as a shield to overthrow democratically elected governments, intellectual
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:30.000]  governments, even pro-western governments, but that won't be puppets. They use Muslim radicals
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:34.480]  to overthrow countries, then they then fight with the Muslim radicals they've put in,
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:42.960]  this endless crisis creation. How do you see them using the Muslims that they've used again
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:49.600]  against the Serbs in the late 90s, against in the 80s, against the Russians in Brzezinski's
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:54.320]  six months before in 79, having them attack Russian outposts in the north of Afghanistan,
[2:34:54.320 --> 2:34:59.360]  getting a Russian response? How do you see the Muslims, i.e. mainly the Wahhabist,
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:06.960]  the Muslim majority, the 80% Sunni, how do you see them being used on the chessboard?
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:09.760]  Who are they? Are they a Rook or are they just a pawn?
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:18.880]  Obrzynski is the father of modern Islamic fundamentalism. He argued, pardon me, in the Carter
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:27.600]  administration that Muslim fundamentalism was the great bulwark against Soviet communism.
[2:35:27.600 --> 2:35:33.440]  He installed Khomeini. He created Khomeini. Khomeini was a well-known long-term British
[2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:38.400]  agent, had been used against the Shah during the Shah. Let's spend some time on that. I'm going to
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:43.040]  sit back. Let's spend some time on that, because I've researched that for the listeners that I've
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:49.760]  probably been believing that. That is true. Let's go back to 53. Let's explain the run-up to 79 in
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:56.880]  the Islamic Revolution and in the Islamic State being set up. Well, Mossadeq would belong along
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:03.840]  with General Qasem of Iraq and Nasser of Egypt and any number of others to the wave of progressive
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:10.640]  nationalistic military types in the Arab world. It would have been the interest of the United States
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:16.640]  to cooperate with them for the modernization of the region and the ending of colonialism and
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:23.040]  imperialism. This was even in the Eisenhower administration, the Suez policy of 1956, turning
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:28.560]  against the British, the French, and the Israelis in favor of the Arabs. That's what got the U.S.
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:36.480]  into the Middle East in any positive way in the first place. The overthrow of Mossadeq is a joint
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:44.320]  operation of the British with Alan Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, and the pro-Wall Street CIA forces.
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:51.680]  And the father of Norman Tortsko. Yes, right, that too. Here's the thing. The Shah,
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:56.880]  the problem of the Shah is this. He had some positive features in the 1960s. Let me mention
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:37:02.400]  this white revolution. The Mullahs of Iran are an expression of the latter funders, the huge
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:06.800]  landowners. They were kind of a feudal class. They're a little bit like this feudal monster we
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:11.760]  have the Dalai Lama running around today that the Hollywood people think is spiritual. The
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:18.000]  Shah had this thing called the white revolution, which was to break up the huge latter fundia
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:23.520]  and actually have a land reform and to try to actually advance the country. Now, this was his
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:31.120]  last attempt in that regard, but Khomeini was deployed as a British agent. The idea in Iran
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:36.560]  was scratch a mullah and you'll find a British agent. That's basically correct. The Khomeini
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:42.640]  revolution was a joint U.S.-British project, but the BBC Persian language service, the Farsi
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:49.200]  service, was the leading edge of this entire thing. Now, remember, the Shah by now politically is a
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:55.520]  monster. He's a reactionary. He's governing with the secret police. However, in terms of his
[2:37:55.520 --> 2:38:01.760]  economic stuff, he's got deals with the Soviets, deals with the Italians. He's going outside the
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:09.680]  realm of U.S. domination and he's got several dozen nuclear reactors either started or about
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:15.920]  to start. He's got steel mills. He's got about 50 billion dollars of tremendous development.
[2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:20.160]  He made the mistake Serbia made. He was becoming independent. He was becoming independent and
[2:38:20.160 --> 2:38:26.800]  he was bringing, he was providing a way to see a country advance from medieval backwardness
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:32.400]  into the modern age with nuclear energy, steel mills, petrochemical, new airport,
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:38.160]  new subway system for Tehran, the port of Banda Robas. My entree into this was, I knew that this
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:44.400]  guy, Loris Corby of Italy, one of the great civil engineering companies of the world,
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:50.320]  who was building this new city of Banda Robas. Now, Bandar Khomeini. When Khomeini came in,
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:55.040]  he shut down all of this. He destroyed, the Iranians would have long since been in the
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:01.120]  nuclear age. They would have had 10 or 20 peaceful nuclear reactors going, but it was Khomeini
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:06.320]  who stopped that. So, Brzezinski basically says, look, we've got to stop economic development
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:11.520]  in the third world. The way we do it was with people like Paul Pot, trained in Paris.
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:16.000]  For those that don't know, let's flush that out now some. He brags in two of his books that they
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:19.840]  helped Paul Pot and helped him kill two million people. He should be immediately arrested. This
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:24.480]  isn't us saying this. He writes this and says that, you know, we let him kill two million people
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:28.480]  and supported him and I'm proud of what I did. And I can pull the quote up, but that's basically
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:33.120]  what he said. I mean, this is just the amazing type activity. If I want to cover Paul Pot briefly,
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:41.840]  then I want to go back to 1979, 1980, then this stage deal with the quote Republicans,
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:46.800]  doing a deal to have him grab hostages, then stage an event. But you have Brzezinski in the
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:52.960]  White House. Why would he then double back and betray Carter if you're saying he's the mastermind?
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:40:00.960]  I know he's a fellow traveler and very powerful. But then, you know, burn the Carter administration,
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:09.280]  which he ran and sat in via the Reagan administration with the Muslim Islamic Revolution over there
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:14.880]  for the weapons. Now, remember, Brzezinski believes that Islamic fundamentalism is the
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:20.480]  number one bullwalk against Soviet communism. So he foments that in Iran. That's where the whole
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:25.360]  thing begins, really. And then he sends in these teams into Afghanistan, as you said,
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:31.840]  to get the Soviets in there and begin to bring them down. Brzezinski fundamentally believes
[2:40:31.840 --> 2:40:36.960]  that he can use the Khomeini regime against the Soviets. This is the problem you have
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:42.320]  when you have a policy of what might be called appeasement, but really of turning these other
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:48.880]  countries into kamikaze puppets, suicidal pawns, expendable assets against your bigger enemy.
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:55.200]  That's the end of the Brzezinski method. You point them at the Russians and let them go.
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:41:02.880]  This cannot be avowed in public. Now, Brzezinski wanted to arm Khomeini, but he couldn't do it
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:09.040]  in public. And he needed a cover story. So he encouraged, in my view, encouraged the taking
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:15.360]  of the hostages as a piece of political theater that would allow him to continue U.S. military
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:21.440]  deliveries to Iran. And that's what is called Iran Contra, started under Carter. And the U.S.
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:27.520]  military deliveries to Iran never stopped. There's a guy called Stanley Pottinger, who was involved,
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:34.160]  and the Brzezinski National Security Council, where they had Iranian representatives. The so-called
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:35.920]  captain, say, today, was operating at the U.S. Navy.
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:38.960]  And so the power never changes. They just remove a figurehead.
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.200]  Yes, but again, it's part of this. The question is that you're trying to subvert those five
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:52.400]  critical republics in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan,
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:58.880]  and Turkmenistan, like the five big Soviet Central Asian republics. That's your target.
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:06.320]  Now, Brzezinski, therefore, has a public policy, and then he has the real policy. If you think about
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:12.960]  the accusation of appeasement against Obama, it's accurate, as long as you know what appeasement is.
[2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:19.440]  You can imagine Obama acting as a puppet for Brzezinski, talking to the Iranians. He would say,
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:26.560]  your real enemy is the Russians, not us. You've got to oppose the Russians in the Caspian Sea.
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:32.960]  You need a Navy in the Caspian Sea. We'll give you a Navy in the Caspian Sea, so you can stop
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:38.720]  those Russians from taking your oil. You want nuclear weapons? We'll give them to you. We have
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:43.760]  special nukes. They only go to Moscow. You want some of those? We'll give you some right away.
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:48.400]  There is no objection by Brzezinski to Iran as a nuclear power, but this cannot be said.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:54.240]  How did Pakistan's armament, and by the U.S. and England, how does that play into this larger
[2:42:54.240 --> 2:42:59.680]  chessboard? I don't know if that's quite so connected. I think the U.S., obviously, what you
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:06.480]  say is true. That's how AQ Khan was working for the U.S. all along. But again, the Iranian one
[2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:11.520]  is the really big one, because Pakistan has to be destroyed because the geopolitical instinct is
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:17.440]  pro-Chinese. Iran can be used as a puppet because the geopolitical instinct, as I've argued,
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:23.840]  is anti-Russian. So Brzezinski would say to them, look, didn't I arm you under Iran contra?
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:29.040]  Didn't I give you everything you needed? Yes. Well, then let me do it again for you now. I can
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:35.040]  deliver everything you need under the table, but let's get you going against those nasty Russians.
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:42.080]  Ahmadinejad will be out by next year. There's a new power constellation. This is what Obama would
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:50.240]  talk about. The neocons say, bomb Iran. Brzezinski, with Obama, says no. Talk to Iran, but destroy
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:54.720]  Pakistan. Remember, Obama is the- Well, that's the same more subtle system that we see growing
[2:43:54.720 --> 2:44:00.960]  out of Carter and then being implemented by the Reagan, really the Bush White House, the Bush
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:07.760]  41-42 White House, because what we're dealing with is what Iraq- I mean, I want to get your
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:13.040]  analysis on this. Same thing. They arm Iraq, tens of billions of dollars, have them attack Iran,
[2:44:13.040 --> 2:44:19.120]  then they tear each other up, and then you have the whole region to send down into another level.
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:23.760]  Yeah, I have a whole chapter on the Carter administration, about a 40-page summary.
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:29.840]  People can't remember what a horror, how horrendous it was under the Carter Brzezinski
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:33.840]  Volcker regime. It was one of the qualitative turning points in American history.
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:39.040]  Concerning what you've just mentioned, the Iraq-Iran War. Now, here's the problem.
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:45.920]  Brzezinski installs Khomeini. The Shah is driven out by Carter and Brzezinski. They stab him in
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:51.120]  the back. At that point, there's a military government or Bakhtiar, a reasonable kind of
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:54.160]  a national- The Shah dies of a 24-hour cancer.
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:45:00.480]  The government, and then they essentially then, the Khomeini comes in, and when Khomeini shuts down
[2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:07.200]  all the development projects, because they're not Islamic in his view, the country begins to
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:11.440]  fall apart. Now, they realize that Khomeini is going to be out within six months. The only way
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:17.680]  to stabilize Khomeini is to go to Saddam Hussein and say, if you attack, you'll have an easy victory.
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:23.440]  So you play Saddam Hussein against Iran. This leads to a war that goes on for the best part of
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:26.960]  the day. Knowing that that will create nationalism and will actually strengthen the Islamic
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:32.400]  Revolution. It will keep Khomeini in power. Now, all of this on Brzezinski's watch. So you've got
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:36.480]  the Soviet-Afghan War unleashed by Brzezinski. But that's really what the neocons have been
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:41.040]  doing. Saber rattling has made Iran more hardline and made the government more popular at a point
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:47.920]  where they were about to topple. Well, I would say there was a serious last-ditch attempt by Cheney
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:54.320]  to bomb Iran, most likely with nuclear weapons, last August, September. That was the Rogue B-52.
[2:45:54.320 --> 2:45:59.120]  He tried as hard as he could, and he came within a hand's breadth. But we just learned that they're
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:05.600]  trying to paint up the PT boats and have a conflict over there. I don't see an attack on Iran. I would
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:10.960]  rule it out. The U.S. and the British do not want it, and the Israelis seem to have bought into the
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:16.640]  new strategy. And that with their prominence in the, in the Georgian picture, indicates to me
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:22.480]  that the Israelis have seen that there will be no attack on Iran. There is, however,
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:29.760]  an attack on Pakistan going on right now. We've got the other side of it. The Turkmenistan Islamic
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:36.960]  Party is a puppet group of patsies in Chinese Turkestan, Sinchon province, right, the northwest
[2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:42.000]  of China, who have now suddenly started rattling sabers and delivering their videos to the CIA front
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:47.840]  in Telsa. All right. And they, they are, they, they run probably through the Pakistani ISI,
[2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:53.040]  or maybe directly by Chosudovsky has an interesting article about this. But the idea is that
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:47:01.120]  terrorism in China is also being stoked with Tibetans, with these Turk, Turkmen, or basically,
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:06.160]  they're all Turks. They're all Muslim Turks between the Caspian Sea and Mongolia,
[2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:11.280]  Tibet. It's a Turkish area, largely Tajikistan, I guess is the exception. So there are a whole
[2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:16.080]  bunch of Muslim Turks and they can be used now along with the Tibetans and along with the
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:21.920]  democracy freaks, the Amnesty International Human Rights Watch crew, to try to destabilize the,
[2:47:22.720 --> 2:47:28.080]  the government of, of China. But now, let's also think, what's the new face of false flag
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:33.920]  terrorism? Let me suggest, I was in Amsterdam, Holland a couple of weeks ago, the Docs on the
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:38.560]  Doc series, and I showed a bunch of pictures. Let's see what the new face of terrorism is.
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:46.160]  Cho at Virginia Tech. You look at him, well, he's Korean, but he might be Chinese. So he's a crazy
[2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:52.160]  Oriental Korean, he's not a Manchurian candidate. And now in the middle of the Olympics, you have
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:47:58.560]  a Chinese guy killing two people and it's hype like aliens are landed. But that's, Cho is one.
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:05.760]  Kazmirchak, Northern Illinois University. He's a left-wing student with social justice concerns.
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:09.280]  He doesn't like the way the criminal justice system. The other Chinese guy that ran around a
[2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:14.880]  few years ago shooting the 14 dare hunters. And then we, I would then include the Unabomber.
[2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:20.160]  This is not quite as recent, but the idea of ecological terrorism. If you're a polluter,
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:25.760]  if your carbon footprint is too big, maybe the new Unabomber or Earth First or somebody like this
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:32.960]  will come and visit you. Then we have the classic ones done by the British against Russia
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:40.160]  to signal the coming of the new policy, which is Lytvinyanka, a Russian from the KGB
[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:45.440]  with nuclear terrorism. Don't think about the relations. Just think about the sort of pictorial
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:51.920]  memes of the myth. Lytvinyanka is one. Politkovskaya. Now she's a Russian journalist who's
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:56.160]  assassinated and they immediately blame Putin. All indications are that this comes from the
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:49:02.960]  Berezovsky stable. Boris Berezovsky, Russian oligarch, now working for British intelligence.
[2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:07.440]  Let's see what else we can think of. Ilya Akhmadov. This is, of course, the Chechen
[2:49:08.640 --> 2:49:14.080]  ambassador here. He's the ambassador of the main Chechen terrorist organization,
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:20.160]  the one with Basayev and Moskadov run by the CIA, which I would say they are the people
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:25.440]  who blew up those buildings in Moscow in 1999. They're the ones who did the theater,
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:31.920]  the school in Beslan, and also the hospital in southern Russia in 1995. The Chechens have now
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:39.200]  claimed probably 1,000 to 1,500 dead. So the Russians, if you add up their, you know, the
[2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:44.400]  Butcher's bill, the Russians have suffered from international terrorism, at least as much as the
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:52.720]  U.S. in 9-11. But let's look at Akhmadov. He's here because Big New Brzezinski lobbied
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:57.200]  to get him asylum. He's now being paid with your money, State Department stipend,
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:03.520]  under the Reagan-Fasell program. He's living in a nice house here in Woodley Park by the zoo.
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:09.040]  He has an office at the National Endowment for Democracy. He gets a secretary, a travel budget,
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:14.240]  a public relations budget, all courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. Now, the Russians have repeatedly said,
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:19.280]  this is a terrorist. You've got an extra item. We want to put him on trial. The U.S. says, no,
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:23.840]  he's a democratic force. As long as he's anti-Putin, it means that he's democratic.
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:29.760]  When you had that pestle on school in September of 2004, the Russian press was full of,
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:35.520]  this attack was planned in London and Washington. I believe it's actually quite correct.
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:43.040]  So if you add up these faces, right, Cho, Kazmirchak, Litvinenko, in particular,
[2:50:43.040 --> 2:50:48.480]  the Unabomber, and then somebody like Yulia Sakharov, I think that's a composite of memes
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:55.440]  from which you can see the probably various kinds of false flag terrorism that are now likely to be
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:51:01.920]  unleashed. And again, it's not just Chechens, right? It could be the FARC. We saw this tremendous
[2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:08.400]  media circus around this woman, Betankur. Stay there, stay there. A day unlike any other in
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:14.320]  the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck
[2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:20.560]  America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the
[2:51:20.560 --> 2:51:25.440]  Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take
[2:51:25.440 --> 2:51:30.640]  a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S.
[2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:36.320]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:42.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:47.680]  the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:52.960]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD
[2:51:52.960 --> 2:52:00.000]  at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:03.360]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:16.000]  Here we go. Here's the story. You wash your car. How long does it last? Three days? A week?
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:23.120]  Two weeks? Life change tea eliminates chemicals, toxins, and parasites and much more. The effect?
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:28.160]  You lose weight. That's right. You lose weight. So here's the story. You wash your car. It gets
[2:52:28.160 --> 2:52:34.240]  dirty again. You cleanse your body. Chemicals and toxins come back. The fix? Stay on the tea.
[2:52:34.240 --> 2:52:40.720]  And here's how we will help. Ask for the Mid-State Fair Special when ordering. Here's how to order.

[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:11.600]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:16.080]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:20.960]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:25.760]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:31.600]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae,
[2:53:31.600 --> 2:53:37.520]  and fungus. The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[2:53:37.520 --> 2:53:42.080]  comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:47.600]  chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF Shower Filter normally

[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:25.280]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done? We've got a long way to go, and there's short time
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:36.480]  to get there, and he's bound just like a bandit run. Keep your foot on the pedal, so I'm never minding breaks. Let it all hang out cause we got a run to make.
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:45.280]  The boys are first taking that lineup, and there's beer and Texar canna, and we'll bring it back no matter what it takes.
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:52.560]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time,
[2:54:52.560 --> 2:55:12.560]  and then we are back, right here on the network, 9 to 1 on the Genesis feeds, 24 hours a day at infoawars.com to the 4-hour show, and for 20 hours it re-hears back-to-back, so you missed Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and his analysis of what happened in Russia, very similar to Tar Police.
[2:55:12.560 --> 2:55:17.600]  That'll be re-hearing when this show ends in about 1 hour and 4 minutes from now.
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:25.600]  We're going to take your calls, wide open phones in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231, any subject you want to discuss.
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:37.600]  Webster has agreed to ride shotgun with us, we always enjoy having him on with us, 1-800-259-9231. Interesting story I'll cover later in the next hour.
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:43.600]  Beijing Olympics 2008 opening ceremony, giant firework footprints, faked.
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:51.600]  And that's the kind of stuff China and Russia and every government. All governments are evil and wicked and corrupt, but who is the dominant global force?
[2:55:51.600 --> 2:56:01.600]  Well, that is, as Tarpley calls it, the Anglo-American Empire. Doesn't matter, they're all corrupt, they're all bad, we're just cold-bloodily analyzing how they're fighting with each other and what they're doing.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:09.600]  Remember, the state is the enemy of the people, bottom line throughout history. The problem is there's always other states trying to come in and take over your state,
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:18.600]  so it's a very, very serious equilibrium that has to be held with the size of the state. But again, we'll continue with Tarpley here in just a moment.
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:25.600]  Don't forget, I am a documentary filmmaker, I have made 19 films, the latest is Truth Rising.
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:31.600]  And it's got Zbigniew Brzezinski being confronted by the young Luke Radowski and him saying, sit down and shut up.
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:40.600]  And it's got everybody else from Geraldo Rivera to Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton to John McCain being confronted. And then it's got Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura,
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:51.600]  the good guys in it, it's got Democracy Nows, Amy Goodman talking about bombs in the building, it's got George Carlin right before he died talking about an inside job.
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:57.600]  On 9-11, it's got the police trying to plant bombs on 9-11 activists. I mean, I really can't describe how powerful.
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:57:01.600]  Well, this is probably the best view of any film I've made, the most entertaining.
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:09.600]  I mean, you talk about short attention span theater, it just moves from issue to issue, really grabbing people in a different way than other films.
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:17.600]  Truth Rising available at infowars.com on DVD or watch it right now on Super High Quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:49.600]  concerning the websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.net, jonesandport.com, truthnews.us.

[3:00:52.600 --> 3:01:01.600]  Sometimes we do the whole show, but always the fourth hour. Live video streaming at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:07.600]  Going back to Webster Tarpley, when we come back in the next segment, we will take your calls for the balance of the hour.
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:12.600]  Webster, finishing up with what you expect to see in this election.
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:15.600]  I know you think that the greater of two evils is Barack Obama.
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:17.600]  I myself see it as a huge distraction.
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:24.600]  I understand you're seeing a star appeal and I agree we'll bring people into the fold to support the corporate fascism.
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:27.600]  We'll give them the grassroots cover they need.
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:30.600]  So I agree with you. He's the most dangerous candidate.
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  I just psychologically have divorced myself so much from the two parties and fully understanding their puppets that I can't even really see Obama.
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:41.600]  I guess as many other people see him.
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:46.600]  But in closing in the three and a half minutes we have left in this opening segment, other key points you'd like to make.
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:58.600]  Well, I would say first of all, if you get Obama with the Democratic Congress, you will have the full fury of the fascist corporate state in terms of that economic austerity,
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:08.600]  killer austerity, genocidal austerity that I talked about, under Green, Polar Bear, snail daughter, auspices, third world solidarity,
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:17.600]  and possibly even this other question of reparations to this or that ethnic group, which would also be a very explosive recipe.
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:25.600]  If you get McCain, I would say you get a tired old lame duck who is going to be a lame duck from the first moment he gets there.
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:33.600]  He'll be quacking in his inaugural address and he will be faced by a very hostile Democratic Congress giving us gridlock.
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:38.600]  This is the best outcome we could get under that scenario would be the gridlock.
[3:02:38.600 --> 3:02:42.600]  So in this sense McCain is actually a lesser evil than Obama.
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  The Democrats try to scare you with McCain.
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:47.600]  They tell you that he's going to put in these fascist judges.
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:50.600]  Well, the Democrats can filibuster those judges if they want to.
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:52.600]  So don't try to scare us with that.
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:57.600]  With Mrs. Clinton, I think you get a much more open-ended project.
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:03.600]  This is somebody who responds to public opinion through triangulation, but she does respond.
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:10.600]  And her history during the primaries has been to move more and more towards New Deal positions, at least verbally.
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:13.600]  And that's what we've got to work with at this point.
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  And this would also allow a solution that would not be McCain and not be Obama.
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:23.600]  The merit of Mrs. Clinton is that she's not McCain and she's not Obama.
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:31.600]  And I think there is going to be a movement to try to get her nominated and perhaps even to change the outcome of the convention.
[3:03:31.600 --> 3:03:35.600]  But I think the principal idea is you've got to build a movement.
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:42.600]  The way you build a movement is figure out what the financiers want most and oppose them.
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:45.600]  I would not say that the state is always the enemy.
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:47.600]  My analysis of history is different.
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:58.600]  I would say financier oligarchs, feudal aristocrats in the more distant past, financiers, financial oligarchs, bankers are the enemy.
[3:03:58.600 --> 3:04:07.600]  And if you look at the origin of the modern state under somebody like John Galliazzo Visconti in Milan in the early about 1400,
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:15.600]  if you look then at Louis XI of France in the 1470s, 1480s, and Henry VII of England, the Earl of Richmond,
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:23.600]  the guy who got rid of Richard III, what you see there is an alliance of the king, that is the state, with the bourgeoisie, the cities,
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:25.600]  and the peasantry against what?
[3:04:25.600 --> 3:04:32.600]  Against feudal oligarchs who are already transforming themselves into banking oligarchs financiers.
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:37.600]  Well, my point is that big states are the most abusive throughout history.
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:38.600]  It breeds corruption.
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:40.600]  The corrupt come in to suck out of it.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:48.600]  And so, and then look at what the oligarchs always want, they always want a big state as their tool to control populations,
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:52.600]  destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie using the commie terms.
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:05:00.600]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley and your phone calls right here on the one the only, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[3:05:00.600 --> 3:05:02.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:08.600]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:10.600]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[3:05:10.600 --> 3:05:39.600]  I can't find my wallet.
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:44.600]  Got the remote.
[3:05:44.600 --> 3:05:46.600]  Oh, my keys.
[3:05:46.600 --> 3:05:48.600]  There's my wallet.
[3:05:48.600 --> 3:06:14.600]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:06:14.600 --> 3:06:16.600]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:06:16.600 --> 3:06:18.600]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:18.600 --> 3:06:19.600]  bin Laden.
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:20.600]  This is his ammo.
[3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:23.600]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:30.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:37.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:41.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:07:00.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:07.600]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:07:07.600 --> 3:07:33.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:07:33.600 --> 3:08:02.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:08:02.600 --> 3:08:14.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:14.600 --> 3:08:26.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:42.600]  Okay, we've got Webster probably with us for the rest of the hour, an in-depth interview today with him on the economy, the election, all that's happened in Russia in future actions.
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:52.600]  Before we go any further, Webster, is there anything else you want to add concerning the geopolitical climate we're in right now before we go to calls?
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:09:01.600]  Certainly, I think right now you've got to also look at the situation in Europe because one of Brzezinski's main goals, of course, is to play Europe against Russia too.
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:13.600]  Normally, Europe would gravitate towards Russia right now because of the oil, the natural gas, the epicenter of the current world economic breakdown crisis, the Bush economic depression,
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  of course, London and New York. They've been hit hardest and other people have been hit hard because they've gotten into bed with London and New York.
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:34.600]  There's a whole school of opinion in France, Germany, Italy, on the continent that it's time now to orient towards the Russians, east-west trade, oil for technology, mutually beneficial economic development.
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:48.600]  We've got to destroy that. What he wants to use is that cordon sanitaire or that unsanitary cordon of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Ukraine to begin cutting off the natural gas.
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:10:02.600]  The Russians, of course, are going around that by building a pipeline down the middle of the Baltic so that they can deliver guaranteed energy without the Ukrainians and the Poles skimming or cutting it off or provoking or the rest of this stuff.
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:21.600]  But we have to thank, ironically enough, in this terrible situation. We have to thank Sarkozy of all people and Merkel for blocking the attempt by Brzezinski to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO as members or at least get that going at the last NATO meeting back in April.
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:33.600]  Remember, Obama wants Georgia in NATO. The Washington Post wants them in there. We've got to say no. No NATO membership for this bandit, thug, kleptocrat regime.
[3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:42.600]  The other thing is the Italian position right now, the Italian government is Berlusconi. This just shows you what kind of situation we're in.
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:57.600]  Berlusconi, of course, is this dirty character that everybody knows, but he's also a friend of the Russians and the Italians have gone very, very far in this east-west trade, oil for technology kind of stuff.
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:05.600]  And they've got a history of building huge automobile plants like the Toljatti Fiat plant that built all those ladders that are still running.
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:17.600]  The Italians are saying, the foreign minister Frattini is saying, we cannot transform the European Union into an anti-Russian bloc, so Georgia, get lost, stay out there.
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:28.600]  I've also been in touch with my friend Giulietto Chiesa, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels. You remember, he's the one who did the zero documentary.
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:41.600]  I was in Milan last November. We had 500 people in the auditorium with Dario Fal, Nobel Prize for Literature and probably the most red playwright in the world today.
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:48.600]  There's an anthology also called Zero with essays by all sorts of people among them, yours truly.
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:59.600]  So Giulietto Chiesa is leading a publicity effort in Europe to try to show people that Georgia is this bunch of pawns of Brzezinski.
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:06.600]  So there's also a lot of work to be done vis-à-vis the Europeans trying to get them to break away.
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:16.600]  In other words, don't become a lemming for Obama like those poor Germans at the Victory Column near the Ziegelssoyla in the middle of Berlin.
[3:12:16.600 --> 3:12:27.600]  Don't go with that, but rather dump Obama. I'm very glad to say my book, Obama the Post-Modern Crew, is coming out in a German edition in the Koppfellach,
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:36.600]  that is K-O-P-P, which will be hitting the newsstands fairly soon in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair, among other things.
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:39.600]  I'm also coming out in Japan because there's another place.
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:47.600]  The Japanese have said very clearly, it was a successful summit of Prime Minister Fukuda with President Hu of China.
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:52.600]  The Japanese defense minister said, the biggest threat to us is chaos in China.
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:57.600]  This is the way of saying, dear Zbigniew, we will not be a staging area for your attacks on China.
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:09.600]  In Taiwan, the KMT, the Kuomintang Party, has made a comeback kicking out the U.S. puppets, the DPP Green Party or Democratic Progressive Party, get rid of them,
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:17.600]  put in people who are reasonable, who realize that their future is a rapprochement with China and mutually beneficial trade.
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:27.600]  I'm sorry to stop you there because I want to give some time to the callers. I have to say, everything you're saying is accurate about what's happening in the world.
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:31.600]  I don't disagree with about 95% of what you're saying. The problem is, there's more to all of this.
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:39.600]  It is a fact that the CIA backed the Communist against the Japanese in China.
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:52.600]  It is a fact, now declassified, the CIA, and David Rockefeller's written editorials in the New York Times saying this, wanted the Communist Chinese to come to power so that they could use them in China.
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:14:02.600]  It is a fact that Armin Hammer and the Rockefellers and the Big Foundation monies pumped billions into Russia from its founding, overthrowing the czars,
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:10.600]  for British intelligence in 1917, right through into the 80s.
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:14.600]  And you're right, they attack with both sides and they're always trying to gobble up republics.
[3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:28.600]  They basically attack from all angles, from within, from without, always creating a neo-mercantile system which leaves all nation states weak and vulnerable and basically starving and in-fighting with regional and religious conflicts.
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:33.600]  I just want to point out that we're not saying China's good or Russia's good or anybody's good here.
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:44.600]  You can disagree if you want. It's that you have this evil global corporate management system that was developed out of London, the city of London.
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:53.600]  And I just don't want to oversimplify this, where America and England and Israel are the bad guys and everybody else are the good guys.
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:59.600]  All these countries are engaging in oppression and corruption. That's the nature of society.
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:06.600]  And I'm just trying to get people to see the bigger picture of how these big tectonic forces are colliding into each other.
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:14.600]  Well, let's look at the heart of the world problem right now is this mass of derivatives, this cancerous mass of kited derivatives.
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:19.600]  And that was a financial weapons system by the central banks while the dollar was still the world reserve currency.
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:29.600]  They made a mad dash to buy up all the real infrastructure of the world, buy up the defense contractors, media of the world to set up their global corporate empire off of the yolk.
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:34.600]  Like an egg off of the sustenance that was the United States.
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:40.600]  Now they want to leave us holding the financial bag for that collapse while they've moved into safe havens,
[3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:52.600]  then bring in a third world police state here and use the United States as a military enclave to produce modern Hessian soldiers for the new global corporate state that has
[3:15:52.600 --> 3:15:56.600]  shocked any connection to any original nation state.
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:16:04.600]  But remember now, if we use my estimate of one quadrillion, it's probably probably 1.5 quadrillion or maybe a lot more.
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:07.600]  Well, it's 6,000 trillion that we know of.
[3:16:07.600 --> 3:16:12.600]  Well, yes, but I'm saying one, well, you want to say two quadrillion.
[3:16:12.600 --> 3:16:15.600]  Fine, two quadrillion is ballpark perfectly good.
[3:16:15.600 --> 3:16:17.600]  Where is that centered?
[3:16:17.600 --> 3:16:20.600]  Well, about a quarter of that is just JP Morgan Chase.
[3:16:20.600 --> 3:16:25.600]  And when you add up the rest of the U.S., you'll get up to well over half.
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:29.600]  You'll get up to probably two thirds of the derivatives and the rest are in London.
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:37.600]  So there you see where the center of this cancer is to say that Russia is the same as this or China.
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:38.600]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:40.600]  I'm saying they're just not as powerful.
[3:16:40.600 --> 3:16:41.600]  Absolutely.
[3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:45.600]  The Anglo-American establishment flooded the world with this liquidity to get everybody in debt and get real assets.
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:47.600]  Now they're going to leave us holding the bag.
[3:16:47.600 --> 3:16:51.600]  So I don't, quote, see the U.S. now becoming a sub player in all this.
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:53.600]  That was a foregone conclusion.
[3:16:53.600 --> 3:17:00.600]  I'm saying now the New World Order, the Anglo-American Empire, as you call it, is moving to that transcendent point
[3:17:00.600 --> 3:17:07.600]  where they sit above all the nation states with their private intelligence networks in Russia, in China, in Israel, in the U.S.,
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:10.600]  just playing us all off against each other.
[3:17:10.600 --> 3:17:12.600]  I don't believe that they have total world control.
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:13.600]  No, I don't.
[3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:15.600]  I think that there are real conflicts in the world.
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:16.600]  I don't think they have total world control.
[3:17:16.600 --> 3:17:19.600]  I'm saying they are dominant.
[3:17:19.600 --> 3:17:26.600]  Dominant up to a point, but fading fast, and Obama is really a flight forward, a desperate bid to give this a facelift,
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:28.600]  to give it a new lease on life.
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:35.600]  And if you block Obama, you're going to be dealing with a severely weakened imperialism under conditions of much greater difficulty
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:37.600]  in organizing mass-consensus.
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:41.600]  I'm going to skip this break for people behind the scenes watching on prisonplanet.tv
[3:17:41.600 --> 3:17:44.600]  and listening on the ExclusiveInfoWars.com streams.
[3:17:44.600 --> 3:17:49.600]  At 24 after, I promise, no more pontificating by myself or Webster.
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:50.600]  It's all great info.
[3:17:50.600 --> 3:17:52.600]  Steve, Rico, Elliott, Cliff, Jeff, and many others.
[3:17:52.600 --> 3:17:54.600]  We're going to go right to you in about five minutes.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:57.600]  But how does it affect the American people?
[3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:03.600]  Let's be centered on ourselves for a minute and take the local regional view for North America.
[3:18:03.600 --> 3:18:09.600]  What is better for the American people, for the empire to crumble and fall apart, or for us to mindlessly support it?
[3:18:09.600 --> 3:18:11.600]  Obviously, I believe mindlessly supporting it.
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:15.600]  People only rape us that much more financially and physically.
[3:18:15.600 --> 3:18:18.600]  And so it is good to let this fall apart.
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:24.600]  I would go with the populists, those prairie farmers back in 1890, meeting in Omaha,
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:28.600]  and they formulated the populist party program, which basically said,
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:34.600]  a mass movement needs to take over the government and turn it against Rockefeller, Morgan, and the Wall Street group.
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:36.600]  And I don't think that has changed.
[3:18:36.600 --> 3:18:38.600]  That's what we should be doing.
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:41.600]  Golden cross speech.
[3:18:41.600 --> 3:18:44.600]  Yes, although he's, you know, that's William Jennings Bryan.
[3:18:44.600 --> 3:18:47.600]  He's not really an organic representative of this.
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:51.600]  He is at least a politician who grew up in that milieu.
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:18:54.600]  And he's trying to fight Wall Street.
[3:18:54.600 --> 3:18:59.600]  Again, maybe he's not a good example, but if you want to think who's like us, who's isolated like we are,
[3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:04.600]  or relatively with not that much money, take those populists of 1890.
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:06.600]  And I think their strategy is valid.
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:08.600]  Now, you want to oppose the empire.
[3:19:08.600 --> 3:19:12.600]  You also want to construct an economic alternative to this.
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:13.600]  And for me, this is clear.
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:15.600]  The New Deal methods worked then.
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:16.600]  They will work now.
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:17.600]  Oh, yeah.
[3:19:17.600 --> 3:19:20.600]  Turn this into a bunch of dependents broken down the family.
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:22.600]  The same foundations you talk about.
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:24.600]  This is not the New Deal.
[3:19:24.600 --> 3:19:26.600]  The New Deal has been gone for 40 years.
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:29.600]  Hey, Webster, 100 years ago, the big foundations, as you know,
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:31.600]  wrote how they were going to get us addicted to government.
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:33.600]  But see, you've got to be stupid.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:38.600]  Look, I tell you, the populists in Omaha said the government is going to belong to us.
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:40.600]  The goal is not to get government out of your life.
[3:19:40.600 --> 3:19:42.600]  The goal is you take over the government.
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:46.600]  Now Milton Friedman, of course, from the Rockefeller Chicago School,
[3:19:46.600 --> 3:19:48.600]  says government is always the problem.
[3:19:48.600 --> 3:19:49.600]  I don't buy that.
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:50.600]  Wall Street.
[3:19:50.600 --> 3:19:51.600]  Finance, oligarchy.
[3:19:51.600 --> 3:19:53.600]  See, that's only one hand of the elite.
[3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:54.600]  That's only one hand.
[3:19:54.600 --> 3:19:56.600]  They claim they don't want government.
[3:19:56.600 --> 3:20:01.600]  But in truth, they do want big government to suck off us with corporate welfare.
[3:20:01.600 --> 3:20:03.600]  Again, I don't do this.
[3:20:03.600 --> 3:20:04.600]  Hold on, Webster.
[3:20:04.600 --> 3:20:05.600]  We're going to behind the scenes.
[3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:06.600]  I want to abbreviate this one.
[3:20:06.600 --> 3:20:11.600]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, Friday, August 29, 2008.
[3:20:11.600 --> 3:20:13.600]  Gold opened at $832 an ounce.
[3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:18.600]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $856.80, $422.20 for half ounce,
[3:20:18.600 --> 3:20:20.600]  and $211.10 for quarter ounce.
[3:20:20.600 --> 3:20:24.600]  That's $856.80, $422.20, and $211.10.
[3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:27.600]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar,
[3:20:27.600 --> 3:20:31.600]  purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:34.600]  Japanese refiners by 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen.
[3:20:34.600 --> 3:20:35.600]  Bad news for US currency.
[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:38.600]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[3:20:38.600 --> 3:20:39.600]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:41.600]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:42.600]  Erosion accelerates.
[3:20:42.600 --> 3:20:45.600]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US.
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:47.600]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:49.600]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[3:20:49.600 --> 3:20:50.600]  Why attack Iran?
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:51.600]  Jerome O'Corsies.
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:20:55.600]  Iran leads attack against the US dollar document spells it out.

[3:21:06.600 --> 3:21:11.600]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:14.600]  I went to ground Sierra, and we knew what to do.
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:16.600]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:21:16.600 --> 3:21:20.600]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:23.600]  a platform to tell their story.
[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:29.600]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement
[3:21:29.600 --> 3:21:32.600]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:21:32.600 --> 3:21:35.600]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:39.600]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:21:39.600 --> 3:21:42.600]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:21:42.600 --> 3:21:48.600]  He takes his hand off, and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:22:00.600 --> 3:22:02.600]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:06.600]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:09.600]  Imagine if I had come to you a couple of years ago and said to you,
[3:22:09.600 --> 3:22:12.600]  hey, gasoline prices are going to jump to $5 a gallon,
[3:22:12.600 --> 3:22:16.600]  and I know a way that we can store several hundred gallons for you,
[3:22:16.600 --> 3:22:20.600]  a year or two supply of gasoline, buy it today at $2 a gallon,
[3:22:20.600 --> 3:22:23.600]  and when it goes to $5 a gallon, you'll be way ahead of the game.
[3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:25.600]  And you'll probably at the time would have said to me, you're nuts,
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:28.600]  get away, you're crazy little dick, go bye-bye, and okay, fine,
[3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:32.600]  now I'm telling you what's happened to gasoline is happening to food.
[3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:35.600]  Your grocery bill is going to skyrocket,
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:40.600]  and you can put bulk foods away at less than half the price of your regular grocery bill.
[3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:43.600]  And by tomorrow's standards, that could be at less than fourth of the price,
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:45.600]  or eighth of the price, or sixteenth of the price.
[3:22:45.600 --> 3:22:47.600]  Hello, or do you have an investor's brain or not?
[3:22:47.600 --> 3:22:51.600]  Pay attention, storeable foods, bulk foods from the J. Michael Stevens Company,

[3:23:06.600 --> 3:23:09.600]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[3:23:09.600 --> 3:23:11.600]  Matthew 24 states four times,
[3:23:11.600 --> 3:23:13.600]  in the last days many will be deceived.
[3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:17.600]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[3:23:17.600 --> 3:23:20.600]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[3:23:20.600 --> 3:23:24.600]  Is the beast a superpower nation, or a giant computer in Belgium?
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:30.600]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:33.600]  Is the antichrist a person, title, or both?
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:36.600]  Some believe these things are in the future, others believe that it's in the past.
[3:23:36.600 --> 3:23:40.600]  First John states, the antichrist is already in the world.
[3:23:40.600 --> 3:23:42.600]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:45.600]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:49.600]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible, for free books, DVDs, and Bible studies,
[3:23:49.600 --> 3:23:54.600]  exposing the antichrist, the beast, and its mark, right to the Bible says,
[3:23:54.600 --> 3:24:02.600]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771, or call 888-211-1715,
[3:24:02.600 --> 3:24:13.600]  that's 888-211-1715.
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:19.600]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[3:24:19.600 --> 3:24:24.600]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:30.600]  I've been on fire with Sally, filled on fast with a girl named Bo.
[3:24:30.600 --> 3:24:35.600]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[3:24:35.600 --> 3:24:39.600]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[3:24:39.600 --> 3:24:41.600]  I take my chances.
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:46.600]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[3:24:46.600 --> 3:24:52.600]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my lead in the latest.
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:57.600]  Kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:00.600]  I might fall from a tall building.
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:05.600]  He is the author of Obama, the postmodernist coup, available at infowars.com.

[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:36.600]  Webster Tarpley, continuing with your analysis.
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:38.600]  Let's get the take of the callers.
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:41.600]  Steve, in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide.
[3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:46.600]  Well, first of all, I want to say I'm talking to two fine men.
[3:25:46.600 --> 3:25:52.600]  Secondly, I think that you guys have been turned around backwards on this situation with Russia.
[3:25:52.600 --> 3:25:56.600]  You didn't even report that last month, it was July 25th,
[3:25:56.600 --> 3:26:02.600]  Putin had threatened the United States with the stationing atomic bombers in Cuba.
[3:26:02.600 --> 3:26:08.600]  Look, Putin has been warning the U.S. loyally, all through 2007,
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:12.600]  at that Munich-Verkunda meeting in the springtime.
[3:26:12.600 --> 3:26:16.600]  He talked about this neocon striving for U.S.
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:22.600]  Stop Tarpley, I'm going to get to it in a minute, because Steve, you can't listen to four hours every day, I don't believe it.
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:26.600]  I have been saying for the last however many months, since this was said,
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:30.600]  I talk about that every week, I talk about their foreign ministers saying,
[3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:38.600]  if you keep moving weapons systems and troops and training and destabilizing in Poland and in Czech Republic,
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:43.600]  and in Georgia and in Ukraine and in all these areas and in the stands,
[3:26:43.600 --> 3:26:47.600]  and in moving your military in, we're going to start moving nukes near you,
[3:26:47.600 --> 3:26:51.600]  and I have said that on record, so go ahead.
[3:26:51.600 --> 3:26:54.600]  Okay, so you're reporting your point of view.
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:26:58.600]  You've never mentioned that people in Eastern and Central Europe are talking about a domino theory,
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:02.600]  where the situation is the dialectic.
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:04.600]  In other words, Russia-
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:08.600]  Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, Russia is shrinking, not getting bigger.
[3:27:08.600 --> 3:27:13.600]  There wasn't Russia that snuck attack a US military base last Thursday night,
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:16.600]  it was the United States, which isn't our government anymore.
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:21.600]  I'm just stating facts, I can't stand communist or leftism or any of this stuff.
[3:27:21.600 --> 3:27:24.600]  I'm here trying to give you a real geopolitical view into this.
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:30.600]  Did Georgia not blow the hell out of an entire city and massacre a bunch of Russian troops and peacekeepers
[3:27:30.600 --> 3:27:33.600]  out of a clear blue sky where they've been since 1991,
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:37.600]  in a ceasefire in two areas that have always been part of Russia?
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:39.600]  Ossetia?
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:41.600]  Go ahead.
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:43.600]  Wait a minute, if what you say were true,
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:50.600]  the first thing they would have done was blow that tunnel between the Ossetia and North Ossetia,
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:52.600]  the Rocky Tunnel.
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:54.600]  You can only get tanks or trucks in one area.
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:27:56.600]  Hold on, what are you saying I'm lying about?
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:27:58.600]  Well, what I'm saying is-
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:00.600]  I mean, Georgia admits they snuck attack Russia.
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:02.600]  I doubt that.
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:04.600]  Hold on a minute, I'm going to put you on hold.
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:06.600]  This is too insane.
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:09.600]  Okay, I mean, Georgia-
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:11.600]  Tarpley, what do you say to something like this?
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:13.600]  Well, this is the U.S. media line.
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:15.600]  This is CNN. This is what Bush says.
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:18.600]  This is what Zalme Khalilzad says at the United Nations.
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:21.600]  What McCain says and what Obama says, and it's a big lie.
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:23.600]  It's a Goebbels big lie.
[3:28:23.600 --> 3:28:25.600]  The aggressor is Georgia.
[3:28:25.600 --> 3:28:27.600]  You have whatever the status quo was.
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:30.600]  The Russian peacekeepers were there under a signed agreement
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:32.600]  with the Georgian government from 15 years ago.
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:36.600]  And let me add, the Georgians had already been taking potshots
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:38.600]  at the Russian troops and citizens beating people up,
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:41.600]  killing them in the outlying towns around Ossetia.
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:45.600]  Ethnic cleansing, that's what the Russians had to come in in 1992-93.
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:49.600]  And then let me expand, they shut the water off to Ossetia
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:51.600]  a month ago and already had them under siege.
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:55.600]  And they basically had a campaign of bombings and assassinations
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:28:56.600]  building up to this.
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:28:59.600]  So it's a cynical orchestrated plan by Georgia.
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:01.600]  Now the Russians see it coming and they say,
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:04.600]  come on, you want to attack, we'll be ready for you.
[3:29:04.600 --> 3:29:07.600]  And the minute they attack, they took the bridge and the tunnels.
[3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:10.600]  I would also ask, ultimately, beyond all the details,
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:14.600]  you want to have your children incinerated in a thermonuclear fireball
[3:29:14.600 --> 3:29:17.600]  for the sake of that bandit, that little Hitler, Sakashvili.
[3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:18.600]  That's crazy.
[3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:20.600]  Look, I'm going to come back to you, Steve.
[3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:22.600]  We're going to skip this break, too, for infowars.com.
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:24.600]  It's got to go to those streams, folks.
[3:29:24.600 --> 3:29:27.600]  But, I mean, this is completely, Steve, I'm blown away here.
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:32.600]  You think I'd go on air and lie to you about Georgia attacking Russia?
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:35.600]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[3:29:35.600 --> 3:29:38.600]  I mean, are you serious, Steve?
[3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:41.600]  Bring Steve back up.
[3:29:41.600 --> 3:29:43.600]  Steve, are you there?
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:46.600]  We're going to break and see if we can get Steve raised back up on the phone.
[3:29:46.600 --> 3:29:48.600]  Steve, it's just incredible.
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:51.600]  I mean, all I do is report the facts here.
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:53.600]  And I'm living in La La Land.
[3:29:53.600 --> 3:29:57.600]  More of your calls right now. Stay with us.
[3:29:57.600 --> 3:30:00.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:30:00.600 --> 3:30:06.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:06.600 --> 3:30:10.600]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[3:30:10.600 --> 3:30:13.600]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:16.600]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[3:30:16.600 --> 3:30:17.600]  But who is the enemy?
[3:30:17.600 --> 3:30:18.600]  Bin Laden.
[3:30:18.600 --> 3:30:19.600]  This is his MO.
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:21.600]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:30:21.600 --> 3:30:23.600]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:30:23.600 --> 3:30:26.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[3:30:26.600 --> 3:30:30.600]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:30:30.600 --> 3:30:33.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[3:30:33.600 --> 3:30:37.600]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:30:37.600 --> 3:30:41.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:30:41.600 --> 3:30:45.600]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[3:30:45.600 --> 3:30:48.600]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:51.600]  peace and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:30:51.600 --> 3:30:52.600]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:37.600]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[3:31:37.600 --> 3:31:39.600]  Travel less, meet online.

[3:33:12.600 --> 3:33:14.600]  Okay.
[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:16.600]  We were just talking to Rico
[3:33:16.600 --> 3:33:18.600]  on the infowars.com behind the scenes streams.
[3:33:18.600 --> 3:33:20.600]  You go to infowars.com.
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:23.600]  Those specific exclusive streams of the behind the scenes.
[3:33:23.600 --> 3:33:26.600]  We are talking to Rico and Toronto.
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:28.600]  He brought up how the Big Foundations fund La Raza,
[3:33:28.600 --> 3:33:32.600]  Machia, the radical Black Separatist groups, all of this
[3:33:32.600 --> 3:33:34.600]  to get us all fighting with each other,
[3:33:34.600 --> 3:33:37.600]  and so then they can radicalize peaceful groups
[3:33:37.600 --> 3:33:39.600]  so those groups never get true equality or freedom
[3:33:39.600 --> 3:33:41.600]  or economic mobility.
[3:33:41.600 --> 3:33:44.600]  They get neutralized, bitter, and filled with hate.
[3:33:44.600 --> 3:33:46.600]  More Balkanization, Webster Tarbley.
[3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:48.600]  This is an absolutely critical theme,
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:50.600]  and you're absolutely right.
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:52.600]  If you look first of all at Obama,
[3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:54.600]  he is more than anything else a product of the foundation.
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:33:57.600]  His mother was an operative for the Ford Foundation.
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:00.600]  Obama has worked for the Gamaliel Foundation,
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:03.600]  the Joyce Foundation, gun control, the Woods Fund,
[3:34:03.600 --> 3:34:05.600]  the Annenberg Foundation,
[3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:09.600]  playing Black parents against the Black Teachers Union.
[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:12.600]  His friend Bernardine Dorn gets huge money
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:14.600]  from the MacArthur Foundation.
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:16.600]  My research for my next book,
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:20.600]  which is Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography,
[3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:23.600]  reveals that the weathermen were actually founded
[3:34:23.600 --> 3:34:25.600]  with a Ford Foundation grant.
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:28.600]  Certainly, Floyd McKissick, Stokely Carmichael,
[3:34:28.600 --> 3:34:31.600]  the worst firebrands, Wrapped Brown,
[3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:34.600]  these characters, the people who opposed Martin Luther King
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:37.600]  with their incendiary rhetoric, all foundation funded.
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:39.600]  And as you correctly point out,
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:42.600]  the worst provocateurs of the Hispanic community,
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:44.600]  the people who talk this insanity
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:46.600]  about carving up the United States,
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:48.600]  they're also foundation funded.
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:53.600]  Obama has friends like Khalidi and a bunch of others.
[3:34:53.600 --> 3:34:58.600]  This is the foundation funded pro-US wing of the PLO.
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:01.600]  Among the Native Americans, you've got a guy like Ward Churchill,
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:04.600]  who is essentially in the same corner.
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:07.600]  The pervasive activity of these foundations
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:11.600]  is one of the things that's destroying American society.
[3:35:11.600 --> 3:35:14.600]  Obama is somebody who says he was a community organizer
[3:35:14.600 --> 3:35:16.600]  for the Gamaliel Foundation.
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:18.600]  What he's really saying is,
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:21.600]  I was a poverty pimp for the foundation world,
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:25.600]  the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation dominate.
[3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:28.600]  This is one of the principal things about Obama.
[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:30.600]  This is what he comes from, his world,
[3:35:30.600 --> 3:35:32.600]  that stuff about the bitter clingers,
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:34.600]  the people who cling to religion and guns,
[3:35:34.600 --> 3:35:36.600]  and anti-trade.
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:39.600]  That is the foundation trilateral point of view.
[3:35:39.600 --> 3:35:43.600]  You cannot have a president who hates the American people.
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:46.600]  In the case of Obama, he does hate the American people,
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:49.600]  and therefore he's going to attack this austerity program
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:51.600]  with great gusto.
[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:54.600]  Unlike Carter, who probably had some Christian scruples about it,
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:56.600]  Obama will have nothing of the sort,
[3:35:56.600 --> 3:35:59.600]  because he's been worshiping in a Ford Foundation church
[3:35:59.600 --> 3:36:01.600]  that Reverend Jeremiah Wright,
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:04.600]  with Dwight Hopkins as an operative of the Ford Foundation,
[3:36:04.600 --> 3:36:07.600]  Reverend Otis Moss got through college with the Ford Foundation,
[3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:11.600]  this whole James Cohn Black Liberation Theology is again
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:15.600]  the Ford Foundation Union Theological Seminary School of this stuff,
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:19.600]  and it is designed to perpetuate racial conflict.
[3:36:19.600 --> 3:36:22.600]  Absolutely, and they fund all these groups,
[3:36:22.600 --> 3:36:25.600]  they do it to get everybody at each other's throats,
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:29.600]  and then the racial tension becomes real,
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:31.600]  and then it's a dynamo,
[3:36:31.600 --> 3:36:34.600]  which just builds up force and strength.
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:36.600]  Anything else, Rico?
[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:39.600]  My second point, something you brought up a couple weeks ago
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:43.600]  when you were talking about the antrax letter
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:45.600]  that the Bush enemy received?
[3:36:45.600 --> 3:36:46.600]  Yes.
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:48.600]  I remember reading quickly,
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:52.600]  just the Roman Empire,
[3:36:52.600 --> 3:36:54.600]  and it was the same thing.
[3:36:54.600 --> 3:36:55.600]  It was the same thing.
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:36:58.600]  Cicero, a little bit before Cicero came into power,
[3:36:58.600 --> 3:37:01.600]  Cicero was saying how the enemies of Rome
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:05.600]  need to be dealt with, have received letters,
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:07.600]  letters that say that a couple senators
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:09.600]  are going to be mass assassinated,
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:11.600]  so we need to clamp down.
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:13.600]  This worked a thousand years ago.
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:14.600]  It works again.
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:16.600]  It's the same thing.
[3:37:16.600 --> 3:37:17.600]  Nothing's changed.
[3:37:17.600 --> 3:37:18.600]  Well, that's what's incredible.
[3:37:18.600 --> 3:37:19.600]  I appreciate your call.
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:22.600]  Yeah, I bought a high school textbook.
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:24.600]  It was at Barnes & Noble.
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:27.600]  I think it's 3,000 years of revolution,
[3:37:27.600 --> 3:37:29.600]  and it's pretty accurate, actually,
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:31.600]  but you just look at every country,
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:32.600]  and just the thousands of revolutions
[3:37:32.600 --> 3:37:34.600]  and all the subterfuge and backstabbing
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:37.600]  and Machiavellian activity and elites
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:39.600]  and cloaking dagger,
[3:37:39.600 --> 3:37:41.600]  and then somehow they taught the American people
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:43.600]  the last 100 years that none of that exists,
[3:37:43.600 --> 3:37:45.600]  everything's fine, go back to sleep,
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:47.600]  and if we say anything on this show,
[3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:49.600]  it's just start looking around you
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:51.600]  and realizing that when these elites
[3:37:51.600 --> 3:37:53.600]  get out of control and these warlords
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:55.600]  and these banker warlords start fighting
[3:37:55.600 --> 3:37:58.600]  with each other, the oligarchy, as Webster calls them,
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:01.600]  when these moneyed noble interests
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:03.600]  start battling with each other,
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:04.600]  we don't matter in the equation.
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:06.600]  We get hurt real bad,
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:09.600]  and this is just a game of chess for them.
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:11.600]  People say, well, why do they want more power?
[3:38:11.600 --> 3:38:12.600]  They're already so rich.
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:14.600]  Anybody who knows rich people knows they want even more.
[3:38:14.600 --> 3:38:16.600]  They want power.
[3:38:16.600 --> 3:38:18.600]  They want control and to deny that there are people
[3:38:18.600 --> 3:38:20.600]  that want power and control is to deny history.
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:22.600]  Webster, I want to go calls quickly,
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:24.600]  but how did we get to the point, do you think,
[3:38:24.600 --> 3:38:25.600]  of the average person?
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:27.600]  They're now coming out of this delusion
[3:38:27.600 --> 3:38:30.600]  and this mesmerized smokescreen,
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:32.600]  but people say, oh, there's no subterfuge,
[3:38:32.600 --> 3:38:34.600]  there's no corruption, there's no influence,
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:36.600]  there's no behind the scenes.
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:38.600]  You're a crazy, dangerous conspiracy theorist.
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:41.600]  How were they able to inculcate that in people's minds?
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:43.600]  Well, it's a long process of degradation.
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:45.600]  I think that the federal question is probably
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:47.600]  the deindustrialization of the United States
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:51.600]  initiated by Volcker under trilateral Carter
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:53.600]  and Brzezinski auspices,
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:38:56.600]  and then continued with the union busting
[3:38:56.600 --> 3:38:59.600]  of the Reagan years, the systematic decline
[3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:01.600]  in the standard of living.
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:04.600]  That's about minus two-thirds of what it had been
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:06.600]  around 1966 or 1967.
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:09.600]  And so people are having to work twice as hard
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:11.600]  just to keep the illusion going,
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:13.600]  and so they physically are just disconnected
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:15.600]  saying, I don't care.
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:17.600]  There's also more recently,
[3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:19.600]  Obama could not have broken through
[3:39:19.600 --> 3:39:21.600]  if the Democratic Party had not been in chaos,
[3:39:21.600 --> 3:39:23.600]  and part of that is Pelosi.
[3:39:23.600 --> 3:39:25.600]  Pelosi came in with the mandate
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:27.600]  of stopping the Iraq war,
[3:39:27.600 --> 3:39:29.600]  and she brought the...
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:32.600]  And what we then had is, as soon as that was in power,
[3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:34.600]  then Al Gore comes out of the woodwork
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:38.600]  with his demagogic fake global warming campaign
[3:39:38.600 --> 3:39:41.600]  to break the momentum against Bush
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:43.600]  and against the Iraq war,
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:45.600]  and then by the end of that year,
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:48.600]  you've got Obama deployed into a chaotic Democratic party.
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:50.600]  Let me stop you, because I want to go to Elliott Jeff,
[3:39:50.600 --> 3:39:53.600]  Cliff, and others, and then a DJ.
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:39:55.600]  But before we do that, I wanted to last hour
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:39:57.600]  get into the eugenics angle,
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:39:59.600]  because you're a real expert on Webster.
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:01.600]  I mean, I know my stuff on this.
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:03.600]  I wrote over 20 books on the subject and studied it,
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:05.600]  and you know even more in some cases than I do.
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:07.600]  In a nutshell,
[3:40:07.600 --> 3:40:09.600]  why do they want to reduce our numbers?
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:11.600]  Why do they want to enslave us?
[3:40:11.600 --> 3:40:13.600]  Why do they want to bring feudalism back in?
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:16.600]  It's just the instincts of the Anglo-American feudal lords.
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:18.600]  And I mean, break that down
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:21.600]  what the fake modern environmentalism is.
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:24.600]  Well, one is the population side.
[3:40:24.600 --> 3:40:27.600]  The oligarchy always argues that there are two main problems
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:29.600]  in the world. One is overpopulation.
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:32.600]  The other is industrial pollution in some form.
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:35.600]  To be an oligarch means that you've got to hate
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:38.600]  the majority of humanity by thinking that you're
[3:40:38.600 --> 3:40:40.600]  better off than they were.
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:43.600]  You can go back to the works of Hesiod in ancient Greece,
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:46.600]  pretty much the beginning of the sort of archaic
[3:40:46.600 --> 3:40:48.600]  Greek literature.
[3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:50.600]  The reason for the Trojan War
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:52.600]  was that there were too many people.
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:54.600]  Too many people were oppressing
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:40:56.600]  the breast of Mother Earth,
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:40:58.600]  and therefore we had to have the Trojan War
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:00.600]  to kill off a lot of them.
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:02.600]  In terms of the global warming,
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:05.600]  I don't need a climatologist to say that this is a fraud.
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:07.600]  As a historian, I can look back
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:09.600]  to the medieval war period,
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:11.600]  1100, 1200,
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:13.600]  when you have grapes growing in England,
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:15.600]  grapes growing in...
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:17.600]  What about Hyperium Maxim, 8,000 years ago,
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:19.600]  which brought us into the Bronze Age
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:22.600]  and the first city-stage?
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:24.600]  I mean, it was 10 degrees hotter on average then.
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:26.600]  They have the ice cores. There's no doubting.
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:29.600]  We are well within the band of fluctuation
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:31.600]  of historical memory.
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:34.600]  The other one, of course, is we have a little ice age
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:36.600]  around 1600 to 1625,
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:39.600]  which corresponds to the Spurro Minimum
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:42.600]  and the Maunder Minimum in the Sunspot Cycle.
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:45.600]  It is basically determined by solar activity.
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:47.600]  That's at least a major input,
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:49.600]  not by human activity at all.
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:51.600]  And in that little ice age,
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:53.600]  you had the ports of Northern Europe,
[3:41:53.600 --> 3:41:55.600]  the ports of Germany and the Netherlands
[3:41:55.600 --> 3:41:57.600]  with ice, icebergs.
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:41:59.600]  The idea being a climatologist
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:01.600]  means you're a charlatan and a fraud
[3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:03.600]  because it's a discipline.
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:05.600]  It's not meteorology.
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:07.600]  It's not oceanography.
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:09.600]  It's not any science. It's not history.
[3:42:09.600 --> 3:42:11.600]  It's a fake science invented by Al Gore.
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:13.600]  And all during the Clinton years,
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:15.600]  if you didn't agree with Al Gore,
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:17.600]  you would be fired.
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:19.600]  He claims he invented the Internet, too.
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:21.600]  He certainly is the pimp pusher of it,
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:23.600]  but the Club of Rome in the early 60s
[3:42:23.600 --> 3:42:25.600]  said they would use threat of a fake ice age
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:27.600]  or global warming to bring in global taxes.
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:29.600]  And remember, Aurelio Pecce,
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:31.600]  the co-founder, was an old fascist
[3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:33.600]  and the other one was Alexander King,
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:35.600]  who once admitted that the purpose of this
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:37.600]  was genocide in the Third World.
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:39.600]  He said, you know, the reason we preach this after all
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:41.600]  is to block development of the Third World.
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:43.600]  That is still the same.
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:45.600]  And that's in the British Commission
[3:42:45.600 --> 3:42:47.600]  on Population 44 to 49,
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:49.600]  which was rolled into State Department
[3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:51.600]  Memorandum 200.
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:53.600]  Yes, and beyond the 200,
[3:42:53.600 --> 3:42:55.600]  remember that this was all institutionalized
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:42:57.600]  under Carter, under Muskie,
[3:42:57.600 --> 3:42:59.600]  as global 2000
[3:42:59.600 --> 3:43:01.600]  and global futures under Brzezinski
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:03.600]  trilateral Rockefeller auspices.
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:05.600]  So you basically got Kissinger
[3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:07.600]  as a puppet of Nelson Rockefeller,
[3:43:07.600 --> 3:43:09.600]  Brzezinski as a puppet of David Rockefeller,
[3:43:09.600 --> 3:43:11.600]  and that's pretty much the way the thing is run.
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:13.600]  Continue. Plush that out.
[3:43:13.600 --> 3:43:15.600]  Well, then, you know,
[3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:17.600]  the idea of having
[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:19.600]  a world population reduction
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:21.600]  idea that milleridge genocide
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:23.600]  built into the U.S.
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:25.600]  foreign policy is this global
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:27.600]  2000 global futures,
[3:43:27.600 --> 3:43:29.600]  and then what do they do?
[3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:31.600]  They turn around and implement that by supporting
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:33.600]  Paul Pot, who goes very far,
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:35.600]  he's the champion in terms of
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:37.600]  proportional genocide.
[3:43:37.600 --> 3:43:39.600]  I think he manages to kill 30 to 40%
[3:43:39.600 --> 3:43:41.600]  of the Cambodian population
[3:43:41.600 --> 3:43:43.600]  and Khomeini, who aborts
[3:43:43.600 --> 3:43:45.600]  the entire industrialization process
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:47.600]  of Iran.
[3:43:47.600 --> 3:43:49.600]  What they're trying to show is that third-world
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:51.600]  populations can be organized
[3:43:51.600 --> 3:43:53.600]  against themselves to destroy themselves.
[3:43:53.600 --> 3:43:55.600]  And ultimately, that's what Obama is.
[3:43:55.600 --> 3:43:57.600]  A fascist mass movement is
[3:43:57.600 --> 3:43:59.600]  the organization of a population
[3:43:59.600 --> 3:44:01.600]  against itself to destroy itself
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:03.600]  in the service of these financiers.
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:05.600]  Let's go to
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:07.600]  Elliott in Ohio. You're on the air.
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:09.600]  So
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:11.600]  I
[3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:13.600]  researched this maybe two days ago.
[3:44:13.600 --> 3:44:15.600]  Have you heard of the first
[3:44:15.600 --> 3:44:17.600]  13th amendment?
[3:44:17.600 --> 3:44:19.600]  No, I'm afraid I haven't. Go ahead.
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:21.600]  I was on
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:23.600]  Jordan Maxwell site, and then I went to one of
[3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:25.600]  his lengths. And yeah, in
[3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:27.600]  1983, these two guys
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:29.600]  research expert David Dodge and
[3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:31.600]  former Baltimore police investigator Tom
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:33.600]  Dunn, they were in
[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:35.600]  the Belfast library on the coast
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:37.600]  of Maine. They found a
[3:44:37.600 --> 3:44:39.600]  constitution from 1825
[3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:41.600]  and
[3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:43.600]  there was actually
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:45.600]  a missing 13th amendment in our
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:47.600]  constitution. It was ratified and 1819
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:49.600]  has not been repealed.
[3:44:49.600 --> 3:44:51.600]  There were more than 30
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:53.600]  original broadsheets made and quite a few
[3:44:53.600 --> 3:44:55.600]  of them are still around.
[3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:57.600]  I've heard of, well, go ahead.
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:44:59.600]  Well, I mean, it's
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:01.600]  a title of nobility and honor. It says,
[3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:03.600]  if any citizen of the United States shall
[3:45:03.600 --> 3:45:05.600]  claim receive or retain any
[3:45:05.600 --> 3:45:07.600]  title of nobility or honor
[3:45:07.600 --> 3:45:09.600]  or shall without consent of Congress
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:11.600]  accept and retain any present pension
[3:45:11.600 --> 3:45:13.600]  office or a malument.
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:15.600]  Yeah, speak of the devil. John, I
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:17.600]  sent you that clip from C-Span
[3:45:17.600 --> 3:45:19.600]  of
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:21.600]  former Secretary of State Colin Powell
[3:45:21.600 --> 3:45:23.600]  telling the reporter that he's a night commander
[3:45:23.600 --> 3:45:25.600]  order of the bath. Will you cue that up, police?
[3:45:25.600 --> 3:45:27.600]  Thank you. Go ahead,
[3:45:27.600 --> 3:45:29.600]  Elliot.
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:31.600]  Yeah, retain any present pension office or malument
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:33.600]  or whatever
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:35.600]  from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign
[3:45:35.600 --> 3:45:37.600]  power such person shall
[3:45:37.600 --> 3:45:39.600]  cease to be a citizen of the United States.
[3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:41.600]  Yeah, so it's saying you can't be a foreign agent
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:43.600]  basically, which makes sense.
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:45.600]  I have a certain background. Now I know
[3:45:45.600 --> 3:45:47.600]  what you're talking about and it does exist.
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:45:49.600]  And I wrote about this in
[3:45:49.600 --> 3:45:51.600]  1996 in Executive Intelligence
[3:45:51.600 --> 3:45:53.600]  Review. You might find it on the internet.
[3:45:53.600 --> 3:45:55.600]  It's an article that says U.S. Constitution
[3:45:55.600 --> 3:45:57.600]  bars Powell from
[3:45:57.600 --> 3:45:59.600]  the presidency because he had become this
[3:45:59.600 --> 3:46:01.600]  nobleman. Yeah, we do know of it.
[3:46:01.600 --> 3:46:03.600]  The U.S. Constitution right now
[3:46:03.600 --> 3:46:05.600]  says you cannot hold
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:07.600]  an office of profit and trust under the
[3:46:07.600 --> 3:46:09.600]  United States. In other words, you can't be in the
[3:46:09.600 --> 3:46:11.600]  Executive Branch or the Supreme Court
[3:46:11.600 --> 3:46:13.600]  if you accept the title of nobility.
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:15.600]  And that plays into the Logan Act
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:17.600]  as in the code
[3:46:17.600 --> 3:46:19.600]  blocking that. But this one goes
[3:46:19.600 --> 3:46:21.600]  further. It says if you accept such a title
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:23.600]  of nobility, you cease to be a citizen.
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:25.600]  Yes, it's currently in there. That's where I am.
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:27.600]  I was ready to attack Rudy
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:29.600]  Giuliani would have been coming under attack
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:31.600]  from me on this if
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:33.600]  he had gotten the Republican nomination.
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:35.600]  Yes, Eliot, that is legitimate. You refresh our memory. Thank you.
[3:46:35.600 --> 3:46:37.600]  And speaking of Powell and the nobility,
[3:46:37.600 --> 3:46:39.600]  here is the audio clip right now.
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:41.600]  And on
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:43.600]  Night Commander of the Order of the Matter
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:45.600]  is the Night Commander of the Order of the
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:47.600]  Matter.
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:49.600]  Your Majesty gave it to
[3:46:49.600 --> 3:46:51.600]  Almond to me about 12 years ago.
[3:46:51.600 --> 3:46:53.600]  Night Commander
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:55.600]  Listen carefully.
[3:46:55.600 --> 3:46:57.600]  Night Commander of the Order of the Matter.
[3:47:01.600 --> 3:47:03.600]  We have the video clip up on
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:05.600]  infowars.com. We put it up there
[3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:07.600]  when Queen Elizabeth II was here in town
[3:47:07.600 --> 3:47:09.600]  last year
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:11.600]  surveying her lands.
[3:47:11.600 --> 3:47:13.600]  They had a White House function. They were
[3:47:13.600 --> 3:47:15.600]  announcing who they were
[3:47:15.600 --> 3:47:17.600]  and much of the administration coming in
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:19.600]  were being announced by their British titles
[3:47:19.600 --> 3:47:21.600]  and giving
[3:47:21.600 --> 3:47:23.600]  field to the Queenie.
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:25.600]  That answers your question. Eliot, let's go to
[3:47:25.600 --> 3:47:27.600]  Cliff in Virginia.
[3:47:27.600 --> 3:47:29.600]  Cliff here on the air. Go ahead.
[3:47:31.600 --> 3:47:33.600]  Hello? Yes, Cliff, go ahead.
[3:47:33.600 --> 3:47:35.600]  Yeah, how you doing today?
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:37.600]  Enjoying your show, by the way, also.
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:39.600]  My question
[3:47:39.600 --> 3:47:41.600]  is there,
[3:47:41.600 --> 3:47:43.600]  Mr. Tarpley,
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:45.600]  I read a report several months ago here
[3:47:45.600 --> 3:47:47.600]  where China sent word to
[3:47:47.600 --> 3:47:49.600]  Illuminati operatives that
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:51.600]  if they tried to indeed, you know, make any
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:53.600]  aggression toward China
[3:47:53.600 --> 3:47:55.600]  and it, shall I say, they're
[3:47:55.600 --> 3:47:57.600]  France, which will be Russia
[3:47:57.600 --> 3:47:59.600]  and Iran via their
[3:47:59.600 --> 3:48:01.600]  friendship packs they have and
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:03.600]  all obligation deals.
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:05.600]  What will be the next move
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:07.600]  for the Illuminati now that
[3:48:07.600 --> 3:48:09.600]  Bush, more or less, has gotten
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:11.600]  punched in the mouth by Putin over
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:13.600]  this Georgia fiasco
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:15.600]  and the fact that China
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:17.600]  said, plainly stated that
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:19.600]  any aggression made toward China
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:21.600]  people around the Illuminati
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:23.600]  would be assassinated.
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:25.600]  I mean, there's two questions there.
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:27.600]  What do you think of Benjamin Fulford, the
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:29.600]  former Forbes writer who meets with
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:31.600]  Rockefeller on video and says he's been
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:33.600]  told by the Asian elite, the mafia
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:35.600]  that they know about the population
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:37.600]  reduction plan and the bio-weapon attack
[3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:39.600]  plan that Cheney talks about, the PNAC
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:41.600]  documents, September 2000, Rebuilding
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:43.600]  America's Defenses. So, I mean, what do
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:45.600]  you think of that and then B,
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:47.600]  again, kind of a recap
[3:48:47.600 --> 3:48:49.600]  of why does this, what does this do
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:51.600]  now that this didn't go well in Georgia?
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:53.600]  Let me do it the other way.
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:48:55.600]  I don't use this concept of Illuminati
[3:48:55.600 --> 3:48:57.600]  because I think this is just pure confusion.
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:48:59.600]  The notion that a society
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:01.600]  founded in Bavaria runs the world
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:03.600]  in my view is
[3:49:03.600 --> 3:49:05.600]  just absurd. What you're dealing with
[3:49:05.600 --> 3:49:07.600]  is the city of London,
[3:49:07.600 --> 3:49:09.600]  British and Wall Street,
[3:49:09.600 --> 3:49:11.600]  the U.S. That's the operative
[3:49:11.600 --> 3:49:13.600]  unit and these terms like
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:15.600]  New World Order and Illuminati, I think
[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:17.600]  they contribute to confusion
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:19.600]  rather than power. Even though all these
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:21.600]  presidents use them and hail it
[3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:23.600]  and swear sovereignly. Yeah, look, the origin of this
[3:49:23.600 --> 3:49:25.600]  Illuminati, though, is British intelligence.
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:27.600]  I know. They're here to say, oh,
[3:49:27.600 --> 3:49:29.600]  you're not the main enemy in the world.
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:31.600]  Those Bavarians are the main enemy.
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:33.600]  This is just crazy. Let me break this down
[3:49:33.600 --> 3:49:35.600]  for you, Webster. There is
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:37.600]  an element to all of this. The elites
[3:49:37.600 --> 3:49:39.600]  are obsessed with the occult.
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:41.600]  The British system, let me finish.
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:43.600]  Please, is Masonic
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:45.600]  and they really are into this and they really
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:47.600]  do govern a lot of what they do
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:49.600]  according to it. Sure, but now you're talking
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:51.600]  the Scottish right Freemasons
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:53.600]  of London and, you know, God knows other
[3:49:53.600 --> 3:49:55.600]  institutions that they have. The Club
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:49:57.600]  of the Isles and all sorts of other things.
[3:49:57.600 --> 3:49:59.600]  But again, this Bavarian thing,
[3:49:59.600 --> 3:50:01.600]  this is the crazy part. This is what
[3:50:01.600 --> 3:50:03.600]  the British themselves put out to say.
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:05.600]  Well, that was just one agent. That was
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:07.600]  Wysop and the guy got struck by lightning.
[3:50:07.600 --> 3:50:09.600]  Thank you so much.
[3:50:09.600 --> 3:50:11.600]  Wait, let's do the Fulford part. There is
[3:50:11.600 --> 3:50:13.600]  a history of secret societies
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:15.600]  in China. For example, Dr. Sun Yat Sen,
[3:50:15.600 --> 3:50:17.600]  when he wanted to do the Chinese Revolution
[3:50:17.600 --> 3:50:19.600]  in 1911, turned
[3:50:19.600 --> 3:50:21.600]  to something called the Red Door
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:23.600]  Society, the Hung Man
[3:50:23.600 --> 3:50:25.600]  or Hung Men Society.
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:27.600]  However, I think
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:29.600]  this stuff now is, you have to look at this
[3:50:29.600 --> 3:50:31.600]  with tremendous skepticism and here's why.
[3:50:31.600 --> 3:50:33.600]  Suppose we have
[3:50:33.600 --> 3:50:35.600]  the Turkmenistan
[3:50:35.600 --> 3:50:37.600]  Islamic party
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:39.600]  setting off some stunt
[3:50:39.600 --> 3:50:41.600]  in Beijing now for the Olympics.
[3:50:41.600 --> 3:50:43.600]  If that's terrorism,
[3:50:43.600 --> 3:50:45.600]  either Mexico City
[3:50:45.600 --> 3:50:47.600]  68 or
[3:50:47.600 --> 3:50:49.600]  Munich 72 style,
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:51.600]  you're going to have a wave of international
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:53.600]  sympathy with China.
[3:50:53.600 --> 3:50:55.600]  Suppose now the Anglo-Americans have come
[3:50:55.600 --> 3:50:57.600]  up with a dialectical or two-phase
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:50:59.600]  false flag.
[3:50:59.600 --> 3:51:01.600]  Hold on, we're going to do three minutes behind the scenes,

[3:54:28.600 --> 3:54:30.600]  I want to tell you about a fine sponsor,

[3:54:39.600 --> 3:54:41.600]  pure clean water, without the fluoride
[3:54:41.600 --> 3:54:43.600]  and limited water from the humidity in the air,
[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:45.600]  you use a solar panel system to run it,
[3:54:45.600 --> 3:54:47.600]  plug it into the wall, machine produces up to
[3:54:47.600 --> 3:54:50.600]  7.5 gallons in a day in wetter areas,
[3:54:50.600 --> 3:54:54.600]  3 gallons, at least 2.5 gallons even in the worst deserts,
[3:54:54.600 --> 3:54:56.600]  with the lowest humidity, just an amazing system,
[3:54:56.600 --> 3:54:58.600]  great tasting pure H2O,

[3:55:18.600 --> 3:55:21.600]  Okay, let's jam in quickly here.
[3:55:21.600 --> 3:55:23.600]  Let's jam in.
[3:55:23.600 --> 3:55:25.600]  Jeff in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[3:55:25.600 --> 3:55:27.600]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:29.600]  First-time caller, but a long-time listener.
[3:55:29.600 --> 3:55:32.600]  I'll be brief since I know you're short on time.
[3:55:32.600 --> 3:55:36.600]  This relates, this does relate to what you've been talking about.
[3:55:36.600 --> 3:55:38.600]  I read a link this morning.
[3:55:38.600 --> 3:55:40.600]  It was from the Financial Times of London.
[3:55:40.600 --> 3:55:42.600]  It was written by Peter Garnam.
[3:55:42.600 --> 3:55:45.600]  And it's just a couple sentences long.
[3:55:45.600 --> 3:55:48.600]  Ulrich Leutman at Commerce Bank said in a note
[3:55:48.600 --> 3:55:51.600]  that he expected the dollar to rise, quote,
[3:55:51.600 --> 3:55:53.600]  like a Phoenix, quote, unquote.
[3:55:53.600 --> 3:55:57.600]  And he also said that in a very short period of time, quote, unquote,
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:55:59.600]  sentiment turned by 180 degrees.
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:03.600]  The market now believes that the U.S. economy, once again,
[3:56:03.600 --> 3:56:06.600]  will be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly.
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:08.600]  But they've said this three times in the last year.
[3:56:08.600 --> 3:56:11.600]  It always goes up and then further down the next time.
[3:56:11.600 --> 3:56:13.600]  I hope it goes up and they can artificially do it.
[3:56:13.600 --> 3:56:15.600]  But all the real market fundamental show,
[3:56:15.600 --> 3:56:17.600]  the dollar has been devalued.
[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:18.600]  They keep printing it.
[3:56:18.600 --> 3:56:21.600]  You have this debt, liquidity, hundreds of millions a month
[3:56:21.600 --> 3:56:23.600]  being pumped into financial institutions.
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:25.600]  Webster, what do you see happening?
[3:56:25.600 --> 3:56:28.600]  The main thing you have is a violent contraction of employment
[3:56:28.600 --> 3:56:29.600]  and production.
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:31.600]  Detroit is collapsing.
[3:56:31.600 --> 3:56:33.600]  The big three automakers are collapsing.
[3:56:33.600 --> 3:56:35.600]  Their subcontractors are collapsing.
[3:56:35.600 --> 3:56:38.600]  Generally speaking, manufacturing employment in this country
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:40.600]  is really on its last leg.
[3:56:40.600 --> 3:56:45.600]  So this contraction, which is expressed in growing unemployment
[3:56:45.600 --> 3:56:47.600]  and growing unreported unemployment,
[3:56:47.600 --> 3:56:50.600]  those who have given up into spare,
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:53.600]  we'd have to look at things like freight car loadings
[3:56:53.600 --> 3:56:57.600]  and truck loadings, real, tangible, physical, economic indices.
[3:56:57.600 --> 3:56:59.600]  And you will see that this economy is approaching the point
[3:56:59.600 --> 3:57:01.600]  of thermodynamic breakdown.
[3:57:01.600 --> 3:57:03.600]  And they're telling us everything's wonderful.
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:06.600]  After that, the financial panic will happen.
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:07.600]  They put these stories out.
[3:57:07.600 --> 3:57:10.600]  The plunge protection team, of course, as everybody knows,
[3:57:10.600 --> 3:57:13.600]  props them up with the help of helicopter bin Bernanke.
[3:57:13.600 --> 3:57:15.600]  They've now got the entire Wall Street,
[3:57:15.600 --> 3:57:18.600]  the JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman,

[3:59:00.600 --> 3:59:03.600]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:59:03.600 --> 3:59:06.600]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[3:59:06.600 --> 3:59:07.600]  But who is the enemy?
[3:59:07.600 --> 3:59:08.600]  bin Laden.

[3:59:09.600 --> 3:59:11.600]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:59:11.600 --> 3:59:13.600]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.

[3:59:20.600 --> 3:59:23.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe that their Israelis, again,
[3:59:23.600 --> 3:59:27.600]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:59:27.600 --> 3:59:31.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:59:31.600 --> 3:59:33.600]  In Laden's connections to the CIA,

[3:59:38.600 --> 3:59:39.600]  warnings in war games,
