[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.190]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:43.229]  Real talk radio.
[00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.330]  That's what this radio transmission has always been about.
[00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.393]  It's really the original name of this radio show.
[00:00:49.393 --> 00:00:51.874]  It's also been called the Final Edition.
[00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:54.775]  You know, when I would do the last live show at a local station.
[00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:57.277]  Okay, we got Mark Dice with us, the resistance band Mephisto.
[00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:58.337]  We're gonna have him back on.
[00:00:58.337 --> 00:00:59.438]  Get it at markdice.com.
[00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:02.336]  I want to shift into 9-11.
[00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:09.462]  Uh, Barnas, what do you think of Mr. Corsi, and what do you think of Mark Dice, and what we just heard with him?
[00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:10.784]  It's throwing me under the bus.
[00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:16.789]  Oh, he's definitely throwing you under the bus a wee bit, but also, you know, I think Combs is throwing you under the bus.
[00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:24.416]  He also was contacted by you, has been on the show, and, uh, you know, he's the little Democratic cheerleader there, the little psy-op on that end of the spectrum.
[00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:32.023]  And he just loves to use you to discredit people when, in fact, Corsi a couple times just tried to say, look, I'm looking at the physicist's evidence.
[00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:36.087]  And, of course, he did have to backpedal and say, maybe there were some unanswered questions.
[00:01:36.087 --> 00:01:39.470]  But I'm saying that, you know, there's no way that the government helped cause 9-1-1.
[00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.574]  And, by the way, Corsi says his publisher will, quote, not let him come on the show.
[00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:45.374]  And he's under contract.
[00:01:45.374 --> 00:01:48.675]  Well, I mean, you got snubbed on Geraldo the other day and other Fox News.
[00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.656]  Yeah, they drove me down there, had me sit there.
[00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.556]  That's why I've always refused to fly there.
[00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:54.597]  They're always trying to get me to fly to New York.
[00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:56.357]  Like it's some Murdoch joke.
[00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:58.418]  And the last guy I sent up there, the plane almost crashed.
[00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.339]  It was like dropping 2,000 feet in thunderstorms.
[00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:02.359]  I'm sure that's a coincidence.
[00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.939]  Of course it is, yeah.
[00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.181]  You've probably got some New World Order person down there in a witch's hat and a big, like, ahhh, Xardaman!
[00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:10.741]  That'll get you, Jones!
[00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:12.459]  Anyways, it's crazy.
[00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.702]  Mark Dice, final comments.
[00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:29.842]  I want to announce, and I'll do this when I'm back on your show in a couple weeks, for, you know, 9-11, the anniversary's coming up here in about three weeks, and for those who can't make it to New York, or who can't go out to a local rally, or who just want to get involved but don't know what to do, I want to just announce Operation Phone Mob.
[00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:32.703]  So, I think on 9-11, it's a Thursday.
[00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:35.404]  Details will be posted at MarkDice.com.
[00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:36.865]  I'll email that out to everybody.
[00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:44.768]  I think that we need to get hundreds of people to call into the radio talk shows on that day, and let's get every single phone call to be one of us.
[00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:46.448]  Let's address the issues.
[00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:47.369]  Let's use this as an opportunity.
[00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.529]  What do you think of Corsi?
[00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.510]  I mean, this is becoming a big issue.
[00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:59.132]  You know, there was some cross-talk there between him and Combs, but he said, I don't know if people made it out, but he said he's never written anything in support of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:04.994]  So, he's in a rough position, but again, he's got a lot of responsibility.
[00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:06.035]  He probably knows the truth.
[00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:13.477]  He's the darling of the hardcore neocons, and then he's saying he's looking at Evans of Inside Job.
[00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.943]  And they're saying he's delusional about the North American Union.
[00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:17.564]  You know what it is?
[00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:29.973]  It's almost like, uh, when Ron Paul was initially interviewed by student scholars, and he said he would support a new investigation, although he didn't believe that it would really tell the truth, and then he'd even have to backpedal from that position when he got bigger.
[00:03:29.973 --> 00:03:40.702]  Well, of course he was able to come on your show, talk about Thurmite, but now that he's a New York Times number one bestseller and he's on all these shows, it's time to back off a bit, because 9-11 truth is just still too hot for some people.
[00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:42.410]  Oh yeah, they all know.
[00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.151]  They all know.
[00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:44.653]  Every single one of them.
[00:03:44.653 --> 00:03:46.716]  His book's already a best seller at this point.
[00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.018]  I think he has nothing to lose.
[00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:51.364]  He should just come out hard hitting and just state the facts.
[00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:57.477]  You know, I understand that his publisher is trying to backpedal and protect their financial net.
[00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:04.262]  He's always asking to come on the show because he knows my audience, with a few other shows, can push it up the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:07.884]  And I think his book's important, and you know, he's being attacked for saying it's disinfo.
[00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:10.726]  No, they're not attacking him on the book itself.
[00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:13.648]  They're attacking him on North American Union or 9-11.
[00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:17.129]  And so that's another issue.
[00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.011]  Why aren't they attacking him on the issues the book covers, Bermy?
[00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:26.312]  Well, I mean, they got some minute errors in there and they blow them out of proportion for the book.
[00:04:26.312 --> 00:04:29.073]  But like you said, they don't want to address the main stuff.
[00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:36.175]  I mean, he does get in the SPP right after the discussion about you on Hannity and Combs, you know, Securities and Prosperities Partnership.
[00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.956]  So the guy's obviously very, very smart.
[00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:40.557]  He's very, very hip to what this movement's doing.
[00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:43.058]  I do hope he comes out a little stronger for 9-11.
[00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:43.998]  Truth, I don't expect it.
[00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:46.199]  His words can't be taken back.
[00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.622]  That interview with you is monumental and should be played all over the place.
[00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.363]  I mean, let's be honest.
[00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:54.325]  Without 9-11 Truth, we're never going to take this country back.
[00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:55.345]  They're going to keep staging more.
[00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:58.147]  Yeah, and he can vote for Chuck Baldwin all he wants.
[00:04:58.147 --> 00:04:59.228]  It's not going to help us.
[00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:03.130]  And Chuck Baldwin isn't admitted to 9-11 Truth, but he knows all about the New World Order.
[00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.252]  Oh, that's a nexus point.
[00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:06.293]  Yeah, of course.
[00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:07.673]  Let's just go into it.
[00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:11.236]  Dr. Corsi denies 9-11 Truth, but supports 9-11 Truth candidate.
[00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:14.038]  Hey, Mark Dice, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:14.939]  No problem.
[00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:15.479]  Good to have you.
[00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.581]  We'll have you back up in two weeks, week and a half.
[00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:19.403]  There he goes, great guy.
[00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:22.505]  Mark Dice, resistancemanifesto.com, markdice.com.
[00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.107]  My website's infowars.com.
[00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:25.968]  Burma's is burmy.com.
[00:05:25.968 --> 00:05:30.052]  We'll be right back with Derek and the whole crew.
[00:05:30.052 --> 00:05:35.777]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:37.018]  And we knew what to do.
[00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:39.098]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:45.446]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:55.029]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:02.115]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:05.278]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:11.083]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.645]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:20.052]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:23.116]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:28.022]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.212]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:06:33.212 --> 00:06:43.598]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods?
[00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:50.863]  Our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[00:06:51.683 --> 00:06:58.586]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:07.110]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:33.676]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:38.699]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.883]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:07:43.883 --> 00:07:47.326]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:56.329]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:07:56.329 --> 00:08:02.132]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:08.114]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:13.376]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:16.297]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now.
[00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:16.798]  We're good.
[00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:33.118]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:33.118 --> 00:08:36.540]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.202]  We have Professor Francis A. Boyle joining us in about five minutes.
[00:08:41.202 --> 00:08:44.244]  By the way, I'm on in Toronto tonight for an hour with Richard Serra.
[00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:45.265]  I want to plug that for listeners.
[00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:46.826]  I want to hear that.
[00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:50.147]  Francis Boyle with huge anthrax news in two minus five minutes.
[00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:52.149]  Finishing up with Jason Burmess.
[00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:54.790]  His new film, Fabled Enemy, is coming out in ten days.
[00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.511]  See it at PrisonPlanet.tv first.
[00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:57.652]  Pre-order the DVD now.
[00:08:57.652 --> 00:08:59.053]  Ships out September 1st.
[00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:04.295]  Going to Shane Geiger, who I appreciate holding.
[00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:07.477]  Shane just popped by and said, can I say I'm an InfoWars freelance reporter?
[00:09:07.477 --> 00:09:08.597]  We said, sure.
[00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:11.499]  They called and checked with NIST that he really was going.
[00:09:11.499 --> 00:09:12.599]  They had their little meeting.
[00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:15.361]  He got his question out, and they shut him down.
[00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:24.886]  So, just giving some background, Shane Geiger, tell listeners what happened, where this was, how you got the question in, and what happened.
[00:09:24.886 --> 00:09:25.326]  Hi, Alex.
[00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:27.087]  Thanks so much for having me on the show.
[00:09:27.087 --> 00:09:27.607]  Oh, thank you.
[00:09:29.075 --> 00:09:29.916]  Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[00:09:29.916 --> 00:09:36.061]  I was basically making some statements that were backed up.
[00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:37.922]  I mean, this is fact.
[00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:51.333]  I was just stating what had been in the Twin Towers report, and then I stated some things about the back and forth between the Stephen Jones camp and MIST.
[00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:54.155]  Stephen Jones did a Data Quality Assurance Act request.
[00:09:55.032 --> 00:10:10.696]  And, uh, NIST replied back in September of 2007, stating that they are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse, and, um, and, uh, they also stated that they did not conduct tests, tests for explosive residue.
[00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:22.039]  Yeah, they won't do mathematic equations, they'll just show us, uh, video, uh, computer composites that any 14-year-old with a case of Hot Pockets and Jolt Cola can make.
[00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:29.697]  Right, so this should sound very familiar to NIST because, you know, they were involved in this back and forth.
[00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:36.280]  And yet, this was at the point in my questioning where I was basically shut down.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.182]  And I had a few other things I tried to get out after that.
[00:10:39.182 --> 00:10:46.185]  I'm very interested in the scientific method being applied to the research of all the 9-11
[00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.860]  Truthers and, you know, the other people who were looking at the locale.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.142]  Well, describe where this was, how you were able to get this out.
[00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:55.084]  I mean, tell us the locale.
[00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:55.985]  Tell us what it was like.
[00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:58.587]  Tell us, you know, you were there.
[00:10:58.587 --> 00:11:04.832]  Yeah, we were in this 11-story, nondescript building on the NIST campus.
[00:11:04.832 --> 00:11:07.134]  I'm glad it didn't collapse on us.
[00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:09.496]  It probably would have collapsed in about two or three seconds.
[00:11:09.496 --> 00:11:13.439]  Well, if somebody would have put a big ladder up against it, or they'd have dug up the steel columns.
[00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:13.839]  Perfect.
[00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:17.751]  Yeah, well, it was just kind of surreal.
[00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:28.760]  I was there among reporters from the AP, New York Times, Fox, the ZDF, which is the second station in Germany.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:38.889]  I was actually talking after the event with somebody who's involved in the making of the third tower, so he's working with Mike Rudin of the BBC.
[00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:44.524]  I got a lot of, it was really great to get some media contacts.
[00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:46.686]  Thanks so much for that, Alex.
[00:11:46.686 --> 00:11:55.672]  And I was just, I was surrounded by all these people who obviously have an axe to grind.
[00:11:55.672 --> 00:12:02.376]  These people were sort of standoffish and it was not really a friendly environment.
[00:12:02.376 --> 00:12:06.960]  In fact, I think it was somewhat telling that as soon as I started
[00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:33.136]  You know, calling NIST on these bear assertions, the lights actually went out in the room, so it was a little unfriendly from that second on, and the microphone started moving away from me as I was, you know, this is just totally ridiculous, you know, I travel halfway across the country to ask questions, and I have to show up under the pretext of being a reporter
[00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.137]  When it's not enough to be a concerned U.S.
[00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:38.058]  citizen to show up here.
[00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:40.300]  Well, you are an important reporter and you did a great job.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.402]  Now Burmess, you've been analyzing this.
[00:12:42.402 --> 00:12:43.643]  You've seen what happened.
[00:12:43.643 --> 00:12:45.244]  They're also backing away from their logs.
[00:12:45.244 --> 00:12:46.205]  We have the video.
[00:12:46.205 --> 00:12:51.169]  The front of the building has some windows knocked out, but they say in their report a third of the building knocked out on the front.
[00:12:52.668 --> 00:13:07.317]  Yeah, the south face of the building, and we have the videos where there's a few windows blown out, but we obviously see the guy walk into the building and then go up the escalator into the main lobby, so there's not... Well, I believe what they said was a quarter of the building, or somewhere between 10 and 12 stories, scooped out of the building.
[00:13:07.317 --> 00:13:12.340]  Well, their new model has no scoop-out, and they don't even claim... Oh, so no new lines for old!
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.001]  Yeah, there's no scoop-out.
[00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:18.845]  They don't even mention the quote-unquote scoop-out, so they've retracted that statement.
[00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:20.986]  Now they're also saying it wasn't the fuel oil tanks
[00:13:21.446 --> 00:13:34.673]  And they're also saying that although no other building has even come close to this kind of structural damage, I guess, from hundreds of degrees less than known fires, that's what did it.
[00:13:34.673 --> 00:13:36.674]  It was the thermal expansion of columns.
[00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:39.435]  ...located near the center of the building.
[00:13:39.435 --> 00:13:43.637]  They're also claiming that that's why the rooftop, the line, falls first.
[00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:45.838]  Okay, and then they say the facade falls with it.
[00:13:45.838 --> 00:13:56.303]  Now, they say in the very beginning that they did test for explosives, but later, in the press conference, they backtracked, and Shane, I believe, is the one that talked about this.
[00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:58.904]  They backtracked and said, oh, well, we never even considered thermite.
[00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:02.186]  It's just such a ludicrous hypothesis that we never tested for it.
[00:14:02.859 --> 00:14:07.696]  Course, this guy's all happened to be top experts in explosive thermate when no one else is.
[00:14:08.405 --> 00:14:10.726]  It just so happens they're top experts.
[00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:13.687]  Yeah, and you know, again, the Ramon Medal is never addressed.
[00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.028]  It's not addressed in this.
[00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:21.630]  And now they're making it into a standards issue and saying that skyscrapers need to re-evaluate how they've been built.
[00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.611]  Oh, it's a total lie!
[00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:29.734]  I mean... Plus, this thing had a special bunker built inside of it to withstand nuclear attacks, but it magically put a big lighter to it.
[00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:30.354]  It just went blap!
[00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:37.737]  Hey, you know what's really upsetting is that, again, this was New York's number one spook house, located in the center of Manhattan.
[00:14:38.217 --> 00:14:38.597]  I think so.
[00:14:58.957 --> 00:15:11.122]  And in Fabled Enemies, we show you how immediately after the building collapsed, the FBI set up teams with binoculars watching the rescue workers to make sure they didn't take anything out of that building that was incriminating.
[00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:15.544]  Now, now, Jason, I want you to set up InfoWars reporter Shane Geiger for 30 minutes tomorrow.
[00:15:15.544 --> 00:15:17.245]  You're sitting in for me as I get ready to go to Denver.
[00:15:17.245 --> 00:15:20.887]  We need to go to Professor Francis A. Boyle here in just a moment.
[00:15:20.887 --> 00:15:21.327]  Do we have him?
[00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:23.974]  Okay, good.
[00:15:23.974 --> 00:15:25.556]  I don't want to make him hold anymore.
[00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:28.320]  We just got overbooked today, and his information is so important.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.428]  Shane, let me set you up, because you went to the SNS report for 30 minutes tomorrow, at least, with Jason.
[00:15:34.428 --> 00:15:38.673]  So let me have Trey and Jason right now call you and get that set up.
[00:15:38.673 --> 00:15:40.335]  Thank you, Jason Burmess, for that information.
[00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:40.636]  Thank you.
[00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.198]  Alright, this is a very, very serious issue.
[00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:48.462]  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I apologize, I was screwing around earlier in the studio, but Jason's about to leave town.
[00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:50.923]  He's been with us for five months, so we're just having some fun.
[00:15:50.923 --> 00:15:55.226]  Very, very dark times, very, very serious things that we are dealing with here.
[00:15:55.226 --> 00:15:55.966]  Thank you.
[00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:57.327]  Shane Geiger, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[00:15:57.327 --> 00:15:59.249]  It was a pleasure, Alex.
[00:15:59.249 --> 00:15:59.589]  Thank you.
[00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:00.329]  You bet, thank you.
[00:16:00.329 --> 00:16:02.611]  You can go through it all tomorrow with people.
[00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:04.812]  Okay, for the next 45 minutes, I am very honored.
[00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:10.536]  We're gonna skip a few of the breaks from PrisonPlanet.tv, viewers, and InfoWars.com, screen listers, because this is too important information.
[00:16:11.258 --> 00:16:11.558]  I don't know.
[00:16:29.807 --> 00:16:44.481]  And last time he was on with us, I guess about a year and a half ago, an article that Steve Watson wrote about it was published in scores of newspapers and one of the largest magazines in the country and some foreign newspapers as well, dealing with the fact that he was saying the anthrax was an inside job.
[00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:48.725]  Now I've got my mother-in-law that doesn't even believe my show calling up thinking the government did it.
[00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:50.307]  Uh, should we put him on the list now?
[00:16:50.307 --> 00:16:51.129]  I'm sure.
[00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:55.474]  Uh, now I've got, uh, just all over, everyone saying it's complete bull.
[00:16:55.474 --> 00:16:57.397]  Mainstream media is saying it's complete bull.
[00:16:57.397 --> 00:16:58.658]  You look at the whole story.
[00:16:58.658 --> 00:17:02.684]  They grab this other, this other patsy, put him in the hospital, murder him, clearly.
[00:17:02.684 --> 00:17:06.509]  Then say that he was always who they knew did it, while they persecuted Steven Hatfield.
[00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:13.231]  We have this other guy, Dr. Philip Zach, breaking in to the bioweapons lab when he didn't even work there, not getting in trouble.
[00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:15.071]  Still at another bioweapons lab.
[00:17:15.071 --> 00:17:16.431]  It's the most weaponized U.S.
[00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:17.592]  anthrax ever seen.
[00:17:17.592 --> 00:17:27.434]  The FBI destroys the original samples so that they can't be proven and so they can claim that this Dr. Ivins cooked it up in his bathtub or in a basement.
[00:17:28.194 --> 00:17:28.575]  Right, well,
[00:17:58.353 --> 00:18:15.566]  The day the technology on the Daschle letter was revealed in the New York Times, I immediately called Marion Spike Bowman, who is a high-level counterintelligence official at the FBI.
[00:18:15.566 --> 00:18:25.073]  And in fact, it turns out, was also the person who spiked the FBI's warrant for the Moussaoui computer.
[00:18:26.005 --> 00:18:27.786]  But that's another issue.
[00:18:27.786 --> 00:18:31.089]  But before we go, tell folks who you are.
[00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:34.011]  Well, I'm getting to that.
[00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:52.784]  He knew me because I had drafted the United States Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that was passed unanimously by both houses of the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr.
[00:18:53.965 --> 00:18:55.966]  That legislation was the U.S.
[00:18:55.966 --> 00:19:12.012]  domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, and Mr. Bowman and I had met each other at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School.
[00:19:12.012 --> 00:19:20.095]  In any event, I told Mr. Bowman, this was in October of 2001, that the only people who had the
[00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:41.804]  Capability to do this would be those individuals working at either United States government labs or private contractors and things of this nature, and it obviously seemed to me this was U.S.
[00:19:41.804 --> 00:19:43.166]  government-related.
[00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:57.493]  He took the information down and said he would pass it on to the appropriate people handling the investigation I hung up.
[00:19:57.493 --> 00:20:09.322]  And then it occurred to me that I had a complete list of who all these people were and what these labs were, going back to my work on getting the legislation through.
[00:20:09.322 --> 00:20:10.063]  Absolutely.
[00:20:10.063 --> 00:20:13.466]  We're going to skip this break for stations out there.
[00:20:14.321 --> 00:20:27.474]  And then just come right back in to the main segment in four minutes with our guest, a really top bioweapons expert, helped write some of the major international treaties for the United States, Francis A. Boyle, and we are continuing skipping this break.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.841]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:20:31.841 --> 00:20:32.541]  Friday, August 29, 2008.
[00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:33.641]  Gold opened at $832 an ounce.
[00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:36.762]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $8.5680, $4.2220 for half ounce, and $2.1110 for quarter ounce.
[00:20:36.762 --> 00:20:37.602]  That's $8.5680, $4.2220, and $2.1110.
[00:20:47.626 --> 00:20:53.371]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:20:53.371 --> 00:20:56.834]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[00:20:56.834 --> 00:20:57.755]  Bad news for U.S.
[00:20:57.755 --> 00:20:58.396]  currency.
[00:20:58.396 --> 00:21:00.558]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:21:00.558 --> 00:21:02.119]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:04.201]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:05.162]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:05.642]  We're good to go.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:36.370]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.013]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:40.556]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:41.357]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:41.357 --> 00:21:42.218]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.720]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.162]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:45.702 --> 00:21:52.848]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:52.848 --> 00:21:53.328]  Some U.S.
[00:21:53.328 --> 00:21:59.693]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:03.136]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:03.376 --> 00:22:13.658]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:22:13.658 --> 00:22:14.878]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.001]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[00:22:52.942 --> 00:22:55.684]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:22:55.684 --> 00:22:57.806]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:22:57.806 --> 00:22:58.787]  this fall?
[00:22:58.787 --> 00:22:59.708]  Don't wait.

[00:23:39.095 --> 00:23:47.060]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.782]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:23:51.782 --> 00:23:54.664]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnoses.
[00:23:54.664 --> 00:24:05.890]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:24:25.887 --> 00:24:26.367]  Federal agents!
[00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:27.048]  We are armed!
[00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:48.643]  Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law.
[00:24:48.643 --> 00:24:51.866]  He's a graduate of the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School.
[00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:58.051]  He's also received a PhD in political science from Harvard University and he has
[00:25:00.496 --> 00:25:11.761]  Just had a bio, it's too long to go over, but he's written international bioweapons conventions for the federal government, advised Congress, written some of the biggest publications out there.
[00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:15.203]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:20.986]  He's currently a member of the Nobel Prize for Governor George H. Ryan Committee.
[00:25:22.435 --> 00:25:30.061]  Okay, continuing, sir, with the FBI covering up this evidence, covering up the original AIM strain, destroying them.
[00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:34.184]  Then they find other samples that other people had that they gave them.
[00:25:34.184 --> 00:25:35.445]  They destroy it immediately.
[00:25:35.445 --> 00:25:39.349]  You're saying crimes, obstruction of justice.
[00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:40.630]  Why are they covering it up?
[00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.452]  Well, then we have the White House on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic.
[00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:47.608]  Weeks before the anthrax letters show up, admitting that arrogantly.
[00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:49.990]  We have political enemies of the Bushes getting it.
[00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.892]  They use it as a smokescreen to pass the Patriot Act.
[00:25:52.892 --> 00:25:58.236]  They're pressuring the FBI, now public, ordering them to say Al-Qaeda, Al-CIA did it.
[00:25:58.236 --> 00:26:05.441]  I mean, this is the most open and shut case ever for the federal government, criminal elements of it, launching the anthrax attack.
[00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:07.723]  Then you have the cover-up, the patsies.
[00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:08.984]  I mean, break that down for us.
[00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.737]  Yeah, I think it's all clear.
[00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:23.546]  On the first weekend in November, I went out to Harvard where I was running a workshop on biological weapons.
[00:26:23.546 --> 00:26:38.857]  And I publicly stated at the time that in my opinion, my professional opinion, it was either elements of the United States government itself or contractors working for the United States government that was behind the anthrax attack.
[00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:56.601]  Colleague at the time, Professor Jonathan King of MIT, who runs their, who's a microbiologist and runs their electron microscope lab, independently said the exact same thing I did.
[00:26:56.601 --> 00:27:06.108]  And I gave interviews on Fox and the BBC and Pacifica saying this, you know, the first week in November.
[00:27:07.583 --> 00:27:28.352]  So it's been very clear, and the reason is that for the FBI cover-up, it would lead back to a secret, covert, illegal, and criminal offensive biological weapons program involving anthrax.
[00:27:28.352 --> 00:27:34.715]  And I say it's criminal because I was the person who drafted the statute making it a crime.
[00:27:34.715 --> 00:27:36.476]  And that's
[00:27:36.997 --> 00:27:46.059]  That's what's going on here, that's why all the lying and covering it up all along, and they're still doing it today.
[00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:57.041]  If you read the investigation, the press conference they heard earlier this week, by the FBI, it does not add up at all.
[00:27:57.041 --> 00:28:02.201]  If you read the article in today's New York Times, it doesn't add up indeed.
[00:28:02.201 --> 00:28:05.122]  It appears from today's New York Times
[00:28:05.874 --> 00:28:35.483]  The FBI, for example, then set the investigation up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing, and could not communicate with anyone else, and only communicated with the FBI, and only looked at samples provided to them by the FBI, and had to take on good faith from the FBI what the samples were.
[00:28:36.184 --> 00:28:47.149]  So, you have the case where the FBI completely controlled, dominated the scientific investigation, including the timing.
[00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:52.792]  Well, Dr. Boyle, I want to go through that, and as best we can piece together who exactly did it and why they did it.
[00:28:53.292 --> 00:29:00.299]  But when the mainline public on the street at coffee shops are saying, can you believe the government launched the anthrax attack?
[00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:01.040]  They're in trouble.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.983]  I mean, the words out, the White House was on the drug that fights it.
[00:29:03.983 --> 00:29:05.405]  The words out, it went to their enemies.
[00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:08.168]  The words out, they set this last guy up.
[00:29:08.168 --> 00:29:10.450]  I mean, I think we have a crisis of confidence here.
[00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:14.214]  Do you think the FBI knows just how ridiculous they look right now?
[00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:21.630]  Well, Alex, I think the important issue to realize now is this.
[00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:28.115]  You know, the FBI's been lying and covering up on this at least since the time I called Bowman.
[00:29:28.115 --> 00:29:44.046]  But there is today in existence a stockpile of super weapons-grade anthrax that is under the control of the original perpetrators
[00:29:45.044 --> 00:30:03.941]  of the anthrax attacks of October 2001 and that stockpile can and will be used again when their masters decide that it would be politically convenient
[00:30:04.645 --> 00:30:07.866]  To scare and terrorize the American people.
[00:30:07.866 --> 00:30:09.387]  All right, we're going to skip this break too.
[00:30:09.387 --> 00:30:09.667]  Hold on.
[00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:11.268]  I just want stations to know that.
[00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:13.108]  Infowars.com listeners, we're going to continue.
[00:30:13.108 --> 00:30:14.909]  Everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:16.570]  Got to tune over to Infowars.com.
[00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.911]  Here we go with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:30:19.911 --> 00:30:21.312]  We're on the march.
[00:30:21.312 --> 00:30:23.813]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:23.813 --> 00:30:26.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:30.052 --> 00:30:43.206]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:30:43.206 --> 00:30:47.030]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:54.253]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:30:54.253 --> 00:30:57.675]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:30:57.675 --> 00:31:05.558]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:33.080]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.401]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:31:35.401 --> 00:31:38.702]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:31:38.702 --> 00:31:45.585]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:31:45.585 --> 00:31:47.686]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:31:48.186 --> 00:31:51.488]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:31:51.488 --> 00:31:56.272]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:31:56.272 --> 00:32:00.214]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:32:00.214 --> 00:32:01.835]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:32:19.066 --> 00:32:22.587]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[00:32:39.053 --> 00:32:39.693]  We're good to go!
[00:33:09.093 --> 00:33:09.493]  Dr. Francis Boyle,
[00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:49.560]  One of the former top bioweapons experts for the federal government helped write some of the major bioweapons conventions internationally for the United States.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.343]  Day one he tried to help with the investigation and found out who was really behind it.
[00:33:54.343 --> 00:33:59.547]  These are hardcore killers and they'll do anything to scare you into submission after their little
[00:34:00.982 --> 00:34:05.143]  Little event they pulled off on 9-11, they weren't done, they launched their anthrax attack.
[00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:16.566]  And they did their dark winter scenario a few years before that, congressionally funded drill of massive anthrax spraying in Texas, in Oklahoma, and martial law being declared.
[00:34:16.566 --> 00:34:21.307]  And you better believe, ladies and gentlemen, they got private contractors ready to spray it on your cities.
[00:34:22.029 --> 00:34:25.372]  And then they'll grab some guy with a beard and put him on TV and say he did it.
[00:34:25.372 --> 00:34:26.753]  It might even be a hologram.
[00:34:26.753 --> 00:34:30.976]  I mean, these guys are just... there's no end to what they'll do.
[00:34:30.976 --> 00:34:33.918]  And Dr. Boyle is our guest.
[00:34:33.918 --> 00:34:38.281]  During the last... you just started calling for a congressional investigation.
[00:34:38.281 --> 00:34:41.664]  The country's being held hostage by the real terrorist.
[00:34:41.664 --> 00:34:42.404]  You've got the floor.
[00:34:42.404 --> 00:34:46.327]  I'd like you to talk more about that and then go back into evidence because it's so voluminous.
[00:34:46.327 --> 00:34:47.588]  Anything else you'd like to talk about?
[00:34:49.255 --> 00:35:08.270]  Right, well, we need hearings along the lines of what we had in the Watergate hearings under President Nixon, where we have open public hearings by a joint committee of Congress, because this attack was designed to shut Congress down.
[00:35:09.008 --> 00:35:10.610]  And to which it did.
[00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:19.960]  It succeeded, to the best of my knowledge, the first time in the history of our republic where Congress was actually shut down and rendered inoperative.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.044]  The House went out of business.
[00:35:23.044 --> 00:35:28.910]  The Senate said it would stay in session, but with the House out of business, you can't do business.
[00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:29.931]  So this is a
[00:35:31.048 --> 00:35:35.191]  Uh, you know, a political crime of the first magnitude.
[00:35:35.191 --> 00:35:38.194]  The Supreme Court, as well, also shut down.
[00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:41.977]  And the media were attacked, our fourth estate.
[00:35:41.977 --> 00:35:46.961]  Of course, the presidency and the executive branch was not attacked.
[00:35:46.961 --> 00:35:51.664]  I leave that to you to figure it out, but we do know the White House was on Cipro.
[00:35:53.183 --> 00:36:13.030]  So, that's really what we need, and maybe if there are open public hearings by Congress, you know, people put under oath with subpoena power, members of Congress then might feel some protection from further threats by the people currently under control of the anthrax.
[00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:20.453]  You also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have appeared
[00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:42.281]  Since around the summer before these events, when the New York Times revealed the existence of the covert anthrax weapons programs run by the CIA and Battelle, and that too is in the public record.
[00:36:42.281 --> 00:36:42.901]  Yeah, those are the ones.
[00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:44.342]  And the list keeps going.
[00:36:44.342 --> 00:36:50.064]  Ivins is only the latest dead microbiologist, so you are correct.
[00:36:51.337 --> 00:36:53.499]  These culprits are playing for keeps.
[00:36:53.499 --> 00:36:57.221]  They are prepared to kill people.
[00:36:57.221 --> 00:36:58.482]  They've tried to kill people.
[00:36:58.482 --> 00:36:59.783]  I think they have killed people.
[00:37:00.529 --> 00:37:06.493]  Well, there's no doubt under PDD 51, the cognitive government system has taken over the government.
[00:37:06.493 --> 00:37:16.940]  Congress knows they were hit by a biological attack from the executive branch and the shadow government controlled by foreign agencies, foreign intelligence operations, British and Israeli, predominantly.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:23.464]  And they have now bullied the media and the Congress into full submission.
[00:37:23.464 --> 00:37:25.966]  They are hopping mad at the Russians for not submitting.
[00:37:25.966 --> 00:37:27.527]  God knows what they'll pull on them now.
[00:37:28.463 --> 00:37:36.150]  And, uh, we are completely controlled by megalomaniacs who have limitless will, dark will, to do God knows what.
[00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:44.138]  Uh, Mr. Boyle, I mean, I can't imagine a more nightmare scenario, and it's so transparent because they want it to be transparent, don't they?
[00:37:46.303 --> 00:37:55.666]  Well, I think it's transparent for people who are really following what's going on and adding it up, but I don't think for the vast majority of the American people.
[00:37:55.666 --> 00:38:09.670]  I do think you are correct in your analysis that the Presidential Doctrine for Continuity of Government was put into effect on September 11th, and it's still in operation today.
[00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.011]  And that we do have, in fact, a secret government that
[00:38:13.536 --> 00:38:18.199]  You know, is really running things behind the scenes, probably.
[00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:20.361]  Cheney is in charge of it.
[00:38:20.361 --> 00:38:23.663]  And so there are really two governments out there.
[00:38:23.663 --> 00:38:26.264]  And that can account for a lot of anomalies.
[00:38:26.264 --> 00:38:34.370]  For example, what happened at the Minot Air Force Base with the nuclear cruise missiles.
[00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:41.294]  That decision to deploy those nuclear cruise missiles had to come directly from a chain of command.
[00:38:41.294 --> 00:38:42.335]  It was not a mistake.
[00:38:43.044 --> 00:38:49.267]  And with the continuity of government, then there are now two chains of command.
[00:38:49.267 --> 00:39:00.913]  So I think you can add up a lot of things by realizing that, you know, there's the open government and then there's the COG in operation.
[00:39:00.913 --> 00:39:01.334]  Right.
[00:39:01.334 --> 00:39:11.779]  Professor Boyle, a lot of people that don't understand history or the way subterfuge works, they wonder why you're alive, why I'm alive, why so many others are alive, if this is all true.
[00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:15.647]  And I would just say it's because they don't want to validate what we've said.
[00:39:15.647 --> 00:39:17.469]  They don't want to underline our words.
[00:39:17.469 --> 00:39:20.273]  They don't want to highlight what we've said and done.
[00:39:20.273 --> 00:39:22.796]  But I do feel the wings of death flapping about.
[00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:23.516]  I've been threatened.
[00:39:23.516 --> 00:39:25.479]  I've had all sorts of other stuff happen.
[00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:26.940]  A lot of other people have been killed.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.363]  So it's not a joke to me, but I just think my lucky stars.
[00:39:29.363 --> 00:39:31.386]  Thank God every day I'm still here.
[00:39:32.447 --> 00:39:38.937]  Uh, but, I mean, what's your take on why other whistleblowers and other, uh, you know, prominent people are still alive?
[00:39:38.937 --> 00:39:42.842]  If these guys are such murderers and such killers, why they haven't come after us?
[00:39:44.284 --> 00:39:46.064]  Well, Dr. Ivins is not alive.
[00:39:46.064 --> 00:39:52.486]  He joined the growing list of microbiologists who are now dead.
[00:39:52.486 --> 00:39:59.728]  I can't recall the last time I looked at that list, but it was somewhere in the area of 15 to 20 microbiologists that have died.
[00:39:59.728 --> 00:40:02.588]  That's a lot more than that.
[00:40:02.588 --> 00:40:04.409]  Yeah, maybe 20 or something like that.
[00:40:04.409 --> 00:40:09.730]  Well, if you look at it globally, it's like 20 in the U.S.
[00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.591]  being shot in the back of the head, being tortured to death, being drowned.
[00:40:12.591 --> 00:40:13.871]  It's hundreds worldwide.
[00:40:14.716 --> 00:40:15.257]  Right.
[00:40:15.257 --> 00:40:23.364]  So, you know, they are, I think, disposing of people who don't directly know what's going on.
[00:40:23.364 --> 00:40:28.089]  I know, you know, Senator Wellstone disappeared, too.
[00:40:28.089 --> 00:40:33.614]  So, you know, I take it the reason others are around is that
[00:40:34.255 --> 00:40:35.295]  They don't really care.
[00:40:35.295 --> 00:40:37.356]  They have all the levers of power.
[00:40:37.356 --> 00:40:42.198]  No, no, they're actually glad we're here saying they control the Congress and murder whoever they want.
[00:40:42.198 --> 00:40:43.298]  They enjoy it.
[00:40:43.298 --> 00:40:47.220]  And all the big gorillas that work in Army Intelligence think it's real funny.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.480]  They love their cocaine money.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.761]  They love their houses in Maui.
[00:40:49.761 --> 00:40:51.601]  They love butcher in this country.
[00:40:51.601 --> 00:40:52.161]  Wide open.
[00:40:52.161 --> 00:40:53.202]  Good job, guys.
[00:40:53.202 --> 00:40:55.423]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[00:40:55.423 --> 00:40:59.784]  Well, I don't think they think we're very effective one way or the other.
[00:40:59.784 --> 00:41:01.885]  Otherwise, they would pick us out, sure.
[00:41:03.214 --> 00:41:04.455]  Well, you know, it could be the twilight of
[00:41:26.809 --> 00:41:29.172]  The American Republic, I hate to say that.
[00:41:29.172 --> 00:41:40.986]  You know, I've been a lawyer since January 10, 1977, taking an oath to uphold the constitutional laws of the United States, as my father was before me.
[00:41:40.986 --> 00:41:45.932]  And it could be we're at the end of the line here for democracy in America.
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:53.246]  That's right, you're a top constitutional law scholar as well, we just can't cover all of your illustrious background.
[00:41:53.246 --> 00:41:59.093]  Let's go over more of the evidence, more areas with the curious case of Dr. Ivins.
[00:41:59.093 --> 00:42:03.037]  I mean, the media, you notice, it was so hard to find that he died in government custody.
[00:42:03.686 --> 00:42:05.808]  I mean, it's just getting shoddier and shoddier.
[00:42:05.808 --> 00:42:06.029]  It is.
[00:42:06.029 --> 00:42:10.033]  I mean, if you just read any of the accounts, I mean, now, surprisingly, you even have
[00:42:26.472 --> 00:42:37.777]  People in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, experts, microbiologists, former biowarfare people saying they don't believe Ivins did it.
[00:42:37.777 --> 00:42:38.797]  That's correct.
[00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:42.799]  That's how flimsy the cover-up has become.
[00:42:42.799 --> 00:42:48.141]  Again, just read today's New York Times.
[00:42:48.141 --> 00:42:54.084]  The more facts come out, the harder it comes to explain any of these things.
[00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:56.680]  Why did they rush out?
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.781]  I don't know what to say.
[00:42:57.781 --> 00:43:07.827]  Why did they rush out and grabbed Ivins and killed him and then made the ridiculous story up about, oh, he's been our main suspect for four years, when just a year ago they were saying the only suspect was Hatfield?
[00:43:07.827 --> 00:43:14.652]  I mean, is that a total contempt for the public's memory or what is that?
[00:43:14.652 --> 00:43:18.194]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:18.194 --> 00:43:22.037]  I don't know if Ivins was killed one way or the other, but
[00:43:23.274 --> 00:43:36.141]  You know, they first blamed it on Hatfield knowing he wasn't responsible, but that could stall and delay everything for a long time, and see if they could get Hatfield to crack up, and he didn't.
[00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:38.223]  He fought back.
[00:43:38.223 --> 00:43:47.128]  Ivins, so then they moved to him, and they got him to crack up, and either he was off by himself, or we still don't know the
[00:43:47.879 --> 00:43:48.821]  Yeah, it's easy.
[00:43:48.821 --> 00:43:49.462]  They have a dead defendant.
[00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:07.003]  Talking about the FBI, they've always been hooked in with the Mafia since their conception, during Prohibition, being paid off.
[00:44:07.003 --> 00:44:13.945]  So from their zenith, or really birth, I should say, from their genesis, they have been, you know, mobsters.
[00:44:13.945 --> 00:44:20.346]  And now, now, I mean, I've seen the FBI out on the streets in places, they're really scary people.
[00:44:20.346 --> 00:44:26.108]  I mean, do you think the average FBI agent really understands they're working for basically a Gestapo organization?
[00:44:26.966 --> 00:44:42.439]  Well, actually, a Mr. Swearegan, who had been an FBI agent and retired and was decorated, wrote a book on the FBI and called it the American Gestapo, repeatedly.
[00:44:42.439 --> 00:44:44.480]  He was a veteran FBI agent.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.222]  I think that is correct.
[00:44:46.222 --> 00:44:49.024]  The last time we discussed the matter,
[00:44:50.147 --> 00:45:10.380]  I think I told you that two FBI agents, well, one agent for the FBI and another for the FBI-CIA Joint Terrorism Task Force, showed up at my office, interrogated me for an hour, tried to get me to become an informant on my Arab and Muslim clients, which would have violated
[00:45:12.136 --> 00:45:16.819]  Their constitutional rights and my ethical obligations as an attorney.
[00:45:16.819 --> 00:45:26.464]  Of course, I refuse to become an informant for the FBI, but I did tell them that I was trying to cooperate with the FBI on the anthrax investigation.
[00:45:27.279 --> 00:45:36.667]  And, uh, told him of, you know, my phone calls there, uh, to Mr. Bowman to, to try to do something on the anthrax, uh, investigation.
[00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:45.074]  And then the FBI, CIA went out and, uh, put me on all the, uh, United States government's terrorist watch lists.
[00:45:45.074 --> 00:45:45.914]  Every one of them.
[00:45:45.914 --> 00:45:50.478]  My lawyer says there are five or six of them, and as far as he could figure out, I'm on all of them.
[00:45:51.118 --> 00:46:04.472]  So, that gives you a pretty good idea of what's going on here, that one guy trying to help unravel the anthrax investigation gets put on the terrorist watch list.
[00:46:04.472 --> 00:46:11.179]  Well, you know, I know it's all about power and who wins, but there's no doubt that I'm trying to defend this country, what's left of it, so are you.
[00:46:12.368 --> 00:46:19.271]  And, you know, guys, we don't expect you to quit the FBI or even stand up for the country, but at least you can passively not join the evil.
[00:46:19.271 --> 00:46:22.253]  I mean, is it that much fun to destroy America?
[00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:24.514]  I mean, I don't understand the enjoyment.
[00:46:24.514 --> 00:46:26.655]  Where do they find these people?
[00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:32.778]  Well, we have to remember there were some good, solid FBI people there up in Minneapolis.
[00:46:33.419 --> 00:46:37.443]  Trying to get that, uh, warrant into... But notice they're always off in a field office.
[00:46:37.443 --> 00:46:39.025]  I understand it's compartmentalized.
[00:46:39.025 --> 00:46:39.305]  Yeah.
[00:46:39.305 --> 00:46:39.945]  Right.
[00:46:39.945 --> 00:46:49.795]  But they tried... Those in the field, Crowley and the rest of them, tried very hard to get that, uh, warrant into Moussaoui's computer that very well could have unraveled, uh, 9-11.
[00:46:51.356 --> 00:46:58.942]  And that was killed by Marion Spike Bowman, who was the same guy I was dealing with in good faith.
[00:46:58.942 --> 00:47:11.510]  And then by the way, the FBI agents that blocked the Anthrax and the 9-11 investigation even before, they all got record cash bonuses, and those that tried to stop the attacks, they got demoted.
[00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:13.272]  Right.
[00:47:13.272 --> 00:47:19.456]  The people who were in charge of the cover-ups on both 9-11 and the Anthrax have all been promoted, which
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:25.086]  Indicates they've done what their masters wanted them to do.
[00:47:25.086 --> 00:47:36.898]  And I think the reason why, you know, eventually if we can unravel who was behind the anthrax attacks, we're going to find out who really was behind 9-11.
[00:47:36.898 --> 00:47:39.101]  Well, I know you have a lot of...
[00:47:40.512 --> 00:47:44.953]  You know, they're so desperate, uh, to cover everything up and lie about it.
[00:47:44.953 --> 00:47:54.475]  I know you have a lot of gravitas, sir, so you like to be very careful with what you say, but do you think a person of interest needs to be looked at as this Philip Zach person, or is he another Red Herring?
[00:47:54.475 --> 00:48:07.419]  I really don't know, uh, much about Mr. Zach, um, just what I've read in the public record, but certainly at the top of everyone's list, uh, should be, uh, Mr., uh, Patrick, who did this type of work for the CIA, and, uh,
[00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:13.329]  Ken Albeck, who did this type of work for the Soviet Union.
[00:48:13.329 --> 00:48:20.215]  Indeed, Albeck has made statements in the public that are inconsistent and simply not true.
[00:48:20.215 --> 00:48:22.117]  Albeck was brought over here by the CIA.
[00:48:23.232 --> 00:48:46.316]  uh... so he's on their payroll and uh... patrick was on the on the payroll so i would you know certainly identify them at the top of the letter alaback wrote about and was over a accidental release remember in the soviet union on that uh... internal uh... you know you know i was at the conchaca peninsula right you know don't hurt lots which is a non central uh...
[00:48:46.776 --> 00:48:53.582]  Central Russia, but you have to understand that it's just not Fort Detrick here that could have done this.
[00:48:53.582 --> 00:49:14.580]  The culture, from what I can see, came from Fort Detrick, but again, assuming any of this information coming out is correct, 25% of it came from Fort Detrick and 75% of it came from the Dugway Proving Ground, run by the Army and with the CIA and Battelle working there.
[00:49:15.436 --> 00:49:27.240]  My guess is that the culture itself came from Fort Detrick, and then it was shipped out to Dugway to be weaponized.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:43.665]  That is, to turn it into a trillion spores per gram, the aerosolization, the additive on the silica covering, which involved nanotechnology,
[00:49:44.594 --> 00:49:48.256]  And then the electrostatic charges.
[00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:50.096]  How ridiculous is it?
[00:49:50.096 --> 00:49:53.038]  I believe it was weaponized at Dugway.
[00:49:53.038 --> 00:49:59.360]  I don't believe it was weaponized at Fort Detrick per se.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.561]  How ridiculous is it?
[00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:05.623]  So we have a team of people here working on this.
[00:50:05.623 --> 00:50:10.505]  It's not simply a question of one or two or three people.
[00:50:11.764 --> 00:50:22.111]  And that's why we have all these big top bioweapons scientists saying you're claiming that that Ivins was able to make this in his basement?
[00:50:22.111 --> 00:50:24.513]  That he was able to get something and then weaponize it?
[00:50:24.513 --> 00:50:28.735]  You know, they're saying that's ridiculous because they know what it takes, don't they?
[00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.336]  Sure, it's completely preposterous.
[00:50:30.336 --> 00:50:35.360]  Even Mr. Spurtzle used to head up Fort Detrick said it can't be done.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:41.244]  So, uh, you know, I think both of these scientists involved in the investigation
[00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:48.674]  Like me, you'd probably assume the FBI was dealing with them in good faith, but that simply isn't the case.
[00:50:48.674 --> 00:50:50.775]  Has this changed your view of the world?
[00:50:50.775 --> 00:50:56.178]  You know, working on this case, seeing this, and seeing how the federal government's been behaving?
[00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:56.938]  No, not really.
[00:50:56.938 --> 00:51:01.361]  You know, I'm 58 years old.
[00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:09.105]  I'm going back to the Kennedy assassination, the two Kennedy assassinations, and the King assassination.
[00:51:09.932 --> 00:51:12.093]  This doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:51:12.093 --> 00:51:19.515]  I was just saying because you said that you said that you thought the FBI would do something, but I guess you weren't thinking they were involved.
[00:51:19.515 --> 00:51:21.836]  We're going to skip this break, too, with our guest.
[00:51:21.836 --> 00:51:23.536]  We'll be back in the final segment.
[00:51:23.536 --> 00:51:27.397]  The only place to listen to the behind the scenes is the InfoWars.com stream.
[00:51:27.397 --> 00:51:30.018]  You got to go over to the site and click on that stream.
[00:51:30.018 --> 00:51:36.780]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.461]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:39.401 --> 00:51:40.962]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:40.962 --> 00:51:41.743]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:41.743 --> 00:51:42.803]  This is his M.O.
[00:51:42.803 --> 00:51:44.104]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:44.104 --> 00:51:46.105]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:46.105 --> 00:51:53.269]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:53.269 --> 00:51:53.750]  Some U.S.
[00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:59.393]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:00.093 --> 00:52:03.596]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:03.596 --> 00:52:14.066]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:14.066 --> 00:52:15.307]  Fabled enemies.

[00:52:29.975 --> 00:52:34.158]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:52:34.158 --> 00:52:39.142]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[00:52:39.142 --> 00:52:44.486]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:52:44.486 --> 00:52:46.407]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:52:46.587 --> 00:52:55.071]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEPs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:52:55.071 --> 00:53:00.053]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.

[00:54:33.869 --> 00:54:37.231]  Dr. Francis Boyle has a book out on the anthrax attacks.
[00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:42.173]  It's a scholarly, detailed book that everyone needs to get and get out to their friends and family.
[00:54:42.173 --> 00:54:43.713]  This is life and death.
[00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:52.297]  If we don't expose these people, they're going to use terror attacks to completely overthrow the country and have a continuity of government system that even dominates Congress.
[00:54:52.297 --> 00:54:56.719]  L. Bush has even taken authority away from Homeland Security to himself.
[00:54:56.719 --> 00:54:59.820]  It's unprecedented in dark times, and I don't take pleasure fighting these people.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:00.121]  I know.
[00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:00.701]  I mean, it is.
[00:55:01.913 --> 00:55:02.734]  I don't even have fear.
[00:55:02.734 --> 00:55:05.075]  I just know, man, this is serious.
[00:55:05.075 --> 00:55:07.696]  I don't like messing with these people, but I have to.
[00:55:07.696 --> 00:55:09.437]  You can't give in to them.
[00:55:09.437 --> 00:55:12.039]  And Dr. Boyle, we just commend you.
[00:55:12.039 --> 00:55:19.522]  The old 5,000-year-old system of sacrificing pawns, going back to being invented in India.
[00:55:19.522 --> 00:55:29.968]  Generals will sacrifice 1,000, 10,000, 20,000 troops to draw an enemy in over a ridge, thinking it's a larger force to then have their army behind the hill crush them, knowing it's going to kill their own force.
[00:55:30.834 --> 00:55:45.158]  In archery training, it's not just in the movie Braveheart, but it's historical cases of where different armies in Japan, in Europe proper, in Africa, you know, the Egyptians would fire on their own troops to kill some of the other troops.
[00:55:45.158 --> 00:55:46.258]  That's an idea.
[00:55:46.258 --> 00:55:47.999]  Collateral damage.
[00:55:47.999 --> 00:55:53.841]  And it's nothing to the war planners running our country for the big banks to mail out some anthrax and kill some people.
[00:55:53.841 --> 00:55:56.381]  It's nothing for them to kill kids now.
[00:55:56.381 --> 00:55:58.242]  To kill a million two Iraqis, as I said.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.984]  And we better realize that what's done to the Iraqis will be done to us.
[00:56:03.984 --> 00:56:05.265]  You report your show.
[00:56:05.265 --> 00:56:09.748]  Dr. Boyle, can you speak to that idea and then plug your book?
[00:56:09.748 --> 00:56:11.329]  Well, sure.
[00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:16.372]  I went to the University of Chicago with all these neoconservatives.
[00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:21.456]  Wolfowitz was there, Chalabi, Kahlilzad, Sholsky, all the rest of them.
[00:56:22.271 --> 00:56:30.178]  Uh, they were getting their PhDs and I was getting my undergraduate degree, later got my PhD from Harvard.
[00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:40.286]  I went through the exact same program that produced all these, uh, neocons, the political science department, uh, Leo Strauss, the godfather of neocons.
[00:56:40.286 --> 00:56:47.772]  His, uh, mentor and sponsor in Germany was Professor Karl Schmidt.
[00:56:48.467 --> 00:57:03.194]  Who went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor of that benighted era, and justified every hideous atrocity the Nazis inflicted on anyone, including the Jews.
[00:57:03.194 --> 00:57:11.398]  And now his grandchildren are Alberto Gonzales, the current Attorney General, Mukasey, and John Yoo.
[00:57:12.925 --> 00:57:13.965]  That's correct.
[00:57:13.965 --> 00:57:19.647]  We have to understand, Alex, that they tried to train me to become one of these people.
[00:57:19.647 --> 00:57:21.387]  Don't you have the special Ph.D.?
[00:57:21.387 --> 00:57:24.028]  They only give one a year from Harvard?
[00:57:24.028 --> 00:57:25.468]  Don't you have the Kissinger Ph.D.?
[00:57:25.468 --> 00:57:32.169]  Yeah, I went to the same program that Kissinger did, indeed, at the Center for International Affairs.
[00:57:32.169 --> 00:57:34.190]  They gave me Kissinger's old office.
[00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:37.311]  His file cabinets were sitting there when I moved in.
[00:57:37.311 --> 00:57:38.591]  But the point is,
[00:57:39.224 --> 00:57:45.672]  We have to understand these neoconservatives, then, are in fact neo-Nazis.
[00:57:45.672 --> 00:57:53.262]  And this is a neo-Nazi mentality that has taken over our government.
[00:57:53.262 --> 00:57:58.028]  And these are the people making these decisions
[00:57:58.667 --> 00:58:06.214]  And that then gets back to why they have no problem unleashing an anthrax attack on the American people in Congress.
[00:58:06.214 --> 00:58:08.416]  Indeed, they're anti-democratic.
[00:58:08.416 --> 00:58:21.108]  Professor Boyle, I can go into overdrive on this radio show, but I don't want to keep you... The show's over in one minute, but I want to extend the show for 10 minutes, commercial-free, just for the internet streams, but that's...
[00:58:21.468 --> 00:58:27.374]  Hundreds of thousands listening on the internet and on tens of thousands later spread out on video.
[00:58:27.374 --> 00:58:30.497]  Can you do 10 more minutes right now just so you can finish this statement?
[00:58:31.286 --> 00:58:31.866]  Sure.
[00:58:31.866 --> 00:58:33.327]  Okay, we're going to go into overdrive.
[00:58:33.327 --> 00:58:35.888]  I want to thank the Genesis Network and all the affiliates.
[00:58:35.888 --> 00:58:51.153]  If you go to InfoWars.com, only on those audio streams, and PrisonPlanet.tv on the video, we're going to continue with an addendum, not just the anthrax attacks, but who they are, the mindset that allows them to engage in this type of behavior.
[00:58:51.773 --> 00:58:59.655]  And so, again, you need to go to one place, InfoWars.com, to click on those streams right now with Dr. Boyle.
[00:58:59.655 --> 00:59:04.276]  Don't forget my new film, Fabled Enemies, that I produced, that Jason Burmiss has directed.
[00:59:04.276 --> 00:59:05.477]  You can pre-order it now.
[00:59:05.477 --> 00:59:07.037]  It comes out in 10 days.
[00:59:07.037 --> 00:59:08.257]  InfoWars.com as well.
[00:59:08.257 --> 00:59:09.278]  Great job, everybody.
[00:59:09.278 --> 00:59:10.798]  Stay with us.
[00:59:10.798 --> 00:59:15.639]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:17.520]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:26.932 --> 00:59:28.493]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:59:28.493 --> 00:59:30.194]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:59:30.194 --> 00:59:38.141]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state that wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:46.389]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:59:46.389 --> 00:59:51.193]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:59:59.119 --> 01:00:02.581]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:05.162]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:00:05.162 --> 01:00:11.946]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:00:11.946 --> 01:00:14.767]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:17.028]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:00:17.028 --> 01:00:22.471]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:00:22.471 --> 01:00:24.852]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:24.852 --> 01:00:27.634]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:34.517 --> 01:00:39.361]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:39.361 --> 01:00:40.942]  You want answers?
[01:00:40.942 --> 01:00:41.883]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:41.883 --> 01:00:46.707]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:46.707 --> 01:00:50.970]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:53.432]  We've only got five minutes left with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:59.817]  Very thankful for him joining us today with his analysis of what's happening.
[01:00:59.817 --> 01:01:02.399]  In closing, Dr. Roberts, two final questions.
[01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:11.749]  Why are the Neocons, Fife and all of these guys, Crystal, running around saying, you know, encircle Russia.
[01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:17.015]  Cheney called them and said there will be a response to this and basically threatened their president Sunday.
[01:01:17.015 --> 01:01:18.697]  That was in the Associated Press.
[01:01:18.697 --> 01:01:22.001]  His quotes were incredibly incendiary.
[01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:25.465]  They've launched a sneak attack on him and now they're acting like Russia caused all this.
[01:01:27.148 --> 01:01:36.891]  A, it does look like they're delusional and engage in megalomania with all these little stunted nobodies you've never even met in the military wanting to flex their muscles.
[01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:40.132]  A, and then B, where do you see this going now?
[01:01:40.132 --> 01:01:45.334]  How do you think this worked out for the U.S., NATO versus Russia?
[01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:49.555]  Well, I think probably we've scared our NATO allies to death if we actually
[01:01:50.725 --> 01:01:58.889]  Issuing these kinds of threats to a nuclear power who hasn't done anything except try to get along with us.
[01:01:58.889 --> 01:02:10.855]  So it may be, unless we have actually purchased and blackmailed all the leaders of the European countries, it may mean that they don't want to be in NATO.
[01:02:10.855 --> 01:02:14.677]  It's too dangerous because it's run by insane people in Washington.
[01:02:14.677 --> 01:02:17.078]  That could be one fallout.
[01:02:17.078 --> 01:02:18.099]  The other fallout will
[01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:22.671]  It'll have to certainly wake up the Russians.
[01:02:22.671 --> 01:02:26.273]  They're trying to get along with us and cooperate with us.
[01:02:26.273 --> 01:02:30.055]  It just means they get stabbed in the back repeatedly.
[01:02:30.055 --> 01:02:40.020]  And so I would imagine we'll see a more aggressive stance on the part of the Russians.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.343]  And since all of our European NATO allies are dependent on Russia for natural gas,
[01:02:46.415 --> 01:02:57.857]  They've got probably as much leverage over allies as we do through blackmail and illegal payments to foreign, to European leaders.
[01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:10.300]  So, I think that because they are insane, the neoconservatives and Cheney, and because Bush is an imbecile, like Pravda says, an imbecile,
[01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:21.238]  We are in risk of enormous, horrendous events that could potentially end life on Earth.
[01:03:21.238 --> 01:03:25.341]  I think that... You call it the reign of the cockroach.
[01:03:25.341 --> 01:03:26.202]  That's right.
[01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:30.546]  That's what I called it when I wrote about it some time back.
[01:03:30.546 --> 01:03:36.611]  I think that the American people have been, you know, just completely irresponsible.
[01:03:38.675 --> 01:03:53.206]  They've let this criminal regime get in office and stay there for essentially eight years, run Russia over their rights, their liberties, the Constitution, and other countries.
[01:03:53.206 --> 01:03:59.290]  I mean, Bush has destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan, the infrastructure, everything.
[01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:01.372]  Well, I was in a... There's millions of people.
[01:04:01.372 --> 01:04:05.895]  These are the greatest crimes the world has seen.
[01:04:07.895 --> 01:04:11.418]  It's an amazing criminal regime.
[01:04:11.418 --> 01:04:13.599]  And every time they open their mouth, they lie.
[01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.961]  We now have all the evidence of the lies everywhere.
[01:04:16.961 --> 01:04:26.948]  So I think they seem to be determined to propel us into some sort of major conflict.
[01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:32.512]  Well, it's like Peanack said, we have the power, we're going to use it.
[01:04:32.512 --> 01:04:33.772]  Yeah, but like you and I agree,
[01:04:37.604 --> 01:04:40.686]  The estimates of the power they have is great and exaggerated.
[01:04:40.686 --> 01:04:45.050]  The United States just doesn't have the power that these people think it's got.
[01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:48.133]  Except for nukes, which they're menacing everyone with.
[01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:49.814]  Yeah, but the Russians have nukes.
[01:04:49.814 --> 01:04:50.895]  The Chinese have nukes.
[01:04:50.895 --> 01:04:51.776]  I know, it's insane!
[01:04:51.776 --> 01:04:57.521]  Pakistanis have nukes.
[01:04:57.521 --> 01:05:02.926]  What you have told me on this program about these behaviors is really frightening.
[01:05:02.926 --> 01:05:03.887]  This is actually
[01:05:05.198 --> 01:05:10.919]  What our so-called leaders are doing and saying is they're clearly insane.
[01:05:10.919 --> 01:05:12.120]  Clearly insane.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.220]  They've all been saying it.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.521]  Well, as this develops, we'll talk to you again, Dr. Roberts.
[01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:17.221]  Thank you for all your time.
[01:05:17.221 --> 01:05:18.061]  All right, Alex.
[01:05:18.061 --> 01:05:19.081]  Good luck to you.
[01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:19.762]  You too, my friend.
[01:05:19.762 --> 01:05:20.522]  Say hi to your family.
[01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:23.102]  Okay, we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarbly.
[01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:23.903]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:23.903 --> 01:05:27.203]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:05:27.203 --> 01:05:29.324]  My new film, Truth Rising, is now available on DVD.
[01:05:30.183 --> 01:05:36.948]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:36.948 --> 01:05:39.590]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.131]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:41.131 --> 01:05:41.931]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:41.931 --> 01:05:42.792]  This is his ammo.
[01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:44.313]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:44.313 --> 01:05:45.794]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:46.295 --> 01:05:53.443]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:05:53.443 --> 01:05:53.924]  Some U.S.
[01:05:53.924 --> 01:06:00.292]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:03.736]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:03.956 --> 01:06:14.241]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:14.241 --> 01:06:15.482]  Fabled enemies.
[01:06:15.482 --> 01:06:23.226]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:23.226 --> 01:06:26.588]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:35.362]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:41.805]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:06:41.805 --> 01:06:44.306]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[01:06:44.306 --> 01:06:49.628]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge you to protect your family with hemp storable foods today.
[01:06:49.628 --> 01:06:51.048]  Tomorrow may be too late.
[01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:55.550]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit HempUSA.org.
[01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:59.852]  This incredible food source is loaded with enzymes so your body can digest the food you eat.
[01:07:00.152 --> 01:07:00.472]  I think so.
[01:07:31.178 --> 01:07:38.644]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:42.687]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[01:07:42.687 --> 01:07:45.770]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[01:07:48.322 --> 01:07:48.703]  I think so.
[01:08:03.362 --> 01:08:03.983]  We're good to go.
[01:08:38.513 --> 01:08:47.398]  Under martial law, all constitutional rights have been suspended.
[01:08:47.398 --> 01:08:50.119]  Stay in your home.
[01:08:50.119 --> 01:08:56.903]  Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents or attorneys.
[01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:58.424]  Shut up!
[01:08:58.424 --> 01:09:03.667]  Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.
[01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:05.808]  Stay in your home.
[01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:06.488]  Curfew is at 7 p.m.
[01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:07.709]  sharp
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:19.711]  After work, anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.
[01:09:19.711 --> 01:09:21.713]  Remain calm.
[01:09:21.713 --> 01:09:23.494]  Do not panic.
[01:09:23.494 --> 01:09:29.840]  Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.
[01:09:31.222 --> 01:09:39.408]  Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples will be shot.
[01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.909]  Stay in your home.
[01:09:41.909 --> 01:09:44.051]  Remain calm.
[01:09:44.051 --> 01:09:49.095]  The number one enemy of progress is question.
[01:09:49.095 --> 01:09:55.800]  National security is more important than individual will.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.482]  All sports broadcasts will proceed
[01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:06.738]  No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.
[01:10:06.738 --> 01:10:11.340]  Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.741]  Shut up!
[01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:15.141]  Be happy.
[01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:18.182]  Obey all orders without question.
[01:10:18.182 --> 01:10:20.963]  The comfort you've demanded is now mandatory.
[01:10:20.963 --> 01:10:21.343]  Be happy.
[01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:30.116]  Now, in England and many areas of the U.S., they do not allow more than groups of two to three people to gather.
[01:10:30.116 --> 01:10:32.437]  Martial law is incrementally being put into place.
[01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.799]  Most of your local departments have been covertly federalized.
[01:10:34.799 --> 01:10:36.480]  Your police have been corrupted.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.280]  Your police chiefs have been covertly paid off.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.843]  A few have gone public and talked about the attempted bribery by CIA, Army, Delta Force.
[01:10:44.756 --> 01:10:47.697]  And I just wanted to briefly play the first part of this CNN piece again.
[01:10:47.697 --> 01:10:50.037]  We're in a town, and guaranteed it is federal, folks.
[01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:52.598]  This is where they're getting the ideas, where they're getting the training.
[01:10:52.598 --> 01:10:56.199]  Oh, there's been a few shootings, so don't leave your house even during the day.
[01:10:56.199 --> 01:10:58.699]  Don't even be in your yard.
[01:10:58.699 --> 01:11:04.561]  Forget what Jell-O-The-Opera joked about, you know, 15 years ago about, uh, don't leave your subdivision sectors.
[01:11:05.203 --> 01:11:06.163]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:06.163 --> 01:11:10.364]  And of course, under Homeland Security, it is Neighborhood Watch spying on you, watching you.
[01:11:10.364 --> 01:11:11.685]  So here it is.
[01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:23.328]  Because of all the recent crime in Helena, West Helena, we're talking about robberies, home invasions, loitering, shootings, the mayor of Helena, West Helena, has decided to impose a curfew, but only in certain areas.
[01:11:23.328 --> 01:11:27.229]  And that applies for everyone, no matter the age, and no matter the time.
[01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:31.350]  If you're caught violating curfew, there's a chance you could wind up behind bars.
[01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.511]  We're afraid that somebody's going to get seriously hurt.
[01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:35.492]  Alright, there we go.
[01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:35.933]  Stop it there.
[01:12:01.255 --> 01:12:02.856]  Now, oh, where are bullets gonna go?
[01:12:02.856 --> 01:12:06.559]  Like, these magic bullets are flying around like the Kennedy assassination.
[01:12:06.559 --> 01:12:06.999]  I looked it up.
[01:12:06.999 --> 01:12:08.980]  There's been a couple murders the last few months there.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.721]  It's drug dealers shooting each other.
[01:12:10.721 --> 01:12:14.384]  The government ships in the drugs to create the crisis to begin with.
[01:12:14.384 --> 01:12:19.007]  And they will selectively, day or night, decide if you're allowed to be out or you'll be taken into the FEMA camp.
[01:12:19.781 --> 01:12:23.304]  And they train your children going back for a decade how to load on the bus during a FEMA drill.
[01:12:23.304 --> 01:12:24.866]  They don't tell the parents about it.
[01:12:24.866 --> 01:12:29.750]  They make them defecate staying in the classroom for eight hours in trash cans in front of everyone.
[01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:35.395]  No lunch is given to them under federal grants to quote teach them what martial law is like.
[01:12:35.395 --> 01:12:38.057]  In 1998, Swansboro happened up there.
[01:12:38.057 --> 01:12:39.138]  It also happened in Ohio.
[01:12:39.158 --> 01:12:39.739]  We're good to go.
[01:13:01.983 --> 01:13:05.244]  I was asked by an Austin police officer what I was doing in the mall yesterday.
[01:13:05.244 --> 01:13:08.466]  And he walked over and said, Alex, what are you doing there?
[01:13:08.466 --> 01:13:09.526]  You're supposed to be on the radio.
[01:13:09.526 --> 01:13:10.306]  And I thought he was joking.
[01:13:10.306 --> 01:13:10.866]  I smiled at him.
[01:13:10.866 --> 01:13:14.108]  He kind of looked at me like, what are you doing here?
[01:13:14.108 --> 01:13:17.089]  And I said, I'm buying a pair of sunglasses.
[01:13:17.089 --> 01:13:19.950]  So that's America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.991]  That's what things have turned into in this country.
[01:13:23.593 --> 01:13:31.240]  And they've built the FEMA emergency management centers, the fusion centers, the local emergency centers are really federal, moving the National Guard into them.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.743]  This is the last decade plus, a long, covert operation.
[01:13:35.467 --> 01:13:37.329]  Doesn't matter what administration's in.
[01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:39.351]  They use the neocons as fronts.
[01:13:39.351 --> 01:13:43.475]  There's a darker military-industrial complex owned by the private banks above us.
[01:13:43.475 --> 01:13:47.158]  For the next hour and 45 minutes, we're joined by Webster Griffin Tarbly.
[01:13:47.158 --> 01:13:51.062]  I wanted to get his take on what happened in Russia and Georgia.
[01:13:51.062 --> 01:13:54.485]  I wanted to get his analysis of the ongoing political campaign.
[01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:56.907]  Now it looks like Hillary's going to be the running mate of Barack Obama.
[01:13:56.907 --> 01:13:57.528]  How can that be?
[01:13:57.528 --> 01:14:00.951]  The woman in shining armor with the evil Barack Obama.
[01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:02.772]  It's all stage, folks.
[01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:04.573]  And I also want to get his take on the martial law.
[01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:13.258]  In fact, let's talk about this gearing up into the police state, this martial law being incrementally accelerated and ratcheted up here in the U.S.
[01:14:13.258 --> 01:14:14.539]  Webster, good to have you on.
[01:14:14.539 --> 01:14:15.159]  Hello, Alex.
[01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:15.939]  How are you?
[01:14:15.939 --> 01:14:16.360]  You bet.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:16.780]  I should have.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.942]  We're also carrying your new book, Obama, the Postmodern Coup.
[01:14:20.942 --> 01:14:22.083]  We have a few left.
[01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.404]  The first edition is almost sold out.
[01:14:23.404 --> 01:14:26.766]  The second is about to come out, but we have it available at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:26.766 --> 01:14:28.347]  Webster, first, what you heard, CNN,
[01:14:29.605 --> 01:14:33.390]  I would recommend that we supplement awareness of everything that you've said, which of course is real and valid.
[01:14:44.409 --> 01:14:52.576]  With another dimension, which is not the top-down, police-state, dictatorial, totalitarian dimension, but the fascist dimension.
[01:14:52.576 --> 01:14:54.278]  And this is fundamentally different.
[01:14:54.278 --> 01:15:01.424]  This is a grassroots, anti-authoritarian movement of goons, thugs, hooligans,
[01:15:02.194 --> 01:15:06.858]  And fervently idealistic students, a lot of them left liberals.
[01:15:06.858 --> 01:15:14.304]  Lemmings, zombies, Kool-Aid drinkers, Manson cultists, Hari Krishnas, whatever you want to call it.
[01:15:14.304 --> 01:15:15.665]  That is the Obama campaign.
[01:15:17.408 --> 01:15:29.251]  The history of fascism indicates that a point is reached where the army, well first of all where the police, are not enough to quell a mass upsurge.
[01:15:29.251 --> 01:15:37.414]  The army cannot be relied on because the history of rulers is that you send in a division and it goes over to the revolutionary side.
[01:15:37.414 --> 01:15:45.036]  And you've got to bring in the youth brigade, you've got to give the petty masses petty power, and that's exactly, but my point is is that
[01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:46.915]  We can blame this on Obama.
[01:15:46.915 --> 01:15:48.656]  I'm not saying he's good, Webster.
[01:15:48.656 --> 01:15:57.100]  The point is, going back at least 25 years, they've had a slow creep into getting citizens involved in the Tattletale squads, into the enforcement squads.
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:02.923]  Now they're co-opting the environmental movement to be their enforcement squads.
[01:16:02.923 --> 01:16:04.824]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:16:04.824 --> 01:16:11.128]  My point is, you're saying Obama, Obama, and I agree he's the figurehead for a very virulent form of this, but
[01:16:12.483 --> 01:16:18.226]  You know, going back to George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, they've been setting up... McCain's called for youth brigades now.
[01:16:18.226 --> 01:16:19.406]  Go ahead.
[01:16:19.406 --> 01:16:28.190]  I would just say that Obama is, if you look at the political landscape, there's only one political figure with a mass-based fascist movement.
[01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:29.230]  And that's Obama.
[01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:30.811]  McCain doesn't have one.
[01:16:30.811 --> 01:16:31.651]  Bush doesn't have one.
[01:16:31.651 --> 01:16:32.252]  It's a joke.
[01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:33.712]  Clinton doesn't have one.
[01:16:33.712 --> 01:16:34.953]  No other Democrat has one.
[01:16:35.473 --> 01:16:39.538]  I've just spent the weekend at the Puma Convention here in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:39.538 --> 01:16:52.214]  This is the anti-Obama Democrats, and I think this is an extremely useful thing to fight Obama up to the time of the convention, to try to stop him at the convention, and if he gets the Democratic nomination, then to defeat him.
[01:16:52.214 --> 01:16:54.797]  I think this is a real distinction.
[01:16:55.217 --> 01:17:07.287]  History shows that there's a huge difference between just another bourgeois politician, no matter how bellicose, no matter how oppressive, no matter how corrupt, and something that gets you into fascism.
[01:17:07.287 --> 01:17:11.650]  With Obama, you've got something like a Green Corps.
[01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:13.852]  You've got a Homeland Security Corps.
[01:17:14.472 --> 01:17:17.654]  And you've got Al Gore's famous Green Army.
[01:17:17.654 --> 01:17:23.057]  So the difference is one way the FBI comes and harasses you or the kinds of things you were talking about.
[01:17:23.057 --> 01:17:29.461]  The other side is a gang of goons and thugs come and burn you out and kill you or lynch you or whatever it is.
[01:17:30.101 --> 01:17:42.514]  And the idea is that the police state gets popular cover, anti-authoritarian or even left or radical cover, out of the fact that you've got these Obama bots that are in action.
[01:17:42.514 --> 01:17:49.021]  I heard stories from people who had been in the Texas Democratic Caucuses, as well as the Iowa ones.
[01:17:49.501 --> 01:18:00.749]  The way that Obama won those caucuses is with intimidation, with threats, with locking the doors, with pushing people, beating them up in some cases, threatening to beat them up.
[01:18:00.749 --> 01:18:13.618]  And when you go to the internet, people who have been blogging against Obama report that they are getting massive cyber warfare, denial of service attacks, attempts to overwhelm their cell phones, and so on down the line.
[01:18:13.618 --> 01:18:16.881]  And then in Germany, they ordered the Germans to not allow any signs
[01:18:17.501 --> 01:18:22.465]  Pro or con, and the police did beat up people with signs that are under Obama's orders.
[01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:25.147]  Yes, right, and it's just amazing.
[01:18:25.147 --> 01:18:29.371]  So I would say you basically have two classes of politicians.
[01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:37.157]  You have the old style ones, however bad they are, of course they're very bad as you're pointing out, but the Bushes, the McCains, the Clintons, that's one thing.
[01:18:37.157 --> 01:18:38.278]  That's bad enough.
[01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:41.881]  But then when you get into the area of this scurrilous
[01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:44.643]  We're good to go.
[01:19:00.515 --> 01:19:16.081]  But now we realize we weren't, and now we are, and this has been a tremendous deterioration, and now it's too late to roll it back, because the genius of fascism, of course, is that it goes out and destroys the institutions that might resist the things that you're talking about.
[01:19:16.081 --> 01:19:23.444]  So far, not that many institutions have been crushed by the measures that you're talking about, but with Obama and the Green Corps, that will begin.
[01:19:23.444 --> 01:19:29.606]  Well, I'm sure I have to say, the mainstream media, the corporates, have been behind him, so that's the big strike against him, and
[01:19:30.905 --> 01:19:42.450]  You are right in saying that he's the only one that gives any support to the government and the corrupt system, and I've heard mainstream pundits say that
[01:19:43.473 --> 01:19:50.039]  We need Obama to bring people back into government, back into trusting the state, into infusing it with new blood.
[01:19:50.039 --> 01:19:53.142]  And so he would give a new lease on life to the New World Order.
[01:19:53.142 --> 01:20:00.630]  They also say that right now they complain that Andrew Sullivan complained in the Atlantic Magazine last December in an issue with Obama on the cover.
[01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:01.991]  And then the White House said...
[01:20:16.664 --> 01:20:19.646]  That Obama will be tested by, quote, an attack.
[01:20:19.646 --> 01:20:24.529]  Then he can pose as a savior when we're hit by a nuke or a bioweapon, and then be our new dictator.
[01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:27.991]  And after all, he's black, so blacks can do no wrong.
[01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.032]  Everything's gonna be fine.
[01:20:29.032 --> 01:20:36.236]  Webster Tarbley... On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:36.716 --> 01:20:44.823]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:44.823 --> 01:20:53.011]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:53.011 --> 01:20:57.755]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:58.075 --> 01:21:03.302]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:03.302 --> 01:21:07.648]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:07.648 --> 01:21:08.749]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:08.749 --> 01:21:12.775]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:18.139]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:18.139 --> 01:21:21.121]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:25.025]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:25.025 --> 01:21:26.526]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:26.526 --> 01:21:31.249]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:34.732]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:21:34.732 --> 01:21:36.694]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:21:37.294 --> 01:21:40.337]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:21:40.337 --> 01:21:46.081]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:50.324]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:21:50.324 --> 01:21:55.528]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:22:29.947 --> 01:22:33.710]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:38.755]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:38.755 --> 01:22:44.180]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:54.709]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:59.590]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:02.371]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:23:02.371 --> 01:23:05.931]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:23:05.931 --> 01:23:18.434]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:26.966]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:23:26.966 --> 01:23:28.208]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:33.350]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:41.172]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[01:23:41.172 --> 01:23:44.933]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[01:23:44.933 --> 01:23:49.115]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[01:23:49.115 --> 01:23:49.715]  Protect yourself
[01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:50.295]  I think so.
[01:24:11.907 --> 01:24:16.351]  Including bug detectors, camera finders, countermeasure equipment and night vision gear.

[01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:34.044]  He's going the distance.
[01:24:34.044 --> 01:24:35.886]  He's going for speed.
[01:24:56.623 --> 01:24:58.744]  All right Webster, let's keep going with Obama.
[01:24:58.744 --> 01:25:16.751]  I want to break down what elite is behind him, but I really want to get your expertise because you know a lot about Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, but what we just saw in the last five days with the sneak attack by the Georgians, backed by NATO, the US, and the Israelis,
[01:25:17.698 --> 01:25:19.920]  I really doubt she'll be his running mate.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.201]  I don't see much indication of that.
[01:25:37.336 --> 01:25:38.836]  Well, I don't believe so.
[01:25:38.836 --> 01:25:48.019]  I think there's a profound hatred by the Wall Street groups themselves of Mrs. Clinton, because they've put all their money into Obama.
[01:25:48.019 --> 01:25:53.360]  It's about a third of a billion dollars so far, and they've been stabbing Clinton in the back.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.322]  Clinton, up until about December, had seemed to be the candidate of Wall Street, but that turned out not to be the case.
[01:25:59.902 --> 01:26:16.599]  So what you've got now is the Rockefeller, Soros, Bilderberg, Trilateral, Rand Corporation, Council on Foreign Relations, Skull and Bones, Chicago School, Foundations, the guys of the Ford Foundation, all of this aligning.
[01:26:16.599 --> 01:26:21.444]  You can hear the Foundations, by the way, on National Public Radio, if you want to know what the Foundations think.
[01:26:21.864 --> 01:26:27.650]  We have foundation-funded oligarch radio, NPR and PBS on the TV, right?
[01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:36.399]  Whatever Bill Moyers does, he's the spokesman for this huge power of the family fondue that are now ensconced in the foundations.
[01:26:36.399 --> 01:26:37.760]  So think about it.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.302]  So you're saying Bill Moyers is bad?
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:40.961]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:26:40.961 --> 01:26:42.962]  You know, he was the spokesman for Johnson.
[01:26:42.962 --> 01:26:45.103]  He was selling the Vietnam War back then.
[01:26:45.103 --> 01:26:52.688]  And he is, I think, one of the leading operatives of this foundation universe, which is what has produced Obama.
[01:26:52.688 --> 01:27:00.172]  Obama is a racist provocateur, a race invader, or race monger, or I would say poverty pimp.
[01:27:00.172 --> 01:27:05.075]  When Obama says he was a community organizer, what in the world does that mean?
[01:27:05.075 --> 01:27:06.956]  I was a poverty... He was a race...
[01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:16.595]  A community organizer for the Gamaliel Foundation, which is funded by the Ford Foundation using Alinsky doctrines.
[01:27:16.595 --> 01:27:17.755]  What does that mean?
[01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:19.456]  It means that he's a counterinsurgent.
[01:27:19.456 --> 01:27:20.437]  He's a wrecker.
[01:27:20.437 --> 01:27:25.960]  He's a police agent sent into those communities to fragment them, to pit one group against another.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:26.640]  I agree.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.542]  Look at what the Great Society did.
[01:27:28.542 --> 01:27:30.624]  It basically destroyed.
[01:27:30.624 --> 01:27:32.546]  You had black illegitimacy at 10%.
[01:27:32.546 --> 01:27:34.388]  Now it's over 90%.
[01:27:34.388 --> 01:27:36.249]  It's totally wrecked those communities.
[01:27:36.249 --> 01:27:46.339]  And we know, going back to Margaret Sanger, with the letters to the Colgates and others, saying we've got to hire blacks to go in so we can sterilize them and kill them.
[01:27:46.339 --> 01:27:48.361]  These black weeds only trust other blacks.
[01:27:48.361 --> 01:27:51.364]  So we've got to create a cadre of foundation blacks that serve us.
[01:27:51.824 --> 01:27:54.025]  Yeah, this is a factor.
[01:27:54.025 --> 01:28:00.269]  I would, however, point to the great turning point in the United States history, the great U-turn, is under Carter.
[01:28:00.269 --> 01:28:06.372]  And Carter, of course, is a trilateral puppet, selected by Brzezinski personally, approved by David Rockefeller.
[01:28:07.052 --> 01:28:09.133]  A similar operation to what we have today.
[01:28:09.133 --> 01:28:11.274]  Jimmy, who comes out of nowhere... Why did they destroy him then?
[01:28:11.274 --> 01:28:13.696]  I mean, I don't think Carter himself is bad.
[01:28:13.696 --> 01:28:14.936]  Carter is bad, yes.
[01:28:14.936 --> 01:28:16.497]  Carter, look at those speeches.
[01:28:16.497 --> 01:28:18.438]  Go back and look at the Malez speech.
[01:28:18.438 --> 01:28:24.962]  Go back and look at Carter's rage at the American people saying the energy crisis is real and you better believe it.
[01:28:24.962 --> 01:28:28.484]  Now, this is also very interesting in terms of trilateral mentality.
[01:28:28.484 --> 01:28:32.126]  Carter's famous Malez speech, the crisis of spirit,
[01:28:32.666 --> 01:28:44.056]  ...of July 1979 is essentially an incompetent, failed president blaming the American people for the fact that we have an incompetent ruling elite.
[01:28:44.056 --> 01:28:46.819]  The Wall Street ruling class is incompetent.
[01:28:46.819 --> 01:28:48.700]  They're incapable of governing.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:54.565]  They have destroyed the greatest economic power in the world, and this is precisely the point.
[01:28:54.565 --> 01:28:57.268]  Under Carter, you have Brzezinski running this
[01:28:57.988 --> 01:29:04.275]  Lunatic, adventurist, anti-Soviet, pro-Islamic fundamentalist foreign policy featuring Khomeini.
[01:29:04.275 --> 01:29:05.256]  That's one side.
[01:29:05.256 --> 01:29:14.046]  The other side, of course, is Paul Adolf Volcker at the Federal Reserve with a 22% prime rate, the highest in American history, at least recent history.
[01:29:14.646 --> 01:29:17.568]  And, of course, for most of us, 22% is the primary.
[01:29:17.568 --> 01:29:18.269]  We don't get that.
[01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:21.091]  We get 30% or 35%.
[01:29:21.091 --> 01:29:24.493]  And this is, of course, when the racket of credit cards usually began.
[01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:28.776]  And it is when the United States began to de-industrialize.
[01:29:28.776 --> 01:29:36.401]  The factories that could not be destroyed by Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Stalin, and Mao were destroyed by vultures.
[01:29:36.401 --> 01:29:40.725]  Yes, the neo-liberal de-industrialization for control of the population.
[01:29:40.725 --> 01:29:41.245]  Neo-serfdom.
[01:29:41.845 --> 01:29:48.410]  And the idea of a low-wage economy, union-busting, the labor movement in full retreat.
[01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:53.513]  But all covered with an envelope, all covered with an envelope of liberalism.
[01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:55.715]  And less covered, this is exactly it.
[01:29:55.715 --> 01:30:05.201]  Under environmentalism, the limits of growth, the era of scarcity, and of course in foreign policy, human rights and humanitarian concerns.
[01:30:05.201 --> 01:30:07.683]  Let's just stay there, I totally agree with you on the analysis.
[01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:09.704]  We want to get all your perspectives on it.
[01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:20.393]  Let's explain to people this whole Malthusian, social Darwinistic world system and how it controls both the left and the right and break that down.
[01:30:20.393 --> 01:30:21.794]  We're on the march.
[01:30:21.794 --> 01:30:24.296]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:24.296 --> 01:30:26.998]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:30.422 --> 01:30:33.626]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:30:33.626 --> 01:30:37.110]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:39.773]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:39.773 --> 01:30:41.314]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:41.314 --> 01:30:42.115]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:42.115 --> 01:30:42.976]  This is his ammo.
[01:30:42.976 --> 01:30:44.498]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:44.498 --> 01:30:46.060]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:53.607]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:53.607 --> 01:30:54.087]  Some U.S.
[01:30:54.087 --> 01:31:00.453]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:00.453 --> 01:31:03.896]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:04.136 --> 01:31:14.426]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:14.426 --> 01:31:15.647]  Fabled enemies.
[01:31:15.647 --> 01:31:23.394]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:23.394 --> 01:31:26.778]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:30.137 --> 01:31:33.582]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:31:33.582 --> 01:31:35.885]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:31:35.885 --> 01:31:39.189]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:46.078]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:31:46.078 --> 01:31:48.201]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:31:48.681 --> 01:31:51.983]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:31:51.983 --> 01:31:56.765]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:31:56.765 --> 01:32:00.707]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:32:00.707 --> 01:32:02.327]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:32:02.327 --> 01:32:04.989]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[01:32:04.989 --> 01:32:10.932]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[01:32:10.932 --> 01:32:14.693]  Remember that code, 500, to qualify for the free webcam.
[01:32:14.693 --> 01:32:16.174]  Webex, now part of Cisco.
[01:32:16.374 --> 01:32:16.754]  We're good.
[01:32:30.231 --> 01:32:33.333]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:32:33.333 --> 01:32:38.835]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:32:38.835 --> 01:32:44.538]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:32:44.538 --> 01:32:46.039]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:46.039 --> 01:32:54.923]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:32:55.223 --> 01:32:55.363]  Yes.
[01:32:55.363 --> 01:32:57.205]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:32:57.205 --> 01:33:01.408]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:33:01.408 --> 01:33:06.431]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:33:06.431 --> 01:33:10.274]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:33:10.274 --> 01:33:11.315]  Keep it natural.
[01:33:11.315 --> 01:33:14.757]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:33:19.861 --> 01:33:23.790]  Try CowBend Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:24.993]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:33:30.831 --> 01:33:45.581]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:54.626]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:33:54.626 --> 01:33:56.948]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:34:06.891 --> 01:34:14.594]  Too many kids are what's making planet worse.
[01:34:14.594 --> 01:34:16.934]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:34:16.934 --> 01:34:19.415]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:34:21.579 --> 01:34:27.543]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:34:27.543 --> 01:34:34.847]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:34:34.847 --> 01:34:39.810]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:42.772]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:34:42.772 --> 01:34:46.934]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:34:46.934 --> 01:34:50.016]  We're gonna have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[01:34:51.335 --> 01:34:55.359]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:34:55.359 --> 01:34:56.681]  Well, join me.
[01:34:56.681 --> 01:34:59.043]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:34:59.043 --> 01:35:02.407]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:35:02.407 --> 01:35:08.473]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:35:22.245 --> 01:35:38.490]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, TruthNews.us, Webster Griffin Tarmley wrote the unauthorized biography, the first big one, back in the early 1990s, about George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:46.253]  He of course wrote Synthetic Terror, and they carried out the 9-11 attacks, government inside job, black-off contractor job.
[01:35:47.512 --> 01:35:55.082]  But of course he's got the new Barack Obama, the post-modern coup, available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:58.866]  Okay, Webster, I'm going to turn the mic off here and give you the floor.
[01:36:03.489 --> 01:36:25.123]  I think we should start at the beginning here about where this new order comes from, who they really are, so people don't get confused by all the left cover, right cover, to bring us up to today with Barack Obama, who I agree with you is probably the biggest threat to liberty, only because of the figurehead and the cover he gives them, not that he actually runs anything or not that I'm saying McCain's a good guy.
[01:36:25.123 --> 01:36:27.104]  So start at the beginning if you can.
[01:36:27.819 --> 01:36:38.703]  And because of the fascist mass movement, or again, reasonable facsimile of a fascist mass movement, which Obama has been able to mobilize, and no other.
[01:36:38.703 --> 01:36:40.964]  This is the qualitative distinction.
[01:36:40.964 --> 01:36:48.586]  This is why Obama is, far and away, the worst possible outcome, and needs to be opposed in any possible way.
[01:36:48.586 --> 01:36:50.167]  I wouldn't call it the New World Order.
[01:36:50.167 --> 01:36:52.908]  I'd call it Anglo-American world empire.
[01:36:52.908 --> 01:36:55.189]  U.S.-British world domination.
[01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.909]  This is what it is.
[01:36:56.549 --> 01:36:57.751]  Uh, there are of course...
[01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:17.694]  Well, again, let me call it Anglo-American World Empire, because I think it gets the idea.
[01:37:17.694 --> 01:37:19.775]  There are, of course, others that are allied with it.
[01:37:19.775 --> 01:37:25.039]  The European Union, the Euro-garks are largely submissive to this.
[01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:26.340]  Russia is not submissive.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:31.504]  I think it makes no sense at all to say Putin and Medvedev now are figures of the New World Order.
[01:37:31.504 --> 01:37:32.224]  They are not.
[01:37:32.224 --> 01:37:33.025]  They are opponents.
[01:37:33.886 --> 01:37:53.244]  As much as they can be, of this Anglo-American world empire, China is in a somewhat more ambiguous position in terms of what you see, but we have reliable reports that underneath it, the Chinese are even more hostile to the continued Anglo-American world domination and they're biding
[01:37:53.804 --> 01:37:54.425]  There are times.
[01:37:54.425 --> 01:37:56.666]  So I regard these two countries as allies.
[01:37:56.666 --> 01:38:05.531]  I welcome the existence of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which has posed a counterweight to the U.S.
[01:38:05.531 --> 01:38:06.171]  and the British.
[01:38:06.171 --> 01:38:17.998]  I would say without Putin, we would have had a police state here already, because it is the existence of this international opposition that prevents, you know, the Wall Street group from imposing what they want here.
[01:38:17.998 --> 01:38:22.641]  The problem we have right now, the strategic constellation that Obama comes out of,
[01:38:23.281 --> 01:38:30.184]  Is that we've had the incompetent and disastrous administration of Bush Cheney and the neocons.
[01:38:30.184 --> 01:38:43.151]  Now, their approach is, the world is focused on the Middle East, everything revolves around Israel, you've got to destroy the leading Arab state, you've got to destroy the leading Islamic state, I guess Iraq and Iran.
[01:38:43.151 --> 01:38:49.013]  You've got to go into Afghanistan, primarily on an anti-Islamic mission.
[01:38:49.013 --> 01:38:52.215]  Brzezinski would say, do go there, but not for that.
[01:38:52.953 --> 01:39:07.498]  And therefore, this has been played out now under the bankrupt and idiotic mythology of 9-11, which you've done so much to expose, and some of the rest of us have also tried to do this.
[01:39:07.498 --> 01:39:11.039]  The thing is, you're getting to the point of diminishing returns with that.
[01:39:11.039 --> 01:39:12.800]  It is simply impossible to keep going.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:13.741]  We're good to go.
[01:39:28.365 --> 01:39:30.066]  It's an interesting case.
[01:39:30.066 --> 01:39:35.347]  Normally when people talk about the Hegelian dialectic in politics, I think this is much overstated.
[01:39:35.347 --> 01:39:37.508]  The British are really not students of Hegel.
[01:39:37.508 --> 01:39:39.448]  They're students of the Venetians.
[01:39:39.448 --> 01:39:40.589]  It's very crude.
[01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:41.429]  Divide and conquer.
[01:39:41.429 --> 01:39:44.870]  But now, with Brzezinski, there is a Hegelian element.
[01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:47.951]  Brzezinski is the student of a guy called Carl Friedrich.
[01:39:48.411 --> 01:39:51.433]  Who was a professor trained in Germany.
[01:39:51.433 --> 01:40:02.701]  He wrote a book about the 17th century, the age of the Baroque, and with Brzezinski co-authored some books about totalitarianism, targeting of course the Soviets, anti-Russian.
[01:40:03.402 --> 01:40:06.244]  He is a student of Alfred Weber.
[01:40:06.244 --> 01:40:17.413]  So, Alfred Weber is the younger brother of Max Weber, Max Weber, the German sociologist around, you know, from about 1890 to 1920.
[01:40:17.413 --> 01:40:19.415]  He was extremely influential.
[01:40:19.415 --> 01:40:22.297]  The guy wrote books about the Protestant ethic and all kinds of other things.
[01:40:22.857 --> 01:40:29.139]  In Alfred Weber, there is a strong Hegelian philosophy of history element.
[01:40:29.139 --> 01:40:33.221]  So the idea simply is, you cannot be Johnny One Note.
[01:40:33.221 --> 01:40:39.563]  You cannot do your operations always under right-wing, militaristic, top-down cover.
[01:40:39.563 --> 01:40:43.665]  You've got to modulate that, and we're now in the middle of a modulation.
[01:40:43.665 --> 01:40:46.366]  Carter was a similar phase.
[01:40:46.366 --> 01:40:48.727]  Carter dropped the usual Cold War stuff.
[01:40:49.307 --> 01:40:58.031]  But he continued it in a more ferocious form, under the guise of human rights, humanitarianism, and interfering in the internal affairs of countries.
[01:40:58.031 --> 01:41:05.414]  Carter was also on a worldwide vendetta to shut down peaceful nuclear energy development, but under left cover.
[01:41:05.414 --> 01:41:11.356]  Not saying, we want you to be puppets of our empire, but saying we don't like nuclear energy.
[01:41:11.356 --> 01:41:14.478]  So when we reach a point by about 2006, 2007, where the Anglo-American ruling class says,
[01:41:17.919 --> 01:41:19.599]  Bush and Cheney are crazy.
[01:41:19.599 --> 01:41:21.580]  The neocons are bankrupt.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:22.840]  We're not getting anywhere.
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:28.342]  We cannot have the U.S., the British, and the Israelis at war with the world forever.
[01:41:28.342 --> 01:41:29.642]  It doesn't work.
[01:41:29.642 --> 01:41:30.742]  We're too bankrupt.
[01:41:30.742 --> 01:41:31.922]  We're too isolated.
[01:41:31.922 --> 01:41:34.023]  Our armies are defeated and demoralized.
[01:41:34.023 --> 01:41:36.383]  Our populations are extremely restive.
[01:41:36.383 --> 01:41:43.285]  We've got a possible mass upsurge around impeachment and anti-Bush, anti-Cheney, end of war, and all this.
[01:41:43.285 --> 01:41:46.466]  So basically they say, let's repeat the Carter operation.
[01:41:46.966 --> 01:41:59.211]  They had been grooming Obama, in my view, since about 1981 to 1983, when Obama and Brzezinski were together on the campus of Columbia University, Morningside Heights in Manhattan.
[01:42:00.015 --> 01:42:01.716]  And recruited him, as far as I can see.
[01:42:01.716 --> 01:42:09.340]  I would hope that Obama would comment on this, if he doesn't like this particular view of his background.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.862]  But he's one of a series of controlled assets.
[01:42:13.862 --> 01:42:19.225]  Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who spouts the self-same rhetoric, is another one.
[01:42:19.225 --> 01:42:22.567]  And there are undoubtedly other options, not all black, to be sure.
[01:42:23.307 --> 01:42:33.037]  Others, you know, southern governors or, you know, northern gritty populists or whatever, but all controlled by this trilateral commission.
[01:42:33.037 --> 01:42:36.280]  So now the idea is they're basically twofold.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:42.306]  If you're going to continue Anglo-American world domination, the US-UK world empire,
[01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:48.654]  You've got to deal with the fact that you've got this Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russia-China.
[01:42:48.654 --> 01:42:52.897]  Russia, of course, the greatest military power, and a tremendous energy power.
[01:42:52.897 --> 01:42:59.821]  The Chinese, the greatest demographic power in terms of people, and the highest rates of economic development.
[01:42:59.821 --> 01:43:02.903]  The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is a magnet.
[01:43:02.903 --> 01:43:04.264]  It's the counter-pole.
[01:43:04.264 --> 01:43:08.867]  Anybody who doesn't like the Anglo-Americans, for example, especially in Africa.
[01:43:08.867 --> 01:43:12.650]  If you're an African state, you have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
[01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:15.852]  Trying to crush you, destroy you, loot you.
[01:43:15.852 --> 01:43:18.294]  The Chinese come along and say, let's make deals 50-50.
[01:43:18.294 --> 01:43:26.839]  It's not humanitarianism, but it's business and it's much better to have an alternative as it was possible during the Cold War.
[01:43:26.839 --> 01:43:30.602]  So Brzezinski basically says, we've got to crush Russia and China.
[01:43:31.162 --> 01:43:31.982]  How do you do that?
[01:43:31.982 --> 01:43:33.823]  Well, it goes like this.
[01:43:33.823 --> 01:43:35.803]  First, kick the Chinese out of Africa.
[01:43:35.803 --> 01:43:37.104]  That's why you've got the U.S.
[01:43:37.104 --> 01:43:38.244]  African Command.
[01:43:38.244 --> 01:43:44.866]  You've got the destabilization of Kenya by Obama's cousin, Odinga, who is the... I call him the killer Luo.
[01:43:44.866 --> 01:43:48.127]  He's the necklacer of Kenya.
[01:43:48.127 --> 01:43:51.508]  The Luos, by the way, with the Luos, it's a little bit like the Kurds.
[01:43:51.508 --> 01:43:52.808]  You can destabilize Kenya.
[01:43:53.368 --> 01:43:56.869]  Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Congo.
[01:43:56.869 --> 01:44:03.671]  You can destabilize five countries using these luaus that Obama happens to represent.
[01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:05.631]  So you've got to kick the Chinese out.
[01:44:05.631 --> 01:44:10.233]  The interest in Zimbabwe is, of course, that's where the Chinese get their minerals.
[01:44:10.233 --> 01:44:10.853]  So the U.S.
[01:44:10.853 --> 01:44:13.854]  and the British say, oh, it's a humanitarian emergency.
[01:44:13.854 --> 01:44:15.554]  Mugabe is a bad man.
[01:44:15.554 --> 01:44:16.694]  Let's get rid of him.
[01:44:16.694 --> 01:44:18.435]  Real reason, Chinese minerals.
[01:44:18.955 --> 01:44:21.958]  Sudan, the best example, the biggest country in Africa.
[01:44:21.958 --> 01:44:24.360]  That's about 7% of the Chinese oil.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:31.206]  Therefore, the Anglo-Americans gin up this Darfur crisis, which is real, but not created by the Sudanese government.
[01:44:31.206 --> 01:44:36.791]  It's partly a feature of the world oil price and, you know, starvation and so forth going on there.
[01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:42.537]  But the first thing, therefore, is try to destroy every Chinese ally you can in Africa.
[01:44:42.537 --> 01:44:43.778]  Get the Chinese out.
[01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:45.039]  Cut off the oil and the minerals.
[01:44:45.675 --> 01:44:51.697]  Destroy places like Burma, Chinese ally, and destroy Pakistan.
[01:44:51.697 --> 01:44:54.378]  Carve Pakistan into four to five pieces.
[01:44:54.378 --> 01:45:03.202]  Even though the current government of Pakistan is Anglo-American puppets, the conducting of the Afghan war is now only targeting, really,
[01:45:03.923 --> 01:45:09.288]  Pakistan, bombing Pakistan, humiliating the government, and preparing the breakup of that country.
[01:45:09.288 --> 01:45:10.149]  Why?
[01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:16.796]  It is a natural ally of China against India, always has been, and it's an important commercial partner.
[01:45:16.796 --> 01:45:21.381]  The end game is, once you've got China stripped of allies and isolated,
[01:45:21.921 --> 01:45:27.965]  Brzezinski says to the Chinese, look, you want oil, you want minerals, go and get them in Siberia.
[01:45:27.965 --> 01:45:32.688]  Go to war with Russia, invade Siberia, and you can get everything you want.
[01:45:32.688 --> 01:45:36.470]  Siberia has lots of minerals, lots of oil, very few Russians.
[01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:37.531]  Let's have World War III.
[01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:44.802]  It means, therefore, play China against Russia, destroy them both, get rid of them both, and the U.S.
[01:45:44.802 --> 01:45:48.285]  and the British can have another hundred years of world domination.
[01:45:48.285 --> 01:45:56.972]  This is exactly the same project we had with Lady Astor, Lord Astor, the Cliveden set in Britain.
[01:45:56.972 --> 01:45:59.194]  It's the great game of divide and conquer, simply put.
[01:45:59.574 --> 01:46:14.219]  Lord Lothian, Lord Halifax, Lord Brand, Prescott Bush, John Foster Dulles, Lord Montague Norman of the Bank of England, Sir Henry Deterding of Royal Dutch Shell, and they basically said, we'll call this appeasement, but it's not appeasement, it's war.
[01:46:14.219 --> 01:46:15.319]  Let's build up Hitler.
[01:46:15.979 --> 01:46:17.540]  And we'll point him east.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:18.700]  We'll encourage him to go east.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:22.081]  And that's all on record with Lord Milner and the Milner Group and the rest of them.
[01:46:22.081 --> 01:46:23.582]  And that's exactly it.
[01:46:23.582 --> 01:46:25.663]  The Milner Group is the Cliveden set.
[01:46:25.663 --> 01:46:29.024]  That's a different name for it in the later phase.
[01:46:29.024 --> 01:46:31.945]  Then there's Carol Quigley and many others, right?
[01:46:31.945 --> 01:46:34.146]  He was a historian for the British Round Table Group.
[01:46:34.606 --> 01:46:39.931]  Yeah, but he does tell you the story, and he presents it as bad, because of course it didn't work.
[01:46:39.931 --> 01:46:47.918]  So their idea is, play Hitler against Stalin, and get rid of both of them that way, and we can have another hundred years of the British Empire.
[01:46:47.918 --> 01:46:55.064]  No, it didn't work, because of course you get Hitler making the Hitler-Stalin pact, and then turning West, and destroying the French.
[01:46:56.087 --> 01:47:01.668]  And the Scandinavians, and the Low Countries, and so forth, and the British get themselves into a fix.
[01:47:01.668 --> 01:47:03.449]  They're going to be destroyed unless the U.S.
[01:47:03.449 --> 01:47:04.949]  comes to save them.
[01:47:04.949 --> 01:47:13.611]  So that's one of the reasons that Winston Churchill was the main beneficiary of Pearl Harbor, and I believe did the most to make sure that this was a surprise attack.
[01:47:13.611 --> 01:47:25.214]  Yeah, but then you see, Darby Lee, I agree with all this analysis, but then you throw in that Roosevelt was a good guy when we know he put in the oil embargoes, and... Well, let me just say something.
[01:47:25.774 --> 01:47:29.517]  I mean, let me just throw this out, though, and then get your take on it.
[01:47:29.517 --> 01:47:34.560]  You have Roosevelt putting the oil embargo on the Japanese.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:48.410]  You have Roosevelt intensifying military action through the groups they'd set up after the Boxer Rebellion into the Flying Tigers to engage militarily the Japanese U.S.
[01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:50.032]  trained forces and even U.S.
[01:47:50.032 --> 01:47:54.415]  pilots, quote, as contractors and start engaging and start shooting down
[01:47:55.556 --> 01:48:02.040]  Japanese bombers, Japanese officers, they start attacking Japanese airfields.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.441]  So for those who don't know, the U.S.
[01:48:03.441 --> 01:48:14.528]  through basically the Halliburton or the Blackwater of the day, attacked in southern China and in surrounding areas, Japanese forces.
[01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:18.711]  Then, of course, a week before they get the codes, they know they're about to launch the attack.
[01:48:18.711 --> 01:48:19.692]  The British know.
[01:48:19.692 --> 01:48:20.473]  Wait a minute.
[01:48:20.473 --> 01:48:21.833]  The British know, the U.S.
[01:48:21.833 --> 01:48:22.434]  does not know.
[01:48:23.331 --> 01:48:24.391]  This is the point.
[01:48:24.391 --> 01:48:25.752]  The British have the Japanese... Oh, really?
[01:48:25.752 --> 01:48:29.633]  Is that why the four submarines attacked Pearl Harbor and they were ordered to still stand down?
[01:48:29.633 --> 01:48:35.176]  The Japanese naval code, JN-28, had been broken by the British.
[01:48:35.176 --> 01:48:38.817]  The purple code, the diplomatic code, had been broken by the U.S.
[01:48:38.817 --> 01:48:39.457]  So the U.S.
[01:48:39.457 --> 01:48:43.078]  knew an attack was probably imminent, but not where or when.
[01:48:43.078 --> 01:48:49.381]  The Honolulu advertiser Webster ran a headline a week before saying the Japanese will attack Pearl Harbor on December 7th.
[01:48:50.194 --> 01:48:52.616]  Yeah, then that's... Our military didn't know, though.
[01:48:52.616 --> 01:48:53.917]  Look, here's the problem, Tarbly.
[01:48:53.917 --> 01:48:58.161]  I wonder why the commanders didn't send out some picket boats.
[01:48:58.161 --> 01:48:59.102]  You know, some trawlers.
[01:48:59.102 --> 01:49:01.524]  Listen... Stop, stop, stop.
[01:49:01.524 --> 01:49:02.785]  Just for a second, Tarbly.
[01:49:02.785 --> 01:49:05.227]  I totally... Look, I know you're a great historian, smart guy.
[01:49:05.227 --> 01:49:06.328]  That's why we have you here.
[01:49:06.328 --> 01:49:07.309]  That's why I sell your books.
[01:49:07.309 --> 01:49:08.730]  I like you.
[01:49:08.730 --> 01:49:11.212]  But I'm really trying to get down to fundamentals here.
[01:49:11.212 --> 01:49:12.994]  Because you have this, um...
[01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:27.820]  Historical perspective that Roosevelt's a great guy, and we do have on one end the Bush-Nazi-Milner angle trying to overthrow him as they brought Hitler to power right around the same time in 35-36 here in the United States.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:32.684]  So there's truth to what you're saying, but there's a subtler, just like you said, left cover.
[01:49:32.684 --> 01:49:39.129]  The same interests were also hedging their bets with Roosevelt, and so this whole thing about Roosevelt being a good guy, I just don't buy into.
[01:49:39.992 --> 01:49:47.456]  Remember that the relation of the Morgan Group to Roosevelt is that they tried to kill him in Miami before he was inaugurated.
[01:49:47.456 --> 01:49:59.001]  They tried to organize a coup against him in the form of the Morgan coup, the Mussolini-style march on Washington, the Smedley-Butler revelations, and so forth, the Dick Stein Committee.
[01:49:59.001 --> 01:50:07.605]  And, according to Elliot Roosevelt, the Churchill gang poisoned Roosevelt and killed him so that the British could launch the Cold War in the wake of this.
[01:50:07.605 --> 01:50:09.026]  Just on the Japanese question,
[01:50:09.566 --> 01:50:13.969]  The argument that you make depends on the idea that the Japanese are a benign power.
[01:50:13.969 --> 01:50:16.130]  The Japanese are amazing... I'm not saying they're a benign power.
[01:50:16.130 --> 01:50:16.950]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:18.691]  I'm not saying they're a benign power.
[01:50:18.691 --> 01:50:20.972]  I'm saying they were, but see that's what brought the U.S.
[01:50:20.972 --> 01:50:21.413]  into the war.
[01:50:21.413 --> 01:50:27.016]  That's what I brought up Japan was, was, was the British screaming for help and now the U.S.
[01:50:27.016 --> 01:50:30.037]  comes in after the Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:50:30.037 --> 01:50:31.078]  I'm saying there was total
[01:50:33.139 --> 01:50:38.402]  I recommend the book by Russ Bridger and Nave, which explains this question of the codes.
[01:50:38.402 --> 01:50:44.726]  That the British had broken the Japanese naval code, but did not share the details of where the attack would come.
[01:50:56.357 --> 01:51:07.288]  But the British, therefore... The other problem is, the people who were controlling the intelligence were Stimson of Wall Street and of the invisible government, and Marshall, similarly.
[01:51:07.288 --> 01:51:10.011]  The question is, they cut off intelligence to Roosevelt.
[01:51:10.011 --> 01:51:12.874]  It's not that Roosevelt didn't give the Navy the intelligence.
[01:51:13.394 --> 01:51:17.658]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:51:17.658 --> 01:51:18.899]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:39.371]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:39.371 --> 01:51:45.719]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:55.295]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:51:55.295 --> 01:52:02.376]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:02.376 --> 01:52:05.556]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:05.556 --> 01:52:11.337]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:11.337 --> 01:52:13.938]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:14.418 --> 01:52:20.320]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.381]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:23.381 --> 01:52:28.283]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:52:29.884 --> 01:52:31.645]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:52:31.645 --> 01:52:33.867]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:52:33.867 --> 01:52:35.648]  I can't find my wallet!

[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:32.061]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:53:32.061 --> 01:53:39.026]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:53:39.026 --> 01:53:47.432]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:53:53.576 --> 01:53:55.157]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:53:55.157 --> 01:53:57.438]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:53:57.438 --> 01:54:01.880]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:04.101]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:54:11.704 --> 01:54:12.184]  I'm healthy.
[01:54:51.178 --> 01:55:01.347]  Webster Tarbley, author, is our guest, author of the new book, Barack Obama, Postmodern Coup, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:01.347 --> 01:55:04.389]  His historical analysis is spot-on.
[01:55:04.389 --> 01:55:05.791]  I agree with him.
[01:55:05.791 --> 01:55:08.233]  I trust but verify.
[01:55:08.233 --> 01:55:10.935]  I just disagree, Webster, with your analysis.
[01:55:10.935 --> 01:55:11.796]  It's all rancid.
[01:55:11.796 --> 01:55:12.556]  They're all bad.
[01:55:12.556 --> 01:55:13.417]  Hillary's bad.
[01:55:13.417 --> 01:55:14.298]  John McCain's bad.
[01:55:14.298 --> 01:55:16.760]  I know you know that, but saying that
[01:55:17.651 --> 01:55:27.437]  We have to throw support in behind Hillary or then McCain later, which is the same thing that so many others are saying.
[01:55:27.437 --> 01:55:28.898]  I just can't do it.
[01:55:28.898 --> 01:55:33.141]  I can't support the false paradigm of the left-right or any of these people.
[01:55:33.141 --> 01:55:37.163]  And if fascism's to come, let Barack Obama and his greenie-meenies bring it.
[01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:39.064]  Let them try to come burn me out.
[01:55:39.064 --> 01:55:41.306]  We got guns in this country.
[01:55:41.306 --> 01:55:44.748]  And maybe that's what we need is to go ahead.
[01:55:44.748 --> 01:55:45.608]  Worse is better.
[01:55:45.608 --> 01:55:46.689]  Bring this thing to a head.
[01:55:47.512 --> 01:55:50.033]  Now, what do you expect to see the way the way the land is right now?
[01:55:50.033 --> 01:55:51.933]  Let's hear some predictions from Webster Darbly.
[01:55:51.933 --> 01:56:01.316]  I have to say that one of the obvious things built into an Obama presidency is the possibility of domestic civil war coming through a number of scenarios.
[01:56:01.316 --> 01:56:15.100]  I would just say I have a great-grandfather who fought at Gettysburg in the Valley of Death there by the Devil's Den and Little Round Top and the 11th United States Regulars of the Sykes
[01:56:16.094 --> 01:56:22.056]  5th Corps, 2nd Division, civil war is the worst possible outcome.
[01:56:22.056 --> 01:56:26.218]  Nothing, but nothing, is worse than civil war.
[01:56:26.218 --> 01:56:27.818]  And I think that's the problem.
[01:56:27.818 --> 01:56:33.860]  No, the CPS taking people's children and putting sodium fluoride in the water, we're all under total war.
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:36.501]  You know about the eugenicist, Webster, you're an expert on that.
[01:56:36.501 --> 01:56:40.522]  Yeah, sure, but again, I think there are peaceful ways out of this.
[01:56:40.522 --> 01:56:42.223]  Well, I want a peaceful way out of this, too.
[01:56:43.986 --> 01:56:49.148]  The method that I recommend is to build a mass movement through mobilization.
[01:56:49.148 --> 01:56:53.610]  And mobilization has to involve the choice of intermediate goals.
[01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:55.091]  In other words, things that people can do.
[01:56:55.091 --> 01:56:57.552]  Right now, it is to stop Obama.
[01:56:57.552 --> 01:57:05.455]  And that means, you know, practically speaking, blocking with other forces that might oppose Obama.
[01:57:05.455 --> 01:57:07.676]  And again, this is based on the history of Italy, 1922.
[01:57:07.676 --> 01:57:08.416]  1933, for example, in the German case,
[01:57:13.498 --> 01:57:19.160]  You had a lot of people saying, why don't the Communists and the Social Democrats form a bloc and stop Hitler?
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.001]  For many reasons, they didn't do it.
[01:57:21.001 --> 01:57:22.102]  They had all good reasons.
[01:57:22.102 --> 01:57:26.803]  They said the other side is really bad and really corrupt and really awful.
[01:57:26.803 --> 01:57:31.945]  And then, once Hitler came to power, they kept saying, whoa, I wish we had done it.
[01:57:31.945 --> 01:57:37.388]  But let me just continue the thing I was trying to do about the world situation.
[01:57:37.388 --> 01:57:40.709]  Part of it is now this question of attempting to repeat
[01:57:41.289 --> 01:57:43.229]  The maneuver of the appeasers, right?
[01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:47.350]  The Neville Chamberlain policy, which was not appeasement, but war.
[01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:56.012]  In other words, when Obama says he wants to negotiate with Iran, he wants to use Iran exactly the same way that Brzezinski is now using Georgia.
[01:57:56.012 --> 01:57:58.692]  In other words, play Iran against the Russians.
[01:57:58.692 --> 01:58:00.192]  That's his future for Iran.
[01:58:00.192 --> 01:58:02.113]  Brzezinski says, why should I attack them?
[01:58:02.113 --> 01:58:06.694]  I can use them to attack the Russians and get rid of all of them that way.
[01:58:06.694 --> 01:58:08.554]  And ultimately, the crowning achievement is
[01:58:09.054 --> 01:58:12.195]  China against Russia, except it won't work.
[01:58:12.195 --> 01:58:16.196]  The other side... But Iran's getting along with Russia.
[01:58:16.196 --> 01:58:17.297]  Who?
[01:58:17.297 --> 01:58:19.537]  Iran has been getting along with Russia.
[01:58:19.537 --> 01:58:23.879]  Look, if you know any Iranians, ask them the following question.
[01:58:23.879 --> 01:58:27.320]  What country is most hated in Iran?
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.341]  And every time I've asked this question, which I ask habitually, it's always Russia.
[01:58:32.026 --> 01:58:38.573]  Russia, remember, occupied Northern Iran during World War II as part of the Lend-Lease Program.
[01:58:38.573 --> 01:58:42.057]  There was a military corridor going through Iran.
[01:58:42.057 --> 01:58:45.621]  The British occupied the South, the Soviets the North.
[01:58:45.621 --> 01:58:47.824]  Now, the Soviets behaved badly.
[01:58:47.824 --> 01:58:50.467]  They were very angry about Hitler and so forth.
[01:58:50.467 --> 01:58:52.930]  No, the Soviets did bad things!
[01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:56.071]  I thought they were sweet!
[01:58:56.071 --> 01:58:59.552]  The residue of that is a hatred that Brzezinski thinks he can build on.
[01:58:59.552 --> 01:59:02.632]  Well, you've got Russians in there with the Chinese building the reactors.
[01:59:02.632 --> 01:59:03.993]  I don't know.
[01:59:03.993 --> 01:59:07.854]  Alright, well, I know they think that Webster's just all delusional.
[01:59:07.854 --> 01:59:11.735]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:11.735 --> 01:59:15.136]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:59:15.136 --> 01:59:17.617]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:20.518 --> 01:59:27.261]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:59:27.261 --> 01:59:29.902]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:29.902 --> 01:59:31.442]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:31.442 --> 01:59:32.243]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:32.243 --> 01:59:33.103]  This is his MO.
[01:59:33.103 --> 01:59:34.623]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:34.623 --> 01:59:36.064]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:36.605 --> 01:59:43.753]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:43.753 --> 01:59:44.234]  Some U.S.
[01:59:44.234 --> 01:59:50.602]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:50.602 --> 01:59:54.046]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:54.346 --> 02:00:04.575]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:00:04.575 --> 02:00:05.796]  Fabled enemies.

[02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:25.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:28.161]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:35.592 --> 02:00:36.913]  Big Brother.
[02:00:36.913 --> 02:00:38.675]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:38.675 --> 02:00:40.437]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:40.437 --> 02:00:42.018]  You want answers?
[02:00:42.018 --> 02:00:42.959]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:42.959 --> 02:00:47.763]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:47.763 --> 02:00:52.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.027 --> 02:00:55.090]  You know, there's so many subjects I want to talk with Webster Tarpley about.
[02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:56.531]  Very thought-provoking discussions.
[02:00:56.531 --> 02:00:57.792]  We'll just keep it for two more hours.
[02:00:58.573 --> 02:00:59.294]  He's agreed to do that.
[02:00:59.294 --> 02:01:00.176]  We appreciate that.
[02:01:00.176 --> 02:01:02.519]  Author of Obama the Postmodernist Coup.
[02:01:02.519 --> 02:01:03.981]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:03.981 --> 02:01:07.767]  We're going to put the phones up in the final hour today.
[02:01:07.767 --> 02:01:14.257]  For the next hour, I want to get his analysis, which he really is an expert on Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, Russia.
[02:01:14.777 --> 02:01:15.658]  We're good to go.
[02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:36.182]  Uh, into the last hour.
[02:01:36.182 --> 02:01:38.703]  We're taking a lot of your calls coming up in about 58 minutes.
[02:01:38.703 --> 02:01:47.987]  Uh, but Webster, you wanted to finish up with the austerity movement, how they have the environmental movement, the austerity movement, the, uh, secret police system they're setting up.
[02:01:47.987 --> 02:01:58.011]  All of this massive, decades-long planning coming to a head with the Golden Boy, literally, uh, there to save us all and bring the left in for the final police state.
[02:01:59.343 --> 02:02:12.386]  We've talked now, I guess, about the foreign policy, in other words, this Brzezinski plan, and in many world capitals, especially Moscow, especially Beijing, if you say Brzezinski plan, it's a plan, therefore, that has an endgame.
[02:02:12.386 --> 02:02:18.428]  China reduced to warlords, 20 to 25 centers of power, as it was in the 1920s.
[02:02:20.271 --> 02:02:33.435]  And Russia also divided up as it was during the Russian Civil War of 1919 to 1920, ultimately coming in with about four to five different states, different countries.
[02:02:33.435 --> 02:02:37.376]  So, we had the Bernard Lewis plan for the Middle East, right?
[02:02:37.376 --> 02:02:45.719]  Carve Iraq three ways, Iran six ways, Lebanon several ways, Turkey three or four ways, Sudan at least two ways, and more.
[02:02:46.573 --> 02:02:48.976]  But then to apply that to Russia and China.
[02:02:48.976 --> 02:02:49.917]  So that's one thing.
[02:02:49.917 --> 02:02:53.501]  Now the other side is the domestic and the austerity.
[02:02:53.501 --> 02:03:03.353]  When you see Obama giving this speech in Oregon, when he had his outburst there, he said, you're not going to be able to drive an SUV.
[02:03:05.487 --> 02:03:08.448]  Genocidal austerity, a further cut in the U.S.
[02:03:08.448 --> 02:03:13.511]  standard of living of 30, 40, 50 percent as much as he can do.
[02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:20.674]  Imagine a government policy of not having a good standard of living, which has always been what the eugenicists have craved.
[02:03:21.492 --> 02:03:22.674]  Absolutely.
[02:03:22.674 --> 02:03:27.718]  But now it's also complicated by the fact that, of course, we have this worldwide financial crisis.
[02:03:27.718 --> 02:03:31.101]  We have the death agony of the dollar as a reserve currency.
[02:03:31.101 --> 02:03:33.323]  We have banking panic going on.
[02:03:33.323 --> 02:03:34.384]  We had Countrywide.
[02:03:34.384 --> 02:03:35.586]  Then we had Northern Rock.
[02:03:35.586 --> 02:03:37.107]  We had Bear Stearns.
[02:03:37.107 --> 02:03:38.188]  Now we've had IndyMac.
[02:03:38.188 --> 02:03:41.031]  We basically have banking failures every week.
[02:03:41.911 --> 02:03:48.015]  We've got hyperinflation, which you see in fuel, but also in food and many other areas.
[02:03:48.015 --> 02:03:56.721]  So you're heading towards an extreme world economic breakdown crisis, the end of the post-1945 era, as Soros himself says.
[02:03:56.721 --> 02:03:59.043]  So when Soros says, this is what it is, what does he want?
[02:03:59.583 --> 02:04:04.324]  They've got to increase the looting pressure on the U.S.
[02:04:04.324 --> 02:04:11.706]  population to allow the bailout of JPMorgan Chase, the Soros interests, Goldman Sachs, and so forth.
[02:04:11.706 --> 02:04:13.307]  How do you do that, though?
[02:04:13.307 --> 02:04:19.969]  Bush and Cheney would come out and say, well, we're going to tax you for the war on terror, and that would lead to an explosion in their face.
[02:04:19.969 --> 02:04:27.451]  Obama will come and say, we're going to save the polar bears, we're going to save the planet, we're going to save the ice caps, we're going to have
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:31.882]  Carbon tax, cap and trade on carbon.
[02:04:31.882 --> 02:04:33.462]  We're going to have a green tax.
[02:04:33.462 --> 02:04:35.623]  We're going to have a third world solidarity tax.
[02:04:35.623 --> 02:04:46.188]  The only problem with this is all the money goes to Rockefeller Soros and Goldman Sachs.
[02:04:46.188 --> 02:04:48.069]  All right, Webster.
[02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:56.233]  When we get back, we will break this all down in detail and finish up the story you're breaking down for us and then get into
[02:04:57.799 --> 02:04:59.301]  What's happened in Russia?
[02:04:59.301 --> 02:05:01.623]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[02:05:01.623 --> 02:05:07.849]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[02:05:07.849 --> 02:05:10.792]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[02:05:10.792 --> 02:05:19.902]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean and sparkling, then you need Sully Smile All Natural Tooth Powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.
[02:05:20.342 --> 02:05:29.164]  Soleil Smile contains 84 mineral-rich Himalayan sea salt, baking soda, and xylitol, a sugar substitute with long-lasting dental benefits.

[02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:11.862]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:11.862 --> 02:06:14.023]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:06:14.651 --> 02:06:17.838]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:06:17.838 --> 02:06:25.174]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:33.642]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:06:41.184 --> 02:06:41.984]  They're not after money.
[02:06:41.984 --> 02:06:43.484]  They have all the money they need.
[02:06:43.484 --> 02:06:44.465]  They're after power.
[02:06:44.465 --> 02:06:45.625]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:00.270]  Question.
[02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:05.014]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[02:07:05.014 --> 02:07:09.497]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[02:07:09.497 --> 02:07:10.338]  Question.
[02:07:10.338 --> 02:07:15.602]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[02:07:15.602 --> 02:07:16.382]  Question.

[02:08:10.908 --> 02:08:11.829]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:11.829 --> 02:08:16.675]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.675 --> 02:08:20.741]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.504 --> 02:08:39.696]  Webster, let's go through a detailed analysis from your perspective on what happened with the Georgian sneak attack last Thursday night into Friday morning on the eve of the Olympic Games on 888.
[02:08:39.696 --> 02:08:45.781]  The Russians moving nuclear weapons in and repulsing the Georgian-slash-U.S.-British-Israeli attack.
[02:08:47.322 --> 02:08:50.106]  Uh, and what do you think this means geopolitically now?
[02:08:50.106 --> 02:09:01.702]  In the words of Lieutenant Colonel Sam Gardner, Air Force expert on these regions and that area, that region, and these type of weapon systems, the Russians undoubtedly brought nukes into the area and that they're stated
[02:09:02.282 --> 02:09:07.085]  Default position is to nuke, with tactical weapons, any U.S.
[02:09:07.085 --> 02:09:11.688]  forces that attack them with precision-guided conventional munitions.
[02:09:11.688 --> 02:09:16.772]  He called this the greatest military escalation in modern history since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:09:16.772 --> 02:09:21.955]  The neocons have been running around on TV, Crystal and others, saying they want war with Russia.
[02:09:21.955 --> 02:09:25.157]  The New York Times called it the beginning of what could be World War III.
[02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:29.020]  The Russians reportedly stopped attacking last night, but then the Georgians
[02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:30.061]  We're good to go.
[02:09:50.126 --> 02:09:55.569]  Well, I have tried to argue for the past eight or nine months.
[02:09:55.569 --> 02:09:58.890]  The situation in Washington, first of all, has fundamentally changed.
[02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:00.551]  The neocons are out.
[02:10:00.551 --> 02:10:01.671]  They have no power.
[02:10:01.671 --> 02:10:04.933]  We'll see why they're trying to get back on TV now.
[02:10:04.933 --> 02:10:07.294]  But the neocons have been broken as a faction.
[02:10:07.294 --> 02:10:11.896]  You've got Libby out, Rumsfeld out, Wolfowitz out, out at the World Bank.
[02:10:12.836 --> 02:10:17.960]  Lord Black, Lord Conrad Black, a top world neocon, is actually now in jail.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:25.105]  You've got Ledeen under attack by the Rockefeller Committee for his activities with his old Iran-Contra network.
[02:10:25.105 --> 02:10:29.528]  So, the thing that you're facing now, I would not call it neocon anymore.
[02:10:29.528 --> 02:10:30.749]  It's not the neocons.
[02:10:30.749 --> 02:10:34.411]  It is the Rockefeller-Brezhinski-Trilateral-Bilderberg Group.
[02:10:34.571 --> 02:10:37.272]  Okay, so that's who NATO and Israel are taking orders from.
[02:10:37.272 --> 02:10:39.193]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:10:39.193 --> 02:10:40.533]  That is who is running the U.S.
[02:10:40.533 --> 02:10:41.814]  government at this point.
[02:10:41.814 --> 02:10:44.655]  I understand that, Webster, but let me bring up this caveat.
[02:10:44.655 --> 02:10:54.278]  I mean, it's pretty darn neocon when you've got the military head of the Georgian military not even being Georgian, being an Israeli, and the foreign minister being an Israeli.
[02:10:54.278 --> 02:10:54.578]  Go ahead.
[02:10:55.576 --> 02:11:11.352]  Yeah, the point of this now is that the neocons are essentially a group of stragglers and fugitives that are tending to attach themselves to the Brzezinski machine trying to save themselves and maintain their positions and their careers in this new era.
[02:11:11.352 --> 02:11:11.833]  But notice,
[02:11:12.293 --> 02:11:30.638]  The emphasis, the epicenter of world confrontation has shifted radically out of the Middle East, out of the Persian Gulf, and to the borders of Russia, and also China, because the other thing, what I was actually looking for to happen on 8808, was some kind of a terror stunt at the Beijing Olympics.
[02:11:30.638 --> 02:11:39.021]  This could still happen, which could also then heat up the world, and I would urge people to be aware of that, and we can maybe talk about that in a minute.
[02:11:39.838 --> 02:11:45.481]  The kinds of things that you're seeing now are typical, classic Brzezinski.
[02:11:45.481 --> 02:11:49.824]  Remember, Brzezinski says, you can't attack these countries yourself.
[02:11:49.824 --> 02:11:52.245]  If you want to destroy Venezuela, you can't attack them.
[02:11:52.245 --> 02:11:53.586]  You use surrogates.
[02:11:53.586 --> 02:11:54.726]  Play Columbia.
[02:11:54.726 --> 02:11:56.307]  You want to destroy Somalia?
[02:11:56.307 --> 02:11:56.927]  Stay out of there.
[02:11:56.927 --> 02:11:58.348]  Let Ethiopia go in.
[02:11:58.348 --> 02:12:00.870]  In this case, he's got a little Hitler.
[02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:05.672]  Saakashvili is a little Hitler created by Brzezinski.
[02:12:05.672 --> 02:12:08.554]  This process of the color revolution, the so-called
[02:12:09.574 --> 02:12:23.341]  And we'll go back to how they financed the takeover there, but did you see the video of a plane flies overhead and he starts cowering and crying and then running and then they cover him up with armored vests and he's like screaming like a little girl?
[02:12:23.341 --> 02:12:25.782]  I mean, I've never seen a leader act like that.
[02:12:25.782 --> 02:12:27.523]  An ultimate little coward.
[02:12:27.523 --> 02:12:30.004]  And he's wild-eyed and always lying.
[02:12:30.004 --> 02:12:31.185]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[02:12:32.066 --> 02:12:34.167]  I would compare him, in many ways, to Obama.
[02:12:34.167 --> 02:12:44.657]  A megalomaniac, drunk with power, indulging in illusions of infantile omnipotence, and really thinking... He probably... I believe that Brzezinski has played him.
[02:12:44.657 --> 02:12:51.083]  In other words, Brzezinski has promised him... Yeah, he told him he'd win, and not that it was really meant to bring Russia in and escalate things.
[02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:57.407]  And not that he was... You don't tell your expendable pawns that they are expendable pawns on a kamikaze trip.
[02:12:57.407 --> 02:12:58.688]  You don't tell them that.
[02:12:58.688 --> 02:13:00.529]  You let them go ahead and think that they're coming back.
[02:13:00.529 --> 02:13:10.975]  Now, a lot of analysts are saying, and it does seem to be true, that people see McCain as a stronger military leader, and that this Georgian-Russian crisis actually strengthens McCain's hand.
[02:13:10.975 --> 02:13:12.296]  Why would Brzezinski do that?
[02:13:12.296 --> 02:13:14.197]  Yeah, I think it may have happened too soon.
[02:13:14.197 --> 02:13:19.521]  The problem is when you're dealing with somebody as unstable as Saakashvili, he's also got to respond
[02:13:20.197 --> 02:13:27.661]  To his own internal conditions, one obvious fact, if you want to have an attack in that part of the world, you've got to do it during the summer.
[02:13:27.661 --> 02:13:30.963]  You can't do it during the autumn when the rains come.
[02:13:30.963 --> 02:13:34.205]  So, really, there are competing considerations.
[02:13:34.205 --> 02:13:39.708]  Our election is in November, but if they're going to attack this year, they've more or less got to do it now.
[02:13:39.708 --> 02:13:41.669]  There's a lot to be said about that.
[02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:45.731]  The principal idea, though, is that Georgia is the aggressor.
[02:13:45.731 --> 02:13:49.433]  They launched a genocidal sneak attack in the middle of the night
[02:13:49.993 --> 02:13:58.058]  With massive rocket attacks, air bombardment and heavy artillery to kill the civilians of South Ossetia.
[02:13:58.058 --> 02:14:10.486]  CNN and Fox now confirmed showed video of the Georgians attacking South Ossetia and the gorge over by Abkhazia and then lied and said that was Russians doing it.
[02:14:10.486 --> 02:14:12.707]  I mean, this is unprecedented media lying.
[02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:20.434]  Yeah, it's probably the biggest media hysteria, but you can compare it to 9-11 or the Iraq War or Obama.
[02:14:20.434 --> 02:14:28.219]  It's the same media that have been telling you Obama is the savior are now telling you that Putin and Medvedev are the devils.
[02:14:28.219 --> 02:14:32.402]  The Russian response, of course, is then a powerful counter-stroke.
[02:14:32.962 --> 02:14:40.348]  And they've got to destroy the Georgian second echelon, in other words, the second attack wave that would have come in there.
[02:14:40.348 --> 02:14:47.514]  Yeah, the main forces that were built up to come in behind the shock troops, now, now, now... And the military infrastructure all over the country.
[02:14:47.514 --> 02:14:49.055]  Let me just comment on this.
[02:14:49.055 --> 02:14:50.796]  This is largely built up by the U.S.
[02:14:50.796 --> 02:15:00.184]  With your tax dollars, this tin-pot little Hitler, Saakashvili... Increase their defense budget by 30-plus times in five years, but I want to stop there because I want to go back and then you can go forward.
[02:15:00.504 --> 02:15:03.927]  But I want to cover every point here and get here and take Webster.
[02:15:03.927 --> 02:15:19.678]  Dealing with this, do you think Brzezinski and the Anglo-American establishment and the neocon followers, and I agree with you, they're now like the birdcage liner being removed, new ones being put in as a front for the oligarchs, do you think they miscalculated or is this what they expected?
[02:15:20.387 --> 02:15:22.710]  I think they've miscalculated the timing.
[02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:30.017]  However, remember, on the McCain side, you've also got a tentacle of Brzezinski, and indeed, also in the U.S.
[02:15:30.017 --> 02:15:30.838]  government.
[02:15:30.838 --> 02:15:33.241]  Ian Brzezinski is the other son.
[02:15:33.241 --> 02:15:34.963]  He has three kids.
[02:15:34.963 --> 02:15:38.807]  Mark Brzezinski, Clinton National Security Council, works for Obama.
[02:15:39.327 --> 02:15:45.589]  Mika Brzezinski, you see her every morning, this airhead with Scarborough on Morning Joe, MSNBC.
[02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:53.831]  But then we have Ian Brzezinski, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon for NATO and Eastern Europe.
[02:15:53.831 --> 02:15:57.012]  He is undoubtedly one of the people who got this thing going.
[02:15:57.592 --> 02:15:59.393]  Ian Brzezinski.
[02:15:59.393 --> 02:16:02.794]  And, of course, he's also a top advisor to McCain.
[02:16:02.794 --> 02:16:08.816]  So, in a certain way, between McCain and Brzezinski, and Obama, you're going to get Brzezinski anyway.
[02:16:08.816 --> 02:16:21.001]  The difference, of course, is that with Obama as the face of imperialism, as we saw in Berlin, Obama basically says, I can get you the European troops and the European money that with McCain you can't get.
[02:16:21.161 --> 02:16:23.923]  That's right, he can sell the suckers one more time.
[02:16:23.923 --> 02:16:31.687]  Right, and he can get the Europeans to go and die in an apocalyptic war against Russia, whereas McCain's chances of doing that are inferior.
[02:16:31.687 --> 02:16:40.673]  Also, Obama's going to be a better strike-breaker than McCain because he'll do it with left cover, and he can even use his goons, which even somebody like Clinton does not have.
[02:16:40.673 --> 02:16:43.974]  She does not have an army of goons in the way that Obama does.
[02:16:43.974 --> 02:16:46.296]  I want to continue with Obama, but let's get back into Russia.
[02:16:47.416 --> 02:16:56.000]  I mean, this was a very dangerous, reckless move by the oligarchs, by the New World Order, to do this.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.082]  Certainly, but let's just look at the ways this could escalate into World War III.
[02:17:00.082 --> 02:17:08.906]  One obvious one is, you've got these 2,000 Georgian troops that have gone into Iraq at the behest of the U.S., and they wanted to go back to Georgia.
[02:17:08.906 --> 02:17:11.307]  Now, I would say to them, fine, do it on your own power.
[02:17:11.967 --> 02:17:14.150]  Uh, but no, we've had C-17 U.S.
[02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:16.673]  Air Force transports ferrying them back.
[02:17:16.673 --> 02:17:21.860]  Now, this is a very unfriendly act towards, uh, the Russians.
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:26.105]  Putin is complaining... He started two days ago bringing them into a hot battle zone.
[02:17:26.105 --> 02:17:29.470]  Right, and, and, according to NBC News, there were contacts between
[02:17:29.930 --> 02:17:30.331]  I don't know.
[02:17:46.685 --> 02:17:48.146]  It's difficult to know how many.
[02:17:48.146 --> 02:17:52.790]  At least 125 or maybe several hundred U.S.
[02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:58.534]  advisers are attached to the Georgian Defense Ministry to go with all of this hardware that the U.S.
[02:17:58.534 --> 02:18:04.458]  has been pouring in to Georgia, which the Russians, I hope, have now largely destroyed.
[02:18:04.458 --> 02:18:06.900]  But the possibility of some of those U.S.
[02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:13.624]  advisers getting killed and then a huge media spectacle around that has got to be factored in.
[02:18:13.624 --> 02:18:14.225]  Another point.
[02:18:14.765 --> 02:18:22.227]  The Black Sea, the Russians have put up a naval blockade on the Georgian ports in the Black Sea.
[02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:30.609]  Suppose the US, the British, the French, or the Ukrainian hotheads, also possible, or Romania, Bulgaria, we don't know.
[02:18:30.609 --> 02:18:32.250]  Those are now NATO states, right?
[02:18:32.250 --> 02:18:35.991]  Poland and the Balkans are basically in NATO.
[02:18:36.631 --> 02:18:48.479]  If they try to run the blockade, break the Russian blockade, and deliver ammunition, or even humanitarian, they would say, what, really, ammunition, I'm sure, then that could lead to an international incident.
[02:18:48.479 --> 02:18:51.221]  A Lusitanian-type deal or Gulf of Tonkin?
[02:18:51.221 --> 02:19:00.227]  It would be, I guess, a Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse, because the Russians would be there with a picket line, and if you don't stop, and you don't submit to a search, they're going to blow you up.
[02:19:00.227 --> 02:19:01.308]  Now, here's the most dangerous.
[02:19:02.404 --> 02:19:17.300]  Not only is Saakashvili and this Georgian regime the product of people power coup color revolution, in this case it's the Roses Revolution, run by Brzezinski, financed by Soros, National Endowment for Democracy, call this the Left CIA.
[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:18.782]  This is something you haven't seen that much.
[02:19:19.182 --> 02:19:22.285]  Well, you've seen it, but it hasn't been prominent internally.
[02:19:22.285 --> 02:19:28.750]  If you go to Ukraine, the group in Kiev, Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, the ice princess, right?
[02:19:28.750 --> 02:19:31.612]  This blonde with her braided blonde hair.
[02:19:31.612 --> 02:19:32.613]  She's a kleptocrat.
[02:19:32.613 --> 02:19:35.375]  She's a NATO agent and a kleptocrat.
[02:19:35.375 --> 02:19:37.577]  The Ukrainians are supporting Georgia.
[02:19:37.577 --> 02:19:41.020]  Now you've got one of these two Kaczynski twins in Poland.
[02:19:41.724 --> 02:19:49.870]  And what they've got is a front of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Ukraine, supporting Georgia.
[02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:54.453]  So we can see a ring around Russia starting similar conflicts.
[02:19:54.453 --> 02:19:57.335]  This could only be the start of a larger brushfire war.
[02:19:57.335 --> 02:19:57.855]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.651 --> 02:20:06.393]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:06.393 --> 02:20:09.054]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:20:09.054 --> 02:20:10.595]  But who is the enemy?
[02:20:10.595 --> 02:20:11.395]  Bin Laden.
[02:20:11.395 --> 02:20:12.395]  This is his ammo.
[02:20:12.395 --> 02:20:13.776]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:20:13.776 --> 02:20:15.196]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:20:15.757 --> 02:20:22.904]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:20:22.904 --> 02:20:23.385]  Some U.S.
[02:20:23.385 --> 02:20:29.732]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:20:29.732 --> 02:20:33.196]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:20:33.416 --> 02:20:43.706]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:20:43.706 --> 02:20:44.947]  Fabled Enemies.
[02:20:44.947 --> 02:20:52.694]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:20:52.694 --> 02:20:56.078]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:20:59.466 --> 02:21:06.147]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:06.147 --> 02:21:14.249]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:14.249 --> 02:21:22.431]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:22.431 --> 02:21:27.172]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:32.738]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:32.738 --> 02:21:37.103]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:37.103 --> 02:21:38.184]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:38.184 --> 02:21:42.209]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:21:47.571 --> 02:21:50.572]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:21:58.715 --> 02:22:07.419]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[02:22:13.422 --> 02:22:20.525]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:22:20.525 --> 02:22:23.927]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:22:23.927 --> 02:22:26.148]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:22:58.149 --> 02:23:01.512]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[02:23:01.512 --> 02:23:05.236]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[02:23:05.236 --> 02:23:09.320]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:14.005]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[02:23:14.005 --> 02:23:16.828]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[02:23:16.828 --> 02:23:21.973]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[02:23:22.433 --> 02:23:29.096]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[02:23:47.847 --> 02:23:49.629]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.
[02:23:49.629 --> 02:23:51.671]  Don't give your money to the state.
[02:23:51.671 --> 02:23:52.292]  Spray your plate!
[02:24:23.879 --> 02:24:45.324]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene Weren't your mama's only boy But her favorite one, it seems
[02:24:47.025 --> 02:24:57.192]  Webster Darby is our guest today.
[02:24:57.192 --> 02:24:59.253]  Your calls are coming up in about 35 minutes.
[02:24:59.253 --> 02:25:06.438]  You can talk about any subject you want with our guest, any other issue.
[02:25:15.664 --> 02:25:23.949]  Okay, we've gotten into the third, what you were saying, most dangerous scenario with these now NATO or sub-NATO states.
[02:25:23.949 --> 02:25:32.314]  They all have different ethnic partitions right along the borders with Russia proper, Mother Russia.
[02:25:33.092 --> 02:25:37.673]  Perfect time to start these Balkanization, divide and conquer conflicts.
[02:25:37.673 --> 02:25:38.574]  Continue.
[02:25:38.574 --> 02:25:42.395]  Of the ones that I've mentioned, Poland is a full member of NATO.
[02:25:42.395 --> 02:25:43.815]  This should never have been done.
[02:25:43.815 --> 02:25:49.097]  The Polish regime is a collection of anti-Russian hotheads.
[02:25:49.797 --> 02:25:52.119]  Uh, created in the image of Brzezinski.
[02:25:52.119 --> 02:26:04.549]  Brzezinski even says that he considered going back to Poland in the late 1990s and becoming president of the country and leading the anti- I'm adding this now, leading the anti-Russian assault.
[02:26:05.129 --> 02:26:06.010]  We're good to go.
[02:26:26.467 --> 02:26:41.310]  Because look at this, when you have these clashes, right, the US advisors on the ground in Georgia, US ships in the Black Sea, US planes coming in, ferrying in military supplies, you go immediately to superpower confrontation.
[02:26:41.310 --> 02:26:47.071]  You immediately have intercontinental ballistic missiles ready to go, H-bombs on them.
[02:26:47.071 --> 02:26:49.052]  This may or may not happen in the near future.
[02:26:49.052 --> 02:26:53.213]  It's no longer toying with Arabs, you're genociding and slaughtering who are fighting you with AK-47s.
[02:26:53.213 --> 02:26:53.353]  Exactly.
[02:26:55.013 --> 02:26:57.214]  You're not dealing with defenseless states, right?
[02:26:57.214 --> 02:27:04.458]  Iran, of course, is not defenseless in the sense that it can project power to the Persian Gulf and maybe cut off the world's oil supply.
[02:27:04.458 --> 02:27:07.560]  But there's virtually no way they can strike into the United States.
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:10.562]  Now, with Russia, and indeed with China, this is totally different.
[02:27:10.562 --> 02:27:13.663]  I would urge people to mobilize on this issue.
[02:27:13.663 --> 02:27:15.864]  We cannot have any U.S.
[02:27:15.864 --> 02:27:18.286]  money, soldiers, aid,
[02:27:19.246 --> 02:27:21.347]  Stop this diplomatic support.
[02:27:21.347 --> 02:27:32.470]  Let me point out, in addition to the bellicose nonsense that you've heard from McCain, you know, he wants to kick the Russians out of the group of eight, and he looks into Putin's eyes and sees KGB.
[02:27:32.470 --> 02:27:34.871]  That's all very witty, I'm sure.
[02:27:34.871 --> 02:27:41.793]  Notice that Obama says he wants Georgia to become a NATO full member.
[02:27:41.793 --> 02:27:48.235]  So Obama, having seen the insanity of his fellow Brzezinski puppet, Saakashvili, the little Hitler,
[02:27:49.193 --> 02:28:01.719]  Obama says, yes, let's put the entire weight of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the U.S., Canada, Turkey, and all these Europeans, let's throw that into the scales behind a lunatic like Saakashvili.
[02:28:01.719 --> 02:28:03.659]  This disqualifies Obama.
[02:28:03.659 --> 02:28:11.683]  Obama also says the Russians have violated the sovereignty of Georgia and encroached on the sovereignty of Georgia.
[02:28:11.683 --> 02:28:14.824]  No, Senator, that's called hot pursuit.
[02:28:14.824 --> 02:28:16.105]  As soon as those Georgians
[02:28:17.183 --> 02:28:22.386]  Murdered 2,000 civilians in the night of the 8th and the 9th.
[02:28:22.386 --> 02:28:27.929]  At that point, the countermeasures of the Russians are pure self-defense under the U.N.
[02:28:27.929 --> 02:28:28.649]  Charter.
[02:28:28.649 --> 02:28:29.850]  That's allowed under the U.N.
[02:28:29.850 --> 02:28:30.670]  Charter.
[02:28:30.670 --> 02:28:35.533]  And it becomes hot pursuit because you're chasing people that are trying to kill you.
[02:28:35.533 --> 02:28:41.196]  Yeah, they couldn't run the main armies out and then let them regroup, which they were doing, for a counter-assault.
[02:28:41.196 --> 02:28:42.997]  Once they were routed, they had to destroy them.
[02:28:43.377 --> 02:28:52.645]  Yes, and remember that Saakashvili, this petty, this tin-pot little Hitler, he tried the same thing back in 2004, and he was defeated.
[02:28:52.645 --> 02:28:55.328]  Also remember, he's not democratic at all.
[02:28:55.328 --> 02:28:57.770]  There was a large mass movement against him.
[02:28:57.770 --> 02:29:02.374]  It was basically a color revolution in reverse, this time with real popular support.
[02:29:02.954 --> 02:29:11.618]  And, uh, Saakashvili immediately declared martial law, shut down the TV, kicked out the foreign journalists, and rounded up the opposition.
[02:29:11.618 --> 02:29:14.859]  He was even tortured and killed with US support.
[02:29:14.859 --> 02:29:19.582]  They even used Georgia, reportedly, as a black site to take some of the torture victims too.
[02:29:19.582 --> 02:29:22.363]  They're full NATO puppets.
[02:29:22.363 --> 02:29:26.845]  The Russian position, of course, is that South Ossetians are Russian citizens.
[02:29:27.365 --> 02:29:31.087]  So you've killed 2,000 Russian citizens and several dozen of their troops.
[02:29:31.087 --> 02:29:32.968]  It's comparable to 9-11.
[02:29:32.968 --> 02:29:35.849]  By the way, the number's going up, as you know, Webster.
[02:29:35.849 --> 02:29:38.790]  They're now digging a bunch of people out of the rubble.
[02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:41.452]  So it's gonna be more than 2,000 dead civilians.
[02:29:41.452 --> 02:29:43.633]  Webster, Tarpley, stay with us.
[02:29:43.633 --> 02:29:50.136]  We're gonna go to break, come back, continue with this, then get into the social Darwinism, what drives the evil minds.
[02:29:50.136 --> 02:29:51.516]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.516 --> 02:29:54.038]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.038 --> 02:29:56.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.836 --> 02:30:07.236]  That was an inside job!
[02:30:07.236 --> 02:30:08.377]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:30:08.377 --> 02:30:10.097]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:30:10.097 --> 02:30:12.978]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:30:12.978 --> 02:30:18.020]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:26.282]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[02:30:26.282 --> 02:30:31.104]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:30:39.006 --> 02:30:42.468]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:30:42.468 --> 02:30:45.110]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:30:50.777 --> 02:30:51.798]  Truth Rising.

[02:30:59.805 --> 02:31:03.227]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:31:03.227 --> 02:31:05.549]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:31:05.549 --> 02:31:08.852]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:31:08.852 --> 02:31:15.738]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:31:15.738 --> 02:31:17.840]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:21.622]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:31:21.622 --> 02:31:26.404]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:31:26.404 --> 02:31:30.346]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:31:30.346 --> 02:31:31.966]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:31:46.113 --> 02:31:50.697]  Drink and Mate proudly presents another mind-boggling episode of America's Toughest Quiz Show!
[02:31:50.697 --> 02:31:51.858]  That's too complicated!
[02:32:07.069 --> 02:32:12.792]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening of partying by using Drink and Mate.
[02:32:12.792 --> 02:32:20.636]  For 20 points in the wind, Milt, Blur 5 and blank kinate receptor subunits and hippocampal neurons co-assemble to form functional receptors.
[02:32:20.636 --> 02:32:23.137]  Uh, uh, Pony?
[02:32:23.137 --> 02:32:24.658]  Oh, too bad.
[02:32:24.658 --> 02:32:25.198]  Yes, Chip?
[02:32:25.934 --> 02:32:28.575]  The logical companion of Glur 5, Glur 6.
[02:32:28.575 --> 02:32:30.975]  You've won the game!
[02:32:30.975 --> 02:32:32.476]  Hey, life is like a game.
[02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:35.277]  And if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every day.
[02:32:35.277 --> 02:32:38.838]  Which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[02:32:38.838 --> 02:32:40.578]  That's why there's Drink and Mate.
[02:32:40.578 --> 02:32:44.999]  A patented formula of guava leaf extract, proven to reduce the effects of hangover.
[02:32:44.999 --> 02:32:48.801]  It restores balance to your body, keeping headaches and nausea at bay.
[02:32:48.801 --> 02:32:49.981]  And it really works!
[02:32:49.981 --> 02:32:50.841]  Tell them, Don!
[02:32:50.841 --> 02:32:51.881]  Drink and Mate!
[02:32:51.881 --> 02:32:53.782]  I wouldn't be able to read this without it!
[02:32:54.143 --> 02:32:56.773]  Available at Quality Retailers Nationwide.
[02:32:56.773 --> 02:32:58.660]  Drinkin' Mate urges you to please drink responsibly.
[02:33:28.442 --> 02:33:34.066]  Bottom line, we have an out-of-control elite who play with the world like it's their little toy.
[02:33:34.066 --> 02:33:37.469]  Am I saying Putin's good?
[02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:37.749]  No.
[02:33:37.749 --> 02:33:50.539]  He was caught staging bombings in 1999 so that he could create political support to come into office under a popular war with the Chechens, backed by, again, the United States.
[02:33:51.932 --> 02:33:56.616]  You always find the Muslim extremists on a very short leash to this government.
[02:33:56.616 --> 02:34:04.162]  That's why it's so sick that they use them as cover, as decoys, in the drills for the 9-11 attacks.
[02:34:04.162 --> 02:34:06.164]  Webster Tarpley, let me bring this up.
[02:34:06.164 --> 02:34:20.235]  How, if Brzezinski and the Rand Corporation and the Rockefeller clan, mimicking what the British had done in the region at the turn of the last century, creating most of the nations in the Middle East, their modern borders,
[02:34:21.008 --> 02:34:28.515]  They've always been used as a shield to overthrow democratically elected governments, intellectual governments, even pro-western governments, but that won't be puppets.
[02:34:28.515 --> 02:34:34.660]  They use Muslim radicals to overthrow countries, then they then fight with the Muslim radicals they put in.
[02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:37.843]  You know, kind of this endless crises creation.
[02:34:38.947 --> 02:34:49.233]  How do you see them using the Muslims that they've used again against the Serbs in the late 90s against in the in the 80s against the Russians?
[02:34:49.233 --> 02:34:55.917]  Brzezinski six months before in 79 having them attack Russian outposts in the north of Afghanistan getting a Russian response.
[02:34:55.917 --> 02:34:58.278]  How do you see the Muslims, i.e.
[02:34:58.278 --> 02:34:59.399]  mainly the Wahhabist,
[02:35:00.339 --> 02:35:07.063]  The Muslim majority, the 80%, Sunni, how do you see them being used on the chessboard?
[02:35:07.063 --> 02:35:07.523]  Who are they?
[02:35:07.523 --> 02:35:11.005]  Are they a rook or are they just a pawn?
[02:35:11.005 --> 02:35:15.407]  Brzezinski is the father of modern Islamic fundamentalism.
[02:35:15.407 --> 02:35:25.932]  He argued, pardon me, in the Carter administration that Muslim, pardon me, fundamentalism was the great bulwark against Soviet
[02:35:26.835 --> 02:35:27.716]  Communism.
[02:35:27.716 --> 02:35:29.377]  He installed Khomeini.
[02:35:29.377 --> 02:35:30.958]  He created Khomeini.
[02:35:30.958 --> 02:35:37.023]  Khomeini was a well-known, long-term British agent, had been used against the Shah during the Shah- You know what?
[02:35:37.023 --> 02:35:38.244]  Let's spend some time on that.
[02:35:38.244 --> 02:35:39.625]  I'm gonna sit back.
[02:35:39.625 --> 02:35:44.248]  Let's spend some time on that because I've researched that for the listeners that are probably believing that.
[02:35:44.248 --> 02:35:45.989]  That is true.
[02:35:45.989 --> 02:35:47.250]  Let's go back to 53.
[02:35:47.250 --> 02:35:53.455]  Let's explain the run-up to 79 and the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic State being shut up.
[02:35:54.665 --> 02:36:10.718]  Well, Muzadek would belong, along with General Qasem of Iraq and Nasser of Egypt and any number of others, to the wave of progressive, nationalistic, military types in the Arab world, and it would have been in the interest of the United States
[02:36:11.318 --> 02:36:17.380]  To cooperate with them for the modernization of the region and the ending of colonialism and imperialism.
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:27.564]  And this would be, even in the Eisenhower administration, the Suez Policy of 1956, turning against the British, the French, and the Israelis in favor of the Arabs.
[02:36:27.564 --> 02:36:28.664]  That's what got the U.S.
[02:36:28.664 --> 02:36:31.105]  into the Middle East in any positive way.
[02:36:32.128 --> 02:36:44.493]  In the first place, but the overthrow of Mossadegh is a joint operation of the British with Alan Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, and the pro-Wall Street CIA forces.
[02:36:44.493 --> 02:36:46.754]  And the father of Norman Schwarzkopf.
[02:36:46.754 --> 02:36:47.714]  Yes, right, that too.
[02:36:49.688 --> 02:36:50.748]  Here's the thing.
[02:36:50.748 --> 02:36:53.629]  The Shah, the problem of the Shah is this.
[02:36:53.629 --> 02:36:56.430]  He had some positive features in the 1960s.
[02:36:56.430 --> 02:36:58.411]  Let me mention this white revolution.
[02:36:58.411 --> 02:37:03.132]  The mullahs of Iran are an expression of the latifundists, the huge landowners.
[02:37:03.132 --> 02:37:04.633]  They're a kind of a feudal class.
[02:37:04.633 --> 02:37:07.874]  They're a little bit like this feudal monster we have, the Dalai Lama.
[02:37:08.454 --> 02:37:11.776]  Running around today that the Hollywood people think is spiritual.
[02:37:11.776 --> 02:37:22.583]  The Shah had this thing called the White Revolution, which was to break up the huge Latifundia and actually have a land reform, and to try to actually advance the country.
[02:37:22.583 --> 02:37:26.125]  Now this was his last attempt in that regard.
[02:37:26.125 --> 02:37:29.447]  But Khomeini was deployed as a British agent.
[02:37:29.447 --> 02:37:33.930]  The idea in Iran was scratch a mullah and you'll find a British agent.
[02:37:33.930 --> 02:37:34.931]  That's basically correct.
[02:37:35.431 --> 02:37:35.992]  We're good to go.
[02:38:06.092 --> 02:38:10.715]  Several dozen nuclear reactors either started or about to start.
[02:38:10.715 --> 02:38:11.716]  He's got steel mills.
[02:38:11.716 --> 02:38:16.079]  He's got about 50 billion dollars of tremendous development.
[02:38:16.079 --> 02:38:17.540]  He made the mistake Serbia made.
[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:19.101]  He was becoming independent.
[02:38:19.101 --> 02:38:26.466]  He was becoming independent and he was providing a way to see a country advance from medieval backwardness
[02:38:26.946 --> 02:38:36.010]  Into the modern age with nuclear energy, steel mills, petrochemical, new airport, new subway system for Tehran, the port of Bandar Abbas.
[02:38:36.010 --> 02:38:49.516]  My entrée into this was I knew that this guy, Loris Corbi of Italy, one of the great civil engineering companies of the world, who was building this new city of Bandar Abbas, now Bandar Khomeini.
[02:38:49.516 --> 02:38:52.537]  When Khomeini came in, he shut down all of this.
[02:38:52.537 --> 02:38:53.998]  The Iranians would have long since
[02:38:54.558 --> 02:38:55.178]  We're good to go.
[02:39:11.165 --> 02:39:14.327]  Yeah, for those that don't know, let's flesh that out now, Sam.
[02:39:14.327 --> 02:39:18.590]  He brags in two of his books that they helped Pol Pot and helped him kill two million people.
[02:39:18.590 --> 02:39:19.851]  He should be immediately arrested.
[02:39:19.851 --> 02:39:21.332]  This isn't us saying this.
[02:39:21.332 --> 02:39:26.315]  He writes this and says that, you know, we let him kill two million people and supported him, and I'm proud of what I did.
[02:39:26.315 --> 02:39:29.157]  And I can pull the quote up, but that's basically what he said.
[02:39:29.757 --> 02:39:53.125]  I mean, this is just the amazing type activity, but I want to cover Pol Pot briefly, then I want to go back to 1979, 1980, then this staged deal with the, quote, Republicans, doing a deal to have him grab hostages, then stage an event, but you have Brzezinski in the White House, why would he then double back and betray Carter if you're saying he's the mastermind?
[02:39:53.125 --> 02:39:57.227]  I know he's a fellow traveler and very powerful, but then, you know, Bern,
[02:39:59.278 --> 02:40:11.165]  The Carter administration, which he ran and sat in, via the Reagan administration with the Muslim Islamic Revolution over there for the weapons.
[02:40:11.165 --> 02:40:19.930]  Now remember, Brzezinski believed that Islamic fundamentalism is the number one bulwark against Soviet communism, so he fomented that in Iran.
[02:40:19.930 --> 02:40:22.351]  That's where the whole thing begins, really.
[02:40:22.351 --> 02:40:28.375]  And then he sends in these teams into Afghanistan, as you said, to get the Soviets in there and begin to bring them down.
[02:40:29.321 --> 02:40:35.446]  Um, Brzezinski fundamentally believes that he can use the Khomeini regime against the Soviets.
[02:40:35.446 --> 02:40:49.016]  This is the problem you have when you have a policy of what might be called appeasement, but really of turning these other countries into kamikaze puppets, suicidal pawns, expendable assets against your bigger enemy.
[02:40:49.016 --> 02:40:49.836]  That's the end of it.
[02:40:49.836 --> 02:40:50.537]  Wind-up toys.
[02:40:50.537 --> 02:40:52.018]  Of the Brzezinski method, right?
[02:40:52.018 --> 02:40:55.380]  You know, you point them at the Russians and let them go.
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:56.942]  This cannot be allowed in public.
[02:40:57.942 --> 02:41:05.531]  Brzezinski wanted to arm Khomeini, but he couldn't do it in public, and he needed a cover story.
[02:41:05.531 --> 02:41:14.861]  So he encouraged, in my view, encouraged the taking of the hostages as a piece of political theater that would allow him to continue U.S.
[02:41:14.861 --> 02:41:19.006]  military deliveries to Iran, and that's what is called Iran-Contra.
[02:41:19.594 --> 02:41:21.175]  It started under Carter.
[02:41:21.175 --> 02:41:21.595]  The U.S.
[02:41:21.595 --> 02:41:24.456]  military deliveries to Iran never stopped.
[02:41:24.456 --> 02:41:36.760]  There's a guy called Stanley Pottinger who was involved, and the Brzezinski National Security Council, where they had Iranian representatives, the so-called Captain Seytoodeh, was operating under the U.S.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:37.100]  Navy.
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:38.961]  And so the power never changes, they just remove a figurehead.
[02:41:40.026 --> 02:41:47.455]  Yes, but again, it's part of this, the question is that you're trying to subvert those five critical republics in Central Asia.
[02:41:47.455 --> 02:41:53.924]  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, right?
[02:41:53.924 --> 02:41:57.428]  The five big Soviet Central Asian republics.
[02:41:57.428 --> 02:41:58.269]  That's your target.
[02:41:59.614 --> 02:42:05.557]  Now, Brzezinski, therefore, has a public policy, and then he has the real policy.
[02:42:05.557 --> 02:42:13.641]  If you think about the accusation of appeasement against Obama, it's accurate, as long as you know what appeasement is.
[02:42:13.641 --> 02:42:18.963]  You can imagine Obama acting as a puppet for Brzezinski, talking to the Iranians.
[02:42:18.963 --> 02:42:22.445]  He would say, your real enemy is the Russians, not us.
[02:42:23.419 --> 02:42:26.681]  You've got to oppose the Russians in the Caspian Sea.
[02:42:26.681 --> 02:42:29.462]  You need a navy in the Caspian Sea.
[02:42:29.462 --> 02:42:35.345]  We'll give you a navy in the Caspian Sea so you can stop those Russians from taking your oil.
[02:42:35.345 --> 02:42:37.086]  You want nuclear weapons?
[02:42:37.086 --> 02:42:38.527]  We'll give them to you.
[02:42:38.527 --> 02:42:39.968]  We have special nukes.
[02:42:39.968 --> 02:42:41.389]  They only go to Moscow.
[02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:42.569]  You want some of those?
[02:42:42.569 --> 02:42:43.930]  We'll give you some right away.
[02:42:43.930 --> 02:42:47.572]  There is no objection by Brzezinski to Iran as a nuclear power.
[02:42:48.512 --> 02:42:55.278]  How did Pakistan's armament and by the US and England, how does that play into this larger chessboard?
[02:42:55.278 --> 02:42:58.040]  I don't know if that's quite so connected.
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:00.422]  I think the US, what you say is true.
[02:43:00.422 --> 02:43:03.084]  That's how AQ Khan was working for the
[02:43:03.704 --> 02:43:04.425]  For the U.S.
[02:43:04.425 --> 02:43:12.850]  all along, but again, the Iranian one is the really big one, because Pakistan has to be destroyed because the geopolitical instinct is pro-Chinese.
[02:43:12.850 --> 02:43:19.455]  Iran can be used as a puppet because the geopolitical instinct, as I've argued, is anti-Russian.
[02:43:19.455 --> 02:43:23.978]  So Brzezinski would say to them, look, didn't I arm you under Iran-Contra?
[02:43:23.978 --> 02:43:25.479]  Didn't I give you everything you needed?
[02:43:25.959 --> 02:43:26.579]  Yes.
[02:43:26.579 --> 02:43:28.820]  Well then, let me do it again for you now.
[02:43:28.820 --> 02:43:35.243]  I can deliver everything you need under the table, but let's get you going against those nasty Russians.
[02:43:35.243 --> 02:43:37.684]  Ahmadinejad will be out by next year.
[02:43:37.684 --> 02:43:40.945]  There's a new power constellation.
[02:43:40.945 --> 02:43:42.726]  This is what Obama would talk about.
[02:43:43.726 --> 02:43:46.428]  The neocons say, bomb Iran.
[02:43:46.428 --> 02:43:51.011]  Brzezinski, with Obama, says no, talk to Iran, but destroy Pakistan.
[02:43:51.011 --> 02:44:02.318]  Remember, Obama is... Well, that's the same more subtle system that we see growing out of Carter and then being implemented by the Reagan, really the Bush White House, the Bush 41-42 White House.
[02:44:05.004 --> 02:44:07.247]  Because what we're dealing with is with Iraq.
[02:44:07.247 --> 02:44:09.110]  I mean, I want to get your analysis on this.
[02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.650]  Same thing.
[02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:10.752]  They arm Iraq.
[02:44:10.752 --> 02:44:11.853]  Tens of billions of dollars.
[02:44:11.853 --> 02:44:13.195]  Have them attack Iran.
[02:44:13.195 --> 02:44:15.778]  Then they tear each other up.
[02:44:15.778 --> 02:44:19.203]  And then you have the whole region descend down into another level.
[02:44:19.958 --> 02:44:23.882]  Yeah, I have a whole chapter on the Carter administration, about a 40-page summary.
[02:44:23.882 --> 02:44:30.790]  People can't remember what a horror, how horrendous it was under the Carter-Brezhinski-Volker regime.
[02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:35.175]  It was one of the qualitative turning points in American history.
[02:44:35.175 --> 02:44:39.219]  Concerning what you just mentioned, the Iraq-Iran war, now here's the problem.
[02:44:39.219 --> 02:44:41.702]  Brezhinski installs Khomeini.
[02:44:42.382 --> 02:44:45.365]  The Shah is driven out by Carter and Brzezinski.
[02:44:45.365 --> 02:44:46.766]  They stab him in the back.
[02:44:46.766 --> 02:44:54.572]  At that point, there's a military government or Bakhtiyar, a reasonable kind of... The Shah dies of a 24-hour cancer.
[02:44:54.572 --> 02:45:05.621]  ...government, and then they essentially then... Khomeini comes in, and when Khomeini shuts down all the development projects, because they're, you know, not Islamic in his view,
[02:45:06.461 --> 02:45:07.863]  The country begins to fall apart.
[02:45:07.863 --> 02:45:10.685]  Now, they realize that Khomeini is going to be out within six months.
[02:45:10.685 --> 02:45:17.851]  The only way to stabilize Khomeini is to go to Saddam Hussein and say, if you attack, you'll have an easy victory.
[02:45:17.851 --> 02:45:21.274]  So you play Saddam Hussein against Iran.
[02:45:21.274 --> 02:45:23.615]  This leads to a war that goes on for the best part of the decade.
[02:45:23.615 --> 02:45:27.759]  Knowing that that will create nationalism and will actually strengthen the Islamic Revolution.
[02:45:27.759 --> 02:45:29.600]  It will keep Khomeini in power.
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:31.722]  Now, all of this on Brzezinski's watch.
[02:45:31.722 --> 02:45:35.225]  So you've got the Soviet-Afghan War unleashed by Brzezinski.
[02:45:35.265 --> 02:45:36.866]  That's really what the neocons have been doing.
[02:45:36.866 --> 02:45:42.408]  Saber-rattling has made Iran more hardline and made the government more popular, to the point where they were about to topple.
[02:45:42.408 --> 02:45:52.473]  Well, I would say that was a serious last-ditch attempt by Cheney to bomb Iran, most likely with nuclear weapons, last August, September.
[02:45:52.473 --> 02:45:54.514]  That was the rogue B-52.
[02:45:54.514 --> 02:45:58.036]  He tried as hard as he could, and he came within a hair's breadth.
[02:45:58.036 --> 02:46:02.698]  But we just learned that they're trying to paint up the PT boats and have a conflict over there.
[02:46:03.775 --> 02:46:05.517]  I don't see an attack on Iran.
[02:46:05.517 --> 02:46:06.477]  I would rule it out.
[02:46:06.477 --> 02:46:07.018]  The U.S.
[02:46:07.018 --> 02:46:11.762]  and the British do not want it, and the Israelis seem to have bought into the new strategy.
[02:46:11.762 --> 02:46:21.510]  In other words, their prominence in the Georgian picture indicates to me that the Israelis have seen that there will be no attack on Iran.
[02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:25.193]  There is, however, an attack on Pakistan going on right now.
[02:46:25.193 --> 02:46:30.217]  We've got the other side of it, the Turkmenistan Islamic Party.
[02:46:30.917 --> 02:46:37.599]  Is a puppet group of patsies in Chinese Turkestan, Xinjiang province, right, the northwest of China.
[02:46:37.599 --> 02:46:43.141]  Who have now suddenly started rattling sabers and delivering their videos to the CIA front intel center.
[02:46:43.141 --> 02:46:57.826]  Right, and they are, they run probably through the Pakistani ISI or maybe directly, right, Joe Sudovsky has an interesting article about this, but the idea is that terrorism in China is also being stoked with Tibetans
[02:46:58.835 --> 02:47:01.980]  With these Turkmen, or basically, they're all Turks.
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:06.707]  They're all Muslim Turks between the Caspian Sea and Mongolia, Tibet.
[02:47:06.707 --> 02:47:08.310]  It's a Turkish area largely.
[02:47:09.207 --> 02:47:10.708]  Tajikistan, I guess, is the exception.
[02:47:10.708 --> 02:47:24.559]  So there are a whole bunch of Muslim Turks, and they can be used now, along with the Tibetans, and along with the democracy freaks, the Amnesty International human rights watch crew, to try to destabilize the government of China.
[02:47:24.559 --> 02:47:29.083]  But now, let's also think, what's the new face of false flag terrorism?
[02:47:29.083 --> 02:47:36.829]  Let me suggest, I was in Amsterdam, Holland, a couple of weeks ago, the Docs on the Docs series, and I showed a bunch of pictures.
[02:47:36.829 --> 02:47:38.631]  Let's see what the new face of terrorism is.
[02:47:39.418 --> 02:47:41.640]  Cho at Virginia Tech.
[02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:45.103]  You look at him, well he's Korean, but he might be Chinese.
[02:47:45.103 --> 02:47:48.686]  So he's a crazy oriental Korean.
[02:47:48.686 --> 02:47:50.508]  He's not a Manchurian candidate.
[02:47:50.508 --> 02:47:56.673]  And now in the middle of the Olympics you have a Chinese guy killing two people and it's hype like aliens have landed.
[02:47:56.673 --> 02:47:58.675]  But Cho is one.
[02:47:58.675 --> 02:48:01.978]  Kazmierczak, Northern Illinois University.
[02:48:02.478 --> 02:48:05.942]  He's a left-wing student with social justice concerns.
[02:48:05.942 --> 02:48:08.244]  He doesn't like the way the criminal justice system goes.
[02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:10.926]  The other Chinese guy that ran around a few years ago shooting the 14 bear hunters.
[02:48:12.421 --> 02:48:15.042]  And then I would then include the Unabomber.
[02:48:15.042 --> 02:48:19.102]  This is not quite as recent, but the idea of ecological terrorism.
[02:48:19.102 --> 02:48:28.504]  If you're a polluter, if your carbon footprint is too big, maybe the new Unabomber or Earth First or somebody like this will come and visit you.
[02:48:28.504 --> 02:48:38.266]  Then we have the classic ones done by the British against Russia to signal the coming of the new policy, which is Litvinenko, a Russian
[02:48:38.946 --> 02:48:41.747]  From the KGB with nuclear terrorism.
[02:48:41.747 --> 02:48:47.669]  Don't think about the relations, just think about the sort of pictorial memes of the myth.
[02:48:47.669 --> 02:48:48.889]  Litvinenko is one.
[02:48:48.889 --> 02:48:49.889]  Politkovskaya.
[02:48:49.889 --> 02:48:54.491]  Now, she's a Russian journalist who was assassinated and they immediately blamed Putin.
[02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:58.172]  All indications are that this comes from the Berezovsky stable.
[02:48:58.172 --> 02:49:03.153]  Boris Berezovsky, Russian oligarch, now working for British intelligence.
[02:49:03.153 --> 02:49:04.474]  Let's see what else we can think of.
[02:49:04.474 --> 02:49:05.414]  Ilyas Akhmedov.
[02:49:06.047 --> 02:49:09.869]  This is, of course, the Chechen ambassador here.
[02:49:09.869 --> 02:49:14.251]  He's the ambassador of the main Chechen terrorist organization.
[02:49:14.251 --> 02:49:18.232]  The one with Basayev and Maskadov, run by the CIA.
[02:49:18.232 --> 02:49:23.995]  Which, I would say, they're the people who blew up those buildings in Moscow in 1999.
[02:49:23.995 --> 02:49:29.417]  They're the ones who did the theater, the school in Beslan, and also the hospital in southern Russia in 1995.
[02:49:30.718 --> 02:49:35.764]  The Chechens have now claimed probably 1,000 to 1,500 dead.
[02:49:35.764 --> 02:49:46.215]  So the Russians, if you add up their, you know, the Butcher's Bill, the Russians have suffered from international terrorism at least as much as the U.S.
[02:49:46.215 --> 02:49:46.996]  in 9-11.
[02:49:46.996 --> 02:49:48.757]  But let's look at Akhmadov, right?
[02:49:48.757 --> 02:49:49.418]  He's here.
[02:49:50.379 --> 02:49:54.203]  Because Big New Brzezinski lobbied to get him asylum.
[02:49:54.203 --> 02:49:59.848]  He's now being paid with your money, State Department stipend under the Reagan-Facel program.
[02:49:59.848 --> 02:50:03.752]  He's living in a nice house here in Woodley Park by the zoo.
[02:50:03.752 --> 02:50:06.715]  He has an office at the National Endowment for Democracy.
[02:50:06.715 --> 02:50:12.140]  He gets a secretary, a travel budget, a public relations budget, all courtesy of the U.S.
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:12.580]  taxpayer.
[02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:15.343]  Now the Russians have repeatedly said, this is a terrorist.
[02:50:16.167 --> 02:50:17.247]  You've got to extradite him.
[02:50:17.247 --> 02:50:18.328]  We want to put him on trial.
[02:50:18.328 --> 02:50:18.648]  The U.S.
[02:50:18.648 --> 02:50:19.488]  says no.
[02:50:19.488 --> 02:50:21.008]  He's a democratic force.
[02:50:21.008 --> 02:50:23.949]  As long as he's anti-Putin, it means that he's democratic.
[02:50:23.949 --> 02:50:32.891]  When you had that Beslan school in September of 2004, the Russian press was full of, this attack was planned in London and Washington.
[02:50:32.891 --> 02:50:35.112]  I believe it's actually quite correct.
[02:50:35.652 --> 02:50:39.134]  So, if you add up these faces, right?
[02:50:39.134 --> 02:50:46.818]  Cho, Kazimierczak, Litvinenko in particular, the Unabomber, and then somebody like Ilyas Akhmedov.
[02:50:46.818 --> 02:50:56.044]  I think that's a composite of memes from which you can see the probably various kinds of false flag terrorism that are now likely to be unleashed.
[02:50:56.044 --> 02:50:56.364]  And again,
[02:50:57.564 --> 02:50:59.505]  It's not just Chechens, right?
[02:50:59.505 --> 02:51:00.785]  It could be the FARC.
[02:51:00.785 --> 02:51:05.186]  We saw this tremendous media circus around this woman, Betancourt.
[02:51:05.186 --> 02:51:07.107]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:51:07.107 --> 02:51:10.328]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[02:51:10.328 --> 02:51:13.809]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:13.809 --> 02:51:16.469]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:16.469 --> 02:51:18.010]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:18.010 --> 02:51:18.790]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:18.790 --> 02:51:19.770]  This is his ammo.
[02:51:19.770 --> 02:51:21.191]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:21.191 --> 02:51:21.931]  We have to look to Israel.
[02:51:21.991 --> 02:51:26.593]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[02:51:26.593 --> 02:51:28.634]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:51:40.839 --> 02:51:51.127]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:51:51.127 --> 02:51:52.347]  Fabled enemies.
[02:51:52.347 --> 02:52:00.093]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:00.093 --> 02:52:03.476]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:12.621]  Here's a story.
[02:52:12.621 --> 02:52:13.462]  You wash your car.
[02:52:13.462 --> 02:52:14.704]  How long does it last?
[02:52:14.704 --> 02:52:15.464]  Three days?
[02:52:15.464 --> 02:52:16.125]  A week?
[02:52:16.125 --> 02:52:17.066]  Two weeks?
[02:52:17.066 --> 02:52:22.532]  Life Change Tea eliminates chemicals, toxins, and parasites, and much more.
[02:52:22.532 --> 02:52:23.253]  The effect?
[02:52:23.253 --> 02:52:24.254]  You lose weight.
[02:52:24.254 --> 02:52:24.694]  That's right.
[02:52:24.694 --> 02:52:25.655]  You lose weight.
[02:52:25.655 --> 02:52:26.997]  So here's the story.
[02:52:26.997 --> 02:52:28.038]  You wash your car.
[02:52:28.038 --> 02:52:29.159]  It gets dirty again.
[02:52:29.159 --> 02:52:30.280]  You cleanse your body.
[02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:32.282]  Chemicals and toxins come back.
[02:52:32.282 --> 02:52:32.582]  The fix?
[02:52:33.203 --> 02:52:34.384]  Stay on the T!
[02:52:34.384 --> 02:52:36.305]  And here's how we will help.
[02:52:36.305 --> 02:52:39.687]  Ask for the Mid-State Fair Special when ordering.
[02:52:39.687 --> 02:52:40.908]  Here's how to order.
[02:52:40.908 --> 02:52:41.728]  Online.
[02:52:41.728 --> 02:52:43.269]  GetTheTee.com.
[02:52:43.269 --> 02:52:45.670]  That's GetTheTee.com.

[02:52:48.092 --> 02:52:51.073]  Restoring America's health, one teabag at a time.
[02:53:07.023 --> 02:53:15.930]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:53:15.930 --> 02:53:21.094]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:53:21.094 --> 02:53:32.223]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:53:32.603 --> 02:53:38.386]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:53:38.386 --> 02:53:44.649]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:53:44.649 --> 02:53:45.689]  What about you?
[02:53:45.689 --> 02:53:47.610]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:21.413]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[02:54:21.413 --> 02:54:28.080]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:30.423]  I'm eastbound, just one more band it runs.
[02:54:30.423 --> 02:54:33.566]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:49.741]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:54:49.741 --> 02:54:51.162]  to 3 p.m.
[02:54:51.162 --> 02:54:52.663]  Central Standard Time.
[02:54:52.663 --> 02:55:00.829]  And then we are back, right here on the network, 9 to 1 on the Genesis feeds.
[02:55:02.377 --> 02:55:04.158]  24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:04.158 --> 02:55:07.659]  We do the four-hour show, then for 20 hours it re-airs back-to-back.
[02:55:07.659 --> 02:55:13.181]  So you missed Dr. Paul Greg Roberts and his analysis of what happened in Russia, very similar to TARP police.
[02:55:13.181 --> 02:55:17.422]  That'll be re-airing when this show ends in about one hour and four minutes from now.
[02:55:18.686 --> 02:55:19.907]  We're going to take your calls.
[02:55:19.907 --> 02:55:23.129]  Wide open phones in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:55:23.129 --> 02:55:28.792]  Any subject you want to discuss, Webster has agreed to ride shotgun with us.
[02:55:28.792 --> 02:55:33.035]  We always enjoy having him on with us.
[02:55:33.035 --> 02:55:33.615]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:55:33.615 --> 02:55:37.318]  Interesting story I'll cover later in the next hour.
[02:55:37.318 --> 02:55:39.899]  Beijing Olympics 2009 opening ceremony.
[02:55:39.899 --> 02:55:42.221]  Giant firework footprints.
[02:55:42.221 --> 02:55:42.561]  Faked!
[02:55:43.627 --> 02:55:49.830]  Yeah, that's the kind of stuff China and Russia and every government... All governments are evil and wicked and corrupt.
[02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:51.670]  But who is the dominant global force?
[02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:55.192]  Well, that is, as Tarpley calls it, the Anglo-American Empire.
[02:55:55.192 --> 02:55:55.672]  Doesn't matter.
[02:55:55.672 --> 02:55:56.412]  They're all corrupt.
[02:55:56.412 --> 02:55:57.093]  They're all bad.
[02:55:57.093 --> 02:56:01.775]  We're just cold-bloodedly analyzing how they're fighting with each other and what they're doing.
[02:56:01.775 --> 02:56:04.996]  Remember, the state is the enemy of the people, bottom line, throughout history.
[02:56:05.857 --> 02:56:15.201]  Uh, the problem is there's always other states trying to come in and take over your state, so it's a very, uh, very serious equilibrium that has to be held with the size of the state.
[02:56:15.201 --> 02:56:18.602]  Uh, but again, we'll continue with Tarpley here in just a moment.
[02:56:18.602 --> 02:56:21.023]  Don't forget, I am a documentary filmmaker.
[02:56:21.023 --> 02:56:22.503]  I have made 19 films.
[02:56:22.503 --> 02:56:26.045]  The latest is Truth Rising.
[02:56:26.045 --> 02:56:30.927]  And it's got Zbigniew Brzezinski being confronted in it by the young Luke Radowski and him saying, sit down and shut up!
[02:56:32.165 --> 02:56:38.208]  And it's got everybody else from Geraldo Rivera to Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton to John McCain being confronted.
[02:56:38.208 --> 02:56:42.490]  And then it's got Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, the good guys in it.
[02:56:42.490 --> 02:56:44.410]  It's got Democracy Now!'
[02:56:44.390 --> 02:56:48.172]  's Amy Goodman talking about bombs in the building.
[02:56:48.172 --> 02:56:52.734]  It's got George Carlin right before he died talking about an inside job on 9-11.
[02:56:52.734 --> 02:56:56.356]  It's got the police trying to plant bombs on 9-11 activists.
[02:56:56.356 --> 02:56:58.577]  I mean, I really can't describe how powerful.
[02:56:58.577 --> 02:57:01.618]  This is probably the best view of any film I've made, the most entertaining.
[02:57:02.412 --> 02:57:04.335]  I mean, you talk about a short attention span theater.
[02:57:04.335 --> 02:57:09.944]  It just moves from issue to issue, really grabbing people in a way, in a different way than other films.
[02:57:09.944 --> 02:57:14.973]  Truth Rising, available at InfoWars.com on DVD, or watch it right now on super high quality.
[02:57:15.871 --> 02:57:19.372]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, all 19 of my films.
[02:57:19.372 --> 02:57:30.615]  The fourth hour every day we go live with the video cam in studio, and the document cam, and of course the guest cam, the online cam, and we give you exclusives here on the stream in the fourth hour.
[02:57:30.615 --> 02:57:43.998]  You get exclusive extras when you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, like an hour and a half plus with in-game 1.5, the little addendum to in-game that PrisonPlanet.tv members got,

[02:59:53.985 --> 02:59:55.585]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:34.363 --> 03:00:41.826]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now already into the fourth and final hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny.
[03:00:41.826 --> 03:00:49.989]  The websites are m4wars.com, prisonplanet.com, m4wars.net, jonesreport.com, truthandnews.us.
[03:00:49.989 --> 03:00:51.790]  And you can also watch us live every day.
[03:00:51.790 --> 03:00:52.930]  We do this fourth hour.
[03:00:52.930 --> 03:00:57.592]  Sometimes we do the whole show, but always the fourth hour live video streaming at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:01:01.952 --> 03:01:08.215]  Going back to Webster Tarpley, when we come back in the next segment, we will take your calls to the balance of the hour.
[03:01:08.215 --> 03:01:12.637]  Webster, finishing up with what you expect to see in this election.
[03:01:12.637 --> 03:01:15.598]  I know you think that the greater of two evils is Barack Obama.
[03:01:15.598 --> 03:01:27.624]  I myself see it as a huge distraction, but I understand you're saying his star appeal, and I agree, will bring people into the fold to support the corporate fascism, will give them the grassroots cover they need.
[03:01:27.624 --> 03:01:30.125]  So I agree with you he's the most dangerous candidate.
[03:01:31.042 --> 03:01:41.390]  I just psychologically have divorced myself so much from the two parties and fully understanding they're puppets that I can't even really see Obama, I guess as many other people see him.
[03:01:41.390 --> 03:01:47.215]  But in closing, in the three and a half minutes we have left of this opening segment, other key points you'd like to make?
[03:01:47.215 --> 03:01:54.080]  Well, I would say first of all, if you get Obama with the Democratic Congress, you will have the full fury
[03:01:54.827 --> 03:02:17.871]  Of the fascist corporate state, in terms of that economic austerity, killer austerity, genocidal austerity that I talked about, under Green, Polar Bear, Snail Daughter auspices, Third World Solidarity, and possibly even this other question of reparations to that ethnic group, which would also be a very explosive recipe.
[03:02:17.871 --> 03:02:22.292]  If you get McCain, I would say you get a tired, old, lame duck.
[03:02:23.497 --> 03:02:25.998]  Who is going to be a lame duck from the first moment he gets there.
[03:02:25.998 --> 03:02:29.959]  He'll be quacking in his inaugural address.
[03:02:29.959 --> 03:02:33.721]  And he will be faced by a very hostile Democratic Congress, giving us gridlock.
[03:02:33.721 --> 03:02:38.562]  This is the best outcome we could get under that scenario would be the gridlock.
[03:02:38.562 --> 03:02:43.004]  So, in this sense, McCain is actually a lesser evil than Obama.
[03:02:43.004 --> 03:02:45.244]  The Democrats try to scare you with McCain.
[03:02:45.244 --> 03:02:47.685]  They tell you that he's going to put in these fascist judges.
[03:02:47.685 --> 03:02:51.306]  Well, the Democrats can filibuster those judges if they want to.
[03:02:51.306 --> 03:02:52.447]  So don't try to scare us with that.
[03:02:53.027 --> 03:02:57.608]  With Mrs. Clinton, I think you get a much more open-ended project.
[03:02:57.608 --> 03:03:13.332]  This is somebody who responds to public opinion through triangulation, but she does respond, and her history during the primaries has been to move more and more towards New Deal positions, at least verbally, and that's what we've got to work with at this point.
[03:03:14.730 --> 03:03:19.971]  This would also allow a solution that would not be McCain and not be Obama.
[03:03:19.971 --> 03:03:24.172]  That's the merit of Mrs. Clinton is that she's not McCain and she's not Obama.
[03:03:24.172 --> 03:03:31.934]  And I think there is going to be a movement to try to get her nominated and perhaps even to change the outcome of the convention.
[03:03:31.934 --> 03:03:35.815]  But I think the principal idea is you've got to build a movement.
[03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:43.643]  The way you build a movement is figure out what the financiers want most and oppose them.
[03:03:43.643 --> 03:03:45.804]  I would not say that the state is always the enemy.
[03:03:45.804 --> 03:03:47.685]  My analysis of history is different.
[03:03:47.685 --> 03:03:53.367]  I would say financier oligarchs, feudal aristocrats in the more distant past,
[03:03:54.059 --> 03:03:58.802]  Financiers, finance oligarchs, bankers, are the enemy.
[03:03:58.802 --> 03:04:21.478]  And if you look at the origin of the modern state, under somebody like Gian Gagliazzo Visconti, in Milan in the early about 1400s, if you look then at Louis XI of France in the 1470s, 1480s, and Henry VII of England, the Earl of Richmond, the guy who got rid of Richard III, what you see there is an alliance of the king, that is the state,
[03:04:22.078 --> 03:04:26.101]  With the bourgeoisie, the cities, and the peasantry against what?
[03:04:26.101 --> 03:04:33.126]  Against feudal oligarchs who are already transforming themselves into banking oligarchs and financiers.
[03:04:33.126 --> 03:04:38.130]  Well, Webster, my point is that big states are the most abusive throughout history.
[03:04:38.130 --> 03:04:39.231]  It breeds corruption.
[03:04:39.231 --> 03:04:40.892]  The corrupt come in to suck out of it.
[03:04:41.572 --> 03:04:44.793]  And then look at what the oligarchs always want.
[03:04:44.793 --> 03:04:53.575]  They always want a big state as their tool to control populations, destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie using the commie terms.
[03:04:53.575 --> 03:05:01.417]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley and your phone calls right here on the one, the only Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:05:01.417 --> 03:05:02.217]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:07.409 --> 03:05:09.169]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[03:05:09.169 --> 03:05:11.370]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[03:05:11.370 --> 03:05:13.150]  I can't find my wallet!
[03:05:13.150 --> 03:05:13.990]  Sound familiar?
[03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:17.451]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[03:05:17.451 --> 03:05:22.812]  Introducing our patented Find One, Find All Key Finders, or FOFA XD for short.
[03:05:22.812 --> 03:05:28.994]  Once a FOFA key finder is attached to each of those easy-to-lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[03:05:28.994 --> 03:05:35.315]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[03:05:35.435 --> 03:05:37.016]  The possibilities are endless.
[03:05:37.016 --> 03:05:43.342]  Fofa goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[03:05:43.342 --> 03:05:45.204]  Got the remote!
[03:05:45.204 --> 03:05:46.825]  Oh, my keys!
[03:05:46.825 --> 03:05:48.186]  There's my wallet!

[03:06:02.379 --> 03:06:14.246]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:14.246 --> 03:06:16.888]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:16.888 --> 03:06:18.449]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:18.449 --> 03:06:19.250]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:20.250]  This is his MO.
[03:06:20.250 --> 03:06:21.611]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:21.611 --> 03:06:23.012]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:23.592 --> 03:06:30.737]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:30.737 --> 03:06:31.217]  Some U.S.
[03:06:31.217 --> 03:06:37.581]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:37.581 --> 03:06:41.023]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:41.283 --> 03:06:51.547]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:51.547 --> 03:06:52.767]  Fabled enemies.
[03:06:52.767 --> 03:07:00.530]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:00.530 --> 03:07:03.931]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:07.475 --> 03:07:13.640]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[03:07:13.640 --> 03:07:15.562]  But there is something you can do.

[03:08:08.721 --> 03:08:15.344]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:15.344 --> 03:08:27.210]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:27.210 --> 03:08:31.933]  Okay, we've got Webster Carpenter with us for the rest of the hour, an in-depth interview today with him.
[03:08:32.913 --> 03:08:42.835]  On the economy, the election, all that's happened in Russia, in future actions.
[03:08:42.835 --> 03:08:52.518]  Before we go any further, Webster, is there anything else you want to add concerning the geopolitical climate we're in right now before we go to calls?
[03:08:52.518 --> 03:08:53.718]  Certainly.
[03:08:53.718 --> 03:09:01.400]  I think right now you've got to also look at the situation in Europe, because one of Brzezinski's main goals, of course, is to play Europe against Russia, too.
[03:09:02.120 --> 03:09:10.990]  Normally, Europe would gravitate towards Russia right now because of the oil, the natural gas, the epicenter of the current world economic breakdown crisis.
[03:09:10.990 --> 03:09:15.254]  The Bush economic depression is, of course, London and New York.
[03:09:15.254 --> 03:09:16.615]  They've been hit hardest.
[03:09:16.615 --> 03:09:21.461]  And other people have been hit hard because they've gotten into bed with London and New York.
[03:09:21.461 --> 03:09:24.484]  There's a whole school of opinion in France, Germany, Italy.
[03:09:25.104 --> 03:09:33.930]  On the continent, that it's time now to orient towards the Russians, East-West trade, oil for technology, mutually beneficial economic development.
[03:09:33.930 --> 03:09:36.112]  So Brzezinski's got to destroy that.
[03:09:36.112 --> 03:09:48.300]  And what he wants to use is that cordon sanitaire, or that, you know, that unsanitary cordon of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Ukraine to begin cutting off the natural gas.
[03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:52.143]  The Russians, of course, are going around that by building a pipeline down the middle
[03:09:52.743 --> 03:10:02.269]  Of the Baltics, so that they can deliver guaranteed energy without the Ukrainians and the Poles skimming, or cutting it off, or provoking, or the rest of this stuff.
[03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:18.699]  Remember, we have to thank, ironically enough, in this terrible situation, we have to thank Sarkozy, of all people, and Merkel for blocking the attempt by Brzezinski to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO as members, or at least get that going.
[03:10:19.359 --> 03:10:21.902]  At the last NATO meeting back in April.
[03:10:21.902 --> 03:10:25.004]  Remember, Obama wants Georgia in NATO.
[03:10:25.004 --> 03:10:26.946]  The Washington Post want them in there.
[03:10:26.946 --> 03:10:28.407]  We've got to say no.
[03:10:28.407 --> 03:10:33.912]  No NATO membership for this bandit, thug, kleptocrat regime.
[03:10:33.912 --> 03:10:40.098]  The other thing is, the Italian position right now, the Italian government is Berlusconi.
[03:10:40.098 --> 03:10:43.401]  This just shows you what kind of situation we're in.
[03:10:43.401 --> 03:10:44.782]  Berlusconi, of course.
[03:10:46.063 --> 03:11:01.414]  Uh, dirty character that everybody knows, but he's also a friend of the Russians, and the Italians have gone very, very far in this East-West trade, oil-for-technology kind of stuff, and they've got a history of building, you know, huge automobile plants, right?
[03:11:01.414 --> 03:11:05.457]  The Togliatti Fiat plant that built all those Ladas that are still running.
[03:11:06.782 --> 03:11:15.468]  The Italians are saying, the Foreign Minister Frattini is saying, we cannot transform the European Union into an anti-Russian bloc.
[03:11:15.468 --> 03:11:18.530]  So Georgia, get lost, stay out there.
[03:11:18.530 --> 03:11:24.133]  I've also been in touch with my friend Giulietto Chiesa, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels.
[03:11:24.133 --> 03:11:25.354]  You remember, he's the one who did
[03:11:25.914 --> 03:11:29.575]  The Zero documentary.
[03:11:29.575 --> 03:11:32.195]  I was in Milan last November.
[03:11:32.195 --> 03:11:41.137]  We had, oh, 500 people in an auditorium with Dario Falc, Nobel Prize for literature and probably the most read playwright in the world today.
[03:11:41.137 --> 03:11:48.718]  There's an anthology also called Zero with essays by all sorts of people, among them yours truly.
[03:11:48.718 --> 03:11:53.799]  So Giulietto Chiesa is leading a publicity effort in Europe
[03:11:54.279 --> 03:12:06.754]  To try to show people that Georgia is this bunch of pawns of Brzezinski, so there's also a lot of work to be done vis-a-vis the Europeans, trying to get them to break away.
[03:12:06.754 --> 03:12:10.579]  In other words, don't become a lemming for Obama like those poor Germans.
[03:12:11.639 --> 03:12:16.821]  At the Victory Column near the Ziegesäule in the middle of Berlin.
[03:12:16.821 --> 03:12:20.222]  Don't go with that, but rather dump Obama.
[03:12:20.222 --> 03:12:37.408]  I'm very glad to say my book, Obama, the Postmodern Coup, is coming out in a German edition in the Krupp-Fellach, that is K-O-P-P, which will be hitting the newsstands fairly soon, in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair, among other things.
[03:12:37.408 --> 03:12:40.149]  I'm also coming out in Japan, because there's another place.
[03:12:40.689 --> 03:12:48.210]  The Japanese have said very clearly, it was a successful summit of Prime Minister Fukuda with President Hu of China.
[03:12:48.210 --> 03:12:52.951]  The Japanese Defense Minister said, the biggest threat to us is chaos in China.
[03:12:52.951 --> 03:12:58.392]  This is a way of saying, dear Big New, we will not be a staging area for your attacks on China.
[03:12:58.392 --> 03:13:04.353]  In Taiwan, the KMT, the Kuomintang Party, has made a comeback, kicking out the U.S.
[03:13:04.353 --> 03:13:08.554]  puppets, the DPP, Green Party, or Democratic Progressive Party.
[03:13:08.994 --> 03:13:17.297]  Get rid of them, put in people who are reasonable, who realize that their future is a rapprochement with China and mutually beneficial trade.
[03:13:17.297 --> 03:13:21.458]  Okay, well I'm sorry I've got to stop you there because I want to give some time to the callers.
[03:13:21.458 --> 03:13:25.179]  I have to say, everything you're saying is accurate about what's happening in the world.
[03:13:25.179 --> 03:13:28.240]  I don't disagree with about 95% of what you're saying.
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:32.541]  The problem is, there's more to all of this.
[03:13:32.541 --> 03:13:34.282]  It is a fact that the CIA
[03:13:36.872 --> 03:13:40.054]  Back the Communists against the Japanese in China.
[03:13:40.054 --> 03:13:53.381]  It is a fact, now declassified, that the CIA, and David Rockefeller's written editorials in the New York Times saying this, wanted the Communist Chinese to come to power so that they could use them in China.
[03:13:53.381 --> 03:14:04.547]  It is a fact that Armand Hammer and the Rockefellers and the big foundation monies pumped billions into Russia from its founding, overthrowing the czars, poor British intelligence,
[03:14:05.518 --> 03:14:05.859]  Yeah, I think.
[03:14:21.596 --> 03:14:28.700]  Which leaves all nation states weak and vulnerable and basically starving and infighting with regional and religious conflicts.
[03:14:28.700 --> 03:14:34.563]  I just want to point out that we're not saying China's good or Russia's good or anybody's good here.
[03:14:34.563 --> 03:14:35.864]  You can disagree if you want.
[03:14:35.864 --> 03:14:44.008]  It's that you have this evil global corporate management system that was developed out of London, the city of London.
[03:14:44.008 --> 03:14:49.871]  I just don't want to oversimplify this where America and England and Israel
[03:14:50.825 --> 03:14:51.085]  I don't know.
[03:15:03.152 --> 03:15:06.995]  Of how these big tectonic forces are colliding into each other.
[03:15:06.995 --> 03:15:14.842]  Well, let's look at the heart of the world problem right now is this massive derivative, this cancerous mass of kited derivatives.
[03:15:14.842 --> 03:15:20.207]  And that was a financial weapons system by the central banks while the dollar was still the world reserve currency.
[03:15:20.207 --> 03:15:29.675]  They made a mad dash to buy up all the real infrastructure of the world, buy up the defense contractors, media of the world, to set up their global corporate empire off of the yoke
[03:15:30.095 --> 03:15:35.017]  You know, like an egg off of the sustenance that was the United States.
[03:15:35.017 --> 03:15:56.606]  Now they want to leave us holding the financial bag for that collapse while they've moved into safe havens, then bring in a third world police state here and use the United States as a military enclave to produce modern Hessian soldiers for the new global corporate state that has shucked any connection to any original nation state.
[03:15:57.259 --> 03:16:04.757]  But remember now, if we use my estimate of 1 quadrillion, it's probably 1.5 quadrillion or maybe a lot more.
[03:16:04.757 --> 03:16:07.203]  Well, it's 6,000 trillion that we know of.
[03:16:07.904 --> 03:16:12.947]  Well, yes, but I'm saying one... Well, you want to say two quadrillion.
[03:16:12.947 --> 03:16:16.270]  Fine, two quadrillion is ballpark, perfectly good.
[03:16:16.270 --> 03:16:17.230]  Where is that centered?
[03:16:17.230 --> 03:16:21.073]  Well, about a quarter of that is just JPMorgan Chase.
[03:16:21.073 --> 03:16:25.696]  And when you add up the rest of the U.S., you'll get up to well over half.
[03:16:25.696 --> 03:16:29.819]  You'll get up to probably two-thirds of the derivatives, and the rest are in London.
[03:16:30.359 --> 03:16:34.161]  So there you see where the center of this cancer is.
[03:16:34.161 --> 03:16:38.123]  To say that Russia is the same as this or China... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:16:38.123 --> 03:16:40.424]  I'm saying they're just not as powerful.
[03:16:40.424 --> 03:16:40.905]  Absolutely.
[03:16:40.905 --> 03:16:45.807]  The Anglo-American establishment flooded the world with this liquidity to get everybody in debt and get real assets.
[03:16:45.807 --> 03:16:47.288]  Now they're going to leave us holding the bag.
[03:16:47.828 --> 03:16:49.350]  So I don't, quote, see the U.S.
[03:16:49.350 --> 03:16:51.492]  now becoming a sub-player in all this.
[03:16:51.492 --> 03:16:53.434]  That was a foregone conclusion.
[03:16:53.434 --> 03:17:09.891]  I'm saying now the New World Order, the Anglo-American Empire, as you call it, is moving to that transcendent point where they sit above all the nation-states with their private intelligence networks in Russia, in China, in Israel, in the U.S., just playing us all off against each other.
[03:17:10.858 --> 03:17:12.939]  I don't believe that they have total world control.
[03:17:12.939 --> 03:17:13.499]  No, I don't.
[03:17:13.499 --> 03:17:15.319]  I think that there are real conflicts in the world.
[03:17:15.319 --> 03:17:16.839]  I don't think they have total world control.
[03:17:16.839 --> 03:17:20.120]  I'm saying they are dominant.
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:22.741]  Dominant up to a point, but fading fast.
[03:17:22.741 --> 03:17:28.862]  And Obama is really a flight forward, a desperate bid to give this a facelift, to give it a new lease on life.
[03:17:28.862 --> 03:17:35.744]  And if you block Obama, you're going to be dealing with a severely weakened imperialism under conditions of much greater difficulty.
[03:17:36.304 --> 03:17:48.827]  Okay, I'm going to skip this break for people behind the scenes watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and listening on the exclusive InfoWars.com streams and then at 24 after, I promise, no more pontificating by myself or Webster.
[03:17:48.827 --> 03:17:49.688]  It's all great info.
[03:17:49.688 --> 03:17:54.809]  Steve, Rico, Elliot, Cliff, Jeff, and many others, we're going to go right to you in about five minutes.
[03:17:54.809 --> 03:17:57.730]  But, okay, how does it affect the American people?
[03:17:57.730 --> 03:18:02.971]  Let's be centered on ourselves for a minute and take the local, regional view for North America.
[03:18:03.937 --> 03:18:09.439]  What is better for the American people, for the empire to crumble and fall apart, or for us to mindlessly support it?
[03:18:09.439 --> 03:18:17.602]  Obviously, I believe mindlessly supporting it, they will only rape us that much more financially and physically, and so it is good to let this fall apart.
[03:18:18.922 --> 03:18:25.208]  I would go with the populists, those prairie farmers back in 1890 meeting in Omaha.
[03:18:25.208 --> 03:18:34.656]  And they formulated the Populist Party program, which basically said a mass movement needs to take over the government and turn it against Rockefeller, Morgan, and the Wall Street group.
[03:18:34.656 --> 03:18:37.098]  And I don't think that has changed.
[03:18:37.098 --> 03:18:38.299]  That's what we should be doing.
[03:18:38.299 --> 03:18:41.202]  So we need a Golden Cross speech?
[03:18:42.350 --> 03:18:44.932]  Yes, although he's, you know, that's William Jennings Bryan.
[03:18:44.932 --> 03:18:48.075]  He's not really an organic representative of this.
[03:18:48.075 --> 03:18:54.720]  He is at least a politician who grew up in that milieu, and he's trying to fight Wall Street.
[03:18:54.720 --> 03:19:07.191]  Again, maybe he's not a good example, but if you want to think who's like us, who's isolated like we are, or relatively, with not that much money, take those populists of 1890, and I think their strategy is valid.
[03:19:07.191 --> 03:19:09.873]  Now, you want to oppose the empire, you also want to construct
[03:19:10.573 --> 03:19:13.994]  A, uh, an economic alternative to this, and for me this is clear.
[03:19:13.994 --> 03:19:17.135]  The New Deal methods worked then, they will work now.
[03:19:17.135 --> 03:19:21.076]  Oh yeah, it's turned us into a bunch of dependents, broken down the family.
[03:19:21.076 --> 03:19:22.676]  The same foundations you talk about.
[03:19:22.676 --> 03:19:24.577]  This is not, this is not the New Deal.
[03:19:24.577 --> 03:19:26.698]  The New Deal has been gone for 40 years.
[03:19:26.698 --> 03:19:31.879]  Hey Webster, 100 years ago the big foundations, as you know, wrote how they were going to get us addicted to government.
[03:19:32.719 --> 03:19:39.162]  Look, I tell you, the populace in Omaha said, the government is going to belong to us.
[03:19:39.162 --> 03:19:41.283]  The goal is not to get government out of your life.
[03:19:41.283 --> 03:19:43.044]  The goal is you take over the government.
[03:19:43.044 --> 03:19:49.307]  Now Milton Friedman, of course, from the Rockefeller Chicago School says, government is always the problem.
[03:19:49.307 --> 03:19:50.407]  I don't buy that.
[03:19:50.407 --> 03:19:52.048]  Wall Street, Finance Oligarch.
[03:19:52.048 --> 03:19:54.049]  See, that's only one hand of the elite.
[03:19:54.049 --> 03:19:55.189]  That's only one hand.
[03:19:55.189 --> 03:20:00.952]  They claim they don't want government, but in truth they do want big government to suck off us with corporate welfare.
[03:20:02.122 --> 03:20:04.803]  Again, I don't... I don't... this... this... Hold on, Wes.
[03:20:04.803 --> 03:20:06.004]  We're going to behind the scenes.
[03:20:06.004 --> 03:20:07.685]  I want to abbreviate this.
[03:20:07.685 --> 03:20:09.486]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:20:09.486 --> 03:20:10.186]  Friday, August 29, 2008.
[03:20:10.186 --> 03:20:11.266]  Gold opened at $832 an ounce.
[03:20:11.266 --> 03:20:14.408]  1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $856.80, $422.20 for half ounce, and $211.10 for quarter ounce.
[03:20:14.408 --> 03:20:15.248]  That's $856.80, $422.20, and $211.10.
[03:20:25.273 --> 03:20:31.016]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[03:20:31.016 --> 03:20:34.478]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[03:20:34.478 --> 03:20:35.399]  Bad news for U.S.
[03:20:35.399 --> 03:20:36.039]  currency.
[03:20:36.039 --> 03:20:38.200]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:39.761]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[03:20:39.761 --> 03:20:41.842]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[03:20:41.842 --> 03:20:43.002]  Erosion accelerates.
[03:20:43.002 --> 03:20:45.544]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[03:20:45.544 --> 03:20:47.465]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[03:20:47.465 --> 03:20:49.686]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[03:20:49.966 --> 03:20:54.389]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:20:54.389 --> 03:20:55.369]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:15.236 --> 03:21:16.517]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:16.517 --> 03:21:23.581]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:23.581 --> 03:21:28.704]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[03:21:29.693 --> 03:21:32.454]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:32.454 --> 03:21:39.537]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:39.537 --> 03:21:42.718]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:42.718 --> 03:21:47.780]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:21:48.480 --> 03:21:51.581]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:21:51.581 --> 03:21:57.463]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:21:57.463 --> 03:22:00.544]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:22:00.544 --> 03:22:05.445]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:22:06.966 --> 03:22:23.244]  Imagine if I'd come to you a couple of years ago and said to you, hey, gasoline prices are going to jump to $5 a gallon, and I know a way that we can store several hundred gallons for you, a year or two supply of gasoline, buy it today at $2 a gallon, and when it goes to $5 a gallon, you'll be way ahead of the game!
[03:22:23.244 --> 03:22:26.608]  And you probably at the time would have said to me, you're nuts, get away, you're crazy, go buy
[03:22:27.008 --> 03:22:28.149]  Bye bye!
[03:22:28.149 --> 03:22:32.935]  And okay, fine, now I'm telling you what's happened to gasoline is happening to food!
[03:22:32.935 --> 03:22:35.558]  Your grocery bill is going to skyrocket!
[03:22:35.558 --> 03:22:40.765]  And you can put bulk foods away at less than half the price of your regular grocery bill.
[03:22:40.765 --> 03:22:45.030]  And by tomorrow's standards, that could be at less than a fourth of the price, or an eighth of the price, or a sixteenth of the price.
[03:22:45.270 --> 03:22:45.870]  Hello!
[03:22:45.870 --> 03:22:47.612]  Do you have an investor's brain or not?
[03:22:47.612 --> 03:22:48.632]  Pay attention.
[03:22:48.632 --> 03:22:52.255]  Storable Foods, Bulk Foods from the J. Michael Stevens Company.

[03:23:01.442 --> 03:23:01.622]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:23:06.914 --> 03:23:09.816]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:23:09.816 --> 03:23:14.218]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[03:23:14.218 --> 03:23:17.780]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the Antichrist.
[03:23:17.780 --> 03:23:21.542]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the Antichrist?
[03:23:21.542 --> 03:23:25.484]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:23:25.484 --> 03:23:30.747]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[03:23:30.747 --> 03:23:33.728]  Is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[03:23:33.728 --> 03:23:35.329]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[03:23:35.649 --> 03:23:36.069]  We're good.
[03:23:54.420 --> 03:23:55.883]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.

[03:24:14.031 --> 03:24:19.636]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[03:24:19.636 --> 03:24:25.121]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[03:24:25.121 --> 03:24:30.526]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[03:24:30.526 --> 03:24:34.149]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[03:24:36.058 --> 03:24:39.586]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[03:24:39.586 --> 03:24:41.631]  I take my chances.
[03:24:41.631 --> 03:24:44.377]  I die for a living in the movies and TV.
[03:24:46.954 --> 03:24:57.818]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[03:24:57.818 --> 03:25:05.841]  I might fall from a tall building... He is the author of Obama, The Postmodernist Coup, available at Infowars.com.

[03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:39.191]  Let's get the take of the callers.
[03:25:39.191 --> 03:25:42.432]  Steve, in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:25:42.432 --> 03:25:46.994]  Well, first of all, I want to say I'm talking to two fine men.
[03:25:46.994 --> 03:25:52.936]  Secondly, you guys have been turned around backwards on this situation with Russia.
[03:25:52.936 --> 03:25:55.998]  You didn't even report that last month, it was July 25th,
[03:25:57.285 --> 03:26:03.730]  Putin had threatened the United States with stationing atomic bombers in Cuba.
[03:26:03.730 --> 03:26:06.412]  Look, Putin has been rewarding the U.S.
[03:26:06.412 --> 03:26:07.873]  loyally all through 2007.
[03:26:07.873 --> 03:26:17.101]  At that Munich Verkünden meeting in the springtime, he talked about this neocon striving for the U.S.
[03:26:17.101 --> 03:26:21.504]  I'm going to get to it in a minute, because this is... Steve, you can't listen to four hours every day.
[03:26:21.504 --> 03:26:22.705]  I don't believe it.
[03:26:22.705 --> 03:26:24.066]  I have been saying for the last
[03:26:25.054 --> 03:26:28.235]  However many months since this was said, I talk about that every week.
[03:26:28.235 --> 03:26:47.702]  I talk about their foreign minister saying, if you keep moving weapons systems and troops and training and destabilizing in Poland and in Czech Republic and in Georgia and in Ukraine and in all these areas and in the stands and in moving your military in, we're going to start moving nukes near you.
[03:26:47.702 --> 03:26:50.203]  And I have said that on record.
[03:26:50.203 --> 03:26:51.263]  So go ahead.
[03:26:51.263 --> 03:26:53.884]  Okay, so you're reporting your point of view.
[03:26:54.264 --> 03:27:02.367]  You don't ever mention the people in Eastern and Central Europe talking about a domino theory where the situation is dialectic.
[03:27:02.367 --> 03:27:05.688]  In other words, Russia... Sir, Russia, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
[03:27:05.688 --> 03:27:08.269]  Russia is shrinking, not getting bigger.
[03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:10.070]  It wasn't Russia that snuck attack.
[03:27:10.930 --> 03:27:11.431]  A U.S.
[03:27:11.431 --> 03:27:12.991]  military base last Thursday night.
[03:27:12.991 --> 03:27:15.913]  It was the United States, which isn't our government anymore.
[03:27:15.913 --> 03:27:17.534]  I'm just stating facts.
[03:27:17.534 --> 03:27:21.536]  I can't stand communists or leftism or any of this stuff.
[03:27:21.536 --> 03:27:24.597]  I'm here trying to give you a real geopolitical view into this.
[03:27:24.597 --> 03:27:37.684]  Did Georgia not blow the hell out of an entire city and massacre a bunch of Russian troops and peacekeepers out of a clear blue sky where they've been since 1991 in a ceasefire in two areas that have always been part of Russia?
[03:27:37.684 --> 03:27:38.244]  Ossetia?
[03:27:40.154 --> 03:27:40.995]  Go ahead.
[03:27:40.995 --> 03:27:42.196]  Wait a minute.
[03:27:42.196 --> 03:27:52.143]  If what you say were true, the first thing they would have done was blow that tunnel between Ossetia and North Ossetia, the Rokhi Tunnel.
[03:27:52.143 --> 03:27:54.345]  You can only get tanks or trucks in one of the tunnels.
[03:27:54.345 --> 03:27:54.505]  Hold on.
[03:27:54.505 --> 03:27:56.687]  What are you saying I'm lying about?
[03:27:56.687 --> 03:28:00.650]  Well, what I'm saying is... I mean, Georgia admits they snuck attack Russia.
[03:28:00.650 --> 03:28:01.590]  I doubt that.
[03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:03.712]  There were incidents... Hold on a minute.
[03:28:03.712 --> 03:28:05.053]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:28:05.053 --> 03:28:06.094]  This is too insane.
[03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:12.114]  Okay, I mean, George Tarpley, what do you say to something like this?
[03:28:12.114 --> 03:28:12.995]  Well, this is the U.S.
[03:28:12.995 --> 03:28:21.963]  media line, this is CNN, this is what Bush says, this is what Zalmay Khalilzad says at the United Nations, what McCain says and what Obama says, and it's a big lie.
[03:28:21.963 --> 03:28:23.184]  It's a Goebbels big lie.
[03:28:23.724 --> 03:28:25.605]  The aggressor is Georgia.
[03:28:25.605 --> 03:28:27.526]  You have whatever the status quo was.
[03:28:27.526 --> 03:28:32.989]  The Russian peacekeepers were there under a signed agreement with the Georgian government from 15 years ago.
[03:28:32.989 --> 03:28:41.794]  And let me add, the Georgians had already been taking pot shots at the Russian tribes and citizens, beating people up, killing them in the outlying towns around Ossetia.
[03:28:41.794 --> 03:28:43.735]  Ethnic cleansing, that's where the Russians had to come in in 1992-93.
[03:28:43.735 --> 03:28:51.480]  And then let me expand, they shut the water off to Ossetia a month ago and already had them under siege.
[03:28:52.276 --> 03:28:56.359]  And they basically had a campaign of bombings and assassinations building up to this.
[03:28:56.359 --> 03:28:59.862]  So it's a cynical, orchestrated plan by Georgia.
[03:28:59.862 --> 03:29:02.804]  Now the Russians see it coming and they say, fine, you want to attack?
[03:29:02.804 --> 03:29:04.286]  We'll be ready for you.
[03:29:04.286 --> 03:29:06.968]  And the minute they attack, they took the bridge and the tunnels.
[03:29:06.968 --> 03:29:17.876]  But look, Steve, I would also add, ultimately, beyond all the details, you want to have your children incinerated in a thermonuclear fireball for the sake of that bandit, that little Hitler, Saakashvili?
[03:29:17.876 --> 03:29:18.497]  That's crazy.
[03:29:19.136 --> 03:29:20.317]  Look, I'm gonna come back to you, Steve.
[03:29:20.317 --> 03:29:22.860]  We're gonna skip this break, too, for InfoWars.com listeners.
[03:29:22.860 --> 03:29:24.421]  Gotta go to those streams, folks.
[03:29:24.421 --> 03:29:28.045]  But, I mean, this is completely... Steve, I'm blown away here.
[03:29:28.045 --> 03:29:33.430]  You think I'd go on air and lie to you about Georgia attacking Russia?
[03:29:33.430 --> 03:29:35.812]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[03:29:35.812 --> 03:29:39.236]  I mean, are you serious, Steve?
[03:29:39.236 --> 03:29:41.858]  Bring Steve back up.
[03:29:41.858 --> 03:29:42.459]  Steve, are you there?
[03:29:44.372 --> 03:29:47.515]  Alright, we're gonna go to break and see if we can get Steve Reyes back up on the phone.
[03:29:47.515 --> 03:29:49.276]  Steve, it's just incredible.
[03:29:49.276 --> 03:29:54.360]  I mean, all I do is report the facts here, and I'm living in La La Land.
[03:29:54.360 --> 03:29:55.601]  More of your calls right now.
[03:29:55.601 --> 03:29:57.523]  Stay with us.
[03:29:57.523 --> 03:29:58.924]  We're on the march.
[03:29:58.924 --> 03:30:01.446]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.446 --> 03:30:04.148]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:07.526 --> 03:30:14.315]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:30:14.315 --> 03:30:16.959]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:30:16.959 --> 03:30:18.501]  But who is the enemy?
[03:30:18.501 --> 03:30:19.302]  Bin Laden.
[03:30:19.302 --> 03:30:20.163]  This is his ammo.
[03:30:20.163 --> 03:30:21.665]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:30:21.665 --> 03:30:23.247]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:30:23.647 --> 03:30:30.790]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:31.270]  Some U.S.
[03:30:31.270 --> 03:30:37.633]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:30:37.633 --> 03:30:41.074]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:41.314 --> 03:30:51.602]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:30:51.602 --> 03:30:52.842]  Fabled Enemies.

[03:31:07.290 --> 03:31:10.715]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:31:10.715 --> 03:31:13.018]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:31:13.018 --> 03:31:16.322]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:31:16.322 --> 03:31:23.211]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:31:23.211 --> 03:31:25.334]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:31:25.814 --> 03:31:29.116]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:31:29.116 --> 03:31:33.898]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:31:33.898 --> 03:31:37.820]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[03:31:37.820 --> 03:31:39.460]  Travel less, meet online.

[03:32:09.754 --> 03:32:13.475]  The Army-Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, a memory.
[03:32:13.475 --> 03:32:18.017]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.
[03:32:18.017 --> 03:32:19.638]  MainMilitary.com.
[03:32:19.638 --> 03:32:22.679]  Get hard to find objects like real wool blankets for under 20 bucks.
[03:32:22.999 --> 03:32:23.520]  I think so.
[03:32:48.097 --> 03:32:48.217]  Okay!
[03:33:15.074 --> 03:33:19.118]  We were just talking to Rico on the InfoWars.com behind-the-scenes streams.
[03:33:19.118 --> 03:33:24.264]  You go to InfoWars.com, those specific exclusive streams of the behind-the-scenes.
[03:33:24.264 --> 03:33:26.546]  We are talking to Rico in Toronto.
[03:33:26.546 --> 03:33:36.978]  He brought up how the big foundations fund La Raza, Mecha, the radical black separatist groups, all of this to get us all fighting with each other and so then they can radicalize peaceful groups
[03:33:37.658 --> 03:33:41.342]  So those groups never get true equality or freedom or economic mobility.
[03:33:41.342 --> 03:33:44.606]  They get neutralized, bitter, and filled with hate.
[03:33:44.606 --> 03:33:45.546]  More balkanization.
[03:33:45.546 --> 03:33:46.407]  Webster Darbly.
[03:33:46.407 --> 03:33:50.351]  This is an absolutely critical theme, and you're absolutely right.
[03:33:50.351 --> 03:33:54.836]  If you look, first of all, at Obama, he is more than anything else a product of the foundations.
[03:33:54.836 --> 03:33:57.479]  His mother was an operative for the Ford Foundation.
[03:33:57.979 --> 03:34:10.746]  Obama has worked for the Gamaliel Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, Gun Control, the Woods Fund, the Annenberg Foundation, playing black parents against the black teachers' union.
[03:34:10.746 --> 03:34:15.229]  His friend Bernardine Dorn gets huge money from the MacArthur Foundation.
[03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:25.715]  My research for my next book, which is Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, reveals that the Weathermen were actually founded with a Ford Foundation grant.
[03:34:26.235 --> 03:34:38.661]  Certainly, Floyd McKissick, Stokely Carmichael, the worst firebrands, Rap Brown, these characters, the people who opposed Martin Luther King with their incendiary rhetoric, all foundation-funded.
[03:34:38.661 --> 03:34:43.664]  And as you correctly point out, the worst provocateurs of the Hispanic community, the people who talked
[03:34:44.324 --> 03:34:47.326]  Insanity about, you know, carving up the United States.
[03:34:47.326 --> 03:34:49.147]  They're also foundation-funded.
[03:34:49.147 --> 03:34:54.450]  Obama has friends like Khalidi and a bunch of others.
[03:34:54.450 --> 03:34:59.873]  This is the foundation-funded pro-US wing of the PLO, among the Native Americans.
[03:34:59.873 --> 03:35:03.735]  You got a guy like Ward Churchill, who is essentially in the same corner.
[03:35:04.916 --> 03:35:12.065]  The pervasive activity of these foundations is one of the things that's destroying American society.
[03:35:12.065 --> 03:35:17.171]  Obama is somebody who says he was a community organizer for the Gamaliel Foundation.
[03:35:17.171 --> 03:35:19.854]  What he's really saying is, I was a poverty pimp.
[03:35:20.274 --> 03:35:20.634]  We're good to go.
[03:35:36.386 --> 03:35:39.948]  That is the foundation, trilateral point of view.
[03:35:39.948 --> 03:35:43.370]  You cannot have a president who hates the American people.
[03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:51.135]  In the case of Obama, he does hate the American people, and therefore he's going to attack this austerity program with great gusto.
[03:35:51.135 --> 03:36:01.441]  Unlike Carter, who probably had some Christian scruples about it, Obama will have nothing of the sort, because he's been worshipping in a Ford Foundation church that Reverend Jeremiah Wright
[03:36:01.881 --> 03:36:19.550]  With Dwight Hopkins as an operative of the Ford Foundation, Reverend Otis Moss got through college with the Ford Foundation, this whole James Cone, black liberation theology is again the Ford Foundation Union Theological Seminary school of this stuff, and it is designed to perpetuate racial conflict.
[03:36:20.803 --> 03:36:35.235]  Absolutely, and they fund all these groups, they do it to get everybody at each other's throats, and then the racial tension becomes real, and then it's a dynamo, which just builds up force and strength.
[03:36:35.235 --> 03:36:36.977]  Anything else Rico?
[03:36:36.977 --> 03:36:47.846]  My second point, something you had brought up a couple weeks ago when you were talking about the anthrax letter that the Bush enemy received, I remember reading
[03:36:48.582 --> 03:36:53.143]  Quickly, just the Roman Empire.
[03:36:53.143 --> 03:36:55.184]  And it was the same thing.
[03:36:55.184 --> 03:36:56.164]  It was the same thing.
[03:36:56.164 --> 03:37:04.326]  Cicero, a little bit before Caesar came into power, Cicero was saying how the enemies of Rome need to be dealt with.
[03:37:04.326 --> 03:37:05.406]  I've received letters.
[03:37:05.406 --> 03:37:11.268]  I have letters that say that a couple senators are going to be mass assassinated, so we need to clamp down.
[03:37:11.268 --> 03:37:13.668]  This worked a thousand years ago.
[03:37:13.668 --> 03:37:14.589]  It works again.
[03:37:14.589 --> 03:37:15.669]  It's the same thing.
[03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:17.390]  Like, nothing's changed.
[03:37:28.374 --> 03:37:57.818]  And it's pretty accurate, actually, but you just look at every country and just the thousands of revolutions and all the subterfuge and backstabbing and Machiavellian activity and elites and cloak and dagger, and then somehow they taught the American people the last hundred years that none of that exists, everything's fine, go back to sleep, and if we say anything on this show, it's just start looking around you and realizing that when these elites get out of control and these warlords and these banker warlords start fighting with each other, the oligarchy as Webster calls them,
[03:37:58.699 --> 03:38:04.723]  Uh, when these moneyed, uh, you know, noble interests, uh, start battling with each other, we don't matter in the equation.
[03:38:04.723 --> 03:38:05.784]  We get hurt real bad.
[03:38:06.628 --> 03:38:08.910]  And, uh, this is just a game of chess for them.
[03:38:08.910 --> 03:38:11.272]  I mean, people say, well, why do they want more power?
[03:38:11.272 --> 03:38:12.152]  They're already so rich.
[03:38:12.152 --> 03:38:15.054]  Only body who knows rich people knows they want even more.
[03:38:15.054 --> 03:38:15.795]  They want power.
[03:38:15.795 --> 03:38:16.535]  They want control.
[03:38:16.535 --> 03:38:20.358]  And to deny that there are people that want power and control is to deny history.
[03:38:20.358 --> 03:38:24.841]  Webster, I want to go to calls quickly, but how did we get to the point, do you think, of the average person?
[03:38:24.841 --> 03:38:28.324]  They're now coming out of this delusion and this mesmerized
[03:38:28.744 --> 03:38:31.306]  Well, it's a long process of degradation.
[03:38:31.306 --> 03:38:35.248]  I think that the central question is probably the deindustrialization of the United States initiated by Volcker under trilateral Carter.
[03:38:51.978 --> 03:38:58.544]  And so people are having to work twice as hard just to keep the illusion going, and so they physically are just disconnected saying, I don't care.
[03:39:15.529 --> 03:39:21.334]  There's also that more recently, Obama could not have broken through if the Democratic Party had not been in chaos.
[03:39:21.334 --> 03:39:23.355]  And part of that is Pelosi.
[03:39:23.355 --> 03:39:30.221]  Pelosi came in with the mandate of stopping the Iraq War, and she brought the... And instead she's ruled with an iron fist, saying no.
[03:39:30.221 --> 03:39:35.786]  And what we then had is, as soon as that was in power, then Al Gore comes out of the woodwork with his demagogic
[03:39:36.366 --> 03:39:48.849]  Fake global warming campaign to break the momentum against Bush and against the Iraq war, and then by the end of that year you've got Obama deployed into a chaotic Democratic Party.
[03:39:48.849 --> 03:39:53.910]  Let me stop you because I want to go to Elliot, Jeff, Cliff, and others and DJ.
[03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:59.912]  But before we do that, I wanted to last hour get into the eugenics angle, which you're a real expert on Webster, and I know my stuff on this.
[03:39:59.912 --> 03:40:04.753]  I've read over 20 books on the subject and studied it, and you know even more in some cases than I do.
[03:40:04.753 --> 03:40:05.693]  In a nutshell,
[03:40:07.114 --> 03:40:08.815]  Why do they want to reduce our numbers?
[03:40:08.815 --> 03:40:10.296]  Why do they want to enslave us?
[03:40:10.296 --> 03:40:12.777]  Why do they want to bring feudalism back in?
[03:40:12.777 --> 03:40:16.759]  Is this just the instincts of the Anglo-American feudal lords?
[03:40:16.759 --> 03:40:20.701]  I mean, break that down, what the fake modern environmentalism is.
[03:40:22.378 --> 03:40:25.121]  Well, one is the population side.
[03:40:25.121 --> 03:40:29.006]  The oligarchy always argues that there are two main problems in the world.
[03:40:29.006 --> 03:40:33.972]  One is overpopulation, the other is industrial pollution in some form.
[03:40:33.972 --> 03:40:40.239]  To be an oligarch means that you've got to hate the majority of humanity by thinking that you're better off than they were.
[03:40:40.239 --> 03:40:41.100]  You can go back to
[03:40:41.821 --> 03:40:47.845]  The works of Hesiod in ancient Greece, pretty much the beginning of the, you know, sort of archaic Greek literature.
[03:40:47.845 --> 03:40:49.186]  Plato as well.
[03:40:49.186 --> 03:40:53.329]  The reason for the Trojan War was that there were too many people.
[03:40:53.329 --> 03:41:00.654]  Too many people were oppressing the breast of Mother Earth, and therefore we had to have the Trojan War to kill off a lot of them.
[03:41:00.654 --> 03:41:06.057]  In terms of the global warming, I don't need a climatologist to say that this is a fraud.
[03:41:06.057 --> 03:41:09.960]  As a historian, I can look back to the medieval warm period, 1100-1200,
[03:41:11.821 --> 03:41:22.750]  When you have grapes growing in England, grapes growing in... What about Hyperion Maxim 8,000 years ago, which brought us into the Bronze Age and the first city-states?
[03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:25.052]  I mean, it was 10 degrees hotter on average then.
[03:41:25.052 --> 03:41:27.034]  They have the high scores, there's no doubt in it.
[03:41:27.034 --> 03:41:32.158]  We are well within the band of fluctuation of historical memory.
[03:41:32.158 --> 03:41:34.660]  The other one, of course, is we have a little Ice Age.
[03:41:35.180 --> 03:41:42.864]  Around 1600 to 1625, which corresponds to the Sperre Minimum and the Maunder Minimum in the Sunspot Cycle.
[03:41:42.864 --> 03:41:45.945]  It is basically determined by solar activity.
[03:41:45.945 --> 03:41:49.947]  That's at least the major input, not by human activity at all.
[03:41:49.947 --> 03:41:56.711]  And in that Little Ice Age, you had the ports of Northern Europe, the ports of Germany and the Netherlands were flooded with ice, icebergs.
[03:41:57.191 --> 03:42:03.638]  So, the idea of being a climatologist means you're a charlatan and a fraud because it's a discipline.
[03:42:03.638 --> 03:42:05.100]  It's not meteorology.
[03:42:05.100 --> 03:42:06.582]  It's not oceanography.
[03:42:06.582 --> 03:42:08.204]  It's not any science.
[03:42:08.204 --> 03:42:09.345]  It's not history.
[03:42:09.345 --> 03:42:11.848]  It's a fake science invented by Al Gore.
[03:42:12.348 --> 03:42:16.610]  And all during the Clinton years, if you didn't agree with Al Gore, you would be fired.
[03:42:16.610 --> 03:42:17.871]  You would be re-invented.
[03:42:17.871 --> 03:42:19.111]  He claims he invented the internet too.
[03:42:19.111 --> 03:42:22.113]  He certainly is the pimp pusher of it.
[03:42:22.113 --> 03:42:28.496]  But the Club of Rome in the early 60s said they would use threat of a fake Ice Age or global warming to bring in global taxes.
[03:42:28.496 --> 03:42:32.618]  And remember, Aurelio Pichet, the co-founder, was an old fascist.
[03:42:33.158 --> 03:42:38.481]  And the other one was Alexander King, who once admitted that the purpose of this was genocide in the third world.
[03:42:38.481 --> 03:42:43.764]  He said, you know, the reason we preach this, after all, is to block development of the third world.
[03:42:43.764 --> 03:42:44.865]  That is still the same.
[03:42:44.865 --> 03:42:50.748]  And that's in the British Commission on Population, 44 to 49, which was rolled into State Department Memorandum 200.
[03:42:51.608 --> 03:43:04.052]  Yes, and beyond the 200, remember that this was all institutionalized under Carter, under Muskie, as Global 2000 and Global Futures under Brzezinski, Trilateral, Rockefeller auspices.
[03:43:04.052 --> 03:43:11.434]  So you basically got Kissinger as a puppet of Nelson Rockefeller, Brzezinski as a puppet of David Rockefeller, and that's pretty much the way the thing is run.
[03:43:14.904 --> 03:43:24.253]  Well, then, you know, the idea of having a world population reduction, i.e., a military genocide, built into the U.S.
[03:43:24.253 --> 03:43:29.038]  foreign policy is this Global 2000, Global Futures, and then what do they do?
[03:43:29.038 --> 03:43:31.080]  They turn around and implement that by supporting
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:33.722]  Paul Pott, who goes very far, right?
[03:43:33.722 --> 03:43:36.744]  He's the champion in terms of proportional genocide.
[03:43:36.744 --> 03:43:41.828]  I think he manages to kill 30 to 40 percent of the Cambodian population.
[03:43:41.828 --> 03:43:47.912]  And Khomeini, who aborts the entire industrialization process of Iran.
[03:43:47.912 --> 03:43:52.536]  What they're trying to show is that third world populations can be organized against themselves
[03:43:53.116 --> 03:43:54.437]  Let's go to Elliot in Ohio.
[03:43:54.437 --> 03:43:55.098]  You're on the air.
[03:43:55.098 --> 03:43:56.058]  No, I'm afraid I haven't.
[03:43:56.058 --> 03:43:56.399]  Go ahead.
[03:44:21.563 --> 03:44:25.366]  I was on Jordan Maxwell's site and then I went to one of his links.
[03:44:25.366 --> 03:44:36.975]  In 1983, these two guys, research expert David Dodge and former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn, they were in the Belfast Library on the coast of Maine.
[03:44:36.975 --> 03:44:38.917]  They found a constitution from 1825.
[03:44:41.383 --> 03:44:46.006]  And, uh, there was actually a missing- there's a missing 13th Amendment in our Constitution.
[03:44:46.006 --> 03:44:54.451]  It was ratified in 1819, has not been repealed, and it's, uh, titled- There were more than 30 original broadsheets made, and quite a few of them are still around.
[03:44:54.451 --> 03:44:58.314]  I- I, uh, I've heard of- well, go ahead.
[03:44:58.314 --> 03:45:00.975]  Well, I mean, like, it's, uh, titled of nobility and honor.
[03:45:00.975 --> 03:45:06.899]  It says, if any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor,
[03:45:07.438 --> 03:45:23.892]  ...or shall, without consent of Congress, accept and retain any present pension, office, or emolument... Yeah, speak of the devil, uh, John, I sent you that clip, uh, from C-SPAN of, uh, former Secretary of State Colin Powell telling the reporter that he's a night commander, order of the bath.
[03:45:23.892 --> 03:45:25.653]  Will you cue that up, please?
[03:45:25.653 --> 03:45:25.974]  Thank you.
[03:45:25.974 --> 03:45:28.816]  Go ahead, um, Elliot.
[03:45:28.816 --> 03:45:35.522]  ...retain any present pension, office, or emolument of any kind, whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power
[03:45:36.058 --> 03:45:38.962]  That person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States.
[03:45:38.962 --> 03:45:42.467]  Yes, I'm saying you can't be a foreign agent, basically, which makes sense.
[03:45:42.467 --> 03:45:44.530]  If I may, I have a question.
[03:45:44.530 --> 03:45:46.873]  Now I know what you're talking about, and it does exist.
[03:45:46.873 --> 03:45:51.439]  And I wrote about this in 1996 in Executive Intelligence Review.
[03:45:51.439 --> 03:45:52.621]  You might find it on the Internet.
[03:45:53.161 --> 03:45:54.322]  An article that says U.S.
[03:45:54.322 --> 03:46:01.808]  Constitution bars Powell from the presidency because he had become this British nobleman.
[03:46:01.808 --> 03:46:02.529]  The U.S.
[03:46:02.529 --> 03:46:08.194]  Constitution right now says you cannot hold an office of profit and trust under the United States.
[03:46:08.194 --> 03:46:13.538]  In other words, you can't be in the executive branch or the Supreme Court if you accept the title of nobility.
[03:46:13.538 --> 03:46:18.302]  And that plays into the Logan Act as in the code blocking that.
[03:46:18.602 --> 03:46:19.963]  But this one goes further.
[03:46:19.963 --> 03:46:23.145]  It says, if you accept such a title of nobility, you cease to be a citizen.
[03:46:23.145 --> 03:46:24.186]  Yes, it's currently in there.
[03:46:24.186 --> 03:46:24.787]  That's why I have it.
[03:46:24.787 --> 03:46:26.888]  I was ready to attack Rudy.
[03:46:26.888 --> 03:46:33.153]  Sir Rudy Giuliani would have been coming under attack from me on this if he had gotten the Republican nomination.
[03:46:33.153 --> 03:46:34.314]  Yes, Elliot, that is legitimate.
[03:46:34.314 --> 03:46:35.234]  You refresh our memory.
[03:46:35.234 --> 03:46:35.575]  Thank you.
[03:46:35.575 --> 03:46:39.918]  And speaking of Powell and the nobility, here is the audio clip right now.
[03:46:39.918 --> 03:46:43.841]  And also the Knight Commander of the Order of the Masters.
[03:46:43.841 --> 03:46:46.543]  Knight Commander of the Order of the Masters.
[03:46:47.837 --> 03:46:49.559]  We have the video clip up on InfoWars.com.
[03:46:49.559 --> 03:46:54.966]  We put it up there when Queen Elizabeth II was here in town.
[03:47:08.161 --> 03:47:08.661]  Hello?
[03:47:08.661 --> 03:47:09.562]  Yeah, how you doing today?
[03:47:09.562 --> 03:47:12.283]  Enjoying your show, by the way, also.
[03:47:39.082 --> 03:47:43.605]  My question is this, Mr. Tarr, please.
[03:47:43.605 --> 03:48:06.379]  I read a report several months ago here where China sent word to Illuminati operatives that if they tried to indeed, you know, make any type of move toward China, and it's, shall I say, their friends, which will be Russia and Iran via their friendship pacts they have and old obligation deals, what will be the next move for the Illuminati now that
[03:48:07.495 --> 03:48:12.617]  Bush, more or less, has gotten punched in the mouth by Putin over this Georgia fiasco.
[03:48:12.617 --> 03:48:23.200]  And the fact that China said, plainly stated that any aggression made toward China and the people around the Illuminati would be assassinated.
[03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:25.701]  Yeah, I mean, there's two questions there.
[03:48:25.701 --> 03:48:33.864]  What do you think of Benjamin Fulford, the former Forbes writer who meets with Rockefeller on video, and says he's been told by the Asian elite, the mafia,
[03:48:34.284 --> 03:48:42.530]  That they know about the Population Reduction Plan and the Bioweapon Attack Plan that Cheney talks about, the PNAC documents, September 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:44.231]  So, I mean, A, what do you think of that?
[03:48:44.231 --> 03:48:51.436]  And then, B, again, kind of a recap of why does this, what does this do now that this didn't go well in Georgia?
[03:48:52.256 --> 03:48:53.377]  Let me do it the other way.
[03:48:53.377 --> 03:48:58.402]  I don't use this concept of Illuminati because I think this is just pure confusion.
[03:48:58.402 --> 03:49:04.809]  The notion that a society founded in Bavaria runs the world, in my view, is just absurd.
[03:49:04.809 --> 03:49:07.712]  What you're dealing with is the City of London, British,
[03:49:08.372 --> 03:49:10.913]  And Wall Street, uh, the U.S.
[03:49:10.913 --> 03:49:12.734]  That's the operative unit.
[03:49:12.734 --> 03:49:18.597]  And these terms like New World Order and Illuminati, I think, uh, they contribute to confusion rather than clarity.
[03:49:18.597 --> 03:49:22.259]  Even though all these presidents use them and, and, and, and hail it and swear sovereignty.
[03:49:22.259 --> 03:49:25.661]  Yeah, look, the origin of this Illuminati, though, is British intelligence.
[03:49:25.661 --> 03:49:25.921]  I know.
[03:49:25.921 --> 03:49:29.603]  And they're here to say, oh, we're not the main enemy in the world.
[03:49:29.603 --> 03:49:31.664]  Those Bavarians are the main enemy.
[03:49:31.664 --> 03:49:32.884]  This is just crazy.
[03:49:32.884 --> 03:49:34.265]  Let me write this down for you, Webster.
[03:49:34.845 --> 03:49:36.906]  There is an element to all of this.
[03:49:36.906 --> 03:49:39.246]  The elites are obsessed with the occult.
[03:49:39.246 --> 03:49:39.866]  Let me finish.
[03:49:39.866 --> 03:49:43.527]  The British system is Masonic.
[03:49:43.527 --> 03:49:45.048]  And they really are into this.
[03:49:45.048 --> 03:49:48.149]  And they really do govern a lot of what they do according to it.
[03:49:48.149 --> 03:49:48.849]  Sure.
[03:49:48.849 --> 03:49:55.230]  But now you're talking the Scottish Rite Freemasons of London and, you know, God knows other institutions that they have.
[03:49:55.230 --> 03:49:57.431]  The Club of the Isles and all sorts of other things.
[03:49:57.851 --> 03:50:01.152]  But again, this Bavarian thing, this is the crazy part.
[03:50:01.152 --> 03:50:03.552]  This is what the British themselves put out to say.
[03:50:03.552 --> 03:50:04.972]  Well, that was just one agent.
[03:50:04.972 --> 03:50:07.933]  That was Wise Hop and the guy gets struck by lightning.
[03:50:07.933 --> 03:50:09.333]  Thank you so much.
[03:50:09.333 --> 03:50:11.034]  Wait, let's do the Fulford part.
[03:50:11.034 --> 03:50:14.454]  There is a history of secret societies in China.
[03:50:14.454 --> 03:50:26.317]  For example, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, when he wanted to do the Chinese Revolution in 1911, turned to something called the Red Door Society, the Hongmen Society.
[03:50:26.317 --> 03:50:26.717]  However,
[03:50:27.486 --> 03:50:32.909]  I think this stuff now is, you have to look at this with tremendous skepticism, and here's why.
[03:50:32.909 --> 03:50:42.553]  Suppose we have the Turkmen Islamic Party setting off some stunt in Beijing now for the Olympics.
[03:50:42.553 --> 03:50:52.738]  If that's terrorism, either Mexico City 68 or Munich 72 style, you're going to have a wave of international sympathy with China.
[03:50:53.507 --> 03:50:59.475]  Suppose now the Anglo-Americans have come up with a dialectical or two-phase false flag.
[03:50:59.475 --> 03:50:59.895]  Hold on.
[03:50:59.895 --> 03:51:05.502]  We're going to do three minutes behind the scenes exclusively at the InfoWars.com streams and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:51:05.502 --> 03:51:05.923]  Stay with us.
[03:51:09.156 --> 03:51:14.797]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:51:14.797 --> 03:51:17.458]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[03:51:17.458 --> 03:51:21.119]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[03:51:21.119 --> 03:51:32.541]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.

[03:51:35.982 --> 03:51:37.602]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment
[03:51:37.642 --> 03:51:38.122]  That's right.
[03:52:07.376 --> 03:52:20.532]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:52:20.532 --> 03:52:24.357]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[03:52:24.677 --> 03:52:31.559]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:52:31.559 --> 03:52:34.980]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:52:34.980 --> 03:52:36.741]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:52:36.741 --> 03:52:42.882]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:52:51.545 --> 03:52:51.965]  We're good.
[03:53:07.020 --> 03:53:13.127]  The pharmaceutical recalls of such products as Vioxx and Celebrex have left many searching for safer options.
[03:53:13.127 --> 03:53:21.096]  Nature's Renewal Supreme Joint Formula provides glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate to regenerate healthy cartilage.
[03:53:21.096 --> 03:53:26.823]  Hyaluronic acid, a vital component for your soft connective tissue and natural body lubricants of your joints,
[03:53:27.023 --> 03:53:27.563]  I think so.
[03:53:48.370 --> 03:53:49.010]  See you next time!
[03:54:14.170 --> 03:54:16.012]  Final segment and worldwide transmission.

[03:54:19.256 --> 03:54:20.037]  InfoWars.com.

[03:54:24.362 --> 03:54:26.444]  We'll be back live tomorrow.
[03:54:26.444 --> 03:54:28.547]  Before we jam in, a few final calls for Webster Tarpley.
[03:54:28.547 --> 03:54:30.369]  I want to tell you about a fine sponsor.
[03:54:30.369 --> 03:54:33.833]  A Cola Blue Atmosphere Water Generator.
[03:54:34.835 --> 03:54:35.436]  We're good to go.
[03:54:52.250 --> 03:54:56.032]  At least two and a half gallons, even in the worst deserts, with the lowest humidity.
[03:54:56.032 --> 03:54:57.072]  Just an amazing system.
[03:54:57.072 --> 03:54:58.833]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[03:54:58.833 --> 03:55:01.034]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:55:01.034 --> 03:55:03.234]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:55:03.234 --> 03:55:06.175]  Natural pH.
[03:55:06.175 --> 03:55:08.016]  Give them a call.
[03:55:08.016 --> 03:55:08.536]  1-866-585-4044.

[03:55:12.478 --> 03:55:14.859]  Big banner on Infowars.com.
[03:55:14.859 --> 03:55:14.899]  866-585-4044.
[03:55:18.564 --> 03:55:21.846]  Okay, let's jam in quickly here.
[03:55:21.846 --> 03:55:23.727]  Let's jam in.
[03:55:23.727 --> 03:55:25.507]  Jeff in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:55:25.507 --> 03:55:27.989]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:55:27.989 --> 03:55:29.689]  First time caller, but a long time listener.
[03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:32.651]  I'll be brief since I know you're short on time.
[03:55:32.651 --> 03:55:36.352]  This does relate to what you've been talking about.
[03:55:36.352 --> 03:55:38.253]  I read a link this morning.
[03:55:38.253 --> 03:55:40.014]  It was from the Financial Times of London.
[03:55:40.014 --> 03:55:41.555]  It was written by Peter Garnham.
[03:55:42.361 --> 03:55:45.704]  And it's just a couple sentences long.
[03:55:45.704 --> 03:55:54.192]  Ulrich Leutmann, a commerce bag, said in a note that he expected the dollar to rise, quote, like a phoenix, quote-unquote.
[03:55:54.192 --> 03:56:00.278]  And he also said that in a very short period of time, quote-unquote, sentiment turned by 180 degrees.
[03:56:00.278 --> 03:56:02.060]  The market now believes that the U.S.
[03:56:02.060 --> 03:56:03.161]  economy once again
[03:56:03.701 --> 03:56:06.362]  We'll be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly.
[03:56:06.362 --> 03:56:08.203]  But they've said this three times in the last year.
[03:56:08.203 --> 03:56:11.324]  It always goes up and then further down the next time.
[03:56:11.324 --> 03:56:13.585]  I hope it goes up and they can artificially do it.
[03:56:13.585 --> 03:56:17.627]  But all the real market fundamentals show the dollar has been devalued.
[03:56:17.627 --> 03:56:18.927]  They keep printing it.
[03:56:18.927 --> 03:56:24.549]  You have this debt, liquidity, hundreds of billions a month being pumped into financial institutions.
[03:56:24.549 --> 03:56:25.770]  Webster, what do you see happening?
[03:56:26.050 --> 03:56:30.434]  The main thing you have is a violent contraction of employment and production.
[03:56:30.434 --> 03:56:32.035]  Detroit is collapsing.
[03:56:32.035 --> 03:56:33.716]  The big three automakers are collapsing.
[03:56:33.716 --> 03:56:36.238]  Their subcontractors are collapsing.
[03:56:36.238 --> 03:56:41.343]  Generally speaking, manufacturing employment in this country is really on its last legs.
[03:56:41.343 --> 03:56:50.010]  So this contraction, which is expressed in growing unemployment and growing unreported unemployment, those who have given up in despair,
[03:56:50.871 --> 03:56:54.877]  Uh, we'd have to look at things like freight car loadings and truck loadings.
[03:56:54.877 --> 03:56:57.922]  Real, tangible, physical economic indices.
[03:56:57.922 --> 03:57:02.148]  And you will see that this economy is approaching the point of thermodynamic breakdown.
[03:57:02.148 --> 03:57:03.791]  And they're telling us everything's wonderful!
[03:57:04.632 --> 03:57:06.994]  After that, the financial panic will happen.
[03:57:06.994 --> 03:57:08.015]  They put these stories out.
[03:57:08.015 --> 03:57:13.800]  The Plunge Protection Team, of course, as everybody knows, props them up with the help of Helicopter Ben Bernanke.
[03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:23.688]  They've now got the entire Wall Street, be it JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman, and Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, and Merrill, and UBS.
[03:57:24.228 --> 03:57:25.549]  All of them are on life support.
[03:57:25.549 --> 03:57:29.932]  They're all getting huge injections of Federal Reserve liquidity.
[03:57:29.932 --> 03:57:36.356]  And the question is, you know, how long before that becomes generalized hyperinflation on the German 1923 model.
[03:57:36.356 --> 03:57:37.397]  Yeah, we're out of time.
[03:57:37.397 --> 03:57:38.398]  We're out of time.
[03:57:38.398 --> 03:57:39.098]  We're out of time.
[03:57:39.098 --> 03:57:40.379]  Sorry to DJ and Matt.
[03:57:40.379 --> 03:57:40.939]  Call back tomorrow.
[03:57:40.939 --> 03:57:42.100]  I'll put you up first.
[03:57:42.100 --> 03:57:43.521]  Our next time, Tarbley's on.
[03:57:43.521 --> 03:57:45.102]  Webster, thank you for spending time with us.
[03:57:45.102 --> 03:57:46.463]  This is Brook, as Obama.
[03:57:46.463 --> 03:57:46.783]  You bet.
[03:57:46.783 --> 03:57:49.705]  The Postmodern Coup, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:49.705 --> 03:57:50.646]  Take care, Webster.
[03:57:50.646 --> 03:57:50.986]  Bye-bye.
[03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:55.593]  An amazing two-hour, 45-minute interview with Webster Tarbley.
[03:57:55.593 --> 03:57:58.935]  I want to tell you that the new film, Fabled Enemies, I just came out with Truth Rising.
[03:57:58.935 --> 03:58:00.997]  Well, we're accelerating our info war.
[03:58:00.997 --> 03:58:02.438]  Burmese's new film made right here.
[03:58:02.438 --> 03:58:03.318]  I produced it.
[03:58:03.318 --> 03:58:06.921]  Fabled Enemies, you can start pre-ordering that Thursday or Friday.
[03:58:06.921 --> 03:58:08.102]  It'll be up on the shopping cart.
[03:58:08.102 --> 03:58:09.262]  You get the DVD first.
[03:58:09.262 --> 03:58:11.024]  It ships out September 1st.
[03:58:11.024 --> 03:58:11.464]  Wink, wink.
[03:58:11.464 --> 03:58:12.545]  Maybe a little bit early.
[03:58:12.545 --> 03:58:15.226]  It'll be on PrisonPlanet.tv September 1st.
[03:58:15.226 --> 03:58:15.807]  Well, guess what?
[03:58:16.917 --> 03:58:24.763]  You can watch the first trailer for Fabled Enemies, Berman's new film, up at the top right-hand corner of PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:24.763 --> 03:58:25.943]  Please spread that virally.
[03:58:25.943 --> 03:58:36.991]  I'm gonna announce tomorrow who the winner of the first contest is, another on the 19th, a bigger one, for the InfoWarsPrisonPlanet.com contest.
[03:58:36.991 --> 03:58:39.933]  Listen, huge show today, Paul Kirk Roberts prefers the show.
[03:58:39.933 --> 03:58:43.376]  Martial law news in the U.S., out of Arkansas.
[03:58:43.376 --> 03:58:46.358]  You'll hear that at the start of the show right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:49.201 --> 03:58:51.803]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:51.803 --> 03:58:57.767]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:57.767 --> 03:59:04.532]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:59:04.532 --> 03:59:07.174]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:59:07.174 --> 03:59:08.716]  But who is the enemy?
[03:59:08.716 --> 03:59:09.536]  Bin Laden.
[03:59:09.536 --> 03:59:10.357]  This is his ammo.
[03:59:10.357 --> 03:59:11.898]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:59:11.898 --> 03:59:13.139]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:59:13.859 --> 03:59:21.025]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:59:21.025 --> 03:59:21.505]  Some U.S.
[03:59:21.505 --> 03:59:27.850]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:59:27.850 --> 03:59:31.313]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:59:31.533 --> 03:59:41.817]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:59:41.817 --> 03:59:43.057]  Fabled Enemies.
[03:59:43.057 --> 03:59:50.800]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:59:50.800 --> 03:59:54.161]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
