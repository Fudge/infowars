[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  They will not force us
[00:08.000 --> 00:16.000]  They will stop degrading us
[00:16.000 --> 00:23.000]  They will not control us
[00:23.000 --> 00:31.000]  We will be victorious
[00:31.000 --> 00:41.000]  We will be victorious against the scientific dictatorship owned and run by the private offshore banks that have created a worldwide Ponzi scheme of fraud.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  They have bought off our countrymen, they have bought off tens of millions of people to serve their system,
[00:46.000 --> 00:57.000]  but if we are able to expose the larger blueprint of global enslavement, this new world order can be brought down and will be brought down.
[00:57.000 --> 01:06.000]  Thank you for joining us. We are live. It is April 27th, 2010 on this Tuesday edition, and we're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[01:06.000 --> 01:27.000]  William Gehm is coming on. He's the head of AliPak. He came out, of course, last Friday in a speech, and he talked about the fact that, reportedly, Senator Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual and that he's being blackmailed,
[01:27.000 --> 01:36.000]  or he's concerned that he's being blackmailed to support carbon taxes, open borders, amnesty, banker bailout takeovers, and much more.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  I mean, why would Graham be engaging in political suicide in his state when everything he's doing is unconstitutional and unpopular if he's not being blackmailed?
[01:45.000 --> 01:58.000]  I don't know if this is true or not. I'm going to challenge Mr. Gehm on it, but the issue is not about Mr. Graham's sexuality or what he does in his private time, the unmarried senator.
[01:58.000 --> 02:11.000]  The issue is that we know countless pedophile scandals, sex scandals, you name it, have been used in the Congress, in the House and Senate, to blackmail and to control politicians.
[02:11.000 --> 02:23.000]  And you really don't get into these upper reaches of power unless you are compromised. So that's coming up in two hours today on this live Tuesday edition.
[02:23.000 --> 02:32.000]  We are also going to get into anti-gun activity going on. Two Chicago state reps say bring in the National Guard.
[02:32.000 --> 02:46.000]  This is out of the Chicago Tribune and expanding on that. Illinois, to declare disarm lawful citizens week with a whole bunch of new bills they've introduced.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  Remember Governor Blagojevich, now disgraced over a year ago, he came out.
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  We played part of the press conference here and called for troops to go door to door in the state of Illinois disarming people.
[02:58.000 --> 03:05.000]  And this is all being done under federal funding and federal auspices. So we'll be talking about that some today.
[03:05.000 --> 03:17.000]  Also, Ron Paul last Friday took to the House floor, will be playing part of that speech coming up and said Iran's sanctions are an act of war under international law and under federal law.
[03:17.000 --> 03:25.000]  And Ron Paul goes over that, the congressman from Texas, but I thought I'd also go to the Christian Science Monitor and many other mainstream news reports.
[03:25.000 --> 03:35.000]  This isn't just Ron Paul saying this, by the rules of war, this is an illegal act of war, sanctions on Iran's gasoline imports, that's war talk.
[03:35.000 --> 03:47.000]  So that's the Christian Science Monitor, not just Ron Paul. Here's Asia Times, U.S. warms to strike on Iran, nuclear strike on Iran.
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  That's what they're saying. They're saying, oh, we have a new policy. We're not going to have preemptive nuclear strike. That itself is a new policy.
[03:54.000 --> 04:08.000]  We never had a first strike policy until Bush changed it four years ago with the so-called usable nukes, the supposed smaller nukes, which are even worse because they don't air flash at a thousand feet.
[04:08.000 --> 04:20.000]  They go into bunkers, they go into the ground and then combine with different metals and isotopes, creating some of the most deadly radioactive clouds known to man.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  But the point is they're getting ready and openly discussing, the Pentagon has discussed, using nukes preemptively.
[04:27.000 --> 04:39.000]  And so Obama's saying, with double speak, oh, we have a new policy. We don't preemptively nuke countries unless you're Iran.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  And so they're getting ready for that crime. And the American people, all the banks are robbing them blind.
[04:45.000 --> 04:55.000]  Some will go to the liquor store and order pizza and go sit in front of the TV feeling manly as mushroom clouds detonate all across Persia.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  Of course, the elite think of you as scum just as they think of the Iranians as scum.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  You may be arrested and your subject to other police action.
[05:05.000 --> 05:16.000]  But the truth is that the United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[05:29.000 --> 05:36.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[05:53.000 --> 06:05.000]  You may be arrested and your subject to other police action.
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[06:11.000 --> 06:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[06:13.000 --> 06:19.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[06:19.000 --> 06:26.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  It felt like my heart was pounding. It made me feel breathless.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself. Nothing did anything.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  Heart and body extract is very powerful, very effective and works quickly.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered heart and body extract.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  I noticed a difference quickly within days.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.

[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, Tuesday, the 27th day of April 2010.
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  We've had MSNBC down here, we've had CNN, and we had PBS last week.
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  Today and tomorrow we have Nightline and ABC World News tonight here.
[08:39.000 --> 08:54.000]  I tell you, I'm just waiting with bated breath to see how they spin this or how they present the information we cover here on the syndicated radio broadcast.
[08:54.000 --> 09:03.000]  We want to welcome the nice folks, certainly nice personnel from Nightline and ABC News here with us today.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  I'm told it's for both reports, and we're going to be opening the phones up coming up later in this hour.
[09:12.000 --> 09:25.000]  They're not open yet, but when we do open the phones, it's 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[09:25.000 --> 09:36.000]  Okay, we're going to talk about what's happened in Arizona and how that's being spun and how the mainstream media and the Obama administration are trying to invoke the race card.
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  Yet again, I want to talk about the true nature of what's really happening.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  The country is trying to survive.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  The country is starting to wake up.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  The NAFTA and GATT and open borders have destroyed our standard of living, and that's the global estate plan.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  To lower the standard of living of the West, not to raise the standard of living of the third and developing world.
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  Mexico has been in full collapse the last five years.
[10:02.000 --> 10:20.000]  Now it's an open collapse, and the federal government's preparing as millions more refugees try to pour across to bring them in and to put them on welfare and then give them voting rights to be used as a political weapon to pass more taxes and disarm the American people.
[10:20.000 --> 10:32.000]  Now, if we didn't have all this welfare that was bankrupting the nation, if we weren't putting so many of these illegals on welfare, if they were brought to this country and educated about the Constitution Bill of Rights,
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  they would go to the ballot box and vote for the Second Amendment national sovereignty, I probably wouldn't be so concerned.
[10:37.000 --> 10:52.000]  But instead, the big government system controlled by the offshore central banks is forging the giant illegal immigrant population into a political army to help bring this nation into the new world order.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  And that's the stated plan.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  We're going to go over some of that today.
[10:59.000 --> 11:08.000]  Also, we have the big banks getting in more and more trouble.
[11:08.000 --> 11:17.000]  We have Goldman Sachs and others testifying before Congress today saying that they basically didn't do anything wrong.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  We're going to be going over that.
[11:21.000 --> 11:30.000]  And then I'm going to continue with the overall agenda for the planetary government and that is population reduction, forced population control.
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  Here's one out of Sky Television news out of England trying to sterilize 10,000 people forcibly in one town to curb births.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  And that dovetails with CNN on Earth Day last week.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  How green is your love life?
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  And they recommend having a one child policy in the United States to implement that.
[11:51.000 --> 12:02.000]  So just hardcore draconian police state being proposed here in the United States, very authoritarian, very, very oppressive.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  And we're going to be talking about some of that information today.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  I wanted to go ahead now before I get into the banking, before we get into what's happening in Arizona,
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  and before our guest judges coming up in about an hour and 45 minutes dealing with Lindsey Graham, the senator, is he being blackmailed?
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  Before we do that, let's go ahead and get into the war front here.
[12:28.000 --> 12:40.000]  The federal government and the willing, accomplice, mainstream dinosaur media knowingly went along with the lie that Saddam Hussein had gotten yellow cake uranium from Niger, Africa,
[12:40.000 --> 12:49.000]  and that they could launch ICBMs that could hit England within 45 minutes carrying chemical and biological weapons.
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  And of course it came out on the White House memo and the Downing Street memo, and there were federal investigations and British investigations over who released these.
[12:57.000 --> 13:09.000]  They don't deny, these are real documents, that the government premeditatedly, in consultation with the British government, lied to the public and said we must fix the intelligence around WMDs.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  We know they're not there, but we're going to war.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  That is the set policy.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  And we're seeing a repeat of this now with Iran.
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  Iran has a lot of oil, but they don't have the refining capacity to supply even half their needs.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  They import most of their refined gasoline.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  They mainly sell unrefined crude oil.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  And they've said we want peaceful nuclear reactors built by the Russians with some help of the French.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  These have no weapons capabilities.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  The uranium isn't anywhere near the enrichment they need.
[13:41.000 --> 13:58.000]  And they've signed on to the treaties and they follow the treaties, and they've said that we want to be able to be energy self-sufficient, like France or Japan, who are some of the more energy self-sufficient groups out there because they're mainly nuclear power.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  And they've been told, no, you cannot build peaceful reactors.
[14:02.000 --> 14:12.000]  And now the United States, England, and Israel are moving to put crippling sanctions on Iran.
[14:12.000 --> 14:21.000]  When we come back from break, I'm going to play a clip of Ron Paul from C-SPAN where he talks about the crippling sanctions.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  U.S. threatens Iran with all options.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  Washington says all options are on the table.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  That's a quote in dealing with Tehran and a veiled threat which refers to the new U.S. nuclear policy.
[14:31.000 --> 14:40.000]  During a Sunday address to attendees of the Pentagon briefing, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates touched on newly crafted nuclear posture review, MPR,
[14:40.000 --> 14:49.000]  under which the Obama administration promises not to use nuclear weapons against states that do not possess nuclear warheads with the exemption of Iran.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  Of course, the policy had always been until Bush got in that they would not use nukes preemptively.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  We always had mutually assured destruction.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Whoever fires first gets blasted.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  Now they've changed that.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  So Obama's kind of going back a half step saying, well, we won't use this against Russia or China or anybody else, but we may use it against Iran.
[15:10.000 --> 15:21.000]  Gates asserted that the 22,000 word nuclear posture review does not apply to countries such as Iran and North Korea because they belong to certain category of states that Washington will never limit its options against.
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  Defense Secretary further added that the Obama administration is taking measures to apply a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  However, he asserted the administration is not ready to fully relinquish its right to preemptive strikes.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  The MPR was met with instant condemnation in Iran.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  Now continuing, what did the Christian Science Monitor have to say about this?
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  The exemption on Iran's gasoline imports, that's war talk.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  And that is an act of war.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  The oldest form of total war is siege.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  You go into a city state before they really had nations.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  And you would encircle them.
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  You would block up their aquifers, their water supplies.
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.000]  Armies with catapult, plague-ridden corpses over the castle wall.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  Saboteurs would infiltrate the city before the siege began and poison water supplies.
[16:24.000 --> 16:36.000]  So cutting off resources, cutting off food, cutting off water, cutting off gasoline, cutting off medicines is one of the oldest forms of siege.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  Iraq was put under siege from 1990 until the invasion in 2003.
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  So 13 plus years.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  And of course we saw lots of propaganda pieces about how Saddam was using the money for himself.
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  Regardless, the point is this was done through the sanctions.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  And of course that entire time there were waivers for Halliburton and others to still do business there.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  So U.S.-based corporations also made great profits out of selective enforcement on the rules.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  But under the rules of war, under international law, this is war.
[17:15.000 --> 17:24.000]  I mean imagine if a foreign navy came and encircled the United States and threatened Mexico and Canada
[17:24.000 --> 17:32.000]  that they allowed any food, any gasoline, any medicines, anything to come into the United States
[17:32.000 --> 17:39.000]  that they would attack those nations or put sanctions on them.
[17:39.000 --> 17:46.000]  Imagine if a foreign government or an empire or a coalition of criminal governments, of pirates,
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  came in and encircled the United States with a blockade and said,
[17:51.000 --> 18:00.000]  we're going to attack or board any ships that try to run the blockade to bring food, medicine, or gasoline into the country.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  That would be an act of war. That would be an act of siege.
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  That would triple the economy, would make many of you lose your jobs, lose your benefits.
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.000]  But we have a government under the Peace Prize winner.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  Well, what a sick joke. That's like giving an ADL award to Hitler or something.
[18:19.000 --> 18:29.000]  It's just asinine. We have the Congress almost unanimously in the House,
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  sanctions on Iran's gasoline imports. That's war talk.
[18:32.000 --> 18:39.000]  Congress is moving quickly to force Obama into blocking gasoline sales in Iran over its nuclear ambitions.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  A U.S. naval blockade is the only real way to enforce that.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  And from Iran's point of view, that means war.
[18:44.000 --> 18:51.000]  Well, not just from Iran's point of view, we're going to come back with Ron Paul, where he breaks down the international and national law,
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  showing exactly what's happening.
[18:53.000 --> 19:00.000]  We have an article with the text of Ron Paul's speech up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  Iran sanctions an act of war when we come back.
[19:05.000 --> 19:13.000]  Then I'm going to get into the situation in Arizona, the move to arrest illegal aliens that are violating the law.
[19:13.000 --> 19:23.000]  This is the opposite of the sanctuary city and sanctuary state policy that 800-plus cities have,
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.000]  that all 50 states have, that illegal aliens are just left alone.
[19:28.000 --> 19:33.000]  And I've talked to Austin police. It's even been in the news that illegal aliens are pulled over drunk driving,
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  no ID, no nothing. They're just let go.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  And they commit crimes over and over again.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  But citizens have the book thrown at them, because whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  If you're a citizen, you're seen as a schmuck milk cow to be sucked off of to fund the New World Order.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  If you're an illegal alien, you're seen as somebody being brought in as a voting block against the American people
[19:53.000 --> 19:59.000]  and someone to further bankrupt the states for the federal slash international private banking takeover that's taking place.
[19:59.000 --> 20:13.000]  We'll be back with that as well. Stay with us.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  We are professionals in 76 countries worldwide, and our products are manufactured by a family-owned company

[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren,
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with precious metals.

[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[22:26.000 --> 22:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[22:34.000 --> 22:40.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[24:07.000 --> 24:14.000]  Okay, we're going to go ahead and go to this clip of Ron Paul on the floor of the house as we march steadily towards war.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  Illegal war of aggression just like Hitler attacking Poland.
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  Here we go again. America, the criminal empire, seized by offshore banks.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  Here it is.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  Mr. Jones of North Carolina.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Texas rise?
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  It was consent that I take my five minutes at this time.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for five minutes.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  I thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[24:41.000 --> 24:49.000]  Today, the motion to instruct on the comprehensive Iranian sanction bill was passed overwhelmingly.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  400 to 11.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  11 individuals said that this was not a good idea.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  I was one of those 11.
[24:56.000 --> 25:08.000]  I'd like to explain why I think the sanction bill against the Iranians is very, very dangerous and not well thought out.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  Sanctions are very serious.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  Sanctions are literally an act of war.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  When you prevent certain goods and services going into a country, it's like a blockade.
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  There's no advantage to us to do this.
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  The sanction bill literally says that any country that trades or sends oil into Iran, we will no longer trade with them.
[25:29.000 --> 25:39.000]  So if Russia sends in oil or gasoline or refined products or China does, we are theoretically under this bill not to trade with them.
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  Can you think of anything more chaotic than having a trade war with China at this particular time?
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  So often, well-intentioned foreign policy procedures backfire.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  They have unintended consequences and there's too often blowback.
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  Today, unbelievably, we are engaged in so many places in the world and we can't afford it.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Our foreign policy costs us a trillion dollars a year to operate.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  We're in 135 countries. We have over 700 bases throughout the world.
[26:11.000 --> 26:17.000]  We are engaged in military confrontation in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[26:17.000 --> 26:25.000]  We're bombing in Yemen and as well as having surrogates fighting in Somalia.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  We're flat out broke.
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.000]  The policy is driving our enemies into the hands of the Chinese and here we are looking for another war.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  The conversation today was nothing more than war propaganda on why we have to get ready to bomb the Iranians.
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  There is no proof, according to our CIA, that they're actually working on a nuclear weapon.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Now, I'm sure they would like to. Why not?
[26:52.000 --> 27:02.000]  Everybody around them have it so it would be logical that if they're surrounded and threatened and intimidated with all their people around them,
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  why wouldn't they want one? Of course they do.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  But others have it.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  They have never been found in violation of the non-proliferation treaty.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  Never.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  And yet Pakistan, India and Israel, they don't even belong.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  And they're our friends and we give them money.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  Pakistan, they get support from us. They have nuclear weapons and they have been known to send nuclear technology to North Korea.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  So the whole process makes so little sense.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  The language today was used that, well, we have to go in because of the weapons of mass destruction.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  They're going to have missiles and they're going to attack us.
[27:44.000 --> 27:54.000]  It's identical to the propaganda promoting in 2002 and 2001 before we attacked Iraq.
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  So the same process is occurring. Try to generate all this excitement about the need to use hostilities.
[28:01.000 --> 28:11.000]  Now a lot of individuals vote for sanctions that are basically anti-war and they don't like the military option and they think this is an alternative.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  I think that is deeply flawed thinking because sanctions lead to hostilities.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  And if you commit to the sanctions, you're really committing to the next step.
[28:23.000 --> 28:33.000]  The sanctions of the 1990s and the year 2000, the sanctions on Iraq, eventually led to the hostilities and the war and invasion.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  So what did that invasion of Iraq do? Did we find any al-Qaeda there? No.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  We found out that Saddam Hussein wouldn't allow the al-Qaeda there.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  No weapons of mass destruction.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  We've turned the country upside down.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  Hundreds of thousands of people injured and killed.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  We have suffered devastating problems from this.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  And what has happened? We've turned the government of Iraq over to the Shiites who are allies with the Iranians.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  So that whole policy has actually backfired.
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  So now what we're doing to the Iranians is driving them into the pockets of the Chinese.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  The Chinese are pretty good capitalists these days.
[29:10.000 --> 29:18.000]  They work hard, they produce, they sell us goods and services, we pay them, they save their money and they're starting to invest.
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  They're investing around the world.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  Not in my name. We'll be right back.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 30:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:21.000 --> 30:30.000]  They so pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[30:47.000 --> 30:53.000]  Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[33:19.000 --> 33:25.000]  Okay, coming up after I go over what's happening in Arizona with the Governor's Signing Immigration Enforcement Bill,
[33:25.000 --> 33:35.000]  I'm going to get into the kangaroo court whitewash hearings going on in Congress with Blank Fine, the head of Goldman Sachs, and others.
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.000]  So that is coming up.
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.000]  First, I want to remind listeners that I have produced 20 plus documentary films.
[33:44.000 --> 33:51.000]  I have directed 20 plus and produced several others. And a new documentary that we just released two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago,
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  is Invisible Empire, a New World Order defined.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  And this film is two hours, 24 minutes long.
[33:59.000 --> 34:08.000]  It gets into how the private central banks took over the United States, how they used the British model of imperial governance from behind the scenes,
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  how they tried and conquer, how they used narcotics trafficking to undermine and corrupt and federalize our police.
[34:15.000 --> 34:23.000]  So it covers government drug dealing, government white slavery rings, government staged terror, the occultic activities of the elites,
[34:23.000 --> 34:33.000]  how large portions of the Congress are pedophiles and or homosexuals, and how that information is used to blackmail them
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  so that many people can't even get into Congress unless they have already been compromised.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  This is a technique being used. It's all covered in Invisible Empire, a New World Order defined.
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  A New World Order on trial for the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planet's ruthless superclass is exposed in stark detail.
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.000]  This documentary film chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda, and debt.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  The criminal controllers that successfully dominated the globe are now in the final phase of consolidating power.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  Worldwide tyranny isn't coming, it's here. This isn't conspiracy theory, it's conspiracy fact.
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  The New World Order is out in the open, all documented in stunning living color.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  Unelected bureaucrats are establishing regional unions under a global superstate,
[35:31.000 --> 35:39.000]  witness their plan for worldwide taxation in a casual surveillance society in which every man, woman, and child is microchipped at birth.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  This is all in their own documents, in their own words.
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.000]  Over 200 clips of world leaders calling for world government, planetary control, planetary tyranny,
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.000]  what Gordon Brown calls the new constitution of the world by the G20.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  Taxation paid directly to the private banks.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  We also released last week Police State for the Rise of FEMA.
[36:02.000 --> 36:10.000]  The rumors are over, the documentation is all here, congressional testimony, the civilian inmate labor camp program,
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  the Military Commissions Act, the National Emergency Centers Act.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  We show you the actual FEMA camps.
[36:16.000 --> 36:24.000]  We go to the FEMA camps, we show you police and military attacking peaceful citizens at the G20 last year in Pittsburgh.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  We don't normally release two films at once, but they happen to be lined up that way.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  Two films released in the last two weeks.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  You can watch them all in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  Download them, burn them to disc, share them with everyone you know.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  Of course, all my other films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global, and Slaveman is also there.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  This film deals with eugenics.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  For the New World Order, world government is only the beginning.
[36:48.000 --> 36:55.000]  Once their program is in place, they can then carry out their massive forced population reduction program.
[36:55.000 --> 37:03.000]  Endgame is also available on DVD at infowars.com, where you can download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[37:03.000 --> 37:14.000]  And if you go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com today, you can download both of these films or view both of these films for free.
[37:14.000 --> 37:24.000]  Yes, you can get a prisonplanet.tv membership and watch the radio show Live at Living Color, another added dimension of information.
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  You can download my book, Paul Watson's book, Six Plus Years of Material, the podcast in higher quality.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  But I don't care.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  You can buy the high quality DVDs and financially support us.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  And that's the best copy to have to make copies from.
[37:38.000 --> 37:45.000]  But look, all I'm calling for is the same activism that has shaken the foundations of the global empire.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  We are discrediting the mainstream media.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  We are discrediting the criminal banking system.
[37:50.000 --> 37:59.000]  We are exposing the crony capitalism that is not free market, that is vertically integrating society and destroying the middle class.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  We have had a great effect because of you, the listeners and the viewers of this radio show.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  And you, the supporters and fans of my films.
[38:08.000 --> 38:20.000]  And so I'm asking you, the listeners and viewers today to go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and to click on the top story.
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.000]  Time for another mass viral wake up call for humanity.
[38:26.000 --> 38:35.000]  That's the Paul Watson headline that has our two newest films and pretty decent YouTube quality from a director channel.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  So it's all up there in one piece.
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.000]  And if you go to infowars.com, you can read the headline story that I posted.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  New offensive in the info war starts today with two free films.
[38:49.000 --> 38:57.000]  And these two films cost around $200,000 to make and they're absolutely free to you and your family.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  So please, I know this is not pearls before swine.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  Take advantage of this.
[39:02.000 --> 39:10.000]  There are already hundreds of other copies that we found online, but we've linked to the best free online copies that we've seen the highest quality.
[39:10.000 --> 39:21.000]  And as of today with us linking to these, they already have close to 350,000 views between them.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  I would like to see these in the millions by next week.
[39:25.000 --> 39:36.000]  And of course, then that will create a fulcrum for other people to take notice of the films and to share it with their friends and family.
[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  We can have these two new films be seen tens of millions of times each in the next year.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Another serious blow against the globalist.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  No rumors, all documented fact.
[39:47.000 --> 40:00.000]  Police stayed for the rise of FEMA in full quality and full length up there and invisible empire and new world order to find both films free for you right now at infowars.com.
[40:00.000 --> 40:12.000]  Post it to your Facebook, your MySpace, go into the mainstream media website message boards, post it there for them, post it on your local talk radio chat boards.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  The power of you, the people taking action is unstoppable.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  We have produced these information warfare weapons.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  They are much more powerful than the media lies because they are the truth.
[40:25.000 --> 40:34.000]  And so I'm asking all of you right now to ensure that these films have a massive effect.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  And I know you won't let me down because you understand we're all in this together.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  We also have just completed the full bibliography online.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  We're going to be linking that today for invisible empire.
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  It's like a book.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  You can check all our facts there.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  And we're also working on the next week on getting the bibliography up for police state for the rise of FEMA.
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  That, of course, is also free as well.
[40:56.000 --> 41:09.000]  You don't see the mainstream media creating documented second by second indexes and bibliographies so people can check out the information for themselves.
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  Because as I always say here, do not believe a word I say.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  Research every claim I make.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  But also when you see us being attacked, research the claims being made against us.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  We've got George Soros' websites attacking us.
[41:25.000 --> 41:35.000]  We've got Newsweek, Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, London Guardian lying about us saying we're calling for violence when we call for the opposite.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  We call for a peaceful restoration of our Bill of Rights and Constitution and due process and law.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  And so that's been discrediting the establishment that they've been doing that as of late.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  I saw a big neocon publication.
[41:50.000 --> 42:03.000]  You can just Google Alex Jones and pull up the article today claiming that I am saying that the earthquakes in Chile and in Haiti were caused by the U.S. government.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  I've never said that.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  In fact, I've been criticized by some listeners for not saying what the government did that.
[42:10.000 --> 42:19.000]  But again, they discredit themselves with this for the tens of millions of people that have tuned into this radio show and seen the articles we've written about this.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  They know that we didn't say that.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  And so again, that further discredits these liars.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  So we want you to look into what we have to say.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  We want you to look into what others have to say.
[42:30.000 --> 42:47.000]  What we did say about the earthquakes is what former Secretary of Defense Cohen in 1997 in the April issue of the Army Times told them that governments have developed weather weapons and tectonic earthquake weapons and that they are a serious threat.
[42:47.000 --> 42:59.000]  And so we simply said when callers called in asking us what we thought about it and callers who were sure that it was a government operation, we simply stated that the government has said these weapons exist.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  The government lies so much.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  Who knows if that's true?
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  The point is Secretary of Defense Cohen said that, not us.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  And I don't like being lumped in with Hugo Chavez in the same article.
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  You know, I'm a critic of Hugo Chavez.
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  I'm a critic of Barack Obama.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  I'm a critic of George W. Bush.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  Anyone who's a tyrant, I'm a critic of them.
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  But it turned out Hugo Chavez didn't say that either.
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.000]  Another lie by the mainstream media here in the United States.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  And that is why they are losing their viewers.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  You've had CNN has lost more than half its viewers just in the last 12 months.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  Glenn Beck in the last two months has lost more than half of his TV viewers.
[43:41.000 --> 43:51.000]  People now wised up to the fact that he's playing the false left-right paradigm and imposing as a constitutional populace when he's not.
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  All the other major news channels, broadcast TV, cable, you name it, are losing viewers and not just to the Internet.
[43:58.000 --> 44:12.000]  They're losing viewers because people have become wise to the fact that the media spins, lies, deceives, or takes things out of context or builds straw men.
[44:12.000 --> 44:27.000]  But whether it's NBC News or CNN or ABC, these are just subsidiaries of the large central banks and of the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  And so the controllers of these systems really don't care if they end up losing all their viewers.
[44:32.000 --> 44:47.000]  Because in this transformation into a tyranny, what the head of the FCC and others have called for a state-run megaphone and for the Cybersecurity Act to basically take over the free Internet and shut down alternative news and voices.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  They're going to do this in a phased-in process.
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  And so you've got a perfect storm between the dinosaur dying mainstream media and the government.
[44:56.000 --> 45:19.000]  And this is happening all over the world against alternative news, against alternative journalists, against alternative ideas because they're losing the fight in the marketplace of ideas with the truly diverse Internet that has empowered the citizen journalist, the citizen pundit, the citizen filmmaker, the citizen researcher.
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  And so that's the process that's taking place right now.
[45:23.000 --> 45:35.000]  You've also got the mainstream media who is completely and totally obsessed with access, access to politicians that simply regurgitate talking points or basically give them a press release.
[45:35.000 --> 45:49.000]  They're too obsessed with being invited to all the big gala dinners and to their large paychecks to ever be able to actually engage in any hard-hitting, deep investigative reports.
[45:49.000 --> 46:05.000]  Oh, you'll see some mainstream news slapping Goldman Sachs on the wrist and saying they made a mistake, they screwed up, but they never go to the actual Goldman Sachs documents and JPMorgan documents where they admit the whole thing was a premeditated implosion of the economy by design.
[46:05.000 --> 46:21.000]  So you have the mainstream media and the government moving to try to censor and control the Internet and talk radio and alternative information because they just can't compete with people who don't have their hands tied like they do.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  So look out for that to happen.
[46:23.000 --> 46:35.000]  I want to get into the situation in Arizona, but before I do that, I want to preface it with some background of what's been happening in the last few decades here in the United States.
[46:35.000 --> 46:44.000]  When citizens say we don't want the government controlling one-sixth of the U.S. economy through health care, the media comes out and says you're a racist.
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.000]  When taxpayers say they don't want to pay higher taxes, the media says you're a racist.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  When people talk about states' rights, the media, the dominant media comes out and says you're a racist.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  That is racism.
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  They are invoking race.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  They are invoking Balkanization and divide and conquer.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  They are invoking division.
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.000]  They don't want black people and Hispanics and Asians and others to be part of the Tea Parties.
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.000]  They don't want people to be involved in any mass political movement that isn't controlled by the establishment.
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  And so they do this so people feel like they're not part of a larger populist movement.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  This is cold, blooded, race-baiting.
[47:25.000 --> 47:34.000]  But we have seen Angus and Reed and Gallup polls in the last month that show upwards of 60-plus percent.
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.000]  Some polls, it's over 80 percent of the American people saying they don't trust the government.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  They want a smaller government.
[47:41.000 --> 47:50.000]  Other major polls out showing 40-45 percent that we've covered here on air of the public who are Tea Party members
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  identify themselves as Democrats or as independents.
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  And that's what scares the system to death.
[47:57.000 --> 48:07.000]  They are scared to death of the American people coming together against the banking dictatorship, the offshore banking oligarchy,
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  the offshore hostile corporate takeover that's happening here in the United States.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  So they are invoking race.
[48:15.000 --> 48:27.000]  Now, on another subject, back in 1993-94, the majority of the American people, again, were smart and were against NAFTA and GATT.
[48:27.000 --> 48:38.000]  They knew that past so-called trade deals were destroying jobs and destroying industry in the United States and incentivizing companies to move offshore.
[48:38.000 --> 48:45.000]  I mean, if there's no environmental standards, no healthcare, no nothing in China or Mexico, what's going to happen?
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  And cheaper wages, you're going to hear a giant sucking sound.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  That happened.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  Now the layoffs are happening everywhere.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  Citizens have been training their replacements for over a decade.
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  We're losing the so-called service jobs that we were promised, that we're going to be our new economy.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  And we see police forces being cut.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  We see potholes not being filled.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  We see teachers being fired.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  While the taxes go up and the IMF is out in the open saying, the good times are over.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  In the Washington Post, you're not going to have a good standard of living.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  Everything you make is going to be paid to us, like Nigeria, like Argentina, like Brazil.
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  It isn't that people aren't smart and hard-working in Nigeria or Argentina or Brazil.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.000]  They had the very same IMF World Bank consortium groups come in the last 100 years.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  Argentina was more wealthy 100 years ago per capita than the U.S.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  They were the richest country per capita in the world.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  It was the old saying, as rich as in Argentina.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Now look at them, one of the poorest in the world.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  This is what happens when you let the bankers take over.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  And what did Thomas Jefferson say?
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency,
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.000]  first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.000]  will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.
[50:14.000 --> 50:21.000]  Thomas Jefferson, the debate over the recon order of the bank bill.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  The recharter of the bank bill, 1809.
[50:23.000 --> 50:32.000]  And that's why the Constitution, 1798, states that the Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  Not a private fellow reserve that took over in 1913.
[50:35.000 --> 50:42.000]  On average, we had 10.2% growth rates and almost zero inflation, sometimes deflation.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  10% growth rates, zero inflation.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  Until 1913, now look at what's happened to us.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  The richest greatest nation on earth becoming homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  Thomas Jefferson had seen what these same banks had done in Europe.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  Now they've done it in Africa and Latin America and Asia.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  Now they're doing it here. They're going to take everything you've got.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  Gun cells are on a staggering pace.
[51:09.000 --> 51:16.000]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.000]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.000]  You'll learn step by step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[51:26.000 --> 51:33.000]  How to create the perfect hiding place as well as the places you should never hide your guns under any circumstance.
[51:33.000 --> 51:40.000]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[51:40.000 --> 51:47.000]  But listen up, for security reasons the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[51:47.000 --> 51:57.000]  Go to hideyourguns.com or call 877-327-0365 before they come for your guns.
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.000]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  They help to create a new world order.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:27.000 --> 52:35.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Invisible Empire.

[53:21.000 --> 53:35.000]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  Herb Kay was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  What have you got to lose? Stop the calls now. Get out of debt and have more money.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  Get Herb Kay's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[53:48.000 --> 53:56.000]  Call 800-822-1291. That's 800-822-1291.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  800-822-1291.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  I read the white papers. We cover them here on air.
[54:10.000 --> 54:16.000]  I go off what the UN is saying and their internal documents that aren't even secret what they're planning to do.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  That's why we've been successful in exposing these criminals.
[54:19.000 --> 54:28.000]  And so it's simple. Whatever the globalists are for, whatever the Fortune 500 is pushing, whatever their agenda is, I'm against it.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  Therefore, NAFTA and GATT, I'm against it.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  There are four open borders, I'm against it.
[54:33.000 --> 54:40.000]  It's very simple. Then we can go into each of those issues and prove why it's bad for the average person.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  And we know what NAFTA and GATT have done to our society.
[54:44.000 --> 54:56.000]  We know what it has caused. But let's go back now to Ross Perot in one of the debates against Bill Clinton and George Bush Sr.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  And, I mean, think about this. This happened decades ago.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  And now think what NAFTA and GATT have done to us.
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  Think what happened since we passed NAFTA and GATT,
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  the same way they created the European Union was through supposed trade agreements.
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.000]  And we have the internal North American Union SPP documents that judicial watch suit and GATT.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  They said we're setting up a North American Union by stealth that will be privately,
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  corporately governed for their profits at our expense. Here it is.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  The candidates will have an opportunity to make a closing statement.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  So, President Bush, I think you said it earlier. Let's get it on.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  Let's go.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  And I think the first question is over here.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  Yes, I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perot.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  What will you do as President to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  so that we can bring jobs back to the United States?
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  That's right at the top of my agenda.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  We ship millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while,
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  you cash in and become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month,
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts,
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  and then go back out.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  Now, if you just want to get down to brass tax,
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  the first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these one-way trade agreements
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  that we've negotiated over the years and say,
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  And they'll gridlock right at that point because, for example,
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships.
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  If they had to comply, you see, if it was a two-way street, just couldn't do it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  and you can move your factory south to the border,
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  pay a dollar an hour for labor, hire a young 25...
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  That's the sum you've been in business for a long time.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  You've got a mature workforce.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  Pay a dollar an hour for your labor, have no health care.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  That's the most expensive single element, making your car.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  And you don't care about anything that's making money.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  There will be a jam-sucking sound going south.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  So if the people send me to Washington,
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  the first thing I'll do is study that 2,000-page agreement
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  and make sure it's a two-way street.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  One last point here.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  I've called, I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it,
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  so I called to who's who and the folks who've been around it.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  And I said, why won't everybody go south?
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  They said, we'll be disruptive.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  I said, for how long?
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  I finally got them up for 12 to 15 years.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  and hires go down to $6 an hour,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  then it's leveled again, but in the meantime,
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  We've got to cut it out.
[58:01.000 --> 58:02.000]  Thank you, Mr. Perot.
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  All right.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  Here we are 18 years later.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  18 years later.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  And it's only getting worse.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Now they tell you, get rid of the borders.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  Their amnesty bill does fix illegal immigration
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  because it makes them all legal.
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.000]  You've got 600 million Latin Americans that want to come up here.
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  You've got billions of other people around the world.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  They get here, they put them on welfare,
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  which bankrupts the states further.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  They drive the wages down.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  And corrupt countries like Mexico
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  use the United States as a political steam valve as well.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  We're going to cover this when we come back.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  You think Navton and Gat hurt us?
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  Amnesty's going to kill us.
[58:41.000 --> 58:47.000]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  how much ammunition do you want?
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  How much do you want?
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  When do you want it?
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  Now or after the battle starts.
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  When will you need it?
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  Will there be any food?
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  How much will you need?
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  We don't know.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  How much do you want?
[59:33.000 --> 59:34.000]  All you can get.
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[59:38.000 --> 59:46.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  Be in that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  The GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  We are simulcasting the second, third and fourth hour today of the syndicated radio broadcast
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  at PrisonPlanet.tv or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Viewers, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  We have ABC News, Nightly News, ABC Nightline.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  They're doing two TV shows.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Supposed profiles on Alex Jones.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  I can't imagine that the dinosaur corporate media is going to be too friendly towards us,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  but these two gentlemen do seem friendly and nice.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  The particularly bad hit pieces, they usually are very cold.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  But we'll all sit here with bated breath waiting until next week to see what they do.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Who knows?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Maybe I'll even haul the ABC News correspondent in here.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  I should have asked him before we went live if he'd like to sit in for 10 minutes with us today
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  and ask me questions live on air.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  We've done that with quite a few other networks over the years.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  They've decided to come in and do a few minutes with us live.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  In fact, this fellow hosts the ABC Nightly News sometimes.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Quite a big, big shot.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Print me up his bio for folks that are just now tuning in.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  I guess they're the lucky few over at ABC. They just let go 25% of their workforce.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  But hey, they're not the only ones.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Tens of millions of people have lost their jobs.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Unemployment's really over 20%.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  The federal government says 10%, but all these mainline analyst firms say it's 22%.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  None of us are really going to have any jobs of any quality if we don't turn this country around.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  That's the point I make a lot.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  I want to make that to ABC News.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  We're all in this together.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  I mean, there's very few people, some of your corporate chiefs,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  that stand to gain from this new world order.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  This is a system meant to shut off resources to the general population.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  I mean, that's the plan that the White House ScienceR covers in his
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  thousand-plus-page book, Ecoscience.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  The world government is about shutting down human development and productivity
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  for the general public.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And then only the elite will have access to the life extension technologies
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  and to the higher forms of education.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  And that'll be sequestered in their government slash corporate reservations.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  And so most of you inside the ABC News corporate reservation,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  you need to know that you're going to be culled out politically over the years
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  and lose your jobs.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And that is the nature of this system.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  We better stand together, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  or we shall surely all hang separately in this new world order.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  And look, I want to challenge the people at ABC News.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Actually, go read Ecoscience.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Watch my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  There's an online bibliography for it.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  What is the endgame.com?
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  Find out the truth for yourselves.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Don't believe me.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  We were talking in the coffee room before I went live today with the ABC News crew.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  And I explained to them, look, they want world government as a means to an end
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  to carry out this global eugenics program.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  And I explained to them that thousands of documents, thousands of news articles,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  UN documents, biological diversity assessments,
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  and I noticed I kind of lost them there.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  They were kind of looking at me like, really?
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Man, this guy is from another planet.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  No, I'm informed about what's going on.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  It's kind of like this.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  It's like, here's the analogy.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  It's like I teleported from 2010 back to, say, a thousand years ago
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  where Mexico City is today, the heart of the Aztec Kingdom.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  And if I could speak their Mayan language and if I walked up to them and I said,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  listen, you don't need to sacrifice thousands of people a week.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  You don't need to have bloodletting.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  You don't need to sacrifice your children.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  I assure you your crops will still grow even if you don't do this.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  They would all look at me like I'm crazy.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  If I teleported back to 1939 Germany and told that off Hitler,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  look, you don't need to start these wars and kill all these people.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  He'd look at me like I was crazy.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  So if you went back to Julius Caesar's time,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  when they were crucifying people for no reason and told them,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  please don't do this, Julius Caesar, you'd be crazy.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  So by that yardstick, because I'm against illegal wars,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  I'm against torture, I'm against secret arrest,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  I'm against foreign banks robbing us with impunity,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  I am the outsider to the system.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  I mean, we've got a broken back, capitulated, acquiescent population
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  and no one's more acquiescent than the people that work for the system.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  They just roll over, do what they told and that's why their children have no future.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  For a member in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  They help to create a new world order.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  If the United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  In the next hour, Senator Graham Gays scandal goes national and viral.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  The word is he's being blackmailed to do all these unpopular things.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  I mean his reelection is in deep danger.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  He doesn't care.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  He says, I want carbon taxes.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  I want open borders.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  I want to give the banks unlimited money.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  I'm in the hip pocket of the globalist.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  You know, I've got to do this.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  That is what Senator Graham is pushing 24-7.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  And so hopefully he's going to be defeated politically.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into the situation in Arizona.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  Now, think about this.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Mexico has fully collapsed.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  I mean, that's been in the news that Mexico has had 20-plus thousand deaths in the last year.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  Police are being killed.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  Citizens are being killed on our side of the border.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  Mexico is a narco-terrorist state.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  You've got the government waging war politically against cartels that haven't been laundering their money through the larger U.S. and Mexican banks.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And we've got, conservatively, Obama says 11 million.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  It's more like 30 million from the numbers we've seen.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  Illegal aliens, 80-plus percent of those 30 million are from Mexico.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  One single country.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  And you've got 100 million people in Mexico.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  And many of the people that come up here are fleeing the law.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  And they get up here in the Mexican government at their consulates in the U.S.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  We'll give them consular matricula cards.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  They've done studies, one with the leader of the Republican House in Colorado a few years ago.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  We had them on in just a few hours, got four different consular matricula cards for himself.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  So you can just walk in, get an ID card, and then U.S. banks accept it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  The phone company accepts it.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  But if you're a citizen, you've got to have several different forms of identification.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  I've got an employee who once worked for Austin Energy a few years ago.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  And he talked about how when an old lady's $20 behind on their power bill, they turn their power off.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  When they're illegal aliens, they're told, they've had big meetings about it, let them have free power.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  And they just produce another consular matricula fake ID at the same address and they get another six months of free power.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  800 plus cities are sanctuary cities.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  And this has come out in the news, and it's also come out in the news in Austin,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  that you'll have a drunk driving illegal alien.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  And the drunk driving illegal alien will be released from jail.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  And then a week later, run into a police car transporting a suspect.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that is going on on a daily basis around the country.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  And then on top of that, I couldn't believe this.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  I mean, here's just one case point example of the types of things we've seen.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  What was it? Six years ago, I went to a Mexican Independence Day rally in Austin.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  And the illegal aliens, not Hispanic Americans, but the illegal aliens and their supporters,
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  were out there waving Mexican flags and saying that the Southwest and Texas belonged to them in the plan of Oslin.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  And we showed you the video of this, and they had signs showing Texas to California, even part of Colorado,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  is going to go back to Mexico that was transferred in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  I mean, it was Native Americans that were here, Mexico never even controlled it.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  But Westerners from the United States did come in and were able to control it.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  And the rest is history.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  And so our public schools, our colleges, and the Mexican public schools and colleges teach a radical,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  nationalistic hatred of the United States.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  And I was at this rally and I saw these shirts that said the plan of San Diego.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And some of my Spanish reading and speaking listeners who were there protesting against them said,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  you know what those green and black shirts mean that say the plan of San Diego?
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And I said, no, what is the plan of San Diego?
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  And they said, well, it's a plan to take over the Southwest and kill all white people ages 16 and up.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  So I went home that night and I Googled plan of San Diego and I saw all these Mecha websites
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  and La Raza affiliated websites and the University of Texas and Mexican universities
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  talking about the plan of San Diego.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  I didn't know that Germany made a deal during World War I to have Mexico attack the U.S.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  and kill all whites 16 and older.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  And of course, Germany at one time with Prince Maximilian actually had a royal down there
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  and Germany built the railroads down there.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  They have an old relationship with Mexico.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  And so then I got a real education.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  I mean, I knew that La Raza's slogan is similar to the Ku Klux Klans
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  for those inside the race, everything for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  I knew that and I knew that the Big Fortune 500 fund, Mecha and La Raza,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  and I knew that the Ford Foundation funded it.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  And so I was somebody who'd protested the Ku Klux Klan many times.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  You've seen those videos on YouTube where I've gone out and bullhorned the Klan
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  and told them their race has scum.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  And so when I learned that Mecha and La Raza were down there with signs saying
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  for our race, everything for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  And we went and interviewed them and they said, absolutely, we're racial.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  This is a racial organization.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  You pilgrims need to leave.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  Whites are bad and you're dying and your culture's dead.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Ha, ha, ha, we're going to get you.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  And so I was saying, well, I've protested the Klan, so I need to protest you.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  But then I didn't know there was a plan to kill all whites.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  And then I didn't know that that plan is being promoted again.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  And so I guess I'm supposed to just sit here and read where these government funded
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  and corporate funded groups are openly talking about killing me and my wife
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  and then my children.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And so I found out more and more.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  And my wife does speak fluent Spanish.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  She lived, what, five years in Spain when she was in junior high.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  And so she speaks fluent Spanish.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  And so she now is on the lookout for this and sees the bumper stickers
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  and sees the grocery stores and little towns that say it on their official signage.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And imagine, imagine, well, that's why the Nazis tried this here in the U.S.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  Imagine if there's a group who speaks another language
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  and the general public isn't aware how perfect that would be for infiltration and takeovers.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Okay.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  So let's get one thing clear here.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  The government in the media uses guilt.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Guilt.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  They say, well, you're against healthcare, you're a racist.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Or you're against open borders, you're a racist.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Or you're against government bailouts to bank, you're a racist.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  What does government bailouts and government-controlled healthcare have to do with race?
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  It doesn't.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  But Chris Matthews and others in the mainstream media invoke race
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  as a way to politically shut people down.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Because oh my gosh, I'm a white yuppie.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  I have all this guilt.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Guilt for nothing.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  I've done nothing.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  I better just shut up.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  That's a political weapon.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  And then meanwhile, the mainstream media will not tell you what Laraza's slogan is.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  They will not tell you about Mecha.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  They will not tell you about the plan of San Diego.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  And so just as I oppose, if we bordered Germany and Germany was here
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  and there were 30 million illegal Germans
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  and they were speaking in German about a plan to kill all Americans
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  or anybody that wasn't German, I would talk about that.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Okay?
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  Like the Hutus killing the Tutsis in Rwanda.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And of course the Hutus spoke a different language
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  so the Tutsis didn't know they were getting ready for it.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  And so because I'm aware of history, I've spoken out against it.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  You've got hundreds and hundreds of millions of people,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  100 million in Mexico alone, all who want to come here.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Going back four years ago, they wouldn't let the public see the amnesty plan,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  the immigration plan.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  It was secret in the House and Senate until Senator Sessions released it
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  and it even legalized felons.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  It allowed people to bring in six family members.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  It legalized everyone.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  It gave everyone a worker ID card, including U.S. citizens.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  So it makes us have a national worker ID.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  That's a national ID under federal control for us,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  which is Draconian and Orwellian.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  And then it just legalizes all the illegal aliens instantly.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  And that's the new plan they've got again.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  So imagine you've got all 50 states.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  You've got 800-plus cities that are sanctuary cities.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  They will not arrest illegals for drunk driving, for attacking people.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  They will not arrest illegals for driving without licenses.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  This is in the news and I've talked to Austin Police.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  This is on record.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  There have been sheriffs who will arrest truckloads of illegals with the coyotes smuggling them
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  in Tennessee and other states remote from the border.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  They call ICE, they call Homeland Security.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  They won't pick them up.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  Then it came out in mainstream news that when they do bust them in the stage rage
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  for the media every few months, they then go give them green cards
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  and give them government jobs.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  Or they use illegals to build a few miles of the fake fence they were building in Texas.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  Remember, that came out in the news.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  The government wants to overrun the country with people that will vote for gun control,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  vote for open borders, vote for big government, vote for welfare.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  And it couldn't work out better because Mexico's a country that's lost two wars with the United States
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  and is one of the most nationalistic countries in the world
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  and who literally, you know, it is the national mantra.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Remember a week after 9-11, they were having a soccer match in Mexico City
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  and they were chanting Osama, Osama, Osama.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  Let's just get it out on the table that you've got wonderful, hardworking, great, intelligent,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  family-oriented Hispanics that are the backbone of this country who are here in this nation.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Okay, and they're great people.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  And then you've got the people from Mexico who stayed in Mexico
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  and who were never part of this country.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  I mean, over a third of the people that fought for Texas independence were Hispanic.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  The father of the Texas Constitution is Hispanic.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  They don't teach that in the media either.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  So people feel included and to be part of this country.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  No, they invoke that it's evil and racist to want to control our borders against a country
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  that's having military incursions into the U.S. and shooting at the National Guard every single week.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  They tell you that you're not allowed to speak out against that
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  because global corporate interests want to break this country up
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  and unionize it into a North American Union.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  And so you have Arizona governor signs immigration enforcement bill
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  and you had a violent riot out there in front of the state house
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  and the media spun it like it was a good thing
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  while lying about the Tea Party saying they're violent when clearly they're not.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  You have the Democratic Party caught attacking their own offices in Denver to blame it on people.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  So this is the type of stuff that goes on and I want to break this down when we come back.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  But you know what NAFTA and GATT did to this country.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Do you need to have it explained to you what having totally open borders will do
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  especially with a country that hates this nation?
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  Mexico will be right back.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  Sinus pressure, sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  You've struggled for years.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Sound familiar?

[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  We're live on TV.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  Google the plan of San Diego for viewers and listeners out there, but for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Let's just Google the plan of San Diego.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  One of the first links is University of Texas.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  You can also link to the Spanish websites, the major universities in Mexico.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  It's taught that once, this is why you go to any rally, you see La Raza signs, you see
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Mecha signs, you see a map of the U.S. with the lower western third cut off as part of
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Mexico.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  This is taught to everyone.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And our media says, don't discuss it.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Don't talk about it.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  Sit down and take it.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  Yeah, there's the University of Texas.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Plan of San Diego.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  University of Texas.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  Plan of San Diego.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  With the outbreak of revolution in northern Mexico in 1910, federal authorities and officials
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  in the state of Texas feared that violence and disorder might spill over in the Rio Grande.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  And then it goes in to what happened about the revolutionary manifesto written and signed
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  by South Texas Town San Diego.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  January 6, 1915, the plan actually drafted in jail in Monterey, provided for the formation
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  of a liberating army of races and people to be made up of Mexican Americans, African Americans
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  and Japanese.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  And it said to then go into the state of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California and kill all
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  the whites above the age of 16.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  So, again, I go to a rally to see what these people are saying.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  There's Mexican flags everywhere.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  There's a plan of San Diego signs everywhere about killing me and my family.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  And they're saying, bring back the plan of San Diego and laughing.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  And this is worse than clan rallies I've gone and protested.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  I've been there bullhorning the clan, bullhorning the Aryan nations.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  We've done it many times.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  But of course, that's okay.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  The media says, that's good.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  That's healthy.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:30.760]  But don't talk about the fact that to this day, the plan of San Diego is promoted and
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.000]  pushed by a large minority of the illegal alien groups.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.720]  Now, on top of that, if you go down to Mexico and you're a U.S. citizen, you've all seen
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.000]  the horror stories on the news, they'll arrest some teenager for no reason, suck $100,000
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  out of their family, beat them up, torture them, do whatever they want.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  Mexico's completely collapsed.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.060]  We have a collapsing nation right next to it.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:27:00.240]  If you try to go down there illegally and you try to boss them around, hey, how about
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.840]  people from the U.S. go down to Mexico, try to rally and protest?
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.760]  How about 10,000 gringos, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter?
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.000]  How about we go down to Mexico City and how about we protest?
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.400]  They'll come out with bullets, not rubber bullets.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.160]  In Mexico, they gun down people with real bullets, and they'll just gun you all down,
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.720]  and it won't even be in our news.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.240]  It might be in the back of the newspaper.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:26.160]  They'd say, well, they were scumbag American Tea Party filth because our big corporate
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.640]  government just loves the antagonistic, hateful, third-world, imploding black hole that is
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.720]  Mexico that they hope will just suck America into it.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.040]  I mean, that's what's going on, and we're not supposed to sit here and talk about this
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040]  and discuss it.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.600]  We're supposed to be all guilty and just sit down and shut up.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.800]  Well, I'm not going to sit down and shut up.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.960]  I'm going to protest La Raza and Mecha and the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.080]  I'm going to stand up against these hate groups, and I'm going to continue to expose
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.480]  them until my dying breath.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:02.560]  Now, you get, depending on the poll, between 70 and 80-plus percent, in fact, I've got
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:08.760]  a poll on this today, in fact, guys, I had that in my stack.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.960]  You print, reprint me the article that says 70% of Arizona's support bill, because I thought
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.960]  it was here in my stack.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960]  Oh, here it is.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.960]  Rasmussen.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.440]  70% of Arizona voters favor new state measure cracking down on illegal immigration.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.560]  Well, they're just Americans, so what would they vote for?
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.560]  The federal government, one of the three things it can do is have a military guard the borders
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.280]  and issue the currency and credit.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.960]  They won't do any of the things they're supposed to do under the Constitution.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:40.160]  We've got Mexican military incursions all over the borders, all over the Texas news.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.240]  Every single day, hardly ever on the national news, all of this is going on.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.720]  U.S. citizens are being kidnapped and murdered en masse.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.440]  Every week, homes are burned on the border, ranchers are killed.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:58.840]  In one night, a few years ago, 14 houses were burned in a plan of San Diego operation.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:04.640]  There's rocket attacks, murder, houses being boarded up, people fleeing en masse, sheriffs
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.880]  are telling people in South Texas, buy guns to protect yourself.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:08.880]  We can't.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:16.240]  It is literally a mad max scenario in South Texas, in West Texas, in areas of Southern
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.480]  Arizona, carnage, death, looting, kidnapping, murder, people running around with Mexican
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:27.200]  flags, screaming for race war, slaughtering old whites.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:31.400]  And then I'm sitting here saying, boy, slaughtering old whites doesn't sound good, and I'm told
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400]  to sit down and shut up.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.480]  I'm going to come back and finish with this on the other side and then go to your phone
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.480]  calls.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.680]  But this is just incredible.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.600]  And then now the feds are saying they're going to come in and try to block Arizona.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:48.480]  And now the feds are saying they've got to hurry and pass their immigration takeover because
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.080]  they've got to break the back of the states right now and kill America once and for all.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:04.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Max, what did you do with the remote?
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.280]  Now what am I going to do?
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.520]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.

[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.800]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.160]  do you want?
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.160]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:17.160]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.400]  How much do you want?
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.400]  When do you want it?
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.560]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.000]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.480]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:31.600]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.800]  and be immunized?
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:36.560]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:40.160]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.400]  How much will you need?
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.400]  We don't know.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]  How much do you want?
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.400]  All you can get.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:33:18.200]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:25.200]  is in the description below.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:30.280]  I've got ABC News here, Nightline, and they're saying, do you actually believe that Mexico
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:33.800]  wants to retake the U.S.?
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:39.780]  That is the stated goal by many members of the Mexican government and Mecha and La Raza
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.280]  and others.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.800]  Pull up the plan of Oslo and pull up Oslo.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.880]  One plan to take over Southwest.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.400]  Since the media is here, go to any of these illegal alien rallies and look at the t-shirts
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.840]  being sold, look at the t-shirts that are being worn, look at the signs.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:02.840]  It shows the United States with the lower part of it in the West cut off in part of
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.000]  Mexico because that did belong to Mexico.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.080]  There were six flags over Texas.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:14.480]  The Spanish were here, the Mexicans, the French, basically everybody was fighting over this
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.360]  territory because it didn't have a governing system.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:23.120]  But Mexico has no real claim over Texas and over California and it's been our free market
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.560]  system that made this such a good place to want to move to.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.720]  So I'm all four people moving here legally and lawfully.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.640]  But if someone is running around seditiously who's an illegal alien waving a plan of San
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:41.400]  Diego or a La Raza or Mecha sign, I mean La Raza means the race.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.600]  And the motto is for those inside the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:55.240]  Now that is as Ku Klux Klan as Aryan nations as it gets, but the media will not cover it.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.440]  And the American people have discovered this.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.120]  They've read the Mecha and La Raza websites.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:05.680]  They've heard the mayor of LA talk about this over the years before he was mayor.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.960]  They've all seen the video and that's why the mainstream media is dying because you
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.160]  guys may have the big numbers, which are dwindling, but you have to keep reapplying.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160]  Everything's fine.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.760]  These foreigners love you.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.760]  They're good.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760]  They're sweet.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.760]  They love America.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.040]  Oh, look, we had some government PR firms hand out some American flags.
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.880]  Oh, look, everything's fine.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.240]  Oh, everything's good.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.920]  NAFTA and GATT is good.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.360]  You're really going to love open borders.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.200]  You're really going to love total amnesty.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:38.080]  And once you've got another 30 million illegals, they are the tipping point to vote for taking
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.640]  private property from the citizens for taking our guns, our second amendment.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:46.760]  You see, we're taught that this is a democracy.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.760]  This is not a democracy.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.400]  This is a constitutional republic.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:56.240]  And in a republic, 1% rights are just as protected as the other 99%.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.680]  But as Thomas Jefferson said, democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.680]  dinner.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.480]  So in this new world order democracy, they just bring in 51% foreigners and have them
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.480]  vote for.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:13.440]  We're taking all your property just like Zimbabwe or some other nation.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.920]  The 51% says, you're our slave now.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.920]  And that's how it works.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.720]  The people that still have jobs, that still provide, that still hire people are slaves
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:27.240]  to the giant hordes of people that live in this country and that are coming to this country
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.160]  from all over the world.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.440]  And more importantly, the big central banks.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.880]  The big central banks take about 90% of the money for themselves and then they throw some
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.000]  chicken feet out to the horde that basically works for them.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.320]  And the American people have figured this out.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.120]  And so the jig is up.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.620]  It's over.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.080]  Now we've got Judge Andrew Napolitano on to Mar to look at this constitutionally.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.800]  And he's saying that this will bankrupt the state of Arizona.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.080]  He's saying it will probably be ruled unconstitutional.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:04.440]  But what do the states do when the federal government will not protect the borders and
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.120]  is on the side of foreigners who they're bringing in as a client?
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:15.680]  Just last week, Obama had a big commencement speech where they were giving green cards
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:20.760]  to a bunch of illegal aliens that had been in our military for three to five years.
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:26.120]  The biggest army recruiting centers in the world are in Latin America and in Eastern
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  Europe.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.600]  Much of our military is made up of foreign troops now.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:34.800]  It isn't foreign armies that are here, it's that our military is being turned into foreign
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.800]  armies.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.920]  Just like the British brought the Hessians in to this nation.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.560]  And so again, I want to explain how this is going to end.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:47.840]  All of us are basically going to be reduced down to the level of people living in Nigeria,
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.320]  living in Mexico.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:54.600]  We need to reach out to Hispanics that are in this country illegally and try to educate
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.800]  them about the New World Order.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.800]  But it's a very sophisticated, I mean, that the American people can't figure it out in
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.560]  most cases.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:08.340]  And we have to freeze legal and illegal immigration because we have a private offshore banking
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:13.640]  cartel that has come in and incentivized bringing illegals in to get them on welfare
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.800]  and then weaponize them politically to bring down this republic.
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.880]  It doesn't matter what color you are, this New World Order and all the policies of this
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.840]  New World Order are destroying our economy.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.640]  It is annihilating our system.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.360]  Look at the incentives for NAFTA and GATT.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.840]  Look at the incentives for corporations to move offshore.
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  Everything is tailored to destroy our industrial society.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.840]  What does Al Gore say?
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.120]  What does Maurice Strong say?
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.680]  What does the head climatologist at NASA say?
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.520]  They're using their phony environmentalism to, quote, shut down our industrial society
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.120]  to seize control of what industries left, to be able to selectively enforce and decide
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.320]  who can have businesses and who can't.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:02.240]  This is a scientific 21st century corruption that is being put into place.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:08.840]  So Arizona governor signs immigration enforcement bill and she says that they ignored criticism
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.920]  from President Barack Obama on Friday and signed a law bill supporters said would take
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.400]  handcuffs off police in dealing with illegal immigration in Arizona, the nation's busiest
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.600]  gateway for human and drug smuggling from Mexico.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.360]  And then some said, well, this will be profiling.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, they set up random checkpoints at the federal government funds at the state
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.600]  level to randomly search our cars for more than 15 years.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  That's unconstitutional.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:41.040]  If you see a day labor site with 15 guys in cowboy boots and cowboy hats piling onto
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:47.320]  the back of the day labor car, you could have city regulators come over and say, what's
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.600]  your permit for this?
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.280]  But no, no, that's all left alone.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:56.560]  And my dad wants to build a fence around his house bureaucrats harassing for six months
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.400]  and won't let him do it.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.600]  But if the illegal aliens want to do whatever they want, they're left alone.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.480]  And again, I've talked about a good family friend that I've known since I was a little
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:12.200]  kid who manages some of the biggest department complexes in Austin for the biggest department
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.680]  company in the U.S.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:19.360]  And years ago she was called into their Dallas meeting, their Christmas meeting with hundreds
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.120]  of their top managers in this auditorium, and they said, look, the federal government
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.440]  has said they're going to leave us alone with regulations, they're going to let us basically
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.920]  do whatever we want.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:34.320]  If citizens have two or three people in an apartment that's only supposed to have one,
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.000]  kick them out, make room for the illegal aliens, this is a secret incentive program.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.920]  And then the AP reported about a year after that that banks are giving illegal aliens
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.360]  loans that they won't give citizens, saying, we know it's been a hard time for you.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.360]  We want you here.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.920]  Use a free welfare, free everything in Austin, close to free power.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.640]  Use any fake ID card you want to get the power turned on.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.680]  When it gets turned off, just bring a new fake ID card in and we'll accept that.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.080]  But we won't do that from citizens.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:08.680]  Again, this is a total discrimination takeover program of America.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:15.880]  We have a cancerous, imploding, nightmare, narco-terrorist state, one of the most corrupt
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:20.280]  nations on earth bordering us and a bunch of other corrupt nations below it in Central
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:28.360]  and South America, surging over into the United States, pouring over so fast and so furious.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:34.680]  And these people are getting here, many of which are intelligent, hardworking people.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.640]  But a lot of other ones are also criminal.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.400]  They're fleeing the law in their nations and they're getting here and being forged into
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.960]  a political weapon and they're violating federal law.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.280]  And then you get a state saying, look, they've killed so many cops.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.080]  They've killed so many citizens.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:52.220]  Our state is literally starting to fall apart like Mexico.
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:55.800]  We have got to start arresting these people and giving them to the feds to deport them.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.600]  You know, when a cop pulls an illegal over for speeding or drunk driving, we're going
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.680]  to take them into jail.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.760]  And the government says, no, you cannot arrest them for drunk driving or speeding because
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.120]  once they get there, the judges just let them go.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.880]  Think of this because it is key to the new world order to bring in this voting block,
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.600]  to vote, to take your guns and your private property.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:22.160]  They've got to bring in groups that aren't American so they can divide the nation.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:25.320]  Foreigners before had to come into Ellis Island, whether you were from China or whether you
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.000]  were from Ireland.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.600]  And you had to show that you had allegiance to this country and that you were disease-free.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.800]  And then you came into the nation and people were thankful and wanted to learn the culture.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.960]  But we have a criminal government that wants to use these people as a weapon against this
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:48.000]  country because our government is a corporate system that wants to absorb Canada and Mexico
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.800]  into this North American Union on record.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.180]  And that's what we have to be made aware of.
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:55.720]  This is really happening.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:00.440]  And the public is awake and the feds are coming into block this, but it's not going to work.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.680]  Mexico is going to implode even faster.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.280]  The states are going to go bankrupt even faster.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.880]  The feds are going to try to come in with federalization.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.560]  The illegals, just like they did in the early 90s in LA, are going to riot again.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.080]  And it is not going to work.
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:21.840]  But the hatred that New York and D.C. and the elites in LA have of this country is so deep
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:26.880]  and they want to break the back of the middle class and rob them blind so badly, it's not
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.960]  enough the banks have stolen $28 trillion, that they want it all and they want it now.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.440]  So Arizona governor dismisses threat of economic boycott.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:40.560]  So the governor's dismissing the threat of economic boycott over the new state immigration
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.360]  law she signed last week.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.960]  Appearing money to Arizona town hall in Tucson, Brewer said she doesn't believe law is going
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.320]  to have that kind of economic impact that some people think it might.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:54.840]  Representative Raul Grovilleva, a Tucson Democrat, has called for a boycott of convention, business
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.960]  for the state and other calls have come for a boycott of Arizona goods, services and
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.160]  tourism because of the nationally controversial immigration law.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.760]  Well, I mean, what about, what about LA?
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.060]  What about California?
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:10.040]  People are boycotting the big government, the out of control taxes, the crime by just
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.040]  leaving.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.960]  And that's why the feds want to have this nationwide so there's nowhere to run, okay?
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.160]  How about we boycott Mexico?
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.160]  Well, you know what?
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.320]  That's already happened.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.560]  That's already happened.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.440]  Everyone I know isn't taking trips down there and I'm not ever taking a trip down to Mexico
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.440]  again.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.440]  I'm not going to Cancun.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.440]  I'm not going to any of those places.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.480]  Besides, you go there now, there's troops on the street corners with machine guns everywhere
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.720]  and the whole society's falling apart.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.880]  People aren't going down there because they know.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.480]  I mean, I was down there two years ago with my wife and kids, took them down there, go
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.480]  scuba dive.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:43.320]  And my wife speaks Spanish folks and she had to hear how we're scumbag Americans and how
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.120]  much they hate us and how they can't wait to overthrow America.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.600]  And she said, I don't ever want to come down here again.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:50.760]  You know, I grew, you know, I grew up in Madrid.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.360]  I, I know what they're saying, you know, I mean, you go up and get something to drink
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.280]  at the counter and it's like, here you go, scumbag filth, we're going to get you.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.280]  I spit at it.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:59.280]  Haha.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.360]  You know, and I'm just supposed to sit here and go, oh great, great, you know, get free
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:05.440]  power in the cities, but you're allowed to drunk drive.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:09.080]  You're allowed to spit in my food, you're allowed to hate America and just run around
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.520]  and defecate all over the country and then murder and kill whoever you want.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.760]  And then we're supposed to just sit here and put up with it and love it and enjoy it.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.280]  No, it's over.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.280]  It's over.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.160]  Oh, here's another thing the media does.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.720]  This is the biggest hoax they engage in here.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:29.760]  I've seen the Gallup polls between 71 and 82% depending on which major poll you look
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:36.560]  at of Hispanic Americans that are American as red, white and blue as George Washington.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.840]  And when they get asked, do you want to control the borders?
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.720]  They say absolutely no amnesty.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720]  Why?
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720]  Because they're not stupid.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:47.080]  They're Americans and they know NAFTA and GATT and open borders has destroyed their
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.080]  wages.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.080]  They're not stupid.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.960]  They can speak Spanish, a lot of them and they're hearing it.
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.040]  They're hearing it every single day.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:01.800]  My cousin grew up in Guatemala and he speaks fluent Spanish and he was a bartender in college
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.640]  and you ought to hear the stuff he heard there.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640]  Okay?
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640]  I'm sick of it.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:09.520]  I'm learning Spanish just so I can hear what people are saying about me behind my back.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.440]  It's over and we're here ringing the alarm bell.
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:13.800]  We've done nothing wrong.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.920]  We're good Americans of every race and color and religion and we're not going to have a
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:24.280]  narco terrorist imploding black ski mask thug state that brainwashes its kids up to
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.800]  the sixth grade, that's the average education level, that the U.S. belongs to Mexico and
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.040]  that they're going to come up here and kill gringo.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.040]  It's over.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.040]  I know about it.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.160]  The people know about it.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.160]  It's over.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:36.160]  It's over.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.160]  Okay?
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.760]  We found out before the globalists could bring America down completely.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.080]  We've got a fighting chance to stop this and Hispanic Americans who love this country
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.600]  need to come out and speak out against this because that's the big illusion.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.960]  That's the big deception.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.440]  That's the big brainwashing.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.680]  That's the mind control.
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.000]  Is that they sit there and say, oh my gosh, lawmakers are afraid Hispanics are going to
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  get angry.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.400]  That's a self-fulfilling process.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.480]  That's mind control.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.040]  They're telling Hispanics you should be insulted by this.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.200]  They're telling Hispanics you should be upset if you're an American that people are saying
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.800]  we can't have wide open borders and 30 million illegal aliens running all over the country.
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.920]  The feds say 11 to 15 million.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.560]  Just like when you say, I'm an American, I don't want the government running one-six
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.880]  of my economy via healthcare and they say you're a racist.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.280]  They invoke that to make you sit down and shut up.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.440]  They're the racist.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.840]  We've got a stinking, wicked, evil, corrupt, illegitimate government that killed over
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:34.360]  a million Iraqis in the last seven years and over a million before that with the sanctions.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.720]  The real racists that want to kill brown people are running our government.
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.720]  It just so happens to be Arabs and Muslims and Persians.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.760]  Planned Parenthood set up by Margaret Sanger and the Rockefellers called Black Subhuman
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:53.760]  Weeds, 51 to 52, depending on the year, percentages of Black people are never born in this nation.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.600]  More than half the Black people that were conceived were never born.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:03.000]  That's racism in the fake poverty pimp cloak that the establishment social engineers use.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.400]  I'm here speaking out against the abortuary mills in the Hispanic areas of town, murdering
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.240]  your children, okay?
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:14.120]  So I'm here telling you straight up, you've been brainwashed, you've been taught that
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.720]  it's okay to be racist.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:18.480]  It feels good to all humans at a primitive level.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.000]  You've been told it's this little secret and we're going to set it all up and the government's
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.240]  behind you and ha ha ha and Obama's out telling the illegals to vote.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:32.520]  All of this is going on, but we're here pulling the rug out from under them.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:38.440]  We're here pulling the curtain back so people can see what's going on, so people can understand
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.080]  the truth of what's happening, the truth of what's developing.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:49.880]  I mean, there was a riot, there've been actually several and imagine how they demonize Americans.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.000]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian doesn't matter when you go out and protest.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.520]  But then when the illegal aliens rioted and attacked police, the police were told to use
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.780]  restraint and to shut up and go along with it and the media said that some tea party
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:06.160]  provoked it with no evidence and the guy looked like a provocateur from hell.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.760]  We know they've been caught provocaturing over and over and over again.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:14.640]  Here it is, hundreds of protest immigration law in Arizona, hundreds of people gathered
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:19.200]  outside Arizona's capitol building on Sunday and largely peaceful protest, largely peaceful
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.240]  against the state's tough new immigration law.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:26.920]  Tough to enforce the law, I'm a big milk cow American citizen.
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.680]  The government looks at me like a mosquito, looks at something it wants to suck off of.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:35.680]  I'm sick of it, I'm tired of the selective enforcement, I've had enough of it, I'm done
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:40.040]  with it, I'm not putting up with it anymore, I'm tired of the discrimination and I'm tired
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:45.760]  of racist groups whether it's the Ku Klux Klan or Mecha or La Raza running around spewing
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.760]  their racism.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:50.840]  But here's the deal, there's not 30 million toothless Klan members in this country.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.480]  There's probably not even 500,000 of them and they get exposed by the media.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:59.560]  But Mecha and La Raza don't, that's the big dirty secret.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.280]  That's the big dirty secret that the mainstream media hopes that the American people don't
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.840]  find out.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:09.560]  They hope you don't find out in many major US cities, more than half the people in the
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:14.200]  lock up are illegal aliens that have committed violent crimes after they were released for
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.920]  other crimes over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.520]  I mean, who was the railway serial killer?
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:24.600]  How many people did he kill and rob and rape before he finally got caught?
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.240]  How many times had he been released from jail?
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:33.200]  How many times had he been turned loose on the population?
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:38.440]  So again, we have a riot, illegal aliens riot in Arizona, media almost completely silent
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:44.240]  on it because the dominant media works for Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, the main
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.840]  private shareholders in the Federal Reserve that have stolen $28 trillion in the last
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.520]  year and a half and you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:56.240]  And they're going to use foreign armies of populations they brought in as a political
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.840]  weapon to stop us from saving America.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:02.760]  They're bringing us down just like other countries.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.440]  Let's talk tough.
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:05.840]  Let's talk comfort.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:13.360]  Let's talk about down home value made in the USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:22.560]  Remember, there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:32.200]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit and put a diamond gusset
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:40.520]  in the crotch where you need most blue diamond gussets got it others don't wear good old
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:43.560]  fashion comfort get diamond gusset jeans.

[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.920]  See them at G US S E T dot com.
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:55.760]  That's gusset dot com or call 888-848-7738.
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.280]  That's 888-848-7738 diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.280]  Others don't.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:06.680]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.280]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:12.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.320]  or gold?
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:16.720]  It's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:18.880]  possible that could even happen again.

[01:37:34.100 --> 01:54:42.000]  thank you very much.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  Look here's the deal, anything the globalist are for, you've got to be against.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.080]  Anything the new world order is pushing, we know, is bad.
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.600]  And so I am all for legal immigration to this country, but no other nation on earth just
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.640]  lets people unlimitedly come in, especially if they come from a country that's lost two
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:04.680]  wars.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:08.440]  And there's incredible dislike of the American people in Latin America because the media
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:11.520]  has demonized the American people, not the banks.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.160]  It's the banks that have robbed and looted and controlled Latin America.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:22.480]  And who are the banks then pushing for to bring in is unlimited numbers from Latin America
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.600]  so we can then all be at each other's throats.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.960]  If we had time to reach out to these people and educate them about what's going on, it
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:31.800]  wouldn't be an issue.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.400]  And it's not as bad an issue, people from Central and South America.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:40.680]  The big issue is Mexico, that's 80% or more of the illegals in this country.
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.600]  And Arizona says when we stop somebody for drunk driving and they're an illegal alien,
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.160]  we're going to go ahead and arrest them.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.600]  And they say, see, think about what that means.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.120]  They can't do anything with them.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:53.120]  They have no IDs, so they have to let them go.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.680]  And Arizona is saying, no, when you commit another crime, we're also going to get you
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.680]  for this.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:02.400]  See, that's discrimination against the American people that this is going on.
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.320]  And it's so late in the game that they brought in these tens of millions of illegal aliens.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.400]  It's so late in the game that they have turned them against America and brainwashed them and
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.320]  kept it quiet from the American people.
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:18.080]  And I just want to thank my Hispanic friends who warned me about this, the first time I
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.240]  ever heard about it, because, you know, I'm a little yuppie kid who's been taught white
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.680]  guilt and everything, and I'm evil.
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:27.680]  Everyone else is good.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.320]  I mean, I wouldn't really talk to my parents, but my school and stuff.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:36.560]  And I visit my cousin in San Antonio, which is almost completely Hispanic in the area
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:37.560]  he lived in.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:42.320]  And then, of course, they were all veterans kids and, you know, a middle class, and they
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:46.560]  would just warn me and say, you know, the people from Mexico coming in now, they don't
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.560]  like America.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.560]  Do you know about this?
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.440]  And I thought it was like some test to see if I was a racist.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:53.280]  And they go, no, man, we don't care about all that.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.360]  We want you to know the reality.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:58.040]  We see through all that race control in the media.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:03.040]  So I actually learned about this from Hispanic Americans in San Antonio when I was in high
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:04.040]  school.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.040]  Okay.
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.480]  And then I learned about it from people that speak Spanish at these rallies.
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.500]  They'd say, you know what that shirt means?
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.000]  That means they want to kill you.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.200]  And I'd say, excuse me.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.740]  And then I'd go look it up and find out it was true.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:19.320]  So again, that's the big secret that nobody's supposed to talk about, that nobody's supposed
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:21.480]  to discuss.
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.920]  And I've had enough of it.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.760]  And the media always phrases it like, oh, and I'm going to Ernie and Mike and Philip
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:28.760]  and Don.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  I apologize.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.000]  I'm going to go to you in the next segment and our guest is coming on.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.200]  I just hate even having to talk about this because I know how it's twisted.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.320]  I know how it's distorted.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:41.200]  But the truth is the truth and I'm just going to tell it and that's the end of it.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:42.680]  The government's stage is 9-11.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:44.440]  I tell the truth.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.400]  The government's putting poison in our water and poison in our vaccines.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.400]  I tell the truth.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.360]  GMO foods designed to sterilize us.
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:52.920]  I tell the truth.
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.520]  The government's getting ready to launch new wars.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:55.520]  I tell the truth.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.960]  The government blows up Oklahoma City.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.560]  I tell the truth.
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.600]  The Ku Klux Klan and Aryan nations in almost every case and Hal Turner run by the feds.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:07.800]  I tell the truth again to get everyone at each other's throats.
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.120]  They go into conservative groups and try to radicalize them so that the conservative message
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:18.920]  is not palatable to blacks and Hispanics and others when it's all of us together against
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.360]  the New World Order.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.840]  And so if you're for the Republic, for freedom, for the free market, for property rights,
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.440]  for the Second Amendment, for family, and for sovereignty, I don't care what color
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:30.440]  you are.
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.440]  I'm your brother.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:36.120]  But if you're working for offshore banks to be brought in here to bring down my nation,
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.840]  you are my enemy.
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:38.840]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.840]  Stay with us.
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:43.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:57.320]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:01.200]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.880]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union,
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:12.080]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:16.760]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:17.760]  our families.
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:21.600]  Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.280]  of your own home.
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:27.880]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:32.040]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:39.040]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:42.240]  producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:45.720]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:45.720 --> 02:00:06.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:11.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.160]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.320]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:18.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:23.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.800]  We have to break our conditioning.
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.520]  We have to stop being politically correct.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:30.200]  We have to tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may, just as be done by the
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.000]  Heaven's Fall.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.680]  Let's go to Ernie in California.
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.680]  Ernie, thanks for holding it on the air.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:36.680]  Hi, Alex here.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.360]  I want to thank you for waking me up.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.880]  Hey, here's what happened.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.720]  I finally got up and did something.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:44.560]  Two weeks ago, I went to a Tea Party.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.480]  I started talking about the 1944 Brittenwood Conference, trial out of commission, council
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:50.480]  formulations.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.480]  Everybody said, oh, good information.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:57.400]  We'll see you two weeks from now, which was this last Saturday, at the Double Tree Hotel.
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.320]  I walked in to give my speech.
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:01.440]  They rushed me out of there.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.960]  You can't talk about that.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:10.080]  Yeah, we posted a video from a Northern California Tea Party last week where we are changed went
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:11.080]  to it.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:17.800]  We signed as Obama with the word fascist and basically the same message under Sarah Palin
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:24.400]  saying both parties are bad, we're tired of big government, we're tired of the corruption.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:29.560]  And that's who originally founded the Tea Party was Ron Paul supporters three years ago.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:35.400]  But they had Tea Party security take the peaceful guy out saying, you're not allowed to have
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.400]  a sign criticizing Sarah Palin.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.920]  You've got to go to a free speech zone.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:45.400]  So conservatives criticize Clinton when he started the free speech zones, then Bush
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.400]  get him.
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:47.400]  They loved him.
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:52.280]  Now Obama's got some free speech zones back and they hate him, but then they carry out
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.440]  free speech attacks against people that disagree with them.
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.440]  It's disgusting.
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  Can I have a shout out?
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.280]  I want to shout out to this special little guy named Jim Patterson running for Congress
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:03.280]  in our district.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:07.800]  Do I have him admit in front of a crowd that he would not join the CFR, trial out of commission,
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:12.320]  or the Build-A-Birds, and when I went there Tuesday, he told me inside and said personally
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:16.840]  to me, listen, it doesn't matter if they replace them, if they kick them out, they'll just
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  replace them.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.320]  So he's already flip flopped.
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:20.320]  Okay.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:24.400]  And basically I talked to an older gentleman there with 76 and I asked him, he asked me,
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.400]  what do you got?
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.400]  I showed him, he's there.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.400]  You know what?
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:28.400]  I'm sorry, status to your son.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:29.400]  He was like about 80.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:30.400]  He's there.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:34.040]  But I've been preaching this for 10 years and these people with Glenbeck and Bill Riley
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.680]  don't tell them they're not going to believe you.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:37.680]  They're that brainwashed.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:39.840]  I want to thank you and I want to ask you one other question.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:43.200]  What do you think about state citizenship and I'll let you go?
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.200]  Thanks for your fight.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.440]  Well, that's a complex issue, state citizenship.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:52.840]  We are citizens of our states under the Bill of Rights and Constitution, okay?
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:55.480]  And then the states form the federal government.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:01.440]  But now under the amendments they passed after the Civil War, they make you a federal ward
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.880]  or a federal chattel.
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:11.680]  And so everyone was enslaved with those amendments instead of everyone being freed is basically
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.280]  how that works.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:15.000]  And so I am a state citizen.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.200]  I mean, that's just history.
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:19.200]  That's how that's always worked.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:23.800]  And then they say, well, we had, you know, federal takeover and deployment of federal
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:25.800]  troops after the Civil War.
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.000]  So that's settled the issue of states' rights.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.880]  Well, why even have a state then?
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.720]  I mean, why do we even have states?
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:36.840]  And that's what the federal government is doing is it's creating one large unified system
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.280]  over everything.
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:43.960]  And the federal government itself has been conquered by offshore private banks and corporations.
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:47.040]  There's been a hostile corporate takeover of the United States.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:48.640]  The globalists brag about this.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:49.640]  That's what globalization is.
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:53.560]  And we've got the World Trade Organization, a private group with more authority over
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:55.040]  our trade than Congress.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:58.760]  We've got a private Federal Reserve banking cartel with more authority over the issuance
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.680]  of currency and credit than our own Congress.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:08.720]  So the federal government itself is vestigial, ceremonial, to a great extent.
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:16.800]  And under Homeland Security, we have the executive making it fully, fully vestigial and ceremonial,
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:23.600]  where only the executive of the National Security Council has true governmental power and executes
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.280]  that through the executive and through the bureaucracy.
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.160]  And the legislative doesn't do what they want.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.160]  They just ignore it.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:33.960]  They take what's happened in Canada the last three years twice and what happened in 79
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:34.960]  in Australia.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.240]  A great case point example that we're talking about here.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.000]  Their parliaments would say no to something that the Special Interest wanted and the Queen's
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.080]  Governor General would come in and veto it and just say, forget the whole parliament.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.080]  I run things.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:53.520]  The Queen of England still owns and runs those countries and the people in their own nations
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.520]  don't even know it.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:58.960]  But when the parliament tries to actually exercise authority, in comes the Queen's Governor
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.360]  General.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.840]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:08.480]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:12.520]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:13.520]  or gold?
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:16.880]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:19.080]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:23.240]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.240]  seeds.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:29.520]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:31.400]  food for you and your family.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.480]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.720]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:39.200]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:42.440]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:49.240]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:53.720]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:58.240]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:27.560]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:47.120]  We turn genes inside out, diamond gusset genes, made in the USA with unparallel quality.
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:51.720]  Our Defender motorcycle genes combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:53.840]  ride all day with confidence.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:56.760]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.840]  When gusset genes got it, others don't.
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:05.200]  You may be arrested and are subject to other police action.
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.480]  Terany is here.
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.080]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.800]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:17.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.600]  on earth.
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:23.400]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.240]  expanded nationwide.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:29.480]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:31.320]  powerful shadow state.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:35.360]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.800]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:45.640]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:49.120]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.160]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.160]  It's here.

[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:05.760]  Now, since I'm on Senator Graham's doorstep, I have an announcement to make today that
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:08.840]  I thought long and hard about saying to anybody.
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:13.960]  But consider the fact that Senator Graham is the number one Republican in the country
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.960]  trying to pass amnesty for illegal immigrants.
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:21.040]  And considering the fact he presented in a group I do consider to be racist, it's called
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:24.760]  the National Council of La Raza, the National Council of the Race.
[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:26.760]  Have you heard of them?
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:28.240]  Senator Graham spoke to them.
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:33.920]  He got an award from them and he said that America is more of an idea than a place.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920]  Thank you.
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.920]  Thank you.
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.920]  Thank you.
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:40.560]  It's my granddaddy who fought in the Ardennes forces in the ground and didn't hear that
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:43.840]  America is more of an idea than a place.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.720]  He said that nobody owns this.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:50.040]  Nobody owns being in America is why he told this racist pro-amnesty group.
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:59.640]  Sometimes I wonder what it would take to make a person sell their own country out like
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:00.640]  that.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:07.320]  And there's one thing that it could be that I'm going to put out in the open here today.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:09.840]  It's a secret that Lindsey Graham has.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.960]  It's no secret in Washington, D.C.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:17.880]  The Democrats know this secret, but while I'm again in the pop, I don't know this secret.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.480]  The business industries in Washington, the one open boarders in the embassy know this
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:22.480]  secret.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.040]  The general public doesn't know this secret.
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:29.240]  I hope this secret isn't being used as leverage over Senator Graham, so today I say Senator
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:35.320]  Graham, you need to come forward and tell people about your alternative lifestyle and
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.320]  your homosexuality.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.320]  Come out of that closet, Lindsey.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:38.320]  Come out of that long-tailed closet.
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:39.320]  Barney Frank is more honest and braver than you.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:40.320]  But God, at least we know about Barney Frank.
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:54.320]  Come out of that long-tailed closet.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:10:00.360]  William Gehm is the leader of Americans for Legal Immigration, PAC, or AlleyPak, which
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.560]  is one of the largest grassroots organizations in America, fighting for more immigration,
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:08.880]  enforcement, border security against illegal immigration and amnesty.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.400]  And we appreciate him joining us.
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:16.080]  He appears regularly on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and publications like USA Today, New
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:21.760]  York Times, LA Times, and he remains steadfast and is resolved to end illegal immigration
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:22.760]  in the United States.
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:30.400]  Williamgehm.com, G-H-E-E-N.com, AlleyPak.us.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:34.720]  The problem is, the globalists want to end illegal immigration by making all the illegals
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:35.720]  completely legal.
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:42.600]  And I want to go over the state of the fight to secure the republic and save the republic
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:45.960]  from the 30 million illegal aliens that are being used by Washington's special interest
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:52.080]  in globalists to bankrupt this nation as a political weapon to vote for gun control and
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:53.560]  you name it.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:57.600]  And this is a life-and-death situation, illegal aliens last week and over the weekend rioted
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:58.600]  in Arizona.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:03.000]  It was on the local news, covered up by the national news media.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.440]  Mexico lost two wars with the U.S. They teach the kids down there to hate the U.S. Hispanics
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:12.400]  who are in America and are citizens are literally the salt of the earth.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:15.520]  From my experience, these are the best people to be Americans.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.520]  But that's two different groups.
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:22.920]  And it's time we tell the truth and come out against this and expose La Raza and Mecha
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.880]  and Auslan and all the things that are happening.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:29.520]  And Williamgehm, thank you for joining us today, sir.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:33.280]  Thanks, I just want to state, you know, one of the things that I mentioned in my speech
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.120]  that a lot of people that reacted negatively to what I had to say about Senator Graham,
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.200]  I've tried to make it as clear as possible that I had no intention to offend people who
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:43.200]  are homosexual.
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.760]  I did not try to pass judgment, although I'm a Christian, I did not try to pass judgment
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.920]  on Senator Graham's homosexuality.
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:57.320]  My concern has been that in my political experience with over 44 campaigns I've consulted and
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.760]  worked with before founding Alec back five years ago.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:01.760]  Blackmail.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:02.760]  Blackmail.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.000]  They don't like a clean person coming up to Washington, D.C. and it doesn't even have
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  to be dirt.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.240]  You know, we think of dirt as something like a bad gambling habit out of control or a very
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.040]  bad drug habit or marital infidelity.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:21.440]  All it has to be, Alex, is something that a person really doesn't want to get out there
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:23.040]  that could bring them down politically.
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:28.560]  And once they know that and the general public doesn't, they have the power to get it out.
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:32.840]  Those people that you heard cheering, they weren't cheering because I punched Lindsey
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:34.360]  Graham politically.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.600]  They were cheering because those people know about Lindsey and the rest of the world doesn't
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:41.960]  and they were so happy that someone actually said something that has the power to get the
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.960]  message out.
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.960]  Absolutely.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:48.120]  Go back over your speech.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:49.640]  It's since gone viral.
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:53.360]  You have it posted up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:58.240]  People can just Google Lindsey Graham, homosexual clip goes viral.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.520]  They can pull that up and watch the full speech for themselves.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:09.840]  But before we go there, you know, as much specifics as you can because, you know, I mean, he is
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:10.840]  a single man.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:12.360]  That's not a crime.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:15.040]  He is somewhat secretive about his lifestyle.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:20.000]  Things come out over and over again that Democratic and Republican leadership aren't just gay,
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.920]  but they're constantly, you know, chasing the pages down the halls or they're in bathrooms
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.160]  and airports soliciting sex.
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:29.520]  And we've seen this throughout history.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:35.280]  I mean, look at the Catholic Church where once these people get in on the pedophile
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.560]  subject, they only recruit other pedophiles and they then protect themselves.
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:44.080]  They then blackmail the church or the government or other institutions that you better do what
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:46.760]  we say or this whole scandal is going to come out.
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:49.760]  So this is about blackmail.
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:50.760]  Please continue.
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:53.960]  Well, again, you know, I am all about a person's privacy.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:56.680]  A lot of people out there like, oh, well, if I had something going on, I wouldn't want
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:57.680]  it out there.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:58.680]  I'm not concerned.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:04.400]  Well, no, I was concerned about Senator Graham's privacy, but his privacy is secondary to the
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.600]  proper functioning of our Republic and American lives.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.240]  If what I did the other day, even for those that disagree with me, if it ends up in saving
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:15.740]  one American life of the thousands of Americans that are being slaughtered needlessly every
[02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:21.880]  year because our borders remain forced open, then I'll take any heat that I have to take.
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:28.040]  And the thing about it is I talk to people in South Carolina and Washington, D.C. that
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:30.240]  aren't just gossips and rumor-marrel people.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:34.280]  They're movers and shakers, Democrats and Republicans, people that are near the inner
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:39.200]  circles of power in both the state and the federal government.
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:40.200]  And they know.
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:43.480]  It's like one of Washington's worst-kept secrets.
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:48.360]  And my past experience when I used to work for the Democrats when I was a younger and
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:52.880]  more liberal youth, I worked for gay politicians.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:57.800]  I discovered things about how these politicians interact with each other.
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.040]  They would compete in business and politics, much like what you described, but they would
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:06.640]  never go too far with each other, Alex, because they had the equivalent of a political nuclear
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:09.200]  weapon like each other, mutually assured disruption.
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:13.320]  They would compete in politics and business, but never go too far and collaborate quite
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:15.640]  often because they each had the ability to destroy each other.
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:20.480]  And if you did not share their perceived liability of homosexuality or whatever it was, and some
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:23.880]  of these people were married with children for the whole postcard routine, okay?
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.440]  These people, one of the things about it is not all homosexuals, but some of the homosexuals
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:34.480]  in politics are very much into creating vast and elaborate illusions that can be detrimental
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.480]  when applied to government to their lives.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:42.960]  And I picked that up all over Lindsey Graham, and I was like, you know, I am 99.5% certain
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.440]  of Graham.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:45.800]  I need to take it off the table.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:49.120]  And the only way I can take it off the table is to bust it out on that speech.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:52.760]  And you know, I get up here, Alex, and I, on these stages in front of thousands of people,
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:57.960]  I beg the federal government to take some action to stop the billions of dollars in tax resources
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.000]  being stolen from us by illegal aliens, to clean up the political corruption, to secure
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:06.600]  our borders, the thousands of Americans being murdered by illegal aliens that have been in
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.280]  and out of our local jails.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:09.280]  And nobody listens.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:10.280]  And nobody says anything.
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:15.320]  But I'm sure that one of the most powerful men in the world is a homosexual and doesn't
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:18.320]  want it to get out, and he might be enforceable because of that.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:24.640]  And all of a sudden, it's on 9,000 websites, and I'm being attacked by John Stewart and
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.440]  Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central.
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:28.160]  Well, it's not going to work.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:32.920]  I mean, Americans know that this blackmail system, whether it's money laundering, drug
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:39.600]  stealing, bribes, sexual escapades, constant, you know, administrations, I mean, look at
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:46.040]  Bush, who was for open borders and the rest of it, with the gay madam in the press corps
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:52.880]  and the hundreds of midnight visits by Jeff Gannon and his male prostitutes, Bohemian
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:57.960]  Grove being in the mainstream news, top gay porn star, Chad Savage and others, quote,
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:59.360]  servicing the moguls.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:05.640]  This is almost a rite of passage from my research to get in to the club.
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:12.440]  And this is why they're so corrupt and so easily controlled is because a large percentage
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:17.240]  and you worked in Congress, I mean, if you had to dead reckon it, sir, what percentage
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:23.280]  up there are doing things sexually, whether it's heterosexual or homosexual, that could
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.280]  destroy them?
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:29.560]  Well, it's really hard to say because, you know, organized crime is the same way, you
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:35.840]  know, they look for a person has a vice with any illegal behavior, illegal income, illicit
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:41.560]  drug use, marital affairs, homosexuality, anything like that that they can use usually
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:44.600]  involves a supply or facilitator mode.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.920]  And there seems to be this blend between both the tactics and actual financial systems of
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.680]  organized crime and our own government.
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:57.200]  Right now, I have U.S. Chamber of Commerce groups and representing Miller Brewing and
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:01.480]  Bank of America that seem to be working hand in hand with drug cartels that are importing
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.440]  all these people.
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:09.160]  And so the fusion and we see that from point south, from Mexico point south, in a lot of
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.920]  cases, the organized crime syndicates control most of if not all of some of these governments
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:19.720]  because they are multi-billion dollar heavily armed with their own private army type.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:24.280]  And that's why Mexico is merging so nicely with the whorehouse that is Washington because
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:29.640]  it's a corrupt state and the mainstream media will out a congressman if they haven't been
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:33.200]  playing ball, but they won't if they are playing ball.
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:37.440]  That's why the Internet is equalizing that now because we can just out them all.
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:40.320]  Well, they're outing their white male states.
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.320]  Look at what happened.
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.960]  Let's look at the trend lately, John Edwards and his love child, the governor, Sanford of
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:51.680]  South Carolina, Governor Elliott Spitzer of New York and his hooker, okay, The Straits,
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.960]  the last of, I will say, the white male heterosexuals in the Democratic and Republican Party.
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.680]  Yeah, that's the word I get from Washington.
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.840]  If you, they're discriminating.
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:05.600]  They're saying if you're not in our club, then, you know, being heterosexual is, I saw
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:10.000]  that in an election article where they're telling somebody he can't run because he's
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  not gay enough.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.680]  Well, there's actually been a thing out of, I think, Pennsylvania, no, excuse me, Philadelphia
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:23.080]  and a state house race up in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, a woman who is outing her male
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:26.840]  opponent claiming that he's not gay, he's hetero.
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.080]  And she's busting him out.
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:32.680]  She says he's pretending to be gay because it's such a large gay vote in the house district
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:35.920]  that he's pretending to be gay just to win the election.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.200]  And there's no outcry or backlash about the outing of a white man.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.920]  So it's almost like England where if you're not a Mason, you can't be in government and
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:46.600]  if you're not gay, you can't be in our government.
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.600]  Stay there.
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:52.360]  We're talking to a gentleman who has a lot of political power and has a very good reputation
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:54.200]  for not making stuff up.
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:55.440]  William Gean is our guest.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:57.320]  We're going to come back and get more into this situation.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.960]  He's going to give you a report on the state of our union and what's happening in Arizona.
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:06.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:10.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:15.280]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:16.600]  allows you to have.
[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:17.600]  It's true.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:22.320]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:26.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:30.640]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:34.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:37.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.520]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:46.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:47.760]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.560]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:21:01.920]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.320]  They help to create a new world order.
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:10.280]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:14.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000]  documents.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.440]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:21.920]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.680]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:28.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.960]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:35.440]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:39.920]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:40.920]  financial system.
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:43.800]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:47.520]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:48.680]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:50.320]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:51.320]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:08.440]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama but the reality that we must face in
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:10.120]  these changing economic times.
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:14.560]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion and our unfunded liabilities
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:19.840]  totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S. dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:23.040]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals.
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:24.600]  But you need to act today.

[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.720]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.600]  our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:41.600]  with precious metals.
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:48.240]  Call me Jim Newcomer at 800-686-2237 extension 104 and we'll discuss how you can take physical
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:52.200]  possession or convert your IRA into precious metals before it's too late.
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:58.960]  800-686-2237 extension 104 and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:01.440]  lifetime to establish.

[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:08.960]  anyone who has their own home service business.

[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:13.440]  Well, now you can.

[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:19.880]  Okay, we're going to cover more of the homosexual guild that is almost in full control of Washington
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:20.880]  and the state houses.
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:21.880]  You want to be a governor?
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:22.880]  You want to be a congressman?
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:23.880]  You want to be a president?
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:24.880]  You better.
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:28.080]  Well, they're even mad at the ones that like women part of the time.
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.160]  That's discriminatory against those of us that, you know, like women.
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:36.220]  I mean, I'm not here hating anybody, but we're seeing this more and more and we know that
[02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:38.220]  this has happened in other civilizations.
[02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:39.840]  Very, very bizarre.
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:45.120]  We have the head of AliPak on with us, William Gean, the leader of Americans for Legal Immigration
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:46.120]  PAC.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.840]  A-L-I-P-A-C.U-S.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:55.200]  But I noticed that Graham has now announced that he's pulling out of the carbon tax bill
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:56.200]  for now.
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:02.000]  He's supported the open border amnesty bill, but he's now angry, and it looks like it's
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.640]  time to your announcement.
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:10.280]  Well, the announcement is Senator Lieberman announced through CNN yesterday that Senator
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:15.600]  Graham has made it clear seven days after my speech, asked him to come forward with
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:17.600]  this homosexuality.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.400]  Senator Graham has announced through Lieberman that he will not support comprehensive immigration
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:26.240]  reform amnesty in 2010, and according to Senator Lieberman, he believes that that kills the
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:29.360]  bill for 2010.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.880]  So I hit him, and he backed up.
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.360]  This is Excelsior.
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:37.320]  Well, it was a rough road getting here.
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:43.360]  I want you to know that after I made that speech, I was under such a barrage of hateful
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:49.160]  messaging coming up from the 27-year-old and under-crowd Comedy Central crowd, where
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:54.120]  I was called on with everything in the book, including many things I couldn't even suggest
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:56.600]  on your radio show.
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:00.120]  Stephen Colbert got on the air, and in front of the country said that I was a man that
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:05.000]  liked to lay down in the urinal at Metz games and let other men urinate on me and pretend
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.960]  to be the toilet cake.
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:13.400]  And I listened to all this hubbub and all this firing stuff and took it completely calmly
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:18.120]  that lose any sleep over because I knew that I'd hit the nail on the head, and I knew that
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.840]  the fervent reaction was an attempt to scare me and to scare other people away from me
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.000]  and scare other people to never do what it was that I had just done.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:33.040]  This could bring down the empire that's been set up in Washington by all these guys up
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:37.200]  there with all our money having such a good time with their male escorts.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:40.840]  But absolutely, in fact, I was mentioning the carbon tax.
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:46.560]  He came out Saturday and said he's pulling out of the carbon tax, Sunday and said he's
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:48.280]  pulling out of the immigration bill.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.560]  I guess they don't have that Trump card on him anymore because why would he politically
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:58.240]  kill himself in his conservative state when he was already close to losing and very low
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.480]  in the polls because he was doing things that were so un-American?
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:08.080]  Well, you know, I'd never be able to prove it in a court of law, but I put it out there
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.080]  and the man backed up.
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:14.920]  And of course, the people that have been jumping all over my case will never tell the world
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:17.880]  that Graham backed up.
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:22.240]  But once again, if only one life is saved, but the other message that I wanted to send
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.600]  to these people in Washington, D.C. is that I'm calling for a peaceful political revolution.
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:32.480]  And when I said the words revolution in three different cities and three days during the
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:36.200]  Tea Party's, Alex, the crowd went wild by the thousands.
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:40.440]  That's what Americans want is they want a revolution and I really believe we have a
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:45.040]  chance to do it here in 2010 peacefully, politically, a velvet revolution.
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:49.680]  But I wanted to send the message, these people in D.C. who want to get their dirty deeds
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:54.080]  nation transfiguring stuff out of the way before they face the electorate, that my sleeves
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.080]  are up.
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:59.600]  And I'm going to say whatever it is I want to say because I'm a red blooded American.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:04.320]  I am a free man and I'm going to say whatever it is I want to say and I'm going to say
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:09.400]  whatever it takes and do whatever it takes to stop these people from wrecking this country.
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:13.200]  Well, William, we appreciate your courage and there's no doubt that where there's smoke,
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:14.200]  there's fire.
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.200]  And this is going on all over D.C. and these people are compromised.
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:22.400]  And the media tried to spin it that you were criticizing gay people when all you were pointing
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.920]  out is they're using this as one of the main tools of blackmail.
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:28.800]  We're going to go to break and talk about the state of the union, what just happened
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:32.320]  in Arizona, where you see things going.
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:35.560]  But before we go to the break, you're inside sources in D.C.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:39.280]  I mean, the word is Graham's just running around on the strip.
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:41.400]  I mean, he's on the street.
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:43.120]  He's running around in parks.
[02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:45.800]  I mean, is that the intel you got?
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:47.200]  He's completely protected.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.200]  He can kiss his gay lover good morning and goodbye at the door and no one's ever going
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  to say anything.
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.920]  Because even if you and I had the pictures, it wasn't going to be able to get you wouldn't
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:28:57.920]  be able to get it out.
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:03.480]  But because I did it on his doorstep in Greenville, South Carolina, and let the tape will leak,
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:08.200]  I let someone else leak it so they thought they had something on me.
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:13.440]  And then I released the full version of the speech with the other contextual information
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:18.200]  that we want Americans to know, such as illegal immigration being a plan to create an economic
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:20.240]  block and blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:25.200]  When we released it on them, the fire was already spreading and thanks to Divine Providence,
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:30.320]  it got out to tens and who knows how many millions of Americans that the story got to.
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.200]  Because if people had never heard it, you wouldn't, you know, Graham would have no incentive
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:39.240]  to stop his behavior or, you know, tell the people that might be influencing him.
[02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:44.520]  Well, you exposed the blackmail and a few days later, he capitulates.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:45.520]  Stay there.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.280]  We're going to come right back and talk about the State of the Union.
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:49.760]  Take phone calls and a lot more with our guests.
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:52.400]  This is with alipak.us.
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:53.720]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:56.160]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.160 --> 02:30:02.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:05.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:09.680]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:10.680]  do you want?
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:16.200]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:17.680]  Food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:18.920]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:20.000]  When do you want it?
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.960]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:23.080]  When will you need it?
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:25.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:26.560]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:28.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.160]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:33.320]  and be immunized?
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:37.080]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:40.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:41.920]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:42.920]  We don't know.
[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:43.920]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:44.920]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:45.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:49.080]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:55.920]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:01.760]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:02.760]  What's your home worth?
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:04.960]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:07.960]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:11.800]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house,

[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:05.720]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:09.080]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:13.200]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.200]  documents.
[02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:18.640]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:21.120]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:23.880]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:27.200]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:32.160]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:34.640]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:39.120]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:40.120]  financial system.
[02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:42.960]  The global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:46.680]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:49.040]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:29.440]  to get out on.
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:32.880]  We're gaining two to three affiliates a week.
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:38.880]  We're keeping all of our affiliates, XMs picked us up six days a week because this information
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:42.000]  sounded radical 10 years ago or even a year ago.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.400]  It isn't radical now.
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:46.360]  The people know we're in trouble.
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:50.200]  And I just want to ask listeners to financially support us by buying the books, the t-shirts,
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:52.000]  the ball caps, the videos.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.200]  All of it is about getting the message out at infowars.com.
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:59.480]  We've released two new films in the last two weeks, Invisible Empire, new order to find.
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:06.680]  The by the way, covers the gay pedophile scandals and how they control in blackmail people long
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:09.880]  before this came out of this new information.
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.400]  That's about 15 minutes of the two hour, 20 something minute film.
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:17.360]  We have police state for the rise of FEMA showing this control grid being built for
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:21.960]  the American people, both of those on DVD at infowars.com and I want to thank you all
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:22.960]  for your support.
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:28.320]  Again, you can go to infowars.com to produce the online video, bookstore slash patriot
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:38.040]  apparel area or you can call toll free 888-253-3139-888-2533139.
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:44.920]  William Gehm who heads up alipak.us, really the premier group that is exposing what's
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:45.920]  happening.
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:49.320]  And I was talking to William during a break and he said, you know, Alex, I learned about
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:50.920]  the plan of San Diego from you.
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:54.880]  Well, I just learned about it by going to an illegal alien rally.
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:00.000]  They were wearing these green t-shirts and I was told by Hispanic friend and then another
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.640]  rally by a UT professor who spoke Spanish.
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:04.160]  Do you know what that means?
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:06.520]  It means the plan and William corrected me.
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:10.480]  It was kill everybody 14 and above who are Americans.
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:13.560]  And now again, that doesn't represent all of the illegal alien lobby, but that's the
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:20.080]  extremism that's in there and it's mainstream to want Oslo and the takeover of the Southwest.
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:25.040]  We're going to explain that with William Gehm here in just a moment, but first I wanted
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:27.920]  to get your take on what's happening in Arizona.
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:32.360]  The feds coming in saying they're going to try to block it and where do you see this
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:33.360]  fight going?
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:37.640]  Well, Alex, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about the plan of San Diego and
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:41.400]  the radical elements that are involved in illegal immigration, a video that we hope to
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:49.000]  release tomorrow from Phoenix, you know, after SB 1070 passed, hundreds if not thousands
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.920]  of illegal aliens assaulted Americans and police officers.
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:56.640]  And there was a mini riot, if you want to call a couple hundred, a couple of thousand
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:59.120]  people doing it, a mini riot.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:03.720]  But we have a video of this woman screaming something along the lines of our shovels and
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.200]  our pickaxes that we use to break the earth and do your landscaping.
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:10.400]  We will use them against you, believe it.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:14.240]  There's a big difference between what's going on on the streets and what's being pumped
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:19.280]  into the cheeseheads through the alphabet media in this country.
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:21.160]  Americans have lost their street smarts.
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:26.520]  Right now, though, Arizona has stood with 70% of her people and about 80% of the American
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:32.200]  people that favor local police enforcing immigration law, because right now the illegal aliens
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  are the blessed ones.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.280]  They just catch them and let them go.
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:38.400]  They treat them much easier than American citizens.
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:40.360]  They can get away with murder.
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:45.360]  They don't need a social security number for a bank thing if you press two for Spanish
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  with Bank of America.
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:49.160]  You go through a lot of set of rules.
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:51.160]  The elites have cleared the way over there.
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:52.160]  That's right.
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:53.920]  Citizens have to have social security numbers, everything else.
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:56.240]  The illegals are just left alone and don't have to have it.
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:01.120]  And we have all these amnesty and sanctuary cities where they're allowed to drunk, drive
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:03.080]  and be released over and over again.
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:04.680]  Why are they so precious?
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:05.680]  What is the plan?
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:07.840]  Why do the elites want to do this?
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:13.080]  Because in my opinion, and once again, the folks that support alipak.us that are on our
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.240]  email alert system, they have a lot of different beliefs about why this is happening.
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:21.200]  We can all disagree on the why, Alex, what we have to agree on is what to do about it.
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:26.200]  But my personal, I guess you would say, professional opinion is that there have been economic unions
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:32.760]  forged in every major hemisphere of the planet, Asia, Europe, Africa, and most recently, Amerisol,
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:37.280]  whatever they form down there in South America where they're going to have the loan currency
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:39.480]  for the whole continent.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:40.480]  Americans would never go for that.
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:46.560]  We're very distinct, free people, and we would certainly never voluntarily vote for or support
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:50.600]  merging our nations with a place like Canada or Mexico.
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:54.440]  Canada doesn't allow Second Amendment rights or First Amendment rights like America does.
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:59.600]  And Mexico is a third world money pit that would cost trillions to try to bring it up
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:02.720]  to our standards, and even then, no telling if it would hold or not.
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:03.720]  So, what do you do?
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:07.760]  If you want to build an economic union and the people of America are the most free people
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:11.800]  on the planet, and oh, yes, that's right, historically, they're the people that have
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:15.680]  the latest record for standing up to people that want to do this type of global stuff
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.560]  and telling them, no, and shutting it down, what do you do to overpower them?
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:20.840]  What do you do to enslave them?
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:22.080]  What do you do to replace them?
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:23.080]  What do you do to degrade them?
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:25.520]  You certainly don't attack them like a pearl harbor.
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:26.720]  You don't want to get their ire up.
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:29.280]  You don't want to get their industrial base up.
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:31.520]  You wear them down with the death of a thousand cuts.
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:33.400]  Take away their ability to produce things.
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:38.240]  And you systematically put people of different ethnicities and races and nationalities from
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:43.200]  around the world in positions of elevated power and authority over the American citizens
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:45.160]  until we couldn't fight back.
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:49.120]  We're so trapped in that all of a sudden, they're going to merge the economies, and
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.200]  they're telling us now that they've already merged the labor force, and they merged the
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:56.320]  consumer markets, and they're telling us that even though our Constitution existing
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:59.640]  laws say that they can't do that, that it's not going to change.
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:05.000]  So take Obama last week when he criticized what Arizona was doing.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.480]  He was at a commencement for people who'd been in the military years who were just now
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:12.200]  getting their green cards.
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:18.040]  So and we know the biggest Army Marine Corps recruiting centers in Mexico City are militaries
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:19.880]  being converted into foreigners.
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.600]  They're just wearing American uniforms.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:22.600]  Yeah.
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:25.780]  The last thing there, they're suppressing freedom of speech with the attacks and the
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:30.800]  race card, they're trying to pass the amnesty to turn 15-plus million illegal aliens and
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:34.520]  soon to be their relatives into voters to replace it with a ballot box, and the last
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:35.880]  thing they'll do is take up the guns.
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:39.320]  They will take up the guns last because we're some of the last people, free people on the
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:44.320]  planet that has private gun ownership, and they want to touch that one lastly.
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.040]  But their plan is in jeopardy, Alex.
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:49.720]  Their plan is in jeopardy because they know that a heavy political hand is going to fall
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:55.760]  this November, and they know that their time to get this amnesty through has pretty much
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:56.760]  expired.
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:03.200]  So I would tell the public that in my book, once their political options are out, then
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:08.000]  the real, real crazy stuff that I don't want to get into today can start happening as they
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.040]  try to continue this, elitist.
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:11.360]  No, let's get into it.
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:12.760]  They're going to activate the groups.
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.400]  It was what Rob Allen and Co. out of Dallas with George Bush five years ago was in the
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:22.320]  Dallas Morning News that actually funded the illegal alien rallies, and the establishment
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:26.480]  is going to activate the illegals to burn down major cities and call them civil rights
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.040]  activists, and the government is going to stage terror attacks and blame it on the Tea
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:31.040]  Parties.
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:34.040]  And then when the illegals riot, they're called freedom fighters.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:36.880]  When citizens even have free speech, we're going to be called racist.
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:40.760]  Well, where I would diverge with you on that, Alex, is that the illegals riot, I think it's
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:41.760]  all over for them.
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:43.720]  I think the American public is waking up.
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.920]  The question is, are they waking up fast now, and they start burning stuff on a major scale.
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:49.960]  It's all going down.
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:54.400]  But you're right about cracking down on us, and that's another thing back to Lindsey Graham.
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:41:00.560]  Senator Graham was sitting down at the negotiating table with Senator Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama,
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:07.120]  and your favorite of mine, Janet Napolitano, the chief of Homeland Security, whose business
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:10.600]  it is to be in your business and know all of your business.
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:13.960]  She's the keeper of secrets, the knower of secrets.
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:19.400]  And Graham's sitting down with her, and every member of Congress, she's lobbying Congress
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  for amnesty.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:25.640]  Our top law enforcer in the country is setting their lobbying members of Congress for amnesty.
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:31.040]  Now, tell me, Alex, do you feel that gives a certain information, access, advantage to
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:32.040]  the lobbyist?
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:37.920]  It absolutely does, and we have Homeland Security in the Mayak and Homeland Security reports
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:42.520]  that we were given by law enforcement last year saying their main enemy is the American
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:49.080]  people, and we also now have the FBI director saying he's worried about domestic groups
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:50.480]  as al-Qaeda.
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.880]  So we're now learning this is all for us, the true Americans, regardless of what color
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:55.880]  we are.
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:41:59.320]  If you're for sovereignty and if you're for the Bill of Rights, you're the enemy, and
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:05.240]  Janet Napolitano is spying on you, and she's there promoting total legalization of the
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:06.520]  illegal aliens.
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:12.720]  Now, there are other people around this scenario that have what I consider to be Graham's
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:17.240]  shared secret, and the messages to them look like this happened to your boy, Lindsey.
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:22.200]  So let's not have to go there, and all they really need to do, and I don't know if they
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  can do it.
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:28.040]  I don't know if some of them can find it in their heart like the Grinch did one day to
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:31.400]  back off trying to wreck this country or not.
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:36.120]  It would be great if they would just stand down and let things return here and let the
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:41.920]  people of the United States have back our government and civilian control of the U.S.
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:47.640]  government immediately because I don't think that violence can be avoided if that doesn't
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:51.840]  happen, and people like me who advocate for peace and political measures, I'm running
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:52.840]  out of time, Alex.
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:43:00.400]  When they start demonizing tens of millions of Americans as threats to the nation because
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:04.760]  of their politics, because of their political views, I'm not being hyperbolic.
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:09.400]  I'm not engaging in the name calling that goes on.
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:16.280]  When I say as a political scientist that I believe you have to go back to Nazi Germany
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:22.080]  or Joseph Stalin's Russia to find examples of that happening.
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:24.240]  Well, absolutely.
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:31.120]  I mean, did you see the ADL come out and say that opponents of Obamacare and opponents
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:36.720]  of amnesty are racist and need to have law enforcement used against them, and they're
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:41.240]  now all over the news saying maybe we should shut down the Internet, maybe we should shut
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:42.240]  down free speech?
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:44.240]  I mean, they know they're criminal.
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:45.720]  They know they've robbed the country blind.
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:48.760]  They know we're waking up to the banking takeover that's happening.
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:49.760]  We know the big J.P.
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:54.480]  Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs is the world, Ford Foundation, you name it, are funding
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:56.360]  the illegals.
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:01.760]  We know they want to bring in this North American Union and break our back.
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:02.760]  So they're all in.
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:03.760]  They're going for broke.
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:07.640]  That's why I tell everybody out there listening, this is it.
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:12.120]  For the last year and a half, Alipak and many of our allies, we've been trying to stop
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:13.800]  three things we've called the nation breakers.
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:17.800]  I think I may have even mentioned this on your show early in the year last year.
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.760]  We've been trying to stop them from officially silencing free speech because this conversation
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:25.160]  between you and me would not fly in Canada and both of us would be in front of a tribunal
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:31.040]  professor that you can shake a leg to try to stop them from abridging Second Amendment
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:34.600]  rights and try to stop them from passing the amnesty.
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:36.080]  We've done that for the most part.
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:42.400]  I mean, they may spring back up with the amnesty and resurrected vampire bill again, but folks,
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:46.480]  the primaries that are going on right now in this country, like down in Arizona between
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:47.480]  J.D.
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:50.520]  Hayworth and John McCain, you better know who the people, friend of the person people
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:51.520]  is and who isn't.
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:52.520]  Okay.
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:57.560]  You better get rid of John McCain, who suddenly has gone from being the Maverick Commie to
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:59.040]  now being Mr. Patriot.
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:00.920]  We've got to get rid of John McCain.
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:05.360]  John McCain came out as Mr. Secure Borders on the Monday after I traveled through three
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:09.520]  cities with thousands of people chanting, Secure the Borders, Secure the Borders.
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:16.640]  And when I mentioned the names Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, John McCain and
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:18.920]  Lindsey Graham, they booed them all.
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:23.880]  They didn't just boo the Democrats, Alex, the Tea Party folks booed them all.
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.240]  Those Tea Party people that are being maligned out there are the people who play by the rules
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:31.680]  in this country, some of the safest, nicest people pick up their own trash when they leave
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:34.160]  people in the country and they're being demonized.
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:36.280]  And I saw something that I want to mention on your show.
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:37.600]  I haven't said to anybody.
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:43.280]  I was trying to get out of Houston to get to Nashville for my second gig on Friday the
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:45.560]  16th at the Murfreesboro.
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.120]  And I was very tired and I came through security and I'm trying to get my shoes on right because
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:54.600]  you know in airport security, it's hard sometimes to get your shoes on right there and I sit
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:56.560]  down and I look up.
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.720]  And there is this heavy set black woman in a little room that looks like a see-through
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:03.760]  wall room like maybe blast panels.
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:05.240]  They were grabbing her breast.
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:12.400]  No, they had a 75 plus year old little old Tennessee lady out of her wheelchair and had
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:18.440]  her standing there, not just wanting her but groping her and wanting her and for 10 minutes
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:23.280]  I'm staring and her son or whoever the relative is standing back there with her wheelchair
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:24.280]  is waiting and watching.
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.000]  And I just stared and I'm like, there's something so wrong here and there were finally wheeling
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  out.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:34.920]  I approached and I was like, ma'am, I just want to say that is one of the wildest things
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.960]  I've ever seen in my life.
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:39.240]  And the guy's like, well, we're used to it when we travel.
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:44.200]  And I said, well, you know, to my knowledge, a little old lady over 70s never harmed an
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:47.160]  aircraft in the history of aviation.
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:52.280]  They're putting Americans like me, like this little old lady, making her stand out of her
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:54.480]  wheelchair and go through this degradation.
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:59.080]  And Alex, if you, if you or I lived to be 75 years old, may it not to be get groped down
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:00.280]  in public in front of people.
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:01.280]  Oh, let me stop you.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:08.280]  Christina Ebersol is a movie star called me Sunday and she's coming on tomorrow.
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:12.320]  She was flying through and they were, they demanded to grab her breast.
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:17.000]  And now as an, and they admit it's an act of humiliation, naked body scanners, they grab
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:21.200]  the woman's breast, they squeeze, they grab your genitals and squeeze.
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.400]  And it's, we're the government, we own you now.
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:24.900]  It's brainwashing.
[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:26.880]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:28.440]  And I was going to go one further.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:34.040]  We've been on planes and my crew's seen it with illegal aliens being led on planes without
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:35.040]  IDs.
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:36.040]  So.
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:42.440]  And our air marshals have been instructed not to tamper with illegal agents, even when
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:46.080]  there's large groups of 20 or 30 of them, and they're all bragging in Spanish about
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:49.880]  how they're illegal and flying on a plane because it's, it's, it's nothing but a red
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:50.880]  carpet.
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:54.360]  And I saw an AP article, I guess it was four years ago, I don't know if you saw this and
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:57.680]  I forget the exact headline, but I covered it for a whole week on air and it was something
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:02.600]  like, you know, bank heads say they're helping, helping immigrants.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:08.080]  And the article said, we give housing loans to illegals with no money and basically no
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.920]  ID to help them.
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:18.640]  I mean, again, it's, it's, I had an, a, a, a IT guy, he's not an employee, he's a contractor.
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:22.600]  One night we had some problems, I had to come let him in, it was about nine o'clock at night.
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:26.560]  I pull up and there's three police cars, they're putting him in handcuffs.
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:28.560]  His driver's license had expired.
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:29.560]  Guess what?
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:32.600]  I sent in for mine three months ago, it never came.
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:33.800]  Mine is now expired.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:36.840]  So as a citizen in Austin, I will be arrested if they pull me over.
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:40.040]  I mean, that's the new America because, but, but, but, but, but hold on.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  I said to the cops, I said, if he was an illegal, you'd let him go.
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.520]  And they laughed and said, yeah, we're told to let him go because the judge would just
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:47.520]  let him go.
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:52.320]  You know, citizens have the book thrown at them, but illegals are just, you are God.
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:54.720]  Just, I mean, again, go ahead.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:49:00.440]  Well, and if they legalize them as they intend to do, I have been telling people now, you
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:05.200]  need to envision a future where the people that come to try to collect your taxes, the
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:08.880]  people that show up as your law enforcement, the people that'll be groping you in the airport
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:13.160]  are people who used to be illegal immigrants that are now citizens and being put in positions
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:14.160]  of authority over you.
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:15.720]  Oh, that already happens.
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:19.760]  I had a member of the British parliament on and he said that most of the CPS workers kidnapped
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:23.800]  in people's kids are foreigners who can't even speak English and I've been in big cities
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:25.040]  and already seen this.
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.200]  The foreigners are to rule us.
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:31.560]  Well, I'm, you know, Alex, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you being on top of
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:32.560]  this.
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:36.000]  A lot of people in talk radio being still being on top of this.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.800]  When I, when I singled out Senator Graham, when I, when I released this secret, I got
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:46.600]  to tell you there are some people inside politics that you ever get in a fight, about to get
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:49.720]  in a fight as a bully of the kid and some buddies you thought you could trust tell you
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:52.400]  that they think they hear their mom calling.
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:57.480]  That's, that's where I was at last week, but talk radio host around this country.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:01.600]  A lot of you folks, you were right there with me and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:05.760]  that because when a lot of people ran away, you don't, you don't run Alex and I appreciate
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:06.760]  that.
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:07.760]  Well, we appreciate you.
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:10.080]  One final segment after this quick break to cover any issues you want to cover and where
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:14.400]  you see this fight going, but anybody else you're going to be outing, anybody else being
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:19.960]  blackmailed for drugs, money, hopefully not in the near future.
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:25.960]  One U.S. Senator every six months is my limit, but you do know about a lot of others.
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:31.880]  I'm going to, I'm going to say and do whatever I need to do to help restore civilian control
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:32.880]  of the U.S. government.
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:37.400]  Well, let me say this, William, you better say right now on air, you're not planning
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:38.400]  to commit suicide.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:42.360]  I'm straight, I don't mess around with hookers or heroin.
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:43.640]  I am not suicidal.
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:47.400]  I love life, my family, flowers and puppies.
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:48.400]  Absolutely.
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:49.400]  Wow.
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:56.720]  William Gean is our guest, alipac.us, alipag.us, got to support what they're doing, they're
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:57.720]  defending the Republic.
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:01.200]  We'll come back, final segment with our guests with other issues he wants to cover, stay
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:02.200]  with us.
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:05.400]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've got to try my pillow.

[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:10.440]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:14.120]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:15.120]  documents.
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:19.600]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.080]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:24.840]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:28.160]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:33.080]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:52:33.080 --> 02:52:35.600]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:40.040]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:41.040]  financial system.
[02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:43.960]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:47.640]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:48.800]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:50.480]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:00.920 --> 02:54:13.520]  Well I've said it many times.
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:17.120]  If somebody in government is doing corrupt things stealing private property, running
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:21.000]  illegal checkpoints, you name it they're going to be involved in corruption.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.720]  And I've gone to the state house and caught bribery that's brought people down.
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:26.600]  I've sent city officials to prison.
[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:31.560]  If you just start following these politicians around with video cameras, start a blog, say
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:33.520]  you're a journalist, that's what you are.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:38.040]  They are so corrupt you're going to find hookers, drug dealing, things you can't even imagine.
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:46.080]  This is a criminal group that runs our society, William Gehm of Alipak.
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:50.040]  The problem is we have legalization of the illegals by fiat.
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:53.040]  For me it's not even if they're illegal, it's that they're above the law and given a red
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:54.040]  carpet treatment.
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:57.720]  You see the tide shifting against that.
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:01.200]  Well both sides of this debate, and you're not going to see this in every part of the
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:06.080]  country, but both sides, the enforcement side, my side, and the anti-study side, we all agree
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:11.880]  that illegal immigration is starting to reverse because of the bad economy and increased enforcement
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:13.480]  mostly on the state level.
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:19.160]  We're down from about 2 million illegal immigrants according to the scientific analysis as best
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:20.160]  we can get.
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:24.160]  That's something that we promise people could happen for three years.
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:25.160]  How many million?
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:27.480]  How many million did you just say?
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:30.840]  They're still coming in, but they're leaving faster than they're coming in, and they believe
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:34.040]  that we're down 2 million, 1 million per year for the last two years.
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:38.560]  Yeah, but the numbers I've seen are as high as 30 million illegals being in the country.
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:40.720]  You're agreeing on the number of 15 million?
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:45.760]  I'm saying that the official numbers have been dropped from 12 to 10, and that is a
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:49.160]  big setback for those that want to amnesty because it's proving that enforcement works
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:52.040]  and that we don't have to deport millions of illegal aliens by hand.
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:53.680]  But what about Mexico collapsing?
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:56.840]  I mean, shouldn't we protect the border just with that happening?
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:00.240]  Well, right now, the only way you and I could protect the border would be to go running
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:02.360]  down there with guns and be vigilantes.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:07.840]  Right now, what we need people doing is, one, defending the state of Arizona, two, taking
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:14.600]  SB 1070, take copies of it, call it in, mail it in, carry it to your state house, members,
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.760]  carry it to your state centers, tell them I want this bill in my state.
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:19.760]  Let's take Arizona.
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:21.160]  Let's spread it around the country.
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:23.600]  Three, let's take the momentum we've got right now.
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:24.600]  You've got to understand.
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:26.880]  Obama and Reid and them, they're going to keep saying, we're going to pass amnesty in
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:27.880]  a minute.
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:32.360]  We're going to do it any minute because they're trying to get their illegal alien supporting
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:34.600]  base from breaking.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:39.480]  Their morale is being broken by our side right now, and they're trying to keep that morale
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:43.880]  up because they think it's going to hurt their illegal alien voters' turnout level
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:45.400]  this November.
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:47.760]  John McCain, he must go down.
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:50.840]  J.D. Hayworth must beat John McCain.
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:55.600]  If John McCain wins, he's going to pop up the month after the election and turn around
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:59.040]  and be for amnesty again instead of secure borders and demoralize people across this
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:03.440]  country, just like Bush did right before the last two election cycles.
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:06.640]  Bush started pushing amnesty two weeks before people voted, Alex, and he did it to throw
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:08.840]  his own people down the drain.
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:12.880]  John McCain needs to go down to J.D. Hayworth, and everybody out there listening that thinks
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:13.880]  that they can't make a difference.
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:18.640]  They need to learn how to become a political activist, pick up a phone, tie in with groups,
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:21.320]  get involved with primaries and elections now.
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:25.400]  By the way, we didn't even get into the crime, the crime way of the illegal.
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:26.880]  Spend 60 seconds on that.
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:30.560]  Well, we know, we don't know the exact numbers, but we know that thousands of Americans are
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:32.160]  being killed each year by illegal aliens.
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:37.160]  God knows how many tens of thousands of children are being molested, billions of dollars in
[02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:41.280]  stolen property and vehicles, billions of dollars in stolen tax resources.
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:45.760]  That's not to say that every illegal alien or even most are, you know, gravitously violent
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  criminals.
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:48.640]  But yes, all illegal aliens are criminals.
[02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:52.280]  They break several laws, including document fraud and identity theft that wreck American
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:53.280]  lives.
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:54.280]  Americans are taking a hit.
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:59.400]  26 Ways of Sunday on this, and nobody will do anything about it and speak out against
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:00.400]  it.
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:01.400]  You're a big racist, violent person.
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:03.360]  That's just not the case.
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:08.160]  And you know, Arizona, once their crime rate starts dropping after they put this law in
[02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:11.440]  to effect, it's going to be another big reason.
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:13.000]  Yeah, it's just like concealed carry.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:18.280]  When they pass that crime goes down to over 20%, and that really proved that fact.
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:20.760]  And the American people have found their legs.
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.760]  They've stood up.
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:23.160]  They don't care what people say about them.
[02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:24.520]  They're going to tell the truth.
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:26.640]  And that's really starting to scare the system, isn't it?
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:27.640]  It is.
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:32.880]  And I hope that your listeners will give us their support at alipak.us, that's A-L-I-P-A-C
[02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:38.600]  dot U-S, please get on our email alerts, join the fight against illegal immigration and
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:39.600]  against Amnesty.
[02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:40.600]  Thank you, William.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:41.600]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:42.600]  Take care.
[02:58:42.600 --> 02:58:53.120]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:57.080]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[02:58:57.080 --> 02:58:58.720]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.720 --> 02:59:02.760]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:03.760]  or gold?
[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:04.760]  It's true.
[02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:07.680]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:09.280]  that could even happen again.
[02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:13.840]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:59:13.840 --> 02:59:14.840]  seeds.
[02:59:14.840 --> 02:59:19.760]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[02:59:19.760 --> 02:59:21.640]  food for you and your family.
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:22.640]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.640 --> 02:59:26.960]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[02:59:26.960 --> 02:59:29.440]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:32.680]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:32.680 --> 02:59:37.720]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:42.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:48.480]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:58.680]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:58.680 --> 03:00:14.920]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:14.920 --> 03:00:18.280]  This is the fourth and final hour today.
[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:20.720]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:27.880]  Yes, Lindsey Graham, who was the deciding vote in the Senate on open borders, one of
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:33.800]  the deciding votes on the carbon tax after being outed reportedly as being blackmailed
[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:42.400]  for being a homosexual, he has now pulled out of those two un-American activities.
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:43.400]  This is very exciting.
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:47.360]  Now, I apologize to not take any more calls today when I opened the phone up earlier,
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:51.880]  but I do want to get into the banking takeover, the testimony today, big developments on the
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:52.880]  economy.
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:58.320]  I want to get into some vaccine developments and several other issues coming up.
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:04.360]  So, this will be a jam-packed final hour today, but right now, we're going to go back to
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:05.360]  your calls.
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:06.840]  Mike and Indiana, you're on the air.
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:07.840]  Thanks for holding.
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:12.840]  Well, hello, Mr. Gean, I appreciate everything you guys do.
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:14.360]  You guys are true patriots.
[03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:18.200]  Well, Mr. Gean is gone now, but you're with me.
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:19.200]  Go ahead.
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:20.200]  Okay.
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:24.960]  I'd still like to thank him for coming out and talking to us.
[03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:31.160]  This might be off of what you were talking about with the things going on, but these
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:36.880]  stones, Georgia stones, almost thousands of people would stand there and go against these
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:38.280]  Georgia guide stones.
[03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:39.280]  I don't know how they're...
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:44.000]  Yeah, it was put up by UN Foundation, and it calls for the world population to be reduced
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  to 500 million.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:49.840]  Yeah, and it's in Aberdeen County, and it just so happens that the county is named
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:52.480]  after a revolutionary ward general.
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:57.000]  How ironic is it to have them stones sitting there?
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:02.520]  Well, it's trees on us, Mike, but what did you think about hearing from the director
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:06.320]  of Alley Pact talking about how blackmail is used to control the congressman?
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:12.760]  I mean, why would Graham go 180 degrees in the opposite direction of the Constitution,
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.640]  the Bill of Rights, and his constituents unless he was being blackmailed?
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:22.280]  And now he didn't come out and defend himself when the news cameras went up and asked him
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:23.720]  about it on YouTube.
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:28.560]  He almost started crying in the Capitol building and just wouldn't even respond.
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:37.560]  So I mean, it's incredible how they're using these people and their private lives as blackmail.
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:42.240]  And then the media turns it around against William Geene like he's bashing gay people
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:44.160]  when that's not what he was doing.
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:48.880]  He's there pointing out that this is being used to blackmail these individuals.
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:50.080]  But see, that's what this is all about.
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:51.720]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:53.160]  Let's talk to Kathy in Florida.
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:54.160]  You're on the air, Kathy.
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:55.160]  Go ahead.
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:02:56.160]  Hi, Alex.
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:58.280]  I also want to salute Mr. Geene.
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:03.680]  I loved his message, and I understand why the PC crowd is against him.
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:05.760]  Have you ever seen the picture of the liberal brain?
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:06.760]  No, I haven't.
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:08.960]  Oh, I have to send that to you.
[03:03:08.960 --> 03:03:12.840]  They have a tiny particle for common sense.
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:14.200]  Everybody would love to see this.
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:20.000]  And I also have a pledge to help them see the lunacy of their position.
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:21.520]  It's like a five-part pledge.
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:22.640]  Just take a minute.
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:27.400]  I will drink all the government Kool-Aid provided and or mandated.
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:32.480]  Number two, I will willingly give all they ask as I realize I am lucky they let me keep
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:34.600]  any of what I earn.
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:39.680]  Number three, I will not ask questions that do not need to be asked as I know these people
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:42.820]  are either racists and or troublemakers.
[03:03:42.820 --> 03:03:48.480]  Number four, I will gladly offer up my children to their PC garbage training centers because
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:52.960]  common sense only causes people to ask those unneeded questions.
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:57.760]  Last but not least, I will willingly bend over and kiss my behind goodbye.
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:02.640]  And number six, I realize that government created the sun, the galaxy, the universe,
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:03.640]  and the green grass.
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:04.640]  They make the fish swim.
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:06.360]  They make the birds tweet.
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:07.360]  Government is God.
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:08.360]  I love Goldman Sachs.
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:09.360]  Take all my money.
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:10.360]  I am scum.
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:11.360]  You are God.
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:12.360]  You are the government.
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:13.360]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:19.240]  We are going to come back and go to John, Tom, Stephen, and others, toll-free number
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:24.320]  to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:28.960]  Coming up, they have suspended vaccinations in Australia because it was killing people.
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:31.840]  But when they have deaths here from vaccines, they increase it.
[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:34.120]  It is like, oh, good, it is working.
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:37.960]  Also the government is now admitting they have secretly taken baby's DNA at birth for
[03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:38.960]  37-plus years.
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:43.000]  I know that is old news for you listeners, but it is back in the mainstream today.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:48.400]  I have also got a big stack on the latest banking takeover that is happening.
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:51.440]  They are coming in, trying to take over our financial system.
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:53.640]  They are trying to get rid of our sovereignty and our borders.
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:04:57.800]  They are trying to launch new wars with Iran.
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:05:00.720]  They have taken over healthcare.
[03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:01.720]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.720 --> 03:05:07.240]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:10.040]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:15.040]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:19.840]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:25.240]  Wow, they have my original remote and an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[03:06:51.360 --> 03:07:05.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:09.720]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:07:09.720 --> 03:07:10.720]  do you want?
[03:07:10.720 --> 03:07:12.720]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:17.760]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:18.960]  How much do you want?
[03:07:18.960 --> 03:07:19.960]  When do you want it?
[03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:22.000]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:23.120]  When will you need it?
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:25.240]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:26.600]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:28.040]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:32.200]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:33.360]  and be immunized?
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:37.160]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:40.720]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:41.960]  How much will you need?
[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:42.960]  We don't know.
[03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:43.960]  How much do you want?
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:44.960]  All you can get.
[03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:45.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:45.960 --> 03:07:49.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:56.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:13.280]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:13.280 --> 03:08:16.480]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., central standard time.
[03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:18.040]  We are here live.
[03:08:18.040 --> 03:08:19.440]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:23.720]  Okay, I'm going to go back to your phone calls and I'm going to get into all the huge developments
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:28.000]  on the One Child Policy that CNN and others are promoting here in the United States.
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:33.960]  Meanwhile, China to sterilize 10,000 to curb births in one town alone to give you an idea
[03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:39.800]  of the type of system that we are going under, the ultimate oppression here.
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:42.360]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[03:08:42.360 --> 03:08:43.680]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[03:08:43.680 --> 03:08:44.680]  John, you're on the air.
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:51.440]  Yeah, I've begun to read an article on global research, global research.ca about how the
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:59.000]  CIA is really responsible for this kind of drug trafficking lawlessness and anarchy in
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.160]  Mexico and is really behind it.
[03:09:01.160 --> 03:09:05.640]  You'll find on global research those kinds of things, the fact that the United States
[03:09:05.640 --> 03:09:11.400]  supported the guy who stole the election, Cardona, against the guy who won the election,
[03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:16.680]  Salvador, who doesn't want enough to get and wants a fair shake for the people in their
[03:09:16.680 --> 03:09:17.680]  country.
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:19.920]  Well, John, hold on just a minute.
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:25.120]  I mean, if you watch Fabled Enemies, our new film, 30 minutes of it covers that.
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:28.280]  It sounds like you're almost implying that we don't cover that.
[03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:34.080]  We've been reporting for a decade that there has been a U.S. government-backed war against
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.680]  cartels that aren't laundering their money through Western banks and that Mexico was
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:44.280]  going to implode in this war, and we are exposing the fact that it is our government that is
[03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:49.840]  engineering this lawlessness just like the British brought down China through opium importations.
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:55.840]  We know about skull and bones, founding the CIA out of the OSS, and that we have a narcotics-travinging
[03:09:55.840 --> 03:10:00.760]  government that keeps drugs illegal so that they can have higher prices on it.
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:05.800]  So I totally agree with you on that, and then the current Mexican president clearly stole
[03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:07.160]  the election down there as well.
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:08.960]  That's why the country is an open rebellion.
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:14.120]  That's why we can't let the U.S. be used as a steam valve for all these people from
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:15.120]  Mexico.
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:17.640]  We need to make them stay down there to get their nation back.
[03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:22.120]  I mean, Mexico has tripled the resources that the United States has, but has an incredibly
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:27.160]  poor population because they have this plutocracy or this kleptocracy down there running it.
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:32.000]  I understand, but I think that is the thing that has to be emphasized, that Avon Santo-Cargill
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:36.640]  and Archer Daniel Midlands have blasted their agriculture and their economy down there forcing
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:38.120]  these people to come here.
[03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:44.360]  The enemies are right here, and I think that you do a great job on the false flag terrorism,
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:49.920]  the Wall Street hoax, the global warming hoax, the police state, but you contradict yourself
[03:10:49.920 --> 03:10:54.240]  constantly when it comes to something like this Arizona situation where you're going
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:58.680]  to have Nazi-style people being told that if they haven't got their driver's license
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:04.400]  or their visa, and if they've got a tan or a dark complexion or a policeman says that
[03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:12.120]  he just pretends to think that they may be an illegal or undocumented person from Mexico,
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:13.520]  they can do this to anybody.
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:15.080]  No, I appreciate your call.
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:17.720]  That is not what's going on, John.
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:21.400]  In Austin, Texas, they don't arrest illegal alien drunk drivers.
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:22.400]  They don't have to have IDs.
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:27.800]  I just saw the Wall Street Journal to get bank accounts, but citizens do.
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:32.760]  Illegal aliens get let through the airport on record when citizens have to go through
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:35.560]  these strip searches, okay?
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:36.560]  You don't understand.
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:40.920]  The globalists, the big banks are four open borders in the North American Union.
[03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:43.880]  It's you that are contradicting yourself.
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:50.520]  All they're saying is that they're going to use the same laws they use against citizens
[03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:52.840]  against the illegal aliens in Arizona.
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:54.000]  This is a crisis.
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:12:00.480]  The New World Order's key is overrunning sovereign nations with outside populations they can use
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:02.640]  as a political weapon, okay?
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:03.640]  It's simple, John.
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:06.320]  I'm against the attack on Iran because the globalists are for it.
[03:12:06.320 --> 03:12:08.600]  I'm against open borders because the globalists are for it.
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:12.760]  I'm against bailing out these big banks because the big banks run the country and they designed
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:16.240]  it, and I told you a year and a half ago it was premeditated, and now we have the Goldman
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:18.680]  Sachs emails proving it was premeditated.
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:20.400]  You're the one that's wrong, okay?
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:24.360]  The New World Order wants to destroy this once free country, okay?
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:29.080]  They got checkpoints in Austin where they take blood from citizens without warrants,
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:30.080]  okay?
[03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:31.600]  We're not talking about that.
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:35.360]  We're talking about if they pull over a car full of 10 illegal aliens and none of them
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:39.560]  have IDs and the driver's drunk, they're going to go to jail, and then they're going to
[03:12:39.560 --> 03:12:41.060]  get deported.
[03:12:41.060 --> 03:12:42.680]  You're not listening to me.
[03:12:42.680 --> 03:12:49.240]  I pulled up here as my IT guy was being put in a police car, and the cops charged up,
[03:12:49.240 --> 03:12:50.840]  and they said, what are you doing here?
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:54.080]  And I said, that guy's here to fix computers in my office.
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:12:55.680]  We've got a website that's down.
[03:12:55.680 --> 03:12:56.760]  Why are you arresting him?
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:00.960]  And they said, well, his driver's license has been expired for a year.
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:03.240]  And I said, well, wait a minute.
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:05.920]  I said, but if he was an illegal alien, you'd let him go.
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:09.800]  And I had a talk with three cops laughing saying, yes, that's true.
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:12.600]  We get in trouble because the judges let him go.
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:14.480]  That is discriminatory.
[03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:15.880]  That is wrong.
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:17.280]  That is a fact.
[03:13:17.280 --> 03:13:21.200]  It's not fair to the American people who are losing their wages and losing their jobs
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:23.120]  regardless of what color they are.
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:25.960]  This has nothing to do with race or what color you are.
[03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:28.480]  I say deport everyone who's here illegal.
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:33.800]  I don't care if they're a Russian, a Chinese, a German, or a polka-dotted, you know, whatever.
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:35.680]  I don't care.
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:37.600]  Enforce the law.
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:39.520]  Enforce the law.
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:40.800]  Enforce the law.
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:42.040]  It's that simple.
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:43.840]  I'm against lawlessness.
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:45.720]  Get it through your head.
[03:13:45.720 --> 03:13:48.040]  I'll tell you what, I've got to go into the DMV myself.
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:50.920]  I mean, I put in my thing a month before.
[03:13:50.920 --> 03:13:55.160]  It told me I was getting my card, and it never came, and I can't get customer service with
[03:13:55.160 --> 03:13:56.160]  the DMV.
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:13:57.160]  I've got to go in there.
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:00.280]  I've got my driver's license right now, and I guarantee you there's a good chance if I
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:04.240]  get pulled over, they're going to throw me in the back of a police car because my idea
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:06.240]  has expired, and I say that's wrong.
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:09.000]  Oh, man, I tell you, that's out of control.
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:10.640]  Tom in New York, you're on the air.
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:11.640]  Go ahead.
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:12.640]  Hi, Alex.
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:16.840]  I just wanted to add something to your conversation for what it's worth.
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:21.520]  You know, I'm a gay person, and I don't think there was anything homophobic you know what,
[03:14:21.520 --> 03:14:22.520]  you know?
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:29.680]  Mr. Gean said, and it's just a really obvious fact, I think, to anybody who looks at deep
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:35.360]  political issues, that blackmail is used, and if you're going to call it out on somebody,
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:39.680]  I wish more people would call it out on these people.
[03:14:39.680 --> 03:14:43.600]  I just finished a book called The Franklin Scandal by a guy named Nick Bryant.
[03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:44.600]  Just came out.
[03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:48.160]  It's a shocking book about the events in Franklin, Nebraska.
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:50.320]  What's your well-documented, by the way?
[03:14:50.320 --> 03:14:55.480]  This is a new book on it, and it's absolutely brilliantly written and brilliantly documented,
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:14:57.560]  and it'll just make anybody angry.
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:02.040]  I highly recommend it, and this stuff goes on, it's real, and it's not homophobic to
[03:15:02.040 --> 03:15:03.040]  call it out.
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:09.320]  And we can't let the people who are involved in this hide behind the homophobic statement,
[03:15:09.320 --> 03:15:15.680]  because what they're doing is they're bringing that whole group into their issue when the
[03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:19.560]  issue is blackmail, whether it's money laundering, whether it's hookers.
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:23.360]  I mean, I remember a few CIA directors back.
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:24.360]  It came out.
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:29.360]  That's why he had to resign, because he was attending these Watergate hotel parties with
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:35.160]  hookers and having been given thousands of free chips for a poker.
[03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:36.440]  I mean, it's all of them.
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:39.840]  I don't care if it's female pages or male pages.
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:41.040]  I don't care what it is.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:43.760]  I don't care if it's John Edwards cheating on his wife.
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:46.600]  It all needs to come out, because they're being blackmailed.
[03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:47.880]  The issue is blackmail.
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:53.680]  Anybody who's honest about their sexuality and come terms with it, they know that the
[03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:59.440]  person who's the trouble is the person who's being blackmailed or open to blackmail or
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:02.840]  who isn't being honest about it, and that sounds like we're Mr. Graham.
[03:16:02.840 --> 03:16:07.800]  Well, how many House members and Senate members who are the biggest on the bandwagon with
[03:16:07.800 --> 03:16:11.680]  all the anti-gay stuff, they're the ones that get caught in the bathrooms?
[03:16:11.680 --> 03:16:14.600]  It's pretty common, and then there's a lot of us gay people.
[03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:17.320]  We don't feel that Barney Frank speaks for us.
[03:16:17.320 --> 03:16:18.400]  And we understand.
[03:16:18.400 --> 03:16:26.040]  I think 9-11 and it being an inside job, you know, I'm active in 9-11 Truth, and we feel
[03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:30.400]  that that's a lot bigger deal right now than calling ourselves married if we're in a committed
[03:16:30.400 --> 03:16:33.760]  partnership, and we would really like to over get over a lot of that.
[03:16:33.760 --> 03:16:34.760]  Exactly.
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:37.720]  It's a football issue, because while they have us fighting with each other over gay
[03:16:37.720 --> 03:16:42.520]  marriage, banks have stolen $28 trillion, and the government's staging terror attacks.
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:46.040]  I appreciate your call, and that's why those are the issues we talk about.
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:50.240]  I mean, we don't normally even get into this whole issue, but Jason Burmes's film covers
[03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:54.080]  it because this is how they are controlling them.
[03:16:54.080 --> 03:16:55.480]  This is what is going on.
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:16:57.520]  I mean, I was even ignorant 10 years ago.
[03:16:57.520 --> 03:17:02.960]  When I snuck into Bohemian Grove, I was about 30 pounds lighter than I am now, and I guess
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:05.320]  I was, you know, handsome, so was Mike Hanson.
[03:17:05.320 --> 03:17:09.360]  And we had these old men whistling at us and people coming up to us, and we had to hide
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:14.640]  out in the woods to videotape the ritual because, I mean, we were literally, you know, like,
[03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:17.520]  it was like sailors had come into port, and we were the women in the town.
[03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:22.200]  We were being, it was like, you know, it was like, the old Republicans were like Peppy
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:28.440]  Lapue chasing the cat, but the cat was Alex Jones and Mike Hanson, and we had old men
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:35.160]  just, this is literally after us, and my whole issue is this is the Republican leadership.
[03:17:35.160 --> 03:17:36.160]  What are they doing?
[03:17:36.160 --> 03:17:40.640]  Well, why do you think the Republican leadership sells out the country?
[03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:43.920]  Why do you think all of these Barney Franks sells it out?
[03:17:43.920 --> 03:17:47.480]  Barney Frank got caught with underage male coal boys in his house.
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:51.560]  We have a mainstream news clip to that in Invisible Empire.
[03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:53.680]  I mean, that's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:59.360]  It's that they're totally and completely blackmailed, and that's why you're seeing this corruption.
[03:17:59.360 --> 03:18:00.360]  That's why we're talking about it.
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:01.360]  Thank you, Tom.
[03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:04.440]  Let's talk to Steve in Florida.
[03:18:04.440 --> 03:18:05.440]  Steve, you're on the air.
[03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:06.440]  Go ahead.
[03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:07.440]  Hey, Alex.
[03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:12.200]  You know, when you're talking about all this stuff with illegals and basically, you know,
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:15.600]  these people are unwitting operatives for the New World War.
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:18.600]  They don't even realize how they're being used.
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:22.960]  I was thinking about, I've got a really good book, and no doubt you've heard of Samuel F.
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:27.960]  B. Morse, the guy that's credited with starting the Morse Code and then sending the telegraph.
[03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:33.320]  Well, back in the 1800s, he did something that's little known, but you can research
[03:18:33.320 --> 03:18:36.840]  this for yourself, and I wish I had the name of the book, but I've got it packed away because
[03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:37.840]  I moved.
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:42.800]  What he did was he went to Europe to do his own fact-finding investigation, and he found
[03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:47.720]  out, and this is what he said, he discovered, uncovered a conspiracy that's exactly what
[03:18:47.720 --> 03:18:53.640]  he called it, to overthrow the United States via the population, and he said the way it
[03:18:53.640 --> 03:18:59.320]  was being done was that the Vatican was having people come over here that were Catholics
[03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:03.120]  as immigrants, and see, these people, they didn't realize that's what it was all about.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:06.960]  They were just coming here to be free, but he said the Vatican had this conspiracy to
[03:19:06.960 --> 03:19:12.400]  take over the United States through population, and the point I'm making is that there's a
[03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:17.480]  principle here that's being followed, there's no new thing under the sun like Solomon said.
[03:19:17.480 --> 03:19:21.320]  Islam has said they're going to take over the world through population.
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:26.680]  If they can't do it by force, they'll do it by stealth.
[03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:32.200]  When I lived in Texas, and I moved recently, three years ago in Houston, here you had a
[03:19:32.200 --> 03:19:37.400]  bunch of kids that were children of illegals, you probably heard about this, that skip school,
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:42.600]  took the Mexican flag, on the streets of Houston yelling, green go, go home, we were here first.
[03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:46.520]  You know, these people, they're just, they're brainwashed, they have no understanding of
[03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:49.760]  what they're involved in, they think they're fighting for their heritage.
[03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:54.520]  Exactly, and the very same banks that have dominated Mexico are now using them to try
[03:19:54.520 --> 03:19:57.280]  to dominate as a political block this country.
[03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:58.760]  Well said, I appreciate your call.
[03:19:58.760 --> 03:20:02.440]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[03:20:02.440 --> 03:20:04.640]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, Food Streg.
[03:20:04.640 --> 03:20:10.160]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program, and have started production.
[03:20:10.160 --> 03:20:11.400]  Congratulations.
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:16.280]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:18.120]  very wise.
[03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:22.840]  Shipments will begin the end of March, and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:20:22.840 --> 03:20:24.960]  Now something fun, it's springtime.
[03:20:24.960 --> 03:20:29.600]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement
[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:32.960]  to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[03:20:32.960 --> 03:20:33.960]  Here's the plan.
[03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:39.120]  When you add a one-month superfood spring pack to your food storage, we'll send you that
[03:20:39.120 --> 03:20:42.760]  garden of non-high-bread seeds absolutely free.

[03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:06.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:07.320]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:10.960]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:10.960 --> 03:22:13.640]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:18.200]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:19.440]  on earth.
[03:22:19.440 --> 03:22:24.240]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[03:22:24.240 --> 03:22:26.080]  expanded nationwide.
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:30.760]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:32.160]  shadow state.
[03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:36.600]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:42.400]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cannons,
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:46.480]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:50.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.040]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:53.040]  It's here.

[03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:06.200]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity,
[03:23:06.200 --> 03:23:11.120]  content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:15.800]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:20.160]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:24.680]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:26.760]  country ever experienced.
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:30.720]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[03:23:30.720 --> 03:23:35.080]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[03:23:35.080 --> 03:23:36.080]  value.
[03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:40.560]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:45.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:23:45.200 --> 03:23:51.720]  Call me today at 800-686-2237, I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing
[03:23:51.720 --> 03:23:52.720]  the book.
[03:23:52.720 --> 03:24:15.800]  Call today at 800-686-2237, again that's 800-686-2237.
[03:24:15.800 --> 03:24:21.520]  We've got ABC Nightly News slash Nightline here, and they're asking why is the radio
[03:24:21.520 --> 03:24:23.760]  show growing so fast?
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:28.080]  Well 14 years ago I'd talk about the government taking blood from babies secretly to put it
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:32.240]  in a Pentagon bio weapons database, now it's mainstream news, see it in the paper every
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:34.840]  week now.
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:39.480]  Going back a decade ago I'd read Club of Rome UN documents where they planned a global
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:44.920]  government using false terrorism and fake environmental crises as a pretext to take
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:49.400]  the people's freedoms, and now that's mainstream news, I mean you can go to Google News and
[03:24:49.400 --> 03:24:54.480]  type in world government, global governance, every day there's mainstream articles saying
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:24:55.640]  how good it is.
[03:24:55.640 --> 03:24:58.800]  So the media was stalling us while they built this system.
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:25:03.480]  The government controlled media was stalling the people saying none of this exists, none
[03:25:03.480 --> 03:25:07.480]  of this is happening, none of this is going on, stalling the population while they built
[03:25:07.480 --> 03:25:08.480]  it.
[03:25:08.480 --> 03:25:13.960]  Now that it's out in the open, people have a memory, people have the recollection of
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:19.000]  wait a minute, the media said this didn't exist, but now it does exist?
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:24.080]  Now there's a global government, the bankers say I have to live under austerity, I have
[03:25:24.080 --> 03:25:29.120]  to give up my freedoms, and then I need to shut up that I can't criticize the government
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:36.840]  or I may be called a terrorist, and so the system is really rousing the sleeping giant
[03:25:36.840 --> 03:25:38.840]  that is America.
[03:25:38.840 --> 03:25:44.120]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here, let's talk to Ronnie in Texas,
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:45.840]  you're on the air Ronnie.
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:53.280]  Thank you Ronnie for saying kids reject cigarettes, they shorten life, reject alcohol, fetal alcohol
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:57.160]  syndrome makes for retarded babies, and reject marijuana, those criminals you have to hang
[03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:01.920]  out with are bad, and I was treated Saturday like I was thrown out of a public park like
[03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:03.720]  a criminal.
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:07.600]  On Saturday at Eors party, after shopping from the local farmers in my favorite farmers
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:12.320]  market, I got off the bus for Eors birthday party, a big bash here in Austin, with lots
[03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:16.360]  of people, lots of kids, I was wearing a Ron Paul T-shirt with hat and buttons.
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:20.600]  And the hippies threw you out for smoking pot, I appreciate your call buddy.
[03:26:20.600 --> 03:26:23.520]  Let's talk to Nick and Brooklyn, Nick you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:26.440]  Hey Al, how are you doing, thanks for taking my call, can you hear me clearly?
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:27.440]  Yes I can.
[03:26:27.440 --> 03:26:32.080]  Yeah Al, I just wanted to touch a little bit on something that your last guest said with
[03:26:32.080 --> 03:26:37.120]  respect to the illegal immigration that is coming into the country, I live here in New
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:41.560]  York as you know from, as I said I was from Brooklyn, and I've been the last, I don't
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:49.160]  know perhaps in the last maybe 10 years, I've seen a large influx, large influx of illegal
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:52.920]  immigrants to the country, rather to New York here.
[03:26:52.920 --> 03:26:58.120]  But I was wondering, I know that you're very well versed on Hitler and Hitler's Germany
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:03.480]  and so on, but I was just wondering, during the time when Hitler was coming into power,
[03:27:03.480 --> 03:27:12.560]  he used that as a key during his nationalization of wanting to nationalize the country whatever
[03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:18.680]  and then all this other stuff of the illegals and that more businesses were owned by non-Germans
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:24.480]  and by Germans, and I was kind of wondering how this might not be a card that the New
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:29.760]  World Order might use when they see themselves getting in more trouble to start from now.
[03:27:29.760 --> 03:27:37.480]  No I think that is a danger and I appreciate your call Nick, because real issues can be
[03:27:37.480 --> 03:27:44.960]  captured and used and have been used throughout history, and there have been problems throughout
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:53.040]  history with nation states and countries being dominated by outside interest, I mean that's
[03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:59.640]  why we had 1775 and 1776, the 13 colonies had really become their own autonomous system
[03:27:59.640 --> 03:28:05.320]  governing themselves, they'd become very wealthy and they didn't want the foreign government
[03:28:05.320 --> 03:28:12.440]  4,000 miles away running their life and when the government was giving more rights to pure
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:17.360]  British citizens that were coming here to rule them than they were to the people in
[03:28:17.360 --> 03:28:22.640]  the colonies, they said, we're not putting up with this, people don't like foreign domination.
[03:28:22.640 --> 03:28:29.240]  Just like the Iraqis don't like us being there now for many years, seven plus years, just
[03:28:29.240 --> 03:28:34.760]  like the Afghans don't like us being there after eight years, they don't like empires,
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:41.840]  they don't like being dominated, but then what happened with Germany is they used a
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:46.840]  whole bunch of things, the Versailles Treaty and what had happened in World War I and the
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:51.920]  fact that they had to pay all these war reparations, they used that to get in control and then they
[03:28:51.920 --> 03:28:57.040]  tried to set up their own empire and invade the planet, I am not for invading the planet,
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:03.800]  I am not for any of these wars, I'm against invading Iran, I'm against launching a nuclear
[03:29:03.800 --> 03:29:07.880]  war against Iran, so I appreciate your call.
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:15.320]  Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through a news blitz as quickly as I can
[03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:19.880]  when we get back after this quick break and one of the other subjects I want to get into
[03:29:19.880 --> 03:29:25.480]  obviously is what's happening with the economy and who the real government is, oh it's an
[03:29:25.480 --> 03:29:30.480]  illegitimate government but it's the government, this private, hostile corporate takeover we've
[03:29:30.480 --> 03:29:34.560]  had here in America, you know you go back to a year ago when I released the Obama deception
[03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:38.120]  we talked about how the banks were going to call for even more taxes and environmental
[03:29:38.120 --> 03:29:43.860]  taxes and planned austerity, well now the IMF and others are saying look, you're never
[03:29:43.860 --> 03:29:48.840]  getting your standard of living back, NAFTA and GATT has been implemented and now your
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:30:01.960]  serfs we own your butt, we'll be right back.
[03:30:01.960 --> 03:30:05.920]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid

[03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:14.600]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold, it's true seeds have
[03:30:14.600 --> 03:30:18.080]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could

[03:32:51.360 --> 03:32:58.080]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your
[03:32:58.080 --> 03:32:59.080]  hands.
[03:32:59.080 --> 03:33:06.080]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300.
[03:33:06.080 --> 03:33:28.560]  OK, so we've got Barack Obama, Gordon Brown, the G20, Herman Bonn, Rumpi, head of the EU,
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:33.640]  saying 2009, 2010, the year of global government.
[03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:38.040]  And we've got the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the mainstream media saying global
[03:33:38.040 --> 03:33:42.960]  government doesn't exist, but next the world government and how it's going to save you.
[03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:47.840]  And, of course, back at the time, we detailed how Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and others
[03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:51.320]  had engineered the financial collapse.
[03:33:51.320 --> 03:33:52.480]  They make money on the way up.
[03:33:52.480 --> 03:33:55.360]  They make money on the bailout on the way down.
[03:33:55.360 --> 03:34:00.520]  And now the internal Goldman Sachs memos and emails are out there, how they bet against
[03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:05.960]  the stock market, bet against the housing market while telling their investors to invest
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:11.680]  in it and getting it certified as AAA rated when they knew it was worthless, absolute
[03:34:11.680 --> 03:34:13.280]  trash derivatives.
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:19.520]  Now, who's the number one contributor to the state governments in lobbying and to the
[03:34:19.520 --> 03:34:20.880]  federal government?
[03:34:20.880 --> 03:34:23.160]  The top 10 banks.
[03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:24.640]  That's your real government.
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:28.640]  You can put Republicans back into power this year, next year.
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:29.960]  It's only going to continue.
[03:34:29.960 --> 03:34:34.160]  Then you put the Democrats back in power and the corruption's going to continue until we
[03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:44.440]  fundamentally go after the big offshore banks that out of nothing, literally out of fiat.
[03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:49.000]  And I want to read again what I read at the start of the show today, what Thomas Jefferson
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:50.920]  said about this.
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:53.240]  This is what our country started a revolution over.
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:55.840]  There were many reasons, but this was the main reason.
[03:34:55.840 --> 03:34:58.960]  This is what Andrew Jackson fought against.
[03:34:58.960 --> 03:35:06.240]  This is what, to a great extent, even Lincoln fought against, creating his own U.S. currency.
[03:35:06.240 --> 03:35:10.280]  This is what Kennedy called for and then was assassinated.
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:14.760]  The government issuing its own currency and credit, empowering the people, not making
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:20.680]  currency and credit the God from which the banks can buy up the entire nation.
[03:35:20.680 --> 03:35:24.440]  Many founding fathers made the point, so did European scholars, that if you took all the
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:30.480]  bankers' power today, they would have it back tomorrow if you let them create currency
[03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:31.480]  and credit.
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:33.120]  They would just give themselves a blank check.
[03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:36.400]  For every dollar you put in a bank, they can have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:38.400]  of dollars they loan out to people.
[03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:39.680]  It's all made up.
[03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:44.280]  And so with these so-called banking reform bills, what's really going on, and I was
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:48.160]  heartened to see last week that the Big Texas Banking Association president came out and
[03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:53.520]  said, this is select megabanks coming in to take over regional and healthy state banks
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:55.280]  and local banks.
[03:35:55.280 --> 03:36:02.280]  And this is a value-added tax on all financial transactions to be paid to a select intergroup
[03:36:02.280 --> 03:36:07.400]  of banks that dominate the major governments of Europe and the United States and who also
[03:36:07.400 --> 03:36:09.880]  dominate the regulatory positions of power.
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:13.080]  I mean, look at Goldman Sachs alone.
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:19.520]  Governments and prime ministers all over the world are former Goldman Sachs.
[03:36:19.520 --> 03:36:20.600]  Scores of finance ministers are former Goldman Sachs.
[03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:25.880]  The Fed chairman, the former New York Fed head, the former Treasury head, the current
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:30.200]  Treasury head, Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs, they are the
[03:36:30.200 --> 03:36:33.600]  foxes guarding the henhouse.
[03:36:33.600 --> 03:36:39.320]  And all of their reforms are just giving themselves more bailouts and more power.
[03:36:39.320 --> 03:36:40.400]  And they're ruthless.
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:42.240]  They're going for everything.
[03:36:42.240 --> 03:36:43.920]  They must be brought to justice.
[03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:46.400]  That's the number one enemy.
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:47.880]  Now what did Thomas Jefferson say?
[03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:51.000]  The Southern Poverty Law Center would call him a terrorist enemy of America.
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:53.360]  No, he's one of our former presidents.
[03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:55.200]  He's one of the founders of this country.
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:36:58.480]  They can call it a conspiracy theory that Thomas Jefferson existed.
[03:36:58.480 --> 03:36:59.480]  He did exist.
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:00.920]  I'll tell Nightline this.
[03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:06.440]  Thomas Jefferson did exist and he did say this about the banks and he wasn't evil.
[03:37:06.440 --> 03:37:07.640]  He wasn't a terrorist.
[03:37:07.640 --> 03:37:09.480]  Thomas Jefferson is not bad.
[03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:11.280]  He was a good American.
[03:37:11.280 --> 03:37:16.280]  The central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the
[03:37:16.280 --> 03:37:19.520]  principles in form of our Constitution.
[03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:25.200]  I am an enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but coin.
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:29.240]  If the American people allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency,
[03:37:29.240 --> 03:37:33.640]  first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow
[03:37:33.640 --> 03:37:37.840]  up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children will
[03:37:37.840 --> 03:37:41.480]  wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:45.800]  Thomas Jefferson, that's just one of many quotes he said about the private banking cartel.
[03:37:45.800 --> 03:37:48.320]  In fact, print me that other quote earlier.
[03:37:48.320 --> 03:37:50.240]  I didn't have that.
[03:37:50.240 --> 03:37:53.760]  Now I want to just boil this down for people.
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:54.840]  You have a choice.
[03:37:54.840 --> 03:37:59.160]  Those of you watching on the Internet, those of you listening on the radio, those of you,
[03:37:59.160 --> 03:38:09.960]  this makes it on a nightline, you have a choice to make as a civilization, as a society.
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:13.040]  You have a choice that you need to make.
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:14.880]  You can't be in the middle of the road.
[03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:16.020]  You can't be on the fence.
[03:38:16.020 --> 03:38:17.120]  You were hot and are cold.
[03:38:17.120 --> 03:38:19.320]  So God spits you out of his mouth.
[03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:21.640]  You've got to make a decision.
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:23.840]  It'd be like a decision against Stalin.
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:26.880]  Are you for Stalin or against Stalin?
[03:38:26.880 --> 03:38:28.800]  Are you for Hitler or against Hitler?
[03:38:28.800 --> 03:38:29.840]  I'm against Hitler.
[03:38:29.840 --> 03:38:30.920]  I'm against Stalin.
[03:38:30.920 --> 03:38:35.680]  I'm against all forms of despotism and oppression over humanity.
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:36.680]  Period.
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:37.680]  I am for justice.
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:42.240]  I am against the globalist and all of their policies because all of their policies are
[03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:49.240]  designed to bring us to absolute serfdom, to be homeless on the continent our forefathers
[03:38:49.240 --> 03:38:50.240]  conquered.
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:52.520]  It is that simple.
[03:38:52.520 --> 03:38:55.480]  Here's a story out of AP today.
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:39:00.760]  It challenges Obama's economic narrative.
[03:39:00.760 --> 03:39:02.520]  That's a nice way of saying he's lying.
[03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:07.120]  The economy has been degenerating for more than a decade.
[03:39:07.120 --> 03:39:10.400]  Most of the money you pay in taxes goes on interest to the debt.
[03:39:10.400 --> 03:39:13.960]  That's why the big banks lobby for bigger government because it gets the government
[03:39:13.960 --> 03:39:18.920]  in deeper debt to them and they made the money up out of nothing.
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:19.920]  Here's another one.
[03:39:19.920 --> 03:39:20.920]  Economist.
[03:39:20.920 --> 03:39:21.920]  The stimulus didn't help.
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:22.920]  CNN.
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:23.920]  Oh, they need a new one.
[03:39:23.920 --> 03:39:28.080]  They told you a year ago in the Obama deception, they called for another bailout.
[03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:32.520]  They used the trillions of dollars they got in the bailout, not just the $887 billion,
[03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:36.600]  but the open window to the Federal Reserve and other mechanisms that Bloomberg has reported
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:43.340]  is $28 trillion and growing to freeze loans, to shut down Main Street, to be so flush with
[03:39:43.340 --> 03:39:48.400]  cash they didn't need to loan until the economy fully imploded so they can buy it up for pennies
[03:39:48.400 --> 03:39:49.720]  on the dollar.
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:51.540]  Here's the Washington Post.
[03:39:51.540 --> 03:40:00.600]  For nations living the good life, the parties over IMF says, how many times has the IMF
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:05.400]  gone into third world nations that dread them, that hate them, that understand they are the
[03:40:05.400 --> 03:40:06.400]  tyrants?
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:11.160]  The hundreds of nations in the last 60 years that the IMF and World Bank have wrecked,
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:14.800]  which are holding companies for the big private central banks.
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:16.360]  These are criminals.
[03:40:16.360 --> 03:40:17.840]  They are economic hit men.
[03:40:17.840 --> 03:40:22.480]  I mean, in 2002, the BBC got internal IMF World Bank documents where they were rigging
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:26.320]  the destruction of third world countries and planning to do it to the West next.
[03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:29.760]  That's in my book, The Sentent to Tyranny, written eight years ago.
[03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:30.760]  We've been warning you.
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:31.920]  We had their plans.
[03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:34.000]  Their plans have fallen into our hands.
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:35.560]  We're not flying blind here.
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:39.440]  We know what they're going to do.
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:43.400]  And just as we told you a year ago, they would then come out and propose, oh, you're never
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:45.640]  going to get your standard of living back.
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:50.240]  You've got to cut all your services, all the money goes to us.
[03:40:50.240 --> 03:40:53.240]  And now that's happening.
[03:40:53.240 --> 03:40:57.800]  In the lingo, the International Monetary Fund, the future of the world hinges on rebalancing
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:02.600]  and consolidation, antiseptic words that would seem to not raise a fuss.
[03:41:02.600 --> 03:41:05.120]  Who doesn't want more balance in their life?
[03:41:05.120 --> 03:41:10.880]  But the translation is a bit ruder, something on the order of suck it up, the party's over.
[03:41:10.880 --> 03:41:12.560]  And that's the headline.
[03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:21.720]  And to keep it on track, they need more taxes, says it right here, more taxes, less services.
[03:41:21.720 --> 03:41:26.120]  You see, they hold you hostage, give us trillions or we'll cause a depression.
[03:41:26.120 --> 03:41:29.860]  Henry Paulson went before the House and Senate and told them that in closed session.
[03:41:29.860 --> 03:41:33.480]  We had Congress went on to tell you this before it was even mainstream news, threatening
[03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:39.160]  them with financial terrorism.
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:43.640]  And it continues here with them saying the party is over.
[03:41:43.640 --> 03:41:52.040]  More taxes, less services, this is a quote, raising retirement age in line with life expectancy.
[03:41:52.040 --> 03:41:58.240]  On and on and on by this predatory group of Madoff-Kinley types, who came up with the
[03:41:58.240 --> 03:42:03.240]  carbon tax derivatives, Kinley, who came up with a lot of the derivatives we face, Bernie
[03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:04.240]  Madoff.
[03:42:04.240 --> 03:42:07.720]  It's all their Madoff founded the NASDAQ.
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:10.840]  This is all that these people are.
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:11.840]  That's who they are.
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:12.840]  That's what they do.
[03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:15.680]  They're a pack of vermin crooks.
[03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:20.200]  They know exactly what they're doing and they're going to destroy everyone's way of life and
[03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:24.720]  our free market system because they want to command and control system.
[03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:29.840]  You have the artificial banking cartel waging war against reality, waging war against the
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:30.920]  real economy.
[03:42:30.920 --> 03:42:39.120]  They are threatened by any form of independence, by any form of liberty, by any form of freedom.
[03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:41.600]  Go read the article for yourself.
[03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:44.640]  For nations living the good life, the party's over.
[03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:48.520]  Oh, they promised NAFTA and GATT was going to give you milk and honey, but it lowered
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:49.680]  your standard of living.
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:52.720]  Now they're promising total amnesty is going to help you.
[03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:54.240]  Whatever they say is the opposite.
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:43:00.440]  They never tell the truth, except when they're laughing at you throwing it in your face.
[03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:01.440]  But this is a lie too.
[03:43:01.440 --> 03:43:08.800]  It says do what they say and accept living like they do in Argentina or in Mexico or
[03:43:08.800 --> 03:43:10.880]  how they live in Nigeria.
[03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:15.080]  That's how you're going to live now with the superclass up there doing whatever they want,
[03:43:15.080 --> 03:43:16.080]  however they want.
[03:43:16.080 --> 03:43:19.120]  No future for your children.
[03:43:19.120 --> 03:43:24.280]  Here's another key article and it's got links into the Wall Street Journal and other publications.
[03:43:24.280 --> 03:43:28.800]  It's the economic collapse, megabanks, the banking oligarchy that controls the equivalent
[03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:32.480]  to 60% of America's GNP.
[03:43:32.480 --> 03:43:36.800]  Today's financial power being concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer individuals.
[03:43:36.800 --> 03:43:42.440]  In fact, the six biggest banks in the United States now possess assets equivalent to 60%
[03:43:42.440 --> 03:43:44.720]  of America's gross national product.
[03:43:44.720 --> 03:43:48.120]  Back in the 1990s, that figure was less than 20%.
[03:43:48.120 --> 03:43:50.480]  These six banks and these are your enemies.
[03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:52.360]  These are the criminal groups.
[03:43:52.360 --> 03:43:57.400]  This is why the ADL is calling for law enforcement action against me because they're a spokesperson
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:02.040]  for these banks and you don't want to be robbed and be economically conquered.
[03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:04.800]  They're going to say you're a terrorist because you're exposing them.
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:07.880]  You're pointing out the emperor is butt naked.
[03:44:07.880 --> 03:44:13.280]  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.B. Morgan Chase, Citigroup Bank of America, Wells Fargo,
[03:44:13.280 --> 03:44:16.720]  literally dictate what goes on in the U.S. banking industry.
[03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:20.680]  And now they've got a banking reform bill to shut down and take over all their competition
[03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:26.480]  and put a VAT tax at the U.N. level, the G20 level, and at the national level.
[03:44:26.480 --> 03:44:32.480]  Here is the London Guardian, but it says, oh, the big banks are going to get it socked
[03:44:32.480 --> 03:44:35.120]  to them when they're the ones that wrote this.
[03:44:35.120 --> 03:44:41.960]  We have the G20 document and it says right here, not just banks, but all financial institutions
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:49.440]  with a value-added VAT tax, as it's known, on you, paid directly to a private global
[03:44:49.440 --> 03:44:50.440]  consortium.
[03:44:50.440 --> 03:44:51.720]  What do you think Mexico does?
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:53.120]  What do you think Brazil does?
[03:44:53.120 --> 03:44:54.720]  What do you think Argentina does?
[03:44:54.720 --> 03:44:56.360]  What do you think Malaysia does?
[03:44:56.360 --> 03:45:00.480]  What do you think African countries do, or Arab countries, when they go into hawk to
[03:45:00.480 --> 03:45:02.720]  the IMF and World Bank?
[03:45:02.720 --> 03:45:05.920]  They pay their taxes directly to them.
[03:45:05.920 --> 03:45:08.720]  That we are now being looted like a third-world nation.
[03:45:08.720 --> 03:45:12.680]  The bankers took their time, used America as an engine of global domination, and now
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:18.520]  they're taking over this country in a big, stinking way.
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:21.640]  Back in the 1990s, the figure was less than 20 percent.
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:25.680]  These banks now control more than 60, literally dictate what goes on in the U.S. banking
[03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:26.680]  industry.
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:30.960]  These entities are the poster children for too big to fail, and they donate massive amounts
[03:45:30.960 --> 03:45:35.200]  of cash to the campaigns of both Republicans and Democrats.
[03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:40.000]  And so, yeah, the Republicans can ride back to power, promising to change all this, just
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:42.720]  like Obama rode to power, promising to change it.
[03:45:42.720 --> 03:45:44.680]  But look at who financed all of them.
[03:45:44.680 --> 03:45:46.200]  They all work for the same people.
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:48.160]  It's a sick joke.
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:49.160]  Here's another one.
[03:45:49.160 --> 03:45:54.680]  Email show Goldman Sachs executives boasting as housing meltdown unfolded, how they were
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:45:59.120]  going to destroy their competition, how they were going to be able to get even more power.
[03:45:59.120 --> 03:46:03.200]  It's all funny to them, and now they're up there lying before Congress, and Congress
[03:46:03.200 --> 03:46:08.440]  is looking at one little area of corruption, and maybe they'll slap one of their mid-level
[03:46:08.440 --> 03:46:16.120]  execs on the hand and get them a $5 million fine for hundreds of billions they got.
[03:46:16.120 --> 03:46:19.840]  It's just, look, look, they're going to give us no quarter.
[03:46:19.840 --> 03:46:24.340]  Just know you're going to be third-world slaves with a paramilitary force controlling
[03:46:24.340 --> 03:46:31.680]  your life because you let a bunch of Kinley, Bernie Madoffs run your life, okay?
[03:46:31.680 --> 03:46:40.440]  And so, now today, Congress has had this Goldman Sachs show hearing, but they turned it into
[03:46:40.440 --> 03:46:46.120]  a big feel sorry for themselves situation, and here's more on the economic terrorism.
[03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:50.160]  Just like they say, give us trillions of dollars or you'll have a depression, then the day after
[03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:54.320]  they pass the banking bailout bill, October 4th, they say, we now won't tell you where
[03:46:54.320 --> 03:46:58.240]  the money went, sit out and shut up, it's secret.
[03:46:58.240 --> 03:47:02.240]  Well, it's the same thing with Greece.
[03:47:02.240 --> 03:47:06.400]  It was Goldman Sachs 10 years ago, and now their top finance minister is a former Goldman
[03:47:06.400 --> 03:47:08.440]  Sachs operative.
[03:47:08.440 --> 03:47:12.640]  They're coming to Europe saying, you're going to have a depression if you don't give us
[03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:14.240]  unlimited money in Greece.
[03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:18.840]  See, the whole EU was about absorbing countries and taking control of them and getting them
[03:47:18.840 --> 03:47:19.840]  into debt.
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:24.120]  These banks just gobble everything up in a paramilitary fashion.
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:33.520]  This is what they do, and we have to just sit here and watch them rape us, watch them
[03:47:33.520 --> 03:47:38.840]  take our country over, watch them, you know, turn our police into a paramilitary force
[03:47:38.840 --> 03:47:43.000]  to dominate our lives and make sure we put up with all this, have to watch them raise
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:47.560]  all these new taxes to be fed to the bankers and watch the bankers laugh at us and say,
[03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:49.360]  you're never getting America back.
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:53.440]  We're going to take everything you got, aha, and hiring all these fake environmentalists
[03:47:53.440 --> 03:47:58.480]  to make it a religion of being poor, a religion of how it's good for the earth to be poor,
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:03.400]  but the bankers get to have all our tax money and all the carbon tax money.
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:10.480]  And so now they're holding Europe hostage again, Greek meltdown in danger of spreading.
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:14.600]  Germany, France, international monetary fund must act quickly to bail out Greece to prevent
[03:48:14.600 --> 03:48:20.400]  a slide in confidence in financial markets, Alistair Darling said yesterday.
[03:48:20.400 --> 03:48:24.760]  And then meanwhile, again, the money is to be paid to the private JP Morgan Chase, Goldman
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:26.840]  Sachs and others.
[03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:31.560]  It's absolutely imperative the IMF and the Eurogroup in Greece sort this out, said Chancellor
[03:48:31.560 --> 03:48:35.920]  of the Exchequer attending the spring meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:40.800]  So again, holding everybody hostage on that front.
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:45.800]  Here's another report on that same front, Financial Times of London, US prepares to
[03:48:45.800 --> 03:48:52.960]  push for global capital rules, a global regime over all financial institutions and all financial
[03:48:52.960 --> 03:48:57.680]  transactions with a tax and the United States is pushing it.
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:49:02.160]  And what is the UN call this when you actually watch C-SPAN and watch the EU commissioners
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:08.440]  and watch the parliament in England and watch the G20, they say world government.
[03:49:08.440 --> 03:49:11.920]  And they clap and oh, we did a great job, bankers.
[03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:13.480]  We got all their internal emails as well.
[03:49:13.480 --> 03:49:14.680]  We ruined them.
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:17.200]  We took the Western free countries down.
[03:49:17.200 --> 03:49:21.880]  We economically dominate them and they all sit up their big fat criminals with paramilitary
[03:49:21.880 --> 03:49:25.680]  troops with machine guns, guarding them, just robbing everything.
[03:49:25.680 --> 03:49:28.480]  We've seen it happen over and over and over again in other countries.
[03:49:28.480 --> 03:49:33.040]  And now they're going to take us all the way to the wall, just beating the financial
[03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:37.320]  daylights out of us, taking everything we've got, always posing as the saviors.
[03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:41.520]  And if we get up at EU citizens and keep exposing them, well, Bill Clinton comes out on TV and
[03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:45.720]  says, if you Tea Party people don't shut up your rhetoric, there's going to be terror
[03:49:45.720 --> 03:49:46.720]  attacks.
[03:49:46.720 --> 03:49:49.920]  And you better believe who's going to stage those terror attacks.
[03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:54.120]  Good old Uncle Sam, who works for the bankers, are going to blow up some buildings and then
[03:49:54.120 --> 03:49:55.960]  blame it on the American people.
[03:49:55.960 --> 03:49:57.880]  That's how they keep the slaves in line.
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:00.720]  But this time we're aware of the Gulf of Tonkin being staged.
[03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:03.400]  This time we know the Reichstag fire was staged.
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:11.280]  We have Operation Northwoods, thanks to ABC News, US government plan to attack US cities
[03:50:11.280 --> 03:50:17.480]  as pretext for war with Cuba, that pull up ABC News, Operation Northwoods.
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:22.160]  And then I tell ABC News reporters about government plans to stage terror attacks and you get
[03:50:22.160 --> 03:50:24.040]  a blank stare.
[03:50:24.040 --> 03:50:29.960]  Just Google it for people right now, Operation Northwoods plan to terrorize US cities.
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:35.160]  You see, we need to wake up and find out that we do have a criminal government.
[03:50:35.160 --> 03:50:40.360]  We are in trouble and we've got to wake up, smell the coffee, face the hard facts and
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:41.560]  take our nation back.
[03:50:41.560 --> 03:50:44.840]  We could just arrest all these top bankers, they've committed so many crimes, Ron Paul's
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:46.400]  been on air and agreed.
[03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:49.280]  We could just bring them to justice and then rebuild our country.
[03:50:49.280 --> 03:50:53.680]  But no, in America we've been taught to be cowards and to lay down and lick the boots
[03:50:53.680 --> 03:50:57.360]  of any corrupt scumbag in a three-piece suit.
[03:50:57.360 --> 03:51:27.280]  And because of that we have no future until you wake up and get up off your butt.
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:49.000]  That's

[03:52:27.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:37.000]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:41.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:41.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  I tell you, it is so depressing, I was just talking to the ABC.
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  Well, sometimes he's the host of the nightly news.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:55:00.000]  I was just in there talking to him and I was explaining that the private central banks have announced they're forming a global government.
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  And he said, well, couldn't you be wrong about that?
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  And I said, no, I've got Herman von Roompi and Gordon Brown and all these leaders saying we're setting up world government.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  I've got Ban Ki-moon in the New York Times, Secretary General of the UN calling for world government.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:22.000]  And then he shifted gears and said, well, you know, isn't that different from a world government?
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  We're talking about groups just working together for peace.
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  This isn't peace.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  These are liars that say Saddam has WMDs after own government puts him in power and sets him up.
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  This is a government that openly ships the opium out of Afghanistan into the United States in Reuters.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:44.000]  They admit they will not eradicate the poppy fields.
[03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  This is a government that is run by a bunch of degenerate criminals violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  This is a government run by Barack Obama, who swore to in the Patriot Act, who swore to get our troops out of Iraq immediately,
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:05.000]  who swore to not hire any lobbyist, who swore to not do any of the things he's now done.
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  And I got to read neocons in the newspaper praising Obama because he continued torture in the war and secret arrest.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  I mean, I have the audio tapes where the informant recorded the FBI telling him to cook the bomb and train the driver
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:24.000]  and bomb the World Trade Center building in 93.
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:30.000]  I've interviewed the survivors that saw McVeigh and the U.S. government agents inside the Alfred P. Murrow building
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:32.000]  in the week before planting the bombs.
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  They thought they were telephone repairmen putting gray sticks of butter on the columns.
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  I know the feds blew that building up.
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:41.000]  I know the feds carried out 9-11.
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  And it doesn't matter if the media just sits there and says, no, there's no world government.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  No, the bankers aren't robbing us.
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  Nothing's wrong.
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:50.000]  Everything's good.
[03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  Unemployment's at 8%.
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  No, it's not.
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:54.000]  It's at 22%.
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:55.000]  It's over.
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  The people are awake.
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:58.000]  They know about the lies.
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:56:59.000]  They know about the propaganda.
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:00.000]  And it's over.
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:02.000]  People are sick of it.
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  And we're going to defeat the globalist on every front.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  We are never going to stop.
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  I want listeners to go to infowars.com.
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  And I want you to get the DVD of Police State 4.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  I want you to get Invisible Empire, two new films.
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:15.000]  I want you to get DVD burners.
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  I want you to make hundreds of copies of peace.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:19.000]  I want you to air them on Access TV.
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  We've got both films posted for free now up on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com today.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:28.000]  I want you to get that URL address with both of them and send it to your whole email list,
[03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  Facebook, everywhere else.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  And we're not going to stop because when we lose our fighting spirit, they win.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  They are not going to break arm around.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  We are not going to sell out to their new world order.
[03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:40.000]  We are not going to go along with their propaganda.
[03:57:40.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  We are not going to drink the Kool-Aid and decide that everything's okay.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:49.000]  We are going to expose the criminal bankers that engineered this collapse by design.
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:51.000]  We now have their internal documents.
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:53.000]  We now have the indictments.
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:56.000]  And still, the media is in denial.
[03:57:56.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  And then when they lose their jobs and when their kids are third world slaves,
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:03.000]  I hope they're man enough.
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:08.000]  I hope they're man enough decades later to not make excuses about the squalor they're living in
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  in whatever petty position they've got in this dung heap.
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:14.000]  And I hope that they admit to themselves that we were right.
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:17.000]  After decades of them saying there's no global government, they go,
[03:58:17.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  well, yeah, there's a global government, but it's a lovey-sweetie one.
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:22.000]  It makes me sick.
[03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:24.000]  That makes me want to throw up.
[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:27.000]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:30.000]  Tell everybody about the radio show no matter how you listen.
[03:58:30.000 --> 03:58:32.000]  We're going to beat this new world order.
[03:58:32.000 --> 03:58:34.000]  We don't have a choice.
[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:36.000]  We're fighting 21st century tyranny.
[03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:38.000]  And we're going to do it together with God's help.
[03:58:38.000 --> 03:59:03.000]  Great job, crew. Retransmission starts now.
