[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:30.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.280 --> 00:39.280]  welcome my friends it is Tuesday August 10th 2010 to be live here of course the
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.040]  next three hours joining us in the third hour always interesting and
[00:44.040 --> 00:49.000]  informative and thought-provoking gas David Ike will be joining us on a host
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.160]  of issues mainly dealing with the attack on Iran the plunging global economy
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.160]  and how the globalists are openly admitting that they're waging war on
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.200]  the human psyche with drugs and chemicals in the food and water and now
[01:03.200 --> 01:07.560]  these brain-altering vaccines that are live viruses that actually go in and
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.400]  attack the brain tissue giving you a type of biological electrochemical
[01:12.400 --> 01:19.440]  lobotomy so that is coming up with David today we'll also take some calls when
[01:19.440 --> 01:25.200]  he's on with us for that hour in the meantime we're going to have wide open
[01:25.200 --> 01:31.760]  phones throughout the first two hours I do have a lot of important news that I
[01:31.760 --> 01:40.120]  will cover of course interspersed former senator Ted Stevens the guy that wanted
[01:40.120 --> 01:47.760]  to end net neutrality and allow the web to be broken up and who was constantly
[01:47.760 --> 01:54.880]  associated with massive corruption and who was haggard by it went down in an
[01:54.880 --> 02:02.680]  aircraft with ex-NASA chief Sean O'Keefe they're on a plane in Alaska this is
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.560]  the second serious plane crash of his life he's believed dead they're
[02:06.560 --> 02:11.440]  reporting five dead right now but they haven't identified the bodies yet very
[02:11.440 --> 02:15.760]  very suspicious if you look at the statistics for frequent business
[02:15.760 --> 02:23.320]  flyers who fly as much as your average federal politician these feds of a much
[02:23.320 --> 02:30.520]  higher level of death rates in aircraft than other frequent flyers now a lot of
[02:30.520 --> 02:34.560]  that is because they tend to be on smaller flights trying to go around and
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.480]  visit constituents but you know Nick baggage Dr. Nick baggage who's a
[02:39.480 --> 02:45.520]  frequent guest here his father was a famous congressman from Alaska and of
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.280]  course his brother is one of the two senators from Alaska right now and he
[02:50.280 --> 02:55.520]  believes his father was killed in foul play for standing up to the Defense
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.760]  Department and others but the global mafia loves to kill people in plane
[03:00.760 --> 03:05.960]  crashes because then the federal government has jurisdiction over those
[03:05.960 --> 03:09.600]  plane crashes they really shouldn't have jurisdiction but they've claimed it in
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.360]  the last few decades and so they're able to come in and cover up what's
[03:13.360 --> 03:18.120]  happened of course we had the senator wellstone situation clearly foul play
[03:18.120 --> 03:30.720]  the list goes on and on and at the same time we have one of the big BP critics
[03:30.720 --> 03:37.720]  Matt Simons found dead yesterday in his swimming pool it's one of their other
[03:37.720 --> 03:42.200]  favorite ways to kill people or it could have just been a heart attack but he'd
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.440]  been a big critic of that and also had worked in the Bush administration so
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.640]  that's some of what we'll be covering here on the broadcast today also Russia
[03:52.640 --> 03:57.440]  battles to defend nuclear sites from fires they've declared a state of
[03:57.440 --> 04:04.840]  emergency and the Russian heatwave may kill 15,000 and shave 15 million dollars
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.480]  off of their gross domestic product really starting to cause disruptions in
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.480]  Russia Bloomberg reports meanwhile temperatures continue well below average
[04:14.480 --> 04:19.880]  in southern California to the point of in their growth belts there they're
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.920]  farming belt they're in the south and central areas and out into the desert
[04:24.920 --> 04:32.240]  many of their lemons and oranges and grapefruits and other citrus crops
[04:32.240 --> 04:38.680]  are not ripening or not maturing because they're having record cold there
[04:38.680 --> 04:43.000]  right now and you could point at that and say we're going into an ice age you
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.160]  could point at Russia and say we're going into global warming the truth is
[04:46.160 --> 04:49.480]  you've got thousands of major weather regions and tens of thousands of
[04:49.480 --> 04:53.760]  micro regions you can always find spots on the earth they're having record hot
[04:53.760 --> 04:57.720]  or record cold it's the general trends that matter the general trends are
[04:57.720 --> 05:02.120]  cool and they're right back let me tell you a little bit about one of our great

[07:26.320 --> 07:30.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[08:10.880 --> 08:16.880]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[08:16.880 --> 08:29.600]  it is Tuesday the 10th of day of August 2010 David Ike is coming up in the
[08:29.600 --> 08:35.720]  third hour today talk about the chemical assault and biological assault going on
[08:35.720 --> 08:41.040]  against the public former senator Ted Stevens and ex-nasa chief Sean O'Keefe
[08:41.040 --> 08:47.120]  have gone down to plane crash and all on board are believed dead was a small
[08:47.120 --> 08:54.600]  plane could be foul play could be the classic high winds of Alaska and the
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.440]  dangers of small aircraft but we'll talk more about that today also want to get
[08:59.440 --> 09:03.120]  more into a story came out a few days ago that we mentioned Stephen Hawking the
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.640]  preeminent physicist and quantum mechanics expert and developer of a lot of
[09:09.640 --> 09:15.280]  theoretical mathematical equations dealing with black holes that have been
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.320]  proven says he believes we must go off world immediately or that it's almost
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.360]  certain in the next 100 years we're going to destroy ourselves and I agree
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.920]  with him I don't think it's going to take a hundred years with the fish in
[09:28.920 --> 09:35.160]  fusion the new generation of nuclear weapons the new generations of anti-
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.840]  matter weapons the Air Force admits they've been developing for at least 20
[09:37.840 --> 09:43.520]  years with genetic engineering and cross species open-air planting and open-air
[09:43.520 --> 09:51.360]  release of other biological entities not just plants but salmon and insects with
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.960]  the other developments in super weapons it is a virtual certainty that this
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.680]  planet will never become a type 1 civilization the species on this planet
[10:02.680 --> 10:12.080]  a type 1 is a survivable species that is not bound to one globe one planet you
[10:12.080 --> 10:16.720]  could even argue technically not one system just remember that a hundred
[10:16.720 --> 10:21.840]  years ago everybody was still predominantly using horses and electricity
[10:21.840 --> 10:28.440]  was still seen as magic this species that can basically do anything we are
[10:28.440 --> 10:32.600]  made in the image of the creator of the universe and where our potential has not
[10:32.600 --> 10:37.640]  even been dreamed of we cannot even imagine our potential but we do have a
[10:37.640 --> 10:43.080]  lot of selfish controlling wicked eugenicist in control who have shown
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.600]  that they do not want a world government to have world peace they want a
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.880]  world government for world carnage and destruction and death so we'll be
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.640]  discussing that more coming up in the next hour a lot of really important
[10:57.640 --> 11:05.480]  economic news and now the mainstream media is not just admitting but is on
[11:05.480 --> 11:12.720]  fire with reports and evidence that the entire Democratic Party but also the
[11:12.720 --> 11:20.240]  Republican Party as a close second is in political freefall it's a greater
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.320]  political realignment than we saw in the 1770s leading up to the kickoff at
[11:25.320 --> 11:31.520]  Lexington and Concord in 1775 and the official kickoff for secession and war
[11:31.520 --> 11:38.120]  in July 4 1776 so they now admit it's a complete and total political realignment
[11:38.120 --> 11:43.160]  and that the system even when they tell the truth no one believes them and
[11:43.160 --> 11:47.520]  there is a total loss of confidence and the globalists are all over the news
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.320]  today saying they need a new war or giant terror attacks they're repeating
[11:52.320 --> 11:58.880]  that and we are in the maximum zone of danger going into this election for
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.600]  giant terror attacks or a new war to be started as a way to rally the population
[12:04.600 --> 12:16.960]  around the flagging corrupt predator class ruling class the rat class so we're
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.720]  going to be discussing that as well today also some interesting information
[12:23.720 --> 12:30.480]  that I'll be covering in the next hour I was aware of this I had read this in the
[12:30.480 --> 12:40.200]  Texas Constitution and legislative statutes section 4 3 1 dot 1 1 2 calling
[12:40.200 --> 12:46.360]  of forces by other officials dealing with the state guard but also to a
[12:46.360 --> 12:54.040]  certain extent the national guard in the state when you have an insurrection or
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.960]  lawlessness that it is not the right it is the duty of the governor the
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.640]  legislature or the county commissioner the head judge the head of the county
[13:04.640 --> 13:13.160]  commission or the sheriff to call out the militia and so we'll be going over
[13:13.160 --> 13:21.680]  that today any sheriff or county judge in Texas or they have similar laws in
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.880]  Arizona it's all based on the federal constitution just a state version of it
[13:25.880 --> 13:33.880]  can call out the police the military the general citizenry and they can start
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.800]  arresting people for crime so just further evidence that the federal lawsuit
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.840]  against Arizona and the threat against Texas if Texas follows suit in other
[13:42.840 --> 13:51.080]  states is an abject manifest complete fraud and the federal lawsuit is also a
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.600]  violation of several articles the Constitution we've covered here
[13:55.600 --> 13:58.760]  previously dealing with the fact that the federal government cannot sue an
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.960]  individual or state or state agency on behalf of a foreign government or
[14:03.960 --> 14:10.680]  foreign individual so we'll be discussing those interesting and very important
[14:10.680 --> 14:17.320]  points of law here coming up later in the broadcast today because if we get the
[14:17.320 --> 14:21.160]  word out to the legislators and to the sheriffs and to the county commissioners
[14:21.160 --> 14:29.240]  they can grow up and start asserting the power of the people vested in their
[14:29.240 --> 14:39.680]  office 100% of the power of every federal government employee agent
[14:39.680 --> 14:45.360]  elected servant it's the same at the state level is given to them through the
[14:45.360 --> 14:51.440]  power of the people enshrined in the Bill of Rights the Declaration of
[14:51.440 --> 14:57.880]  Independence and of course the Constitution so it's not the Constitution
[14:57.880 --> 15:03.920]  that's gone wrong we have gone wrong in not enforcing this so that's another one
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.040]  of the issues that I want to open the phones up to discuss with you but any
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.200]  issue is on the table the toll-free number to join us today on this Tuesday
[15:12.200 --> 15:22.200]  addition is 800-259-9231 that's 1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up
[15:22.200 --> 15:38.280]  and on the air but first before I get into all of this other news and your
[15:38.280 --> 15:45.120]  phone calls I have another excellent illustration of media propaganda and
[15:45.120 --> 15:55.560]  brainwashing that is going on in our society when buys phenol a was approved
[15:55.560 --> 16:01.240]  by the federal government back in the 1950s and out of thousands of different
[16:01.240 --> 16:08.000]  plastic formulas it was chosen by industry despite the fact from my
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.400]  research it's not even one of the least expensive formulas to be a hardening
[16:12.400 --> 16:21.200]  agent in plastic plastic liners food containers the lining of cans and of
[16:21.200 --> 16:31.800]  course soda pop as it's called in the northeast and in the last 30 years there
[16:31.800 --> 16:38.320]  have been legions literally thousands of studies there have been several hundred
[16:38.320 --> 16:45.840]  published in the last year that buys phenol a is above all does a lot of
[16:45.840 --> 16:54.840]  things it's a hormone disruptor but it mimics chiefly estrogen estrogen being
[16:54.840 --> 17:04.520]  the dominant hormone in the female side of the species homo sapien sapien and so
[17:04.520 --> 17:12.280]  it feminizes boys and hyper feminizes girls and there's so much buys phenol a
[17:12.280 --> 17:18.240]  being eaten by humans and and and and seeping into our water supply and and
[17:18.240 --> 17:25.280]  into other beverages that when we then urinate and defecated into the sewage
[17:25.280 --> 17:30.520]  system that it is then processed and put into reservoirs that in every major
[17:30.520 --> 17:37.720]  reservoir that's been studied you have the feminization of male fish and
[17:37.720 --> 17:44.200]  amphibians like frogs and this is on record worldwide where buys phenol a is
[17:44.200 --> 17:51.240]  used leaching of hormones and then that's what birth control does is it mimics
[17:51.240 --> 17:55.920]  pregnancy so that the woman cannot become pregnant so they're basically in a
[17:55.920 --> 18:02.040]  artificial pregnancy state causes a lot of psychological problems and physical
[18:02.040 --> 18:08.520]  problems and in all of these studies they admit that it's causing boys to go
[18:08.520 --> 18:18.120]  into puberty later and to actually over develop other hormonal exchanges in the
[18:18.120 --> 18:24.400]  brain the rest of the body and girls are going into puberty as young as age three
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.720]  and four though hundreds of thousands are going into puberty at around age seven
[18:29.720 --> 18:36.920]  and of course the average before the 1950s with buys phenol a was about 13 the
[18:36.920 --> 18:44.920]  average girl went into puberty at about age 13 same thing for boys now the study
[18:44.920 --> 18:53.520]  show that many Western boys are not even having their testicles drop that is
[18:53.520 --> 18:56.880]  they're up inside you almost like ovaries and they drop down at the onset
[18:56.880 --> 19:04.920]  of puberty until age 15 and boys look and act like little girls women are
[19:04.920 --> 19:10.720]  hyper feminized and so it massively ages them hormones are the main cause of
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.840]  cancer naturally you should notice hormonal tissues like the breasts the
[19:14.840 --> 19:19.760]  testicles the prostate are the most common cancers that's why sharks don't
[19:19.760 --> 19:24.920]  get cancer it's impossible because they don't have hormones they operate on
[19:24.920 --> 19:29.680]  another system that's why shark cartilage has been found to be a good
[19:29.680 --> 19:33.680]  treatment for many cancers but I'm digressing giving you some points of
[19:33.680 --> 19:40.360]  science the issue here is this is now all coming out and I've got multiple
[19:40.360 --> 19:51.400]  national newscast deceiving the viewers and telling the viewers that girls are

[20:28.600 --> 20:33.240]  power of only $4,800 but your golden silver would have the buying power of

[24:06.120 --> 24:11.960]  so in the last week with four states banning by Sphinol a and baby bottles
[24:11.960 --> 24:18.200]  and baby food packaging it already leaches into the food out of the
[24:18.200 --> 24:21.560]  containers but when you microwave them in the containers it gives you massive
[24:21.560 --> 24:29.680]  doses they also admit that just a little bit of the chemical off of printer
[24:29.680 --> 24:37.040]  receipt ink that's used by more than 40% of major retailers is enough to reduce
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.680]  the fertility of men increased cancer in men and women this is by Sphinol a
[24:41.680 --> 24:49.240]  meanwhile I have a CNN clip from over the weekend that we posted up on info
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.640]  wars.com where they've got a doctor on there arguing with another doctor
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.520]  saying there's no evidence it's ever caused a problem despite the fact there
[24:57.520 --> 25:03.800]  are literally hundreds of studies a year they are in the thousands overall now
[25:03.800 --> 25:10.640]  CBS news ABC news NBC news they all said it's obesity in girls that is causing
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.560]  this and they said that's why we need federal controls and basically take
[25:15.560 --> 25:18.920]  people's children from them when they're overweight so they let them sell you
[25:18.920 --> 25:25.160]  corn syrup they let the companies line things in by Sphinol a put MSG in it
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.800]  aspartame all of this causes serious health problems and obesity and all the
[25:29.800 --> 25:36.400]  studies they know full well it kills the guinea pigs kills the monkeys with the
[25:36.400 --> 25:42.800]  aspartame the MSG they know and they create the crisis and then come out and
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.360]  say why are our girls going to puberty at seven and of course in England and the
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.160]  United States when you bring your girl in when she's five six seven eight years
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.560]  old going to puberty they give you hormones to block those hormones which
[25:55.560 --> 25:59.680]  then screw your daughter up even more and there's no discussion about the
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.320]  feminized boys and all of it attacks fertility but I did find several
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.120]  mainstream news articles that did tell the truth one was in the Kansas City
[26:09.120 --> 26:16.760]  star Kansas City calm study finds puberty arriving early in girls and we
[26:16.760 --> 26:20.280]  don't say many scientists believe chemicals in the environment need to be
[26:20.280 --> 26:26.320]  studied like by Sphinol a that act like estrogen by Sphinol a is using many
[26:26.320 --> 26:33.720]  plastics food packaging and even dental sealants and so they go on to tell the
[26:33.720 --> 26:37.280]  truth and say the scientists and researchers are saying by Sphinol a
[26:37.280 --> 26:41.520]  but I watched all these different newscasts last night this morning that
[26:41.520 --> 26:45.120]  were aggregated on YouTube we have them linked up on info wars dot com and
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.840]  present planet dot com and they said oh you're eating too much that's what's
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.320]  making you go into puberty that has nothing to do with it and they know
[26:53.320 --> 26:59.080]  that so they will not tell you what the problem is and it's despicable here's a
[26:59.080 --> 27:03.720]  few minutes of an NBC piece evening I'm Ann Curry in for Brian Williams tonight
[27:03.720 --> 27:08.080]  as a new study published today reveals stunning and alarming findings about the
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.160]  health of our daughters according to the study of more than 1200 children a
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.280]  significant number of girls are now showing signs of puberty as young as
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.440]  seven years old with these findings that researchers are raising concerns that
[27:20.440 --> 27:24.600]  our girls will be at greater risk for behavioral problems perhaps even breast
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.720]  cancer in the future in a moment we'll be talking to a leading pediatrician about
[27:28.720 --> 27:36.360]  what parents can do but we begin now with NBC's Rahima Ellis the results are
[27:36.360 --> 27:41.400]  startling more than 1200 girls between the ages of seven and eight from New
[27:41.400 --> 27:46.120]  York Cincinnati and the San Francisco Bay area were part of the study the
[27:46.120 --> 27:50.840]  findings reported in today's Journal of Pediatrics reveal that while the average
[27:50.840 --> 27:56.920]  age of the onset of puberty is 10 or 11 15% of the girls showed signs of
[27:56.920 --> 28:03.160]  puberty at seven years old among them 10% of white girls twice as many as in a
[28:03.160 --> 28:11.360]  1997 study but 15% of Hispanic girls and 23% of African American girls early
[28:11.360 --> 28:14.880]  developments of risk that's enough and then they just go on to say it's because
[28:14.880 --> 28:21.080]  you're fat if you inject estrogen or drink it or take it as pills you will
[28:21.080 --> 28:29.520]  gain weight and in all these studies it says bisphenol A causes obesity organ
[28:29.520 --> 28:34.760]  damage it massively increases cancer not just breast cancer I mean why do they
[28:34.760 --> 28:41.280]  tell 55 year old women who go into menopause that now they probably shouldn't
[28:41.280 --> 28:49.640]  take estrogen replacement because it massively increases cancer risk they
[28:49.640 --> 28:58.120]  know what's going on so they have a estrogen simulant that is in almost all
[28:58.120 --> 29:01.520]  foods now if you look at the other studies and you can pull these up side
[29:01.520 --> 29:05.320]  by side of Hispanics and blacks they tend to be poor they tend to eat more
[29:05.320 --> 29:09.000]  junk food than whites whites are becoming poor now so you see their number
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.280]  doubling but how do you get 20 plus percent of black children having this
[29:15.280 --> 29:23.000]  problem why do you have 15% of Hispanics having this problem because they're
[29:23.000 --> 29:29.440]  eating more junk food with the bisphenol A and they know full well what's going on
[29:29.440 --> 29:35.440]  and we come back I'll show you a doctor who's part of a big consortium telling
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.760]  you that she has no evidence bisphenol A is bad but in the article Matt Ryan put
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.960]  together he linked to all these mainline studies that conclusively show breast
[29:43.960 --> 29:50.920]  cancer obesity early onset of puberty and girls feminization of boys we're on

[33:05.240 --> 33:11.040]  the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:12.480 --> 33:18.880]  if you look at the public white people Hispanics blacks Asians and you look at
[33:18.880 --> 33:27.960]  photographs of folks even 50 years ago didn't matter what color they were where
[33:27.960 --> 33:33.680]  they were from their eyes looked more alive even if they were overweight they
[33:33.680 --> 33:38.280]  looked healthier you look at the public now especially if you go to a water park
[33:38.280 --> 33:42.760]  we can really see people with their shirts off and even if they're skinny
[33:42.760 --> 33:49.280]  they look like zombies they look unhealthy white people kind of have
[33:49.280 --> 33:54.000]  greenish skin Hispanics kind of have greenish brown skin black folks kind of
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.760]  have brownish green skin people got zits all over their faces and backs even
[33:59.760 --> 34:06.520]  when they're old they look like they've been hit by a mutation ray and you have
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.360]  been hit with my mutation ray and I've gone back and looked at dietary studies
[34:11.360 --> 34:15.720]  from the 40s and 50s people were eating chicken fried steaks people were eating
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.200]  giant platters of fried food and yeah they were having heart attacks and
[34:20.200 --> 34:26.000]  getting cancer and stuff but they were not as fat as they are now we know that
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.520]  buys phenol a causes obesity breast cancer other cancers early on set of
[34:31.520 --> 34:36.280]  puberty and females feminization of boys they know all this they know aspartame
[34:36.280 --> 34:40.440]  actually causes obesity how many nutritionist and medical doctors have
[34:40.440 --> 34:44.560]  we had on to cover that it causes permanent inflammation of the brain all
[34:44.560 --> 34:52.000]  of these chemicals work together and the system chose to allow this if you go
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.240]  to many European countries this stuff is illegal and their population doesn't
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.560]  look like this most of these chemicals are illegal in the food and water and
[35:02.560 --> 35:08.400]  France the French have many many many many a statistically higher level of
[35:08.400 --> 35:13.520]  smoking cigarettes and drinking and the media says oh it's red wine that's why
[35:13.520 --> 35:19.160]  they're living to 81 and we're living to 74 no smoking two three packs of
[35:19.160 --> 35:25.160]  cigarettes a day eating a lot more fattening foods that they don't eat
[35:25.160 --> 35:30.160]  preservatives they won't put up with it you look at French women when they're
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.920]  70 they look like a 50 year old American woman the Germans have allowed most of
[35:35.920 --> 35:41.920]  this stuff and they look almost as dumb down and mutated as us and again I'm not
[35:41.920 --> 35:47.760]  up here on some dietary high horse I was a health nut in high school and into
[35:47.760 --> 35:51.280]  college and I worked so hard and radio and TV I kind of heard hanging out with
[35:51.280 --> 35:54.560]  the radio guys who were drinking every night and you know eating t-bone
[35:54.560 --> 35:58.040]  steaks and kind of got out of shape I've tried to get back into shape once you
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.960]  get out it's very very hard when I'm up here preaching about this stuff you know
[36:01.960 --> 36:10.040]  I'm warning myself as well as you and it's hard to avoid bisphenol a with you
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.080]  when you drink bottled water when you're out on the road or you know you're at an
[36:14.080 --> 36:18.840]  event and people are drinking whiskey but you just want to have a coca-cola and
[36:18.840 --> 36:24.360]  it's full of aspartame full of bisphenol a you know full of corn syrup
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.840]  depending on what you're drinking you can't hardly find sugar can to your gum
[36:28.840 --> 36:33.920]  at a gas station that may have 50 60 choices and my children are begging for
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.360]  some candy and it either has aspartame almost all of it including sugar gum and
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.440]  candy or it's got corn syrup and even chocolate has got corn syrup now you
[36:44.440 --> 36:52.240]  can't find a sweet treat you've got a mail order it I have found stripes gum
[36:52.240 --> 37:03.760]  has sugar in it but it's still got some problem-causing dyes in it but I'll
[37:03.760 --> 37:08.160]  occasionally give that to my children as a treat now I said I was go open the
[37:08.160 --> 37:14.720]  phones up and we are for pastor Kathy Tim Jim and others but you are under
[37:14.720 --> 37:21.440]  chemical and biological attack and we know they've been spiking measles mumps
[37:21.440 --> 37:30.280]  rebella jabs H1N1 vaccines other major vaccines with RNA and every time they
[37:30.280 --> 37:34.880]  get caught adding these viruses they say it's a mistake but we have clearly
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.280]  evidence that it was not a mistake with Dr. Sox polio vaccine that gave over a
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.800]  hundred million Americans the government estimates deadly cancers that
[37:43.800 --> 37:48.880]  were unknown in humans previously the that particular virus SV 40 is
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.000]  communicable we know that the UN has been caught on the back of a tetanus
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.920]  pathogen adding a female hormone to sterilize women they've been caught in
[37:58.920 --> 38:05.080]  India Africa Asia and Latin America this is all on record you just search the
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.680]  term UN caught sterilizing women through vaccines just last Friday in fact will
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.040]  you reprint that for me guys Rockefeller Foundation called for vaccine to
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.560]  sterilize population since I mentioned it last Friday I should actually read
[38:20.560 --> 38:27.880]  those passages that was from 1966 thank you the point is it's guaranteed this is
[38:27.880 --> 38:31.600]  going on and now they want of all these different classes hundreds of them
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.320]  they're developing hundreds that are being publicly developed according to
[38:34.320 --> 38:40.440]  Wired magazine and others of these bio-enhancing viruses one of them of
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.640]  course is a herpes virus that's for life that you can't get rid of that piggy
[38:46.640 --> 38:54.840]  backs steroids associated with aggression and resistance and determination
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.640]  that's their own admissions so you won't have stress or anger and piggybacked on
[38:59.640 --> 39:05.680]  the herpes virus is that hormone class it's a selection of hormones to your
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.640]  brain can't even absorb them I mean hey this is really happening and they come
[39:09.640 --> 39:14.040]  out and announce it like it's a good thing and everybody's knocking down the
[39:14.040 --> 39:24.160]  clinic doors to get these shots but you talk about selling your soul at CBS and
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.680]  ABC and NBC all over the news saying look we'll just start under the new federal
[39:29.680 --> 39:33.680]  health care act your employers will have to get your fat index you'll be given
[39:33.680 --> 39:38.080]  higher taxes you'll be regulated you'll have elder care visit you you'll have
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.000]  CPS visit you it's already happening in Arkansas and other places if your child
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.360]  is overweight by one pound and their body index of what they say is natural and
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.040]  healthy is very skinny for most body types because a lot of people you know
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.200]  have a husky body type and so for them to be quote you know in shape or to be at
[39:57.200 --> 40:04.960]  a healthy body weight you've got to be very very skinny and so they've put all
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.360]  these chemicals out there that make you obese give you cancer that destroy the
[40:10.360 --> 40:16.640]  fertility of men that hyper feminized women they know full well what they are
[40:16.640 --> 40:23.040]  doing in fact before I go to your calls here's the article Rockefeller
[40:23.040 --> 40:30.280]  Foundation develop vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction prisonplanet.com
[40:30.280 --> 40:42.080]  by Jerry in my sin excuse me I said 1966 this is a 1968 report and it's 1968
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.080]  yearly report the Rockefeller Foundation acknowledged funding the
[40:45.080 --> 40:49.000]  development of so-called anti fertility vaccines and the implementation of mass
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.560]  scale from page 51 onward we read and remember built one of Bill Gates's
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.120]  uncles Bill Gates's dad headed up Planned Parenthood they work for the
[40:59.120 --> 41:05.360]  Rockefellers we've confirmed that and this hundred plus billion that these
[41:05.360 --> 41:11.240]  40 billionaires have put in 38 billion from the Gates's 38 billion from Buffett
[41:11.240 --> 41:15.800]  some more billions added by these other billionaires the Rockefeller Foundation
[41:15.800 --> 41:19.920]  is running this and remember the times of London headline billionaires meet in
[41:19.920 --> 41:27.360]  secret to plan population control population reduction and at the end of
[41:27.360 --> 41:30.560]  the article it talks about a world government to carry this out what is
[41:30.560 --> 41:36.920]  eco science cover and it says several types of drugs are known to diminish
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.960]  male fertility but those have been tested have serious problems of toxicity
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.400]  yeah by Sphinol a look what's happening to our girls right now and poor little
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.480]  things I know a lot of women who are 18 19 20 years old getting breast cancer
[41:51.480 --> 41:54.840]  right now and they're going in and burning those tumors out and a lot of
[41:54.840 --> 42:01.040]  them are dying every time I get my haircut or I talked to women in a
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.640]  grocery store I hear women talking at a restaurant it's about their daughters
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.560]  dying of cancer at 25 I've got employees whose girlfriends are dying of
[42:11.560 --> 42:17.360]  cancer of died of cancer kids are dying all over the place in the news
[42:17.360 --> 42:23.080]  cancers are up by several thousand percentage points and they're just
[42:23.080 --> 42:30.520]  killing us and enjoying it they've deployed toxic sterilants against you
[42:30.520 --> 42:34.840]  because see by making a girl go into puberty when she's three four five six
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.160]  seven eight years old the media saying seven it's it's even younger yeah it's
[42:39.160 --> 42:43.880]  hundreds of thousands at seven but it's thousands at three why do you think men
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.800]  that even exercise are getting what bodybuilders call
[42:48.800 --> 42:54.440]  female dog breast I'm not going to use the
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.640]  pejorative term is that the word
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.640]  you're being bathed in chemical and biological warfare that's the cops the
[43:08.640 --> 43:12.960]  military all of us and we just keep serving the bankers oh there's another
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.240]  headline stomach cancer rate increases in young adults well yeah when you're
[43:17.240 --> 43:23.120]  eating BT corn and wheat and cotton seed oil that's killing the cows that they
[43:23.120 --> 43:26.280]  feed it to and killing the pigs they feed it to a lot of pigs or have the best
[43:26.280 --> 43:30.120]  olfactory nerve of any land animal much better than a bloodhound they won't most
[43:30.120 --> 43:35.720]  pigs will not eat GMO corn or GMO wheat or soybean seeds I mean excuse me
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.520]  soybeans also have that same system in them but but that's the whole soybean
[43:40.520 --> 43:49.800]  soybean derivatives and cotton seed oil several types of drugs are known to
[43:49.800 --> 43:53.960]  diminish malfertility but those that have been tested have serious problems of
[43:53.960 --> 43:57.480]  toxicity this is from the Rockefeller Foundation very little work is in
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.320]  progress on immunological methods such as vaccines to reduce fertility and much
[44:02.320 --> 44:06.440]  more research is required it was solution is to be found here and then it
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.120]  goes into how they spend hundreds of millions of dollars in their report to
[44:10.120 --> 44:16.040]  develop these systems and they've been caught doing it I mentioned the tetanus
[44:16.040 --> 44:21.720]  shots earlier now remember that report I covered yesterday and guys I know it's
[44:21.720 --> 44:24.240]  in yesterday's stack maybe you can dig it out or print it again
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.560]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation tens of millions of dollars to fund La Raza
[44:29.560 --> 44:36.560]  why would this mega elite family creating a hundred billion dollar eugenics
[44:36.560 --> 44:40.100]  fund that openly wants world government why would they fund a group that says
[44:40.100 --> 44:45.320]  for the race everything for those outside the race nothing when Planned
[44:45.320 --> 44:50.440]  Parenthood is stated goal from its founding is to kill Hispanics and blacks
[44:50.440 --> 44:54.440]  well they're going to use the third world desperate population that's
[44:54.440 --> 45:00.120]  nationalistic as a political arm to destroy private property rights in the
[45:00.120 --> 45:03.880]  second amendment in the Republic and once the Republic's fallen they'll then
[45:03.880 --> 45:07.760]  suck them into the government-run health care system and soft kill them at their
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.200]  leisure they want the Mexicans here so they can use them as a tool but also get
[45:13.200 --> 45:18.040]  their smart kill going and there's a lot of funding now to Mexico to start the
[45:18.040 --> 45:23.320]  smart killing on their people as well so they want to act liberal and saddle up
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.280]  to you and be your friends so they can kill you that are in a hammer but kill
[45:26.280 --> 45:28.840]  you slow
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.440]  your diabetes is up over a thousand percent in average but what is it three
[45:34.440 --> 45:40.840]  thousand percent last number I saw in Hispanics I drive down the road every day
[45:40.840 --> 45:44.600]  and at bus stops I see young Hispanics with both their legs cut off just
[45:44.600 --> 45:51.920]  everywhere in wheelchairs waiting for buses 20 years old 25 30 their skins
[45:51.920 --> 45:56.840]  purple their giant and fat their legs are cut off you like being murdered well
[45:56.840 --> 46:01.560]  they like murdering you I don't want you to die I don't want you to abort your
[46:01.560 --> 46:05.360]  babies but I will stand against you being formed into an army against my
[46:05.360 --> 46:08.960]  second amendment my private property I've got to take control the government
[46:08.960 --> 46:12.600]  through the Republic with the people if you want to join the fight to get the
[46:12.600 --> 46:16.680]  Republic back and bring these murderers to justice and these globalist then I'm
[46:16.680 --> 46:20.960]  your brother but when you work for Bella Melinda Gates and their foundation of
[46:20.960 --> 46:27.080]  death you are my enemy choose a side choose a side now same thing for black
[46:27.080 --> 46:31.640]  groups totally under control the globalist there it is Bella Melinda
[46:31.640 --> 46:37.880]  Gates Foundation gave millions to La Raza the last decade in one year alone
[46:37.880 --> 46:43.320]  they gave six plus million then it gets into the tens of millions going back to
[46:43.320 --> 46:51.080]  the 60s with the Ford Foundation part of this whole operation to create matcha
[46:51.080 --> 47:00.720]  and La Raza I think you're smart enough to figure this out
[47:01.560 --> 47:06.000]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.960]  reduction now the media is going to tell you how much they love you and how they
[47:10.960 --> 47:16.360]  love your law infasura and your law reconquista it's just because they want
[47:16.360 --> 47:20.640]  to destroy the United States and drive down the wages do you actually want to
[47:20.640 --> 47:24.680]  read about how they want to kill you maybe some of you do maybe some of you
[47:24.680 --> 47:29.200]  don't maybe it feels too good to be murdered slowly by the globalist okay
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.760]  don't say you weren't warned they go on to say using vaccines reduced male
[47:35.760 --> 47:38.760]  fertility was something that needed to be investigated further according to
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.200]  Rockefeller Foundation because both the oral pill and the IUD were not
[47:43.200 --> 47:47.960]  sustainable for mass scale distribution and of course they want to do it by
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.680]  stealth oh get your flu shot oh you know half of you'll never have kids the
[47:53.680 --> 47:56.600]  other halves will have reduced see it's got to be soft kill it can't hit
[47:56.600 --> 48:01.400]  everybody or be too noticeable but they're testing how much they can get
[48:01.400 --> 48:05.600]  away with right now we are faced with the danger within in the next few years
[48:05.600 --> 48:09.800]  these two modern methods for which such high hopes have been held will in fact
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.920]  turn out to be impractical on a mass scale the possibility of administering
[48:13.920 --> 48:17.880]  hormone preparation to reduce fertility was also mentioned although states the
[48:17.880 --> 48:21.720]  report they have been known to cause bleeding problems which may limit their
[48:21.720 --> 48:26.160]  usefulness people notice how bad it is a
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.080]  simple management or a newable subcutaneous implant of these hormones
[48:32.080 --> 48:35.760]  has been suggested but whether or not the same difficulties would result has
[48:35.760 --> 48:40.480]  not been determined and remember they deployed all of this later saying that
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.520]  research thus far has been too low-grade to produce any sustainable results the
[48:45.520 --> 48:52.360]  report was adamant the foundation whenever to assist in filling this
[48:52.360 --> 48:56.040]  important gap in several ways seeking out and encouraging the development of and
[48:56.040 --> 49:00.520]  providing partial support to a few centers of excellence in universities and
[49:00.520 --> 49:04.360]  research institutes the United States and abroad in which the methods and
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.720]  points of view of molecular biology are teamed with the more traditional
[49:08.720 --> 49:14.680]  approaches of embryology endocrinology in research pertinent to the development
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.840]  of fertility control methods you know they want to hit those babies in the
[49:20.840 --> 49:24.360]  womb kind of like the UN programs worldwide where they only want to help
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.720]  the pregnant women they come give them shots and they all have miscarriages on
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.960]  the spot and they send armed troops to enforce the injections and that's what
[49:32.960 --> 49:40.400]  America's turning into as well I mean you can't ignore this number two support
[49:40.400 --> 49:43.600]  research of individual investigators oriented towards development of
[49:43.600 --> 49:47.160]  contraceptive methods or basic information of human reproduction relevant
[49:47.160 --> 49:50.680]  to such developments three encouraging by making research funds available this is
[49:50.680 --> 49:56.600]  40 plus years ago as well as other means established and beginning
[49:56.600 --> 50:01.960]  investigations in turn their attention to aspects of research in reproductive
[50:01.960 --> 50:05.920]  biology that have implications for human fertility and its control for
[50:05.920 --> 50:09.800]  encouraging more biology and biochemistry students to elect careers and
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.120]  reproductive biology and human fertility control through support of research and
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.000]  technology and teaching programs in departments of zoology biology and
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.200]  biochemistry the list goes on and has the motivations for these activities world
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.200]  population reduction and they have another report in 1997 review of
[50:28.200 --> 50:32.760]  anti fertility vaccines population control the New World Order is another
[50:32.760 --> 50:40.000]  major essay issued by the Rockefellers and then you've got all these graduate
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.640]  students when dr. Eric Bianca came out and said he wants 90% of the population
[50:43.640 --> 50:48.240]  dead they came out and said how dare you attacking Alex we want to kill all
[50:48.240 --> 50:52.320]  humans humans are a parasite and I looked up as graduate students they're
[50:52.320 --> 50:56.080]  almost all of them working in bio weapons development they can't wait to
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.800]  just release it and murder you and I know you'll enjoy it

[52:11.480 --> 52:15.760]  through their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool for
[52:15.760 --> 52:19.760]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[52:19.760 --> 52:24.520]  control the United Nations would take over America the Tri-Lateral Commission
[52:24.520 --> 52:29.080]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[52:29.080 --> 52:33.040]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[52:33.040 --> 52:37.000]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.720]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[52:40.720 --> 52:45.000]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.320]  everyone else and I got news for you you're everyone invisible Empire secure

[53:06.880 --> 53:13.720]  order 11,004 will they do it will they pull the trigger this time we all pray
[53:13.720 --> 53:18.680]  they stand down but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[53:18.680 --> 53:24.680]  day think it can't happen here executive order 10,990 locks down all

[54:17.560 --> 54:22.960]  Foundation have pumped the Ford Foundation billions but in the the other
[54:22.960 --> 54:27.400]  groups hundreds of millions into creating Mecheloraza and other groups
[54:27.400 --> 54:33.160]  because they run the leadership and so Hispanics will never suspect because
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.080]  they're wrapped in the Mexican flag particularly Mexican Americans that
[54:37.080 --> 54:39.920]  these groups are controlled and most of them are compartmentalized and don't
[54:39.920 --> 54:45.200]  know this is so you trust them so that you won't notice what's happening to
[54:45.200 --> 54:49.920]  you but they're attacking everybody white people as well and you need to
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.320]  understand this I just showed you the numbers of what's happening to blacks
[54:53.320 --> 54:58.800]  and Hispanics in this country now you can wake up now or you can go along with
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.240]  all of this but I wanted to play another clip we'll put the article up on
[55:02.240 --> 55:08.080]  screen with the headline CNN gas promotes chemical BPA is good then we'll
[55:08.080 --> 55:12.520]  come back and take calls for the full next hour but let's go ahead and play
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.640]  that part of that video clip here it is but joining me now dr. Elizabeth
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.080]  wheeling president and founder of the non-governmental nonprofit American
[55:21.080 --> 55:25.120]  Council on Science and Health she believes much of the concern over
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.200]  environmental toxins really doesn't have a basis in reality also here is Ken
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.600]  Cook director of the environmental working group a nonprofit research and
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.280]  lobbying group he says a government regulation of chemicals has not gone
[55:36.280 --> 55:41.160]  nearly far enough thanks to both you for joining us thanks for having me you
[55:41.160 --> 55:44.160]  know it's interesting dr. we want to start with you you say you said you
[55:44.160 --> 55:47.560]  want to clear up some misconceptions about the association between
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.720]  environmental toxins and children's health what are some of those
[55:51.720 --> 55:56.840]  misconceptions do you believe that they can be harmful first of all there's a
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.160]  major gap between what people perceive about chemicals and health versus what
[56:01.160 --> 56:05.880]  the scientific reality is you know we are surrounded by chemicals mainly from
[56:05.880 --> 56:12.000]  nature everything is chemicals and we have to accept that I know of no case
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.160]  where an unborn child a child or an adult has ever suffered health
[56:18.160 --> 56:23.160]  consequences from exposure to trace levels of chemicals I feel this is all
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.920]  a distraction we want parents to worry about the the real threats to their
[56:27.920 --> 56:31.840]  children things like wearing seat belts getting a smoke detector getting
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.360]  vaccinations you know that you know the drill and instead they're okay that's
[56:35.360 --> 56:38.560]  enough worrying about that you know whether I can't look at that witch
[56:38.560 --> 56:48.120]  anymore with her facelift and the rest of it look they they always stated like
[56:48.120 --> 56:52.160]  it's asinine there's no proof it's like Al Gore there are no scientists who don't
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.080]  believe in man-made global warming not one of course that's a total lie the
[56:56.080 --> 57:01.280]  majority say it's a fraud the climatologist the hydrologist the
[57:01.280 --> 57:06.320]  meteorologist it's on record the vast majority she just says she knows of no
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.040]  case doesn't matter if there's thousands of studies doesn't matter if our girls
[57:10.040 --> 57:14.760]  weren't going into puberty till 13 now they're going into puberty at 7 doesn't
[57:14.760 --> 57:18.560]  matter of breast cancers off the charts doesn't matter if all these problems are
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.080]  happening doesn't matter in all the lab rat studies they know what bisphenol a
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.040]  does they know what aspartame does she goes on to say there's no evidence that
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.600]  pesticides have ever caused a problem really they told my grandfather that
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.360]  would probably gave him lung cancer was cooper talks which was cyanide they told
[57:36.360 --> 57:40.080]  him in the 50s it was safe and he'd throw on the backs of his cows you know
[57:40.080 --> 57:46.320]  to keep the flies off of them I guess Agent Orange was good too right and I
[57:46.320 --> 57:51.920]  guess Obama's come out and the EPA has now come out and said that there's no
[57:51.920 --> 57:55.920]  health problems associated with core exit of course they admitted exon Valdez
[57:55.920 --> 57:59.160]  it's killed almost all the people involved the average life expectancy is
[57:59.160 --> 58:06.480]  51 but she just says there's no problem she just says that's the end of it she
[58:06.480 --> 58:09.840]  just says she has no evidence so in our article we list a bunch of studies and
[58:09.840 --> 58:15.440]  articles admitting the problem yeah when your wife at 35 gets breast cancer your
[58:15.440 --> 58:22.760]  kid gets it at age five or when your son is infertile or your daughter's got

[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.160]  and such and I'm calling you about something else that I tried to get on
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.400]  yesterday was got a girl to lente and couldn't but there's an article by
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:09.680]  Heidi swander on the olive tree ministries all the tree view this is
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:16.160]  what she said it and there on on April 2nd 2009 the work of July 4th 1776 was
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.160]  nullified at the meeting of the G 20 in London the article was written by Dick
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.080]  Morris and according to Morris it says essentially announces a global economic
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:32.200]  union with uniform regulations and bylaws for all nations including the
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.360]  United States and it says here this new financial state of being was confirmed
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:44.480]  in a statement made by Jean-Claude Tricep president of the European Central
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.840]  Bank and Gordon Brown yes no it was all over the foreign papers world
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.680]  government established run by private banks with the sworn oath to protect the
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:01.080]  planet from humanity it also says in here in his speech he said that for the
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:07.080]  good and appropriate functioning of global finance it is extremely important
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.600]  that we and this new ownership of global governance have particularly on
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:18.520]  both sides of the Atlantic that means us to the implementation of the same rules
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:24.400]  in the same fashion yes it's global standardization we're a private global
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.160]  six banks make all the rules it's all admitted and the media will announce it
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.920]  out of one side of their mouth but on the other side say it doesn't exist go
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:39.280]  back to sleep yeah and that's why all this central bank stuff being passed as
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.160]  far as given the federal government free reign and everything else all that is a
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.720]  Congress has went in and passed all that so that goes right along with this and
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:52.080]  something else you was talking about all these diseases that people are getting
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:58.200]  well as you know I'm from Ohio and I'm telling you what there is an increase in
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:06.040]  people getting mercy the disease mercy where it just actually eats your skin
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:12.840]  off of you where the only way it can be treated is with silver yeah a lot of the
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.040]  major studies admit it's destroying your immune system especially in the skin
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.480]  in the epidermis and so what's happening is all of these antibacterials
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.160]  everyone is using are literally destroying your immune system and then
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.560]  just regular old bacteria can just have a delicious meal I appreciate your call
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.320]  pastor good points and I did see Dick Morris's column last year about that it
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.040]  it's just all out in the open let's go ahead and talk to Kathy and Indiana
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.320]  Kathy are on the air hi Alex thanks for waking me up thanks for calling I wanted
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  to tell you about something that happened to my husband and myself about
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.960]  five weeks ago we were camping out with friends about an hour north of Indian
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:01.720] apolis right in the middle of a bunch of cornfields and we were on a lake that
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:07.720]  was on the backside of a reservoir when we woke up the next day on Saturday he
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:14.240]  was dizzy my throat was sore we had had a lot of rain week or so before that and
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.000]  the but the water had receded and so it was down about two feet and there was a
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.440]  gray film that went all around that two-foot area now above the water later
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:32.680]  on in the day a crop duster kept flying over and flying over and flying over and
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.400]  it's been four or five weeks now and I still don't have my voice back well
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.680]  according to that according to the government the media any chemical is
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.040]  good including cyanide and mercury when we when we were driving home I was
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.560]  still daylight out and we're driving through cornfields and there was a
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.680]  there was a clearing and if there was a pole bar and a white a white pole bar
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.480]  said Monsanto all across the front of it amazing this is Alex Jones with five

[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:39.720]  Washington you're on the air hey hello Alex I had a question for you real fast
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.120]  about the effects of BPA and how prolific it is out in this in our
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.520]  environment from the reports I've read it says it's in hard plastics and if I
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.680]  look around my house I see nothing but hard plastics like my television has
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.760]  hard plastic my keyboard my mouse DVD yes it's in most products it's in most
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:04.880]  home plastic pipes PVC it's in most the water treatment plants it is in the
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:10.080]  lining of Coke cans Pepsi cans the little juice containers that are papered
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.240]  on the outside they're plastic lined the worst thing is TV dinners and other
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:20.960]  microwavable foods is is is bisphenol a and when you heat it it literally off
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.080]  gases into it and it's it's it's very very deadly but I mean look at the
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.000]  effeminized men look at the hyper feminine women look at the breast cancer
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.800]  I mean it's just devastating us yeah I can totally see just one of the streets
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.960]  just walking around or any anywhere you look you can see the effects of these
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.680]  chemicals is there a way to detox your system do you know of a way to detox your
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.120]  system and leach it from your your body there are a lot of different chelation
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:53.000]  systems the biggest thing is organic raw foods exercise weight loss most of the
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.640]  stuff gets stored in the organs in the bones but and in the fat and the fat is
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.160]  the main holder of these chemicals and so by losing weight you will get
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.600]  pimples you will have a lot of oil come out you will feel sick as you detox and
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:14.000]  aspartame is very dangerous especially if you're drinking a lot of aspartame
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.760]  laden foods or drinks you need to go off slowly and there's online doctors who've
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.960]  broken down the detox just like prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitors you need

[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:49.080]  Mississippi are on the air on Alex hey buddy just two quick things I wanted to
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:56.320]  bring to your attention is or the entire Mississippi State Guard every unit in the
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.640]  State Guard has been redesignated to military police yes they're converting
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.240]  them into basically federal auxiliaries further removing any state sovereignty
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.840]  just like they took our senators in 1913 that were elected by the legislature
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.560]  being creatures of the state and moved them to federal exactly and as in you
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.840]  talking about federalization the Pentagon is actually actively moving and
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.160]  trying to federalize my state guard and their federalizing local police through
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.240]  the funding and training absolutely absolutely and the good news about that
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.260]  though is of course I've got a family member he's a mid-level commissioned
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:41.800]  officer and talking with some of you know some of his confideries there and
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.720]  some of the higher level guys most of them are totally awake to the the whole
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.600]  FEMA camp and all that kind of good stuff that's the good news and I'm gonna
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.960]  cover it at 40 after that the power of the states is inherent in the 9th and
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:05.240]  10th Amendment and is unstoppable if the people breathe life into it and that's
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:11.200]  why the feds are trying to come in and federalize not just the state guard you
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.080]  know the National Guard that's assigned to the state and the governor but the
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.800]  state guard itself because they know it is a major remedy but remember ever 9
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:27.320]  11 and I have this in my film martial law 9-1-1 that I made in 2005 and in the
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:33.960]  film we go over all of that information and show state guards all over the
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.440]  country under federal direction running checkpoints in downtown Mobile
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.120]  Alabama and other places searching small children training everyone to be
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.840]  under martial law so people bought into it for a while but now there is an
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:54.360]  awakening and matter of fact one of our units here in Mississippi actually were
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:16:00.640]  disbanded because they actually came to gunpoint confrontation with FEMA over a
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.320]  sovereignty issue where FEMA was overstepping their bounds I didn't know
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.000]  that worded I mean I know that sheriffs and others had to throw out FEMA when
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.960]  they were cutting power lines and police communication lines that CBS news but
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:18.240]  when did this happen this happened during Katrina and I believe I believe my
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.480]  family member told me it was in Gulfport and like I said he's a major so he's
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:29.680]  very credible and you know guys it it's absolutely almost anybody can join a
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.400]  state guard and having the right people in the right places at the right time
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.640]  that can make a world of difference on how things pan out for you and me I
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:42.120]  agree a great solutions Chris we're a elaborate on that coming up let's talk
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:48.000]  to Kevin and Alabama Kevin you're on the air yes sir hello mr. Alex Jones and
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.160]  thank you for all your great work I had called you yesterday evening or at least
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:01.840]  your news line to let me know about the Reuters release of Matt Simmons being
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:09.680]  killed which they can they can disapprove it but I think it's certainly what
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:16.880]  happened because he spoke out about the oil gusher out there in the Gulf that's
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.960]  right here's the headline BP critic Matt Simmons found dead in a swimming pool
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.600]  famous for its controversial criticism of BP and calls for full disclosure
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.960]  regarding its true nature the oil disaster in the Gulf is dead WLBZ the
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.100]  Knox County Sheriff's Department says Matthew Simmons founder of the Ocean
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:38.680]  Energy Institute drowned at his home on North Haven late Sunday night Simmons was
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.160]  a leading investment banker for the energy industry and recently retired
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.040]  worked full-time on the new Ocean Energy Institute he was leading proponent of
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.400]  offshore and wind power and sort of raising money to develop and build
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.880]  offshore turbines and and now we have former senator Ted Stevens believe dead
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.200]  along with the former head of NASA's Sean O'Keefe and a plane crash that
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:08.760]  happened today yes sir and you you're covering things that are pertinent this
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:15.160]  country is being taken over it's very simple anybody who can't see it it'll
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.880]  better wake up and I try to spread the fact that this is a place to come to get
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:29.280]  the truth you're not gonna get it from NBC CBS or CNN I've tried to talk to my
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:36.480]  family about it they think I'm crazy and I have somebody close to me who just
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:47.160]  sold their their military company and I wonder why and they did very well but I
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:52.600]  wonder why but what's going on out there in the Gulf it was supposed to be so he
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:19:00.480]  said three miles from the original site there's fractures in this in the oh well
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.080]  that's admitted I mean it's a hoax that they fixed the oil well it's leaking 20
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:10.360]  miles away and they just tell you everything's fine exactly and and the
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.720]  most ludicrous thing about it if we're talking poisons here we can put this
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.320]  phenol a aside for a second how about them tell me it's okay y'all going out
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.960]  there and fish let's get the fishing going and y'all start eating the fish now
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:32.720]  I'm sorry for those fishermen a commercial and so on and so forth but
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:39.200]  dispersants and these fish and stuff are polluted with well I mean the bigger
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.280]  fish whether it's a flounder or a mahi mahi or a swordfish they eat smaller
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.600]  fish and then it precipitates those chemicals out in them and then we eat
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:53.240]  them and we got a mega dose of poison but the government now says core exits
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.400]  good for you it was good for the folks that cleaned up Exxon Valdez they only

[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:38.080]  disagrees we'll go to the head of the line ray are on the air how you doing
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.040]  Alex I'm doing all right all right hey I thank you for doing a lot of the stuff
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.600]  you did on floridation the 9-11 thing and the vaccine I gotta disagree with
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:53.840]  young global warming and your stance on socialism as well no okay well I mean
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.360]  that the socialism is great and all the big banks always finance it because it's
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.320]  a way to rob the little guy and you're talking about I mean I don't know what
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.160]  I could say to you I'm only gonna say one thing about socialism I want to move on
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.080]  the global warming if you're expecting the capitalist the bankers and other
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.960]  industrialists the vaccine companies pharmaceutical companies to play nice
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.760]  you're asking for socialism and the only person who started giving us that was
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:25.240]  Franklin Roosevelt and we don't have him no more I wish we could dig him up with
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.720]  problem back on let me break this down let me break this down you have to have
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:35.040]  a small government but you have to have an informed population these big
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.680]  corporations always lobby for more government to use it as a tool to rob us
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:46.040]  we need to have state governments that prosecute people for putting poison in
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:54.080]  the food we need to have local control not a big federal government okay
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:26:00.560]  as it may I'll move on the global warming it was back in the 80s when
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.280]  British scientist James Burke aired a show on global warming that happened to
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:11.880]  catch oh no summer between 1980 and 85 or so then in the 2000s I saw on an
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.720]  internet article in the Boston Globe that it said that the oil and the coal
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.960]  industry are spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a global
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.840]  warming disinformation campaign and they're getting people to say what they
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:27.200]  want to say I can't help but feel that you're one of those people that they're
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:33.720]  paying I mean you may not be but I that is an outrageous outrageous statement
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:39.520]  for you to make you know to come on my show and say I'm being paid I'm not
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:45.560]  paid one red scent to sit here on the air and say that I don't believe in man
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:51.160]  made global warming sir we've had 14 times higher carbon dioxide and the
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.040]  geological record plants and every study grow faster are more healthy put
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:02.000]  off more oxygen than animals and humans have higher levels of oxygen I mean
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.800]  whether you believe in carbon dioxide being bad or not having globalism and
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.480]  cutting our carbon footprint in the US and Europe will only move our jobs to
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.840]  China and India and Mexico where they won't have the carbon taxes and it will
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.240]  boost the amount of carbon dioxide but I mean that's just like when I had the
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:25.200]  Rockefeller I mean the Rothschild era on he just said well you must be funded by
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.600]  the oil companies it's actually British Petroleum Exxon Mobil and others are the
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.720]  biggest funders of the carbon tax it was Ken Lay of Enron and BP on record in
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.560]  95 and 96 that developed the plan with Bill Clinton and Al Gore now I just gave
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.720]  you facts and it's the big oil companies now pushing the carbon tax because
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.640]  they're owned by the big banks they want that to be the funding mechanism for
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:56.040]  their new global banking system and that's all on record and you just call
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:02.040]  in and as a throwaway line say I read a Boston Globe article a decade ago that
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.880]  says they were funding this and there I have read where some smaller oil
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.360]  companies to protect themselves they don't get shaken down and can still
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.920]  drill have fought against carbon taxes but they've all caved in but the big
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.080]  ones have always been for it I mean that's an amazing statement I mean
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:22.320]  you're saying I have no integrity and you have no proof as well and that and
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.520]  that I just get up here and I paid by oil companies instead of debating me on
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.680]  science you just you know throw that out there which completely discredits you
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.200]  can I say one last thing please well hold on just a minute hold on you need
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.920]  to respond do you have any evidence I'm paid by oil companies go up to Gary
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.120]  know that common look at the truth behind the climate hey I'm putting you on
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.080]  hold I put people that disagree to the head of the line and when you get up
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.560]  here on my show and say that you think I'm taking money from oil companies when
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.000]  all I do is expose how corrupt they are and how they're globalist I give you
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:09.080]  evidence at the big five oil companies in the last 15 years plus AP in 2002
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:16.280]  sued and got thousands of pages of documents where the big in that case it
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.160]  was the top 10 oil companies got together and said we want to use
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:26.560]  environmentalist groups to shut down refineries so there's a bottleneck so
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.440]  that we can jack up prices because there's too much oil now I'm gonna come
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:37.040]  back to you Ray and I'm gonna give you a chance again to give me your proof that
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.000]  I'm paid by the oil companies okay I mean you got to love this you call up
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.560]  here with an amazing lie with a fraud of course you like socialism it shows your

[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:06.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.720]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.680]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.080]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:22.520]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:27.120]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.160]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.840]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:51.400]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.160]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.280]  1-877-327-0365
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:19.440]  well we've done an hour and a half a broadcast I'm gonna go back to Ray James
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.680]  Kevin Brooks Scott I've got some other news I want to hit on dealing with the
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:28.200]  power of state government and important powers that a lot of people aren't
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.000]  aware of and we've got to get the word out about this but before I go back to
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.560]  Ray this is a real sticking point with me because we're funded by our sponsors
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:44.600]  and we're funded by video and book sales and t-shirt and ball cap sales and
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:54.000]  prisonplanet.tv memberships that's how we're funded 100% by you and I get so
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.280]  focused on doing the radio show that I don't even have the capital right now
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.200]  to finish the TV studio I'm gonna give you a tour of it soon we built the
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.360]  building and the structure now I've got to fund the equipment we're buying the
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.640]  cheap stuff but it's still in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and so
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:21.000]  you fund this radio show you fund info wars.com and prisonplanet.com you're
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.760]  the people that make this radio show possible and I need your support when
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:33.440]  you purchase t-shirts books videos you get informative tools to wake people up
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.400]  but you also support our operation and we've got a link down at the bottom of
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.720]  info wars.com that's a link to our PayPal if you just want to donate that's fine
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:50.160]  or if you want to write to us at PO Box 1 9 5 4 9 Austin Texas 7 8 7 6 0
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.200]  we're fighting the oil companies that are funding the global carbon tax and
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.680]  owned by the big banks we're funding the open establishment of world
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:03.480]  government and their neo feudalism using fake environmental rules to shut
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.560]  down all the small guys and only let the big boys operate it's about monopoly
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.920]  we are fighting for the life of this republic and this planet for the
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.000]  Second Amendment and everything else and the fruits of what we done and what
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.640]  we've been able to do with your support are massive and so I would ask
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.760]  listeners to remember when you buy an Obama deception or in game or invisible
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:31.800]  empire in order to find or terror storm or when you buy don't tread on me or
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.960]  the secretive eyes you support this broadcast when you buy a t-shirt or a
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.240]  ball cap or a bunch of citizen rule books we basically sell at cost that
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.920]  funds this operation we've just gotten these in very inexpensive you get bundles
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.440]  of them from 5 to 100 at info wars dot com on the online shopping cart info
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.760]  wars dot com pens that give me a document cam shot of these and it's a
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:02.600]  great way to remind somebody to visit the site you know you buy one of these
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:08.240]  pens for 75 cents or depends on how many you buy how how much they cost but you
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.240]  get them for even lower than that and you say hey visit info wars dot com here's
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:19.040]  a pin you'll pass these out to people and yeah we'll make a few sense off of
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.600]  each of these that'll fund the operation but everything we do is about
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.840]  getting the word out and we need more support not less and I want to commend
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.320]  this audience the name Barry Sataro Barack Obama's real name he's an
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:37.080]  Indonesian citizen that's totally proven the Kenyan evidence is clear as well
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:42.720]  but on 100% that was the number one search term and scores of blogs and
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.600]  newspapers ran stories on it here's one Barry Sataro president Barack Obama
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:53.880]  sets internet on fire fraud with Barry Sataro why Barry Sataro top Google's
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:37:01.040]  trends I mean literally more than 30 articles just in the last 24 hours
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.120]  talking about a CIA pedigree all of it because you took action and we expose
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:14.480]  Barry Sataro Barry Sataro pushing the Carmen tax who do you think runs the
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:18.240]  oil companies the big banks who do you think's raping us who do you think his
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.440]  third biggest contributor was it was BP in fact let me just play this short
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.560]  clip here's a clip from Shell with their vice president for global governance
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.880]  global government and you can go read their full vice president for global
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:39.840]  governance office calling for global carbon taxes Exxon Mobil Shell BP all
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:46.480]  of them I mean then I told that caller specifically about the meetings with
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.960]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Ken lay the head of Enron and the head of BP I said
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:56.560]  respond to that no I'm not you're paid by the oil companies I mean and I said
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.840]  respond give me your proof of that I give you proof I give you facts we're here
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.280]  being poisoned we're here being killed I'm risking my life and this guy has no
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.160]  respect for who I am no respect for what I've done and no respect for himself I
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.480]  love how people who want to intellectually attack us make stuff up
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:17.920]  that's what delusional people do people never face us on the facts they make
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:23.760]  things up and that's an incredible charge 200 years ago if you just said that to a
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:30.360]  founding father they said I'll meet you outside sword or pistols but nowadays
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:35.000]  people just are cowards they just call in my name's public who I am is public
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.400]  I'm out in the open and he has the nerve to throw the gauntlet down and say I
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.400]  think you're funded by the oil companies and I say listen here pal you put up or
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:47.400]  shut up you give me the evidence and he says I'm not gonna do that look
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.720]  regardless I'm taking up too much time it's just I know I'm for real I know I'm
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:58.240]  good I know I care and it just it just makes me sick to hear how socialism's
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:01.200]  good when all the big banks are funding and he just can't get it through his
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:08.520]  head he doesn't understand the big oil companies want a monopoly and they're
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.560]  bringing in the carbon taxes I give him facts well let's play the short clip
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:18.600]  here it is the future climate change energy and economic recovery are a
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.400]  hugely complex issue and it will take more than governments alone to solve
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:28.200]  the problem industry needs to provide expertise and government needs to step
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.800]  up with solid regulatory frameworks that signal where we need to invest to
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:40.560]  provide good solutions so encouraging dialogue on the energy challenge well I
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.800]  mean that's that there you go the there's my proof you know my proof is the
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.320]  club of Rome 25 years ago said they were gonna have a carbon tax and I show
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.480]  screenshots of it an end game my proof is actual documents I don't just get up
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.160]  here and say the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill Gates is funding La Raza and

[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.240]  air oh cool okay now I didn't say you definitely were paid off I just said
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.920]  there are articles out there especially on Gary mill dot com that say people are
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:08.200]  being paid off and he has truth on that plus the climate science itself and it's
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:16.240]  a lot of glad he has the truth I appreciate your call so ridiculous so
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:20.560]  of course some smaller oil companies that didn't want to be shut down what did
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.480]  the Texas Banking Association do four months ago the president of it wrote an
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:30.760]  article saying this financial reform law gives total anonymity and secrecy to
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.760]  the Securities and Exchange Commission that protected Madoff for 11 years it
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:41.600]  allows the six major megabanks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase Bank of America
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.360]  Wells Fargo city group to take over the entire economy what did Ron Paul tell
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:52.320]  you what did the Poletano tell you same thing same thing it's in the bill we've
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:43:00.200]  read the subsections now I got emails saying you must be paid off by the
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.000]  banks to be against this because the banks don't want it the big megabanks
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.720]  wrote the stinking thing it's it's not my fault that I'm informed okay I've done
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:16.280]  the research and yeah 15 20 years ago there were some smaller oil companies
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.360]  being harassed and not able to drill and they wanted to put more taxes on them
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.560]  of course they lobbied but the big mega oil companies they want the taxes to
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:29.920]  shut them down because most of those taxes then get conduited back in to the
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.080]  big central banks that own them it's just it must be too complex for your
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.440]  ray but I'm glad you admitted you have no proof that I'm paid off by all
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:48.160]  companies just you didn't respond though to the fact that I laid out for you you
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:44:00.120]  never listen none of you people do I don't even know what to say anymore it's
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:04.920]  just there's there's people are so weak-minded they just don't understand
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:12.480]  anything they don't have any common sense every major oil company has been
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:17.880]  promoting carbon taxes in the last decade it did you mean did you see the
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:22.000]  coverage of Copenhagen the meeting last year and who was there financing it do
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.520]  you read magazines and newspapers and see who's pushing carbon taxes it's
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.480]  almost nothing but oil companies and banks
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:37.200]  you'll find out with the financial reform bill you'll find out okay just
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:45.800]  it's meant to take over the entire industry it's about monopolies big mega
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.440]  corporations are bigger than most governments they're using government
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.360]  power to consolidate their market I don't know how else to explain that to you
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:04.200]  I I just really don't okay if I can have a document cam shot for prison planet
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:12.240]  dot TV viewers I'll go over this thank you this is government code or the code
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:20.680]  written out of the state of Texas law title for executive branch
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:27.400]  subtitle C state military forces and veterans chapter 4 3 1 state militia
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:38.800]  sub chapter a general provisions okay state of Texas it exists not paid off
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.120]  by all companies to tell you this okay Texas is real you called from their
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:48.800]  ray I'm sure you know it exists now they've demonized the militia and told
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.400]  people that the militia is the federal regular army and they're even now
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:56.120]  trying to federalize the National Guard that's assigned to the states under the
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.320]  governors and that's in the john warren defense authorization act of 2007 for
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.360]  insurrection against the citizens and the governor so the federal government
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.280]  saying that the National Guard is now totally federalized under homeland
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.440]  security control itself run by foreign offshore banks and now they're coming in
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.120]  trying to basically weaken and disband depending on the state not just the
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:22.840]  sheriffs they're trying to get rid of those that's chartered under the state
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:31.160]  it's over the city incorporated within that county those political subdivisions
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:41.280]  and within that in every major state they have the right to revoke claws like
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:48.440]  article 10 in New Hampshire we have similar ones in Texas but there's also
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:53.520]  for case of insurrection or invasion not only can the governor call out the
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:01.880]  posse or call out the militia but county commissioners the county judge and the
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:09.920]  sheriff and I want to read to you now from this document this is section 431
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:18.560]  point one one two calling of forces by other official I'm reading you section
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:25.120]  431 point one one two calling of forces by other official if military aid is
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.960]  immediately and urgently necessary to prevent or suppress violence under
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:37.800]  section 431 point one one one see and it is impractical to secure the aid in
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.720]  time by order of the governor to direct judge of the judicial district the
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.400]  sheriff of the county or the mayor of the municipality which the disturbance
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.400]  occurs may call for aid on the commanding officer of the state military
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:56.320]  forces stationed in the judicial district and this is what a lot of
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.760]  constitutional scholars have said these committees of safety Evan Vieira Dr.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.360]  Vieira and others have talked about the police are really supposed to be the
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.360]  state militia and they're supposed to be under the county and the sheriff and he
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:13.400]  he or she calls on them when needed and then that way it's you and you're in the
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:24.400]  local community and you're a volunteer and then they have a core that's paid it
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.360]  goes on in which the disturbance occurs may call for the aid of the commanding
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.840]  officer of the state military forces stationed in the judicial district
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  county or municipality of the adjunct judicial district county or municipality
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.200]  the officer must make the call in writing and shall immediately notify the
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:46.680]  governor of the action and then it goes on to break that down now let me
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:52.200]  continue state insurrection section 431 point one one five state of
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:56.600]  insurrection the governor by proclamation may declare any portion of
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  the state where state military forces are serving in aid of the civil
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:05.600]  authority to be in a state of insurrection if the governor determines
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:12.600]  that law and order will be promoted by the declaration now that's why they're
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.600]  getting rid of state militias ladies and gentlemen when you've got sheriffs five
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.000]  miles in being robbed at gunpoint by Mexican drug gangs when you've got the
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.640]  collapse of society when you've got shootouts every day when you've got
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:29.800]  people being killed it isn't the right it is it is the duty not just of the
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.960]  sheriff and the county judge and the mayor and the governor and the
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:41.640]  legislature but of you the citizens to demand that the militia be called out
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:45.560]  but now they've a lot of the attributes so it's got to be built and that they
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:51.160]  respond and you'd find plenty of Texas men by the hundreds of thousands ready
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.920]  to rotate in and out on three month tours and plenty of bosses willing to
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.240]  let them off for that period of time and it'd be very inexpensive to pay for
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:05.560]  their three months of service and they'd be rotated in and out that's how
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:10.880]  America works but instead we've got the feds off in Washington coming in and
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.080]  suing on behalf of foreigners which is a violation of the Constitution and
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.720]  Bill of Rights it is an act of treason we've read the subsections here on
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:23.920]  air in the past to for the federal government to sue a citizen or a state
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:30.560]  or a judicial district on behalf of a foreign power or foreign individual that
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.360]  was the what 11th amendment the first thing they did what was it in the 1800
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:41.160]  was it 1799 I forget because they already had problems with foreign lobbyists
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:45.320]  coming in trying to get the federal government to harass states and have
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:50.160]  undue influence over trade and security so the feds won't do their job
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.720]  protecting the borders and they won't let the states do their jobs but it's
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.920]  clearly in the state law that they must protect the border and call out the
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.640]  militia and that's you every able-bodied man hi this is Alex Jones did you know

[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.480]  speaking down there but but David I I want to get into the poisoning of the
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:39.680]  food and water supply these new viruses that they say will cure stress that will
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.440]  reprogram the brains you can't get upset or resist but you weren't listening
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:49.960]  earlier but I want to throw this out at you from your research this guy called
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:53.480]  in and I shouldn't have gotten mad at him I apologize for calling him a punk but
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.600]  he should apologize for claiming he thinks I'm funded by the oil companies
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.440]  and I'm not been given one cent by all companies to point out that the oil
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:04.840]  companies the big ones are promoting the global carbon tax to openly fund their
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:09.040]  new private world government from your research what is the carbon tax about and
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:12.560]  I mean is it not all over the news that the oil companies are funding the
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:18.720]  carbon tax the thing is Alex that what people need to appreciate is that you
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:25.840]  see oil companies you see pharmaceutical companies you see government you see the
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:30.920]  medical world and all these different elements of society the military but
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:37.120]  these are different masks on the same face if you see them as individual you
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:43.600]  say why would the oil companies want a carbon tax and less oil being sold and
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:49.440]  oh no they'd never do that well that's not what it that's not the situation they are just an agent
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:55.080]  of this central global manipulating core and you've broken that down before
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.280]  showing how all the major BP Dutch World Cell Exxon mobile people are also the
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.720]  heads of the trilateral Commission Builderburg Group Club of Rome and it's
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.640]  all interwoven it's just a few hundred people exactly this is what I say to
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:14.600]  these people who go on marches about globalization and then would dismiss the
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.120]  kind of things that appear on your show and in my books and talks and stuff is
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:22.480]  oh no that's extreme that's not going on what they're saying is the transnational
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.160]  corporations like the oil companies and the other transnational corporations
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.160]  they're behind globalization centralization of global power because
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:37.560]  of greed no BP the oil companies and all these other trans nationals are not
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:44.480]  the the engine room of globalization they are the vehicles for it and so what
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:51.280]  may appear to be not good for the oil companies in terms of carbon taxes and
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.920]  less use of all this stuff is actually good for the agenda which the oil
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:01.800]  companies are one strand within once you start to understand that what appear to
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:05.800]  be contradictions become perfectly understandable and perfectly logical and
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.160]  we have the heads of all these major oil companies and the head of NASA and the
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.880]  head of the UN saying they want a post-industrial world to cut off our
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:19.320]  energy to carry out forced population reduction the first thing industrializes
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:25.000]  they get us dependent then they start cutting it off yeah and what they want
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:33.520]  is is basically a global fiefdom where people will just be drugged up zombies
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:39.200]  who are just able to function enough to serve as slaves and nothing more and
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:45.680]  we're at the point of epoch change here Alex it's very very important maybe we
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.520]  could get into this after after the news and after the break because all this
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.840]  stuff you're talking about with the brain-eating nanotechnology and
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:00.640]  viruses and what's in food and water is specifically designed to destabilize the
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:06.160]  body computer system the receiver transmitter system of the the human
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:12.280]  body so that it is locked in to an area of information decoding which is a
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:18.240]  tiny tiny fraction of the information that that is available for us to decode
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:24.880]  it's like the wireless internet you know if you are in some countries you can
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:29.520]  get all over the internet but if you're in China it's firewall off so you can
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:33.960]  only get to a fraction of the and the brain is an electrochemical computer and
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:38.120]  they now admit they want to sterilize us with vaccines and they want to brain

[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:33.760]  happening in Europe England the United States it's feminizing boys and now I
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:39.080]  have times of London the male wired magazine oh they're gonna inject the
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:44.120]  troops with DNA boosters that block off areas of their brains over gonna give

[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:57.440]  those emotions and they say because we want to calm you down and they now
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.760]  admit that that's what the fluoride is about they're now proposing suddenly and
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:05.160]  literally hundreds of newspapers in the last three weeks we've covered it here
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:11.720]  lithium needs to be put in the water to calm everyone a toxic metal anti
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:16.200]  psychotic everything David Ike has talked about we know this has already been
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:20.160]  going on from all the studies now they're coming out with it David are they
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.000]  doing this because they're getting desperate and we've been exposing them
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.040]  and now they want to take the power of exposure away and just spin it well I
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.400]  think that's part of it I mean there's more and more holes that are being
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:37.600]  sprung in the dyke every day of their suppression of understanding and
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:42.520]  knowledge of what's actually going on but if you go back many decades Alex to
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:48.280]  1932 when a book was published by a guy called oldest Huxley called brave new
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:54.200]  world people have said to me over the years what's the plan and I said well
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:59.960]  just read two books to get the feel for it one oldest Huxley brave new world to
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:08.000]  George Orwell's 1984 now interestingly oldest Huxley was a teacher at Eaton
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.840]  College this elite college that the Royals go to near Windsor Castle and
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.120]  one of his pupils was a guy called Eric Blair who later wrote under the name of
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:22.200]  George Orwell and they were connected because you'll know this well and many
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:27.720]  other people to the Fabian Society and because the Fabian Society which was the
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:31.680]  creator of the British Labour Party of Tony Blair and all the rest of it because
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.920]  they are a major strand in the web if you are an inner circle member of that
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:42.280]  you have access to the projected agenda for the world going forward a long time
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:48.520]  and this allows you to write prophetic novels apparently novels from actual
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.600]  understanding of what the game is and then when we get to where we are now we
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.520]  look back and we go that brave new world in that 1984 my god they was so accurate
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:02.240]  how did they do that because they had access to this information let me back
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.200]  you up let me back you up I always have to interrupt David because I want to
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:08.480]  back him up because he just states the facts I want to give you the proof
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:15.280]  David there is a 1962 hour-long speech he gave at Berkeley just just Google
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.920]  oldest Huxley Berkeley speech you'll hear the audio and he said in the speech
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:25.240]  that his pupil was George Arwell he said that his brother was the head of the UN
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.000]  eugenics program Julian Huxley and he said my pupil is wrong it will only be
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.560]  20 or 30 percent 1984 the rest is making you love your servitude with chemicals
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.880]  this is what we plan with eugenics and I'm telling you now because you're too
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:45.840]  weak to even resist us and then he died two months later he knew he was dying so
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:49.800]  he went ahead and came out and said I wrote this in 32 he also wrote that in
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.000]  Brave New World Revisited written the 50s he said this is our actual plan this is
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.320]  non-fiction sorry David go ahead well that's absolutely right and what he's
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:04.000]  talking about and writing about since the 1930s is exactly what's happening
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.520]  today because he knew it was coming he had access to the projected agenda and
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:13.040]  that is to control people through drugs and then the reason that some of these
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.360]  so-called prophetic writers can write novels futuristic novels including
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:21.800]  technology and drug techniques that weren't even thought about at the time
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.120]  they wrote them is because they have access to the agenda and this takes us
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:31.840]  somewhere else in Brave New World the theme is that parents no longer bring
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.280]  up children or even give birth to them they're brought up in state countries and
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:44.840]  it's all laboratory birth basically creating clones for the masses who have
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:48.760]  no ability to think with any level of intelligence they would stay there got
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.200]  to interrupt you long time and coming up and now the state calls the family a
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:56.400]  disease they admit the plan is to end the family they're gonna have your own
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:00.040]  schooling then your kids will stay there till nighttime we'll be right back

[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:30.520]  tall dwarf creatures that serve the elite their main focus was to make their
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:38.440]  slave class go into puberty at around age seven but then to also be quasi
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.040]  sterile but they wanted to go into puberty so they be developed as work
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:46.560]  slaves by that point so they couldn't challenge them now the age of puberty is
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.280]  moving to seven and girls the bias phenol a has done well and he bragged he
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.920]  said he said look arty in England before he died he said we've got remote
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:00.160]  control at the middle institutions with a brain implants he said my brother at
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:04.000]  the UN is developing this he said this is the plan and so when you read that
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.680]  science fiction book it's not science fiction again he wrote a book decades
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:12.000]  later called brave new world revisited nonfiction where he just laughs at you
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.600]  and you know points out that most of us will be killed David like you were
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:19.160]  getting into the hatcheries how they take the babies at birth how they
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:23.760]  genetically engineer them in laboratories that's their plan and now
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:27.040]  they're moving and I got Pentagon declassified documents to just fly
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:31.560]  over us and spray the viruses on us we get a headache we get sick and then it
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:36.560]  destroys our receptors that allow us to think or become angry and so I that's
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:39.320]  clearly where they're going not just lacing the vaccines with this please
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.200]  continue yeah and the other aspect of this I mean you mentioned a few minutes
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:49.920]  ago is this multi-level attack on on the family unit and I've got really
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:55.600]  seriously into one area of this over the last six months which is the state
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:01.520]  stealing children from loving parents it is an absolute epidemic in Britain I
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.440]  was speaking at Trafalgar Square on Saturday at a rally against child abuse
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:10.120]  in which this stealing children by the state was a fundamental part of it I've
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:14.560]  been getting involved in one or two individual cases and trying to give my
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:19.000]  support to mothers who've had I'll give you I'll give you one example
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.520]  young daughter she's now 10 says the father has been abusing her for years
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:30.680]  the mother takes the daughter to social services and the police and says this is
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:35.440]  what she's saying and and I want unsupervised visits to the father stopped
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.760]  be a bit till we've sorted this out they refuse to investigate and when she
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:44.080]  then starts action against the police and the social services for not
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.720]  investigating they then say to her we think you're a split personality and
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:52.920]  and away goes the child and they give the child to the to the relative of the
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:57.320]  father but David David specifically I've had members of British Parliament on and
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.760]  it's even in your mainstream news in the London Telegraph that there are quotas
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:06.520]  on children before they're even born for the adoption racket that's right and
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:11.480]  financial incentives around the world to to meet these targets which means if
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:15.760]  you can't find enough genuinely abused children by their parents then you have
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.000]  to find those that are not but of course it's not only that Alex as we know I
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.040]  mean a lot of these kids I mean if you want if you're a satanic Peter Far
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:28.560]  ring and those two usually connect in fact almost always connect to some point
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.800]  then you need a supply of children a constant supply of children of course
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.080]  the social services can do that in fact they can target children I know this is
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:42.400]  going on Alex where someone will target someone a child they'll see a child in
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.000]  the community on the say I want that child and then someone from the ring in
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:51.080]  social services then finds a reason why the child shouldn't be with the parents
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:54.720]  some serious reason we've had a situation here this is one of endless ones
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:01.920]  where this woman and her husband she had fertility treatment 38,000 pounds worth
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.320]  gave birth to twins social worker came round when they came out of hospital she
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:10.920]  made a joke hey I'm having giving birth has ruined my figure and they took a
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:15.240]  child away and when she got angry as you would they said all the mothers also got
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:18.240]  anger problems and therefore a danger to the child and this is going on
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:24.440]  epidemic wise and in the cases that I've been involved in and I'm involved in
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.080]  I've seen blatant lies where the social services have put into reports the
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:34.600]  mother has faked medical evidence of abuse on the child and I've seen the
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:38.600]  doctors report whether where it came from it wasn't fake to talk so it's all
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:42.280]  lies and what they've done this is another element of it and not just in
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:46.360]  social services but the very very significantly so because of the children
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:51.400]  being taken but in government in general they are using job application
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:58.560]  techniques to elicit narcissistic personalities who have no empathy who
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:04.440]  have no compassion who have no ability to empathize with the agony of loving
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:08.280]  parents having their children taken away and they're getting the jobs in social
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.960]  services which is why all these parents say it's like talking to a computer these
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:17.080]  people have no soul but David going back they're constantly catching the heads of
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:21.600]  social services worldwide running pedophile rings I mean that's even
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:27.360]  CNN but expanding on that this is part of a larger agenda as you know when they
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:32.320]  set up eugenics 150 years ago now 160 years ago in England by the turn of the
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:38.600]  century 1900 they created racial hygiene health departments in Germany England the
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:44.640]  US and Canada that openly so the health department itself is to carry out eugenics
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.560]  and that's why they now admit blood is taken secretly at birth from all babies
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:54.480]  in the West and put in a Pentagon database yeah and what what's going on
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:58.800]  in this country and I did research for my for my latest book in America as well
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:02.280]  on this it's happening there and the time happening there places like
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:09.600]  California is that they are taking so many children from parents there was a
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:13.160]  story in the mainstream media a few days ago where they were saying we could
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:18.120]  run out of foster parents because we're having record numbers of children taken
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:22.280]  from their families now what this is of course it linking into what we're
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:28.160]  talking about today it's all part of the process of removing influence and power
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.480]  of parents on their children's lives and handing it to the state and now they're
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:38.160]  saying he was talking about and China's the model of the one-child policy many
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:41.360]  of their children are raised in government dormitories where they work
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:45.800]  half the time in factories and they're now saying they want year-round school
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.400]  12 months out of the year and they want children to stay at school till 9 10 at
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:54.140]  night that's to get the test scores up when the more funding they have the
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:59.160]  dumber they get it's all by design and I have the government textbooks that are
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:03.920]  given to CPS workers where they call the family a disease and and part of an
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:09.200]  archaic age now what do we do I mean looking at the current phases why are
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:12.200]  they now coming out and admitting we want to put lithium in your water we
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:15.920]  want to give you shots to make you feel good we're going to put viruses in your
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:20.480]  brain that make you submit I mean they've gone from denying this to now
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:26.680]  coming out and really taking the gloves off well I think they have in one
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:29.960]  level there are many levels to this but I think in many ways they had they have a
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:35.080]  time scale problem and I've been talking and writing about this for the best
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.240]  part of 20 years and I know a lot of people might think it's it's far out
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:42.840]  and all the rest of it but but the evidence is pointing that way all the
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.920]  time and that is this the first book I ever wrote after I woke up to all this
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:52.160]  20 years ago I called it truth vibrations because I understood that
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:59.320]  there was an energetic change coming and what we live in is a cosmic version of
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:05.920]  the wireless internet you know this reality is information and we are
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:11.640]  decoding through the body computer vibrational waveform information into
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:14.840]  electrical information into digital information and then finally into
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:19.320]  holographic information which is the physical world that we apparently is
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.360]  outside of us but actually only exists in our in our head just as the internet
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:28.720]  only exists inside the computer as it decodes it and we're going now through an
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:35.040]  epoch change in the cycle the natural cycle of this reality which in Asia they
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.960]  call you guys and and all around the ancient world they talked about the
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.360]  secular nature of time where we go through different epochs of different
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:49.160]  periods of experience some are suppressed and unlimited and some have
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:52.920]  periods of great expansion which the ancients used to call the golden age
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:59.160]  epoch or the golden age you got and we're now at this epoch change where this new
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.960]  energy I call it truth vibrations this new information epoch is coming in
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.840]  which is about expansion it's about opening your mind it's about opening to
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:14.040]  a much greater range of perception and what's happening it's no accident Alex
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:18.600]  but it's at this point that this control system which has been in place for a
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.160]  long long time is throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the plot
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:29.360]  and the plug at humanity because it is trying to destabilize the body
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:35.160]  computer's receiver transmission system electromagnetically through all the
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:38.880]  electromagnetic soup that we live in and the microwaves and all the rest of it
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:43.560]  and through chemically through what they put in water what they put in food
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:48.480]  what they put in vaccines so it's like basically putting a virus into what
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:53.880]  computer it might this computer in front of me as a massive virus in it's not
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:58.240]  going to decode the worldwide web collective reality in a way what if the
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:03.000]  virus wasn't there and that's what they're doing because this new information
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:10.680]  epoch carries information that is gonna absolutely give us a totally different
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:15.520]  view of the world reality and self we're going into an incredible period and by
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:19.200]  the way David expansion and they're trying to stop us connecting with that
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.080]  you're absolutely right because in their own words they say there's a massive
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:26.320]  awakening and that they've got to suppress it and that's why they want to
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:31.240]  bankrupt society so we're dependent on the state so they can force all these
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:35.960]  controls on us but from your research you believe they're going to fail they're
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.880]  going to fail yes for a simple reason that there's gonna come a point where
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:44.600]  this new energy this new information that's what it is it's like it's like
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:50.960]  the wireless internet suddenly starts to morph into a different information
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.280]  constructs and of course what's the computer gonna do it's gonna suddenly
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:00.080]  manifest a different reality on the screen because it's now decoding a
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:05.040]  different information construct that's what's happening so we're at the cusp
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:11.960]  now where basically the irresistible force which is this change is coming
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:16.280]  face-to-face with the moveable object which thinks it is the control system
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:21.440]  but isn't and what it's doing now like I say it's throwing everything it can I
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:27.760]  mean it's a bit like a duck mate where it looks calm on the surface and in the
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:34.280]  control systems way it looks arrogant but actually it's paddling like crazy
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:39.920]  under the water because people are waking up I mean look 20 years ago what I
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:45.200]  mean one of the things that I learned about this information epoch change was
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:49.400]  that 20 years ago what is it was going to bring to the surface or that had been
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:57.600]  hidden from us now look like 20 years ago no no evidence 10 years ago maybe but
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:00.560]  look at it now stay there stay there
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:05.680]  hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters thinking of calling a
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:10.960]  debt relief company don't greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:16.480]  why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:22.040]  best-selling author Herb K's number one debt secret the how-to on stopping the

[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:36.320]  the information you need to do it yourself for free Herb K was right his
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.840]  free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt what do you have
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:44.440]  to lose stop the calls now get out of debt and have more money get Herb K's

[02:20:54.200 --> 02:21:04.640]  7850 800 405 7850 the question is where should the American people draw their
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:10.320]  line in the sand what have we got a republic or a mocking a republic is
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:14.360]  based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:17.960]  rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:23.200]  our land they think they're on our water children our education our money we have
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:28.400]  to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:34.000]  you did during the Patriot uprising we have the facts we have the Constitution
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.720]  we have the Bill of Rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:41.640]  gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you don't tread on me rise the
[02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:45.520]  Republic tyranny is upon us but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:50.080]  American people is rising a new tool in the info war don't tread on me order it
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:57.920]  info wars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:03.600]  independent patriotic Liberty films as many people know ever since president
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:07.120]  Nixon took us off the gold standard the US dollar has been evaluating what
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:10.560]  people don't know however is how this directly affects your personal finances

[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:12.200]  we're sad for him Ted Stevens confirmed that the plane crash there's a man the
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:17.200]  senator are still shrouded in reports of corruption David you got cut off by the
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.400]  break you were saying 20 years ago hardly anybody was awake and the evidence
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:26.720]  wasn't prolific 10 years ago some info was out there but now it's racing and
[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:31.000]  I talked to police you know five years ago Austin cops would walk by when they
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.920]  saw me at the mall or on the street would make jokes at me now they come
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:39.200]  over scared and say we appreciate you we know it's all true what do we do and I
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:43.600]  talked to other police and other cities I talked to military they say the
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:47.880]  awakening is incredible and of course that's the the enforcers power structure
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:52.480]  so continue with the awakening you're seeing and what the controllers are
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.160]  going to do not just chemicals and biologicals but wars depressions scares
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:00.520]  I mean going into this big time of change how are they going to try to
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:06.000]  suppress this global awakening well I'm having the same experience with you
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.280]  know people in the system who are seeing it you know the what putting this
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:16.280]  information out has done it's broken the compartmentalization of the pyramids
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:21.700]  because the pyramid structures within this control system keep people in the
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:24.760]  dark of what they're actually part of you know they're working in governments or
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:28.160]  the military or the police and they get doing their job and going home but they
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:31.760]  don't know how their contribution every day connects to this contribution and
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:36.720]  that contribution to create a very very sinister national and international
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:41.120]  pattern but putting this information out as people like us have been doing over
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.200]  the years has actually broken that compartmentalization because people have
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:49.640]  been able to start seeing within the system actually how their contribution
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:53.840]  does pan out with others what is actually happening and that's a that's a
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:59.880]  massive massive lubricant cross that is where people who are administering and
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:05.240]  law enforcing the system into into everyday life start to realize the
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:08.640]  implications of what they're doing for their own children and grandchildren so
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:13.000]  that's that's another massive step forward in this in this awakening but
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.920]  see what we've got is the different levels of the body computer we've got
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:21.920]  the chemical level the one level it's a chemical organism so they hit the
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:28.000]  chemical balance through additives in food additives in water and and vaccines
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.040]  and all the rest of it then we've got an electromagnetic balance and they're
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:34.360]  trying to hit that with all this electromagnetic pollution that even
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.840]  mainstream media are talking about this soup or fog that we live in now with
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:42.640]  all this technology and microwaves but there's another thing when we feel
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:49.800]  emotion and our mental and emotional state that fundamentally affects our
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:54.880]  vibrational state because at one level we're vibrating energy that's what we
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:01.120]  are information and so if you can get people into a state of fear this is
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:04.040]  this is one of the key reasons there are many reasons for it but is one of the
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:09.200]  key reasons that society has been structured to create as much fear as
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:15.160]  much stress as much worry as much anxiety as possible about what about the
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.520]  future what about the rent what about my job what about the war all this stuff
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:23.440]  what about the kids because when we go into those low vibrational states it
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:30.840]  closes us down so that we're not able to access an expanded awareness an
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:35.720]  expanded perception so they're flooding a high vibrational state it's all to do
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.200]  with frequency so they're flooding all of our inputs and they admit we're an
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:45.200]  electrochemical computer and they now admit they're trying to perfect our
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:50.320]  brain and want to fix the defects by hitting us with viruses that literally
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:55.880]  destroy the neuro receptors this appears to be their checkmate and again as I
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:58.080]  mentioned I have the Pentagon documents we've covered them here where they have
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:04.480]  plans to spray cities with this as a biological and chemical commutative how
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:09.960]  do we respond to their ultimate checkmate well you know this may sound
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:16.200]  right but I don't really care because I feel it's absolutely true you know we
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:22.960]  are being bombarded Alex on all these different levels of being for one simple
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:30.880]  reason we are extraordinary expressions of genius we are extraordinary
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:37.720]  expressions of consciousness and what they've got to do is to attack us on all
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:41.920]  these levels I mean this is there scared of us we're powerful we're made in the
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:46.040]  image of the creator and they know it well this is an analogy that I've used
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:53.480]  a few times and if you want to put a ball in an unnatural state in a tank of
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:58.720]  water you want it on the bottom of the tank then you have to hold it there
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:03.120]  you can't put it there and then take your hand away because it's back to its
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:08.440]  natural state floating on the top and our natural state is of expanded
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:13.360]  consciousness that we would call genius and and you know they're able to create
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:19.640]  what we would perceive from this reality is miraculous things what we are has
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:26.280]  been suppressed we are not manifesting who we really are we manifesting a
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:31.120]  subordinated suppressed version of what we are this is how the control system
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:37.920]  controls us and so when we open our minds open our consciousness understand
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:42.520]  it's a mental emotional thing if you understand and know that you are not
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:46.720]  David Ike you are not Alex Jones you are not Ethel Smith that is your
[02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:52.680]  experience you are infinite eternal consciousness we're on the march the

[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:21.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:25.400]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:29.160]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:33.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:37.240]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:59.720]  panel my solar backup dot com that's one word my solar backup dot com the
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:02.960]  globalists don't own the sun yet folks to take action today start moving
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:05.760]  towards getting off the grid you can call and get a free information package
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:14.600]  at 877-327-0365-877-327-0365 my solar backup dot com now going back to David
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:19.000]  Ike his websites David Ike dot com he's gonna be speaking in five days in
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:24.480]  South Africa he's coming to the United States in October and Davis tell us
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:27.600]  about some of the other places are gonna be speaking in the world I mean the
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.080]  whole thing is exploding which is all part of this awakening I'm gonna go to
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:35.960]  Prague I'm gonna go to New York Times Square in October in San Francisco
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:44.280]  Amsterdam Ukraine Barcelona Lisbon Portugal I'm going to Stockholm Sweden
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:49.560]  then I'm coming to LA next year and so it's amazing what's happening I mean you
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:56.080]  know I couldn't fill a phone box 15 years ago and so you know this awakening
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.440]  it's not a myth it's happening all over the world and this is what's putting
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:05.640]  the control system into panic mode well I agree with you they are going into
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:09.120]  panic mode now now now specifically though you talked about fear and if they
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:13.800]  can keep you in fear you'll go into a catatonic learned helplessness state
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:17.080]  I've seen the psychological studies the governments and corporations are obsessed
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:21.840]  with but these particular vaccines that they call cognitive
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:25.880]  enhancers they want to give school kids the troops they're pushing it like oh
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:28.920]  it's the great new toy coming out in a few months but you can't get it yet
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:32.480]  they're really hyping it with hundreds of these new things that are coming
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.680]  online they aren't they say they want to stop fear and anxiety but the way I
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:41.760]  read it is it's gonna block regular steroids interacting in the brain which
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:47.320]  show aggression or resistance or determination so for me when I say
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.200]  fear I get fearful so I take action but I guess that really isn't fear that's
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:57.000]  resistance and so what so so they want us to be in fear why then would they come
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.560]  out with vaccines that just completely block it where you're an emotionalist
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:05.280]  jellyfish I guess that's the next stage well that's the next day exactly because
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:12.440]  you know once you've got a drug control of the body then suddenly you're doing
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:16.720]  it in a different way you're destabilizing fundamentally destabilizing the body in
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:23.080]  another way as opposed to the to the fear itself see what the body is it's an
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:29.680]  information blueprint think the green codes in the Matrix movie it's an
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:35.240]  information blueprint now when that blueprint is in its prime state we are
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:42.000]  healthy we think sharply we we are functioning perfectly we're creative
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.600]  we're decisive we're beautiful we're we're in tune with the universe we can
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:51.520]  see through what we can't see when we're in a closed state now what we need to do
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:55.360]  I would suggest is see everything as information if we're going to understand
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:59.080]  what's going on here because this is how deeper in the rabbit hole so when
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:05.120]  someone puts a virus or whatever into into a body it's information the virus
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:10.920]  is information it's introducing rogue distorting information that distorts the
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:15.480]  blueprint the basic blueprint of the body and that means that the blueprint is
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:19.200]  distorted so in some way we're going to be distorted through physical health
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:23.080]  through emotional health or through mental health this is what's going on
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:26.720]  it's all about information and just going back to what I said a few minutes
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:35.640]  ago the power of our consciousness to to balance back and hold that blueprint is
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:40.880]  immense this you know that wonderful story of the American professor who was
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:45.240]  doing research on LSD it went out to the east and talked to some mystical
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:49.400]  mixed it guy who'd spent his life focusing on the power of the mind and
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:54.320]  everything and he gave him LSD nothing happened he gave him more LSD nothing
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.640]  happened he gave him an erotic dose of LSD and the guy just sat there and
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:03.160]  smiled at him it didn't have any effect because he was using his mind to
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:08.640]  overpower the effect of the drug now we can do this this is this is where this
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:13.440]  this new epoch is going where we we understand the true power of consciousness
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.800]  in the mind what the control system has spent so much time doing and he's doing
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:23.960]  today more than anything is to try to hold us in a low closed mind closed
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:29.800]  vibrational state so we cannot access that natural power we have the true
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:37.120]  self to to to resist that this all this multi-level stuff that's being
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.640]  thrown at us that was my other issue that was my other issue is that we see
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:46.320]  in the natural world with bugs with insects with microorganisms and with
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:54.240]  animals that over time a lot of times under poison or or drugs or antibiotics
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:00.120]  things just get stronger over time and I've clearly the globalists know this
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:03.320]  they know that all they're poisoning and I've seen this in their literature
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:07.840]  they've said that with a certain minority it's actually accelerating
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:14.880]  awakening and having the opposite effect yeah because of this epoch
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:20.720]  changes going on we're now seeing a very clear forking in the road where one
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:26.560]  kind of track if you like there are people that are staying closed-minded
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:30.960]  they're following the system they're doing and perceiving as they're told to do
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:36.920]  and perceive and now this is ever-gathering other section of society
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.800]  which is getting bigger all the time which is expanding its its its consciousness
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:46.760]  it's opening its mind it's saying look I'm gonna put a blank sheet of paper here
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:53.720]  and I'm not gonna let preconceived belief preconceived idea to edit my
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:59.520]  perception I'm going to let information and my experience lead me to what I
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:03.880]  think is reality what I think is happening in the world and not what I've
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:08.160]  been programmed to believe is me and reality what is going on in the world
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:12.440]  before and that is I mean I mean I'm sure you've seen this Alex I mean so many
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:17.560]  will be so obvious now there is this clear parting of the ways between those
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:22.680]  two groups of people in the world that which is staying closed and that which
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.920]  is demonstrably opening its mind and it's it's it's becoming more and more
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:32.280]  blatant all the time I totally agree with you and that now leads us to
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:36.480]  financial collapse as a way to control us as their own document state but also
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:43.840]  the Iran situation break that down for us David Ike well the story ran I mean to
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:50.000]  understand a massive part of that all you've got to do is is read the big new
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:54.960]  Brzezinski's book the Grand Chess Board in which he said about an area of the
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:58.800]  world called Eurasia which is basically for people who haven't come across this
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.600]  from from Europe in the Middle East across to to through to China and across
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:07.920]  China and this is what he said in the book in 1997 how America manages Eurasia
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.720]  is critical a power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world's
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:17.200]  three most advanced economy economically productive regions a mere glance at the
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:21.360]  map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.920]  Africa's subordination rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania a
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:31.440]  geopolitically peripheral to the world's central continent about 75% of the
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:35.360]  world's people live in Eurasia and most of the world's physical wealth is there
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:40.240]  as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil the Eurasia accounts
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:44.480]  for about three fourths of the world's known energy resources and then you look
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:50.440]  at a map of Eurasia particularly one part of it and that is a line of
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:59.360]  countries from Israel across through to China and it's like a wanted list of
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:06.160]  of the control system you have in that line of countries Iraq they're in there
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:12.080]  they've got control of Iraq as a result of that spurious invasion in that line
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:17.200]  of countries is Afghanistan they've got that at least they're in there and have
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:22.240]  a massive foothold in there next to Afghanistan between that and China is
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:27.720]  Pakistan which as we know they're systematically undermining with with
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:32.920]  false flagged terrorist events and then massive weather situations which may
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:39.640]  well not be natural and then you look at a big elephant in the living room that
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:45.200]  would connect Iraq to Afghanistan and basically apart from Syria complete
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:49.120]  which they're also targeting more and more of course we propaganda they would
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:53.560]  complete that line of countries from Israel right across to China which is
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:57.000]  what they want and that elephant in the living room connecting Iraq to
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:04.040]  Afghanistan is Iran and that's why they want that and if they can't find a
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:08.080]  reason that people will accept and they've not yet what they'll do in the
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:12.240]  end because their time scale is not infinite and quite the opposite is they'll
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:15.560]  try to go in there or they will go in there just without trying to without
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.440]  asking anybody you know what we got to go guys you know we can't wait any longer
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:24.000]  and that's their geopolitical that's their geopolitical aim but at the same
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.920]  time there's the trillions in weapon sales there's the domestic excuse to
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.200]  clamp down the West to stage terror attacks and say that Iran has done it
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:37.480]  and we know that's the real target exactly then you look up north from that
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:42.360]  line of countries and you're into Georgia and you're into Kazakhstan and
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:47.040]  you're going up to the Russian border then and this is all Eurasia all this
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:53.400]  area that they that Brzezinski was talking about in 1997 and you know what
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:59.320]  what is also very important Alex in this whole area is that people are given the
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:06.960]  perception that this is great land of Arabic rule when it's not at all you
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:11.920]  know I wrote an article a few weeks ago which which was basically headed if he
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:20.400]  ran goes Arabia goes because if you look at a map of Arabia and then you look at
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:25.960]  the the controlling forces behind these countries look at it it's supposed to be
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:30.320]  the land of Arabia the land of Islam well Egypt well that's controlled from
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:35.080]  Tel Aviv and Washington and then you've got Saudi Arabia Tel Aviv and Washington
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:40.720]  then you've got Kuwait Tel Aviv and Washington Iraq taken over already as
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:45.600]  we can we can see the United Arab Emirates and all the rest of it I've got
[02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:52.360]  no chance of standing up to this Washington Tel Aviv axis and and so Iran
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:56.920]  is right in the middle there this massive massive country and if that goes
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:03.320]  then it's only remnants left and Arabia is basically gone and it's about divide
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:10.440]  and rule on so many levels because most of the Islamic world is made up of
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:18.080]  funny Muslims the major shia is Islamic center is Iran and so a lot of the
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:22.160]  Muslim world again well I wish we're funny Iran that shia we're not bothered
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:27.440]  about that so much and and what they don't realize when Iran goes it's over
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:32.840]  for them well absolutely and and there is our Israeli plans that have been
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:37.240]  declassified in the 80s Pentagon plans that when they're done with Iran they're
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:40.800]  not just going to stop at Syria they're planning to overthrow Saudi Arabia
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:44.800]  they're planning to overthrow Jordan they're planning to overthrow Lebanon
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.960]  they're planning to overthrow Libya they are going to overthrow all of those
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:55.000]  countries and roll in with the drugs in the water and the vaccines because most
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.680]  of those Muslim countries will not go along with the New World Order they
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:05.560]  don't fit too well into this whole master plan yeah I mean I think that's
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:10.400]  right among the people but you know what they've done in Arabia I know quite a
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:14.080]  lot about this because of people that I know sure their leaders are very evil
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:20.920]  yeah people I know I mean Arabia has been taken over by interlopers you know
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:25.880]  people talk about shakes always royal it's a shake well shake just meant in
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:30.840]  the in the tribal situation she just meant it just meant a wise man and they
[02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:36.240]  morphed it into being royalty and they created this furious off-the-peg
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:41.160]  manufactured royal families who now act as tyrannies in all these countries no
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:44.040]  but I mean that's true I mean that's what the whole Lawrence of Arabia fable
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:48.160]  is is about Saudi Arabia it's actually a true story they went out and just found
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:53.760]  warlords gave them weapons and set them up yeah and so when you've got a
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:58.520]  situation like that Alex where you've got these royal fiefdoms in Saudi Arabia
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:03.920]  United Arab Emirates and all these other places they are dictators to their
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:10.760]  people but they themselves this is the point and so then to the tabal in that
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:16.000]  is run out of places like Tel Aviv and Washington and London and so this
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:21.840]  situation where you have these royal tyranny dynasties means that you only
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:27.120]  have to control a few people before you can control the whole nation of Saudi
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:33.720]  Arabia or to buy Abu Dhabi Bahrain to wait all of it and then they use a
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:40.400]  twisted form of Islam to suppress and control their populations I am back in
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:45.520]  the late 70s I spent eight weeks in Saudi Arabia I love the people they were
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:51.640]  so kind that tell you what the system the royal family it is grotesque it is be
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:57.360]  on the tyranny it is beyond the imagination where people were still
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:00.840]  having their arms chopped off for stealing and all the rest of it it's
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:09.040]  horrible and and that extreme incredible grotesque form of Islam was created by
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:13.920]  the House of Saud which are interlopers that just come along and claim their
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:17.800]  royal or all the rest of it that shouldn't matter anyway to suppress the
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.600]  people and Saudi Arabia I've been saying this for like 15 20 years it's it's one
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:28.280]  of many 51st states of the United States that's why these patsy people
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:33.280]  involved in 9 11 that's how many came out of Saudi Arabia this is why bin Laden
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:40.480]  came out of Saudi Arabia and got put in Afghanistan to front up that the the
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:49.800]  the bin Laden's build most US military bases in the Middle East and I talked
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:52.600]  to spring when they had of the US Embassy they were ordered to let those
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:56.560]  hijackers in they were told they were US government agents exactly and then
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:04.120]  Saudi Arabia is not on the side of the Arab world I mean it's no accident but
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:12.200]  you have got like goodness what you've got in Israel is daily genocide against
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:17.400]  the Palestinian people it is so blatant it's so in your face and nothing ever
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.160]  happens you will have sanctions against Iran will have security council
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:27.960]  resolutions against Iran and these places nothing nothing is done to give
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:32.720]  consequences to Israel for the genocide against the Palestinians but then you
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:39.560]  say where the heck are all these rich massively wealthy apparently on the
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:45.080]  surface powerful Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia the night of out of Emirates and
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:50.440]  all the rest of it's Western people that are going in flotillas to challenge the
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.120]  blockade of Gaza and then you read in the mainstream newspaper that Saudi
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:51:04.200]  Arabia have opened it stay there stay there stay there this is not a drill
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:09.600]  repeat this is not a drill gun cells are on a staggering pace gun prices are
[02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:13.240]  going through the roof and that means desperate vicious criminals now want

[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:10.720]  well to close out this interview with David Ike today we're gonna talk more
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:15.240]  about Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia arguably one of the most corrupt nations on
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:20.360]  earth Israel's got a lot of organ trafficking and slave trafficking and a
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:24.200]  lot of other countries do as well but in the Middle East Saudi Arabia is the
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:28.960]  are the big traffickers in and notice you never hear our media criticizing
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:34.680]  them it's all Iran because Iran is not controlled by the new world order it's
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:38.720]  got to be taken down I'm saying Iran is good I'm just simply stating it's not
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:43.360]  part of the global takeover David to finish your points on that point the
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:50.360]  thing is if Saudi Arabia was a target country there'd be banner headlines all
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:57.160]  the time and exposure documentaries all the time about the grotesque way that
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:55:01.600]  that country is controlled and the way they treat the people but because it's
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:06.320]  it's it's part of the control system of course everyone turns a blind eye it's
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:10.560]  the same with Israel you see because that's part of the control system it's
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:15.320]  a fiefdom of the house of Rothschild I mean people they just let them get away
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:19.640]  literally with mass murder and you know and then you've got Iran and because
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:23.280]  it's a target country of course that that's where all the propaganda goes
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:27.200]  into it's all mind control and mind manipulation and perception manipulation
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:31.800]  you know I've done enormous amounts of research over the years it continues to
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:36.880]  this day about the abuse and trafficking and stealing of children by this
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:41.200]  system there's something about the energy of children that they absolutely
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:46.720]  want and if you go back even into the ancient world when they talked about
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:52.680]  sacrificing young virgins etc to the gods that was code for children they've
[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:56.600]  been doing it all along and now what they're doing it on a massive scale and
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:01.840]  and so many of the the children that are trafficked end up in Saudi Arabia and
[02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:05.320]  these Arab states in the United Arab Emirates of course a few years ago there
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:09.800]  was this massive scandal when they had it is enormous numbers of young young
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:14.960]  boys who were camel jockies in their camel racing system and they they were
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.400]  basically they were held in captivity in slavery it's extraordinary and and
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:26.560]  and that's what these Arab with so-called royal fiefdoms do their
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:31.000]  tyrannies the dictatorships we need a revolution we need a people's revolution
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  in these countries more than or as much as if not more than anywhere else
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.720]  because the suppression of the people in these countries I've experienced it
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:47.280]  it's just extraordinary well it is and if you read the Bible and Leviticus but
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:51.560]  even mainline history give not your children to the fires of Moloch they
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:56.440]  would go throw babies in to the fires and of course takes us to belly me and
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:01.800]  grove and all the other stuff absolutely and all of this is coming out now
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:06.160]  yeah well we talk about Bohemian Grove 15 years ago and get laughed at now it
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:09.960]  comes out that okay many of your Republican leaders are with gay porn
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:14.160]  stars what's the big deal I mean it just shows how compromised they are and then
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:19.240]  you got Barry Sataro Barack Obama the good news is is that they tried to pump
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:25.120]  him up as a messianic savior but that sure fell hard well that's one of the
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:30.800]  most encouraging things of all I mean even where he was with the hyponix and
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:36.360]  his superior when he was elected his honeymoon period has been dramatically
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:42.600]  short given how high he was built up before that is also an expression in
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:46.600]  many ways of this awakening where people start to see through things they
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:50.680]  couldn't see through before this is making it harder and harder for them to
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:55.440]  sell the the agenda to people as there's more and more people see what the
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:00.400]  agenda is they see a that that's leading to that problem reaction solution yes I
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:03.880]  see why they've done that because they want to bring this in this this is
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:09.560]  changing the game it's changing the game and you know it is coming down but
[02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:13.520]  in the next few years it won't seem like that but it's coming down David I look
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:18.960]  forward to talking to you in October David Ike.com the awakening is on but
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:22.280]  the enemy is going to strike back and it is going to be darkest before the dawn
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:27.800]  we look forward to speaking to you again soon take care always informative a
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.600]  very well-spoken gentleman and I agree with his insights in the geopolitical
