[00:45.520 --> 00:51.640]  us including in the third hour a US Army medic who was court-martialed for
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.560]  refusing vaccines but even going through the legal process in the military to
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.120]  have a religious exemption to those vaccines he was threatened with being
[01:01.120 --> 01:05.160]  fragged among other things he's going to join us in the third hour in the second
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.720]  hour we're joined by John Rappaport from no more fake news calm to just we are
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.560]  going to tear into the breaking news now about the drug companies and the fraud
[01:16.560 --> 01:23.800]  and the bribery and the the spiked vaccine test results we now have evidence
[01:23.800 --> 01:29.160]  virtually proof at this point whistleblowers from inside Merck who say
[01:29.160 --> 01:34.040]  that they caught their company spiking the mumps vaccine with animal
[01:34.040 --> 01:39.240]  antibodies to fake the efficacy rate in order to defraud the US government and
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.520]  lie to the FDA and they say that in fact Merck's behavior according to their
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.680]  allegations which were filed in a false claims act that's now a matter of public
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.000]  record they say that Merck actually through their actions contributed to the
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.600]  spread of infectious disease and thereby allow them to sell more vaccines
[01:58.600 --> 02:02.920]  because the disease was spreading gee we're vindicated yet again here in the
[02:02.920 --> 02:06.280]  alternative media which is becoming the new mainstream media the only truth
[02:06.280 --> 02:10.240]  telling media left on the planet it seems we've got that story coming up in
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.000]  the second hour also here in the first hour I've got a review of the new video
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.120]  just put out yesterday by Alex Jones and the Info Wars crew humanities greatest
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.320]  secret I'm going to talk about that and tell you why that is such a big deal and
[02:24.320 --> 02:30.280]  why the the big picture perspective here is so on target to what really matters
[02:30.280 --> 02:35.160]  we are talking about the future of human civilization it's why we've got to
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.600]  defeat the tyranny we've got to defeat the globalist we've got to defeat the
[02:38.600 --> 02:44.160]  the genetic intervention of the future of life on earth because the very future
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.200]  of humanity is at stake and I'll tell you why coming up in the bottom of this
[02:48.200 --> 02:52.400]  first hour but before then now some of the breaking news today check this out
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.120]  well let's start with the simple stuff and then we'll get into the more
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.000]  fascinating things but a poll the hill poll says the majority of Americans now
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.280]  believe Obama has changed the country for the worse 56% of likely voters they
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.000]  say believe Obama's first term has transformed the nation in a negative way
[03:12.000 --> 03:20.800]  you think you think maybe maybe on 35% believe the country has changed for the
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.480]  better where are these 35% I'm curious about those people do they do they
[03:27.480 --> 03:31.160]  think we should run more guns into Mexico do they think we should destroy
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.320]  more of the Bill of Rights I mean how you know how many amendments are remaining
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.080]  before they stamp them all out anyway that's an interesting poll at the hill
[03:40.080 --> 03:46.480]  dot-com here's something interesting a family was slugged with a carbon tax for
[03:46.480 --> 03:51.520]  the funeral so while they were grieving for the loss of a loved one they got
[03:51.520 --> 03:57.760]  slapped with a carbon tax for burying their family member and the it seems
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.920]  like the cemetery here had to apologize because they said quote even the dead
[04:02.920 --> 04:09.520]  don't escape the carbon tax yeah nothing certain but death and taxes and now
[04:09.520 --> 04:14.640]  carbon taxes when you're dead that's what it's all coming to Al Gore should be
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.280]  happy I guess we're all going to keep paying taxes as our bodies decompose
[04:18.280 --> 04:24.040]  and release elements into the atmosphere we're gonna be taxed on that as well now
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.320]  McDonald's is sponsoring the Olympics which is raising question marks with
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.480]  anyone who knows anything about nutrition and health really you're gonna
[04:33.480 --> 04:38.880]  have a high calorie high sodium fast food processed food company sponsoring
[04:38.880 --> 04:42.120]  the Olympics which is supposed to be about elite athletes and peak human
[04:42.120 --> 04:46.640]  performance that's a strange question anyway a lot more news coming up

[08:15.520 --> 08:21.840]  on the alex jones channel listening to the tip of the spear of truth-telling
[08:21.840 --> 08:28.040]  news in its worldwide broadcast on this Monday in July so thank you for joining
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.640]  us we've got an incredible show lined up for you key guests ahead we've got a lot
[08:32.640 --> 08:38.600]  of evidence that is that has come out now showing that murk faked its vaccine
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.520]  studies regarding mom's vaccine and that according to the whistleblowers at murk
[08:43.520 --> 08:47.120]  the company has defrauded the US government and other governments of
[08:47.120 --> 08:52.600]  hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions over the years we've got that
[08:52.600 --> 08:58.280]  story coming up we've got what is that a drone outside I hear something coming
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.360]  in we're being we're being grazed by weird machines out there I think it's
[09:03.360 --> 09:08.240]  just actually lawn care people no no big deal we've got John Rapport coming up
[09:08.240 --> 09:14.560]  in that segment then we've got a US Army medic who was court-martialed because
[09:14.560 --> 09:21.520]  of his religious exemption for vaccines and he he's gonna be joining us by
[09:21.520 --> 09:25.480]  Skype in the third hour to talk about how he was threatened with even being
[09:25.480 --> 09:30.520]  dragged and what he had to go through the abuse that he had to go through
[09:30.520 --> 09:33.640]  because he just did not want to be injected with an experimental vaccine
[09:33.640 --> 09:37.440]  and so these stories tie together where we're talking about the big lie of the
[09:37.440 --> 09:42.040]  vaccines and then how it's happening in the military that these people are being
[09:42.040 --> 09:46.040]  so pressured to undergo the vaccines in fact you know we have another story here
[09:46.040 --> 09:49.720]  about the military let me dig this out of the stack because it's just so much
[09:49.720 --> 09:56.400]  here here it is the what is this was it called the the the Medal of Honor the
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.240]  false Valor Act is that what it was called anyway the Supreme Court at the
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.600]  same time that are ruled in favor of Obamacare as a tax by the way also ruled
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.800]  that it is a free speech right for any person in America to claim that they are
[10:10.800 --> 10:17.000]  a Medal of Honor winner that you can't have a law that provides penalties for
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.040]  lying about winning the Medal of Honor now this predictably is getting a lot of
[10:24.040 --> 10:28.920]  veterans really angry and I'm with them on that I think that the Medal of Honor
[10:28.920 --> 10:34.520]  is is something that's special right I mean you have to earn that you don't
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.360]  just it's not given out at Halloween Halloween like candy this is and the
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.840]  other military medals are earned by people who put their lives on the line
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.560]  and then to allow someone else to go out there and just say oh I won the Medal of
[10:47.560 --> 10:51.720]  Honor and I won this and I won that and I served here I serve there what if
[10:51.720 --> 10:58.720]  those are complete lies to allow someone to lie about that just basically it
[10:58.720 --> 11:02.920]  devalues the the true value of the medal for those who really earned it who
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.000]  really put their lives on the line and all those who would have earned it had
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.080]  they lived through their encounters so there you go the Supreme Court saying
[11:10.080 --> 11:14.400]  that it's your free speech right to lie about the Medal of Honor isn't that
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.680]  interesting so you don't have free speech to protest anywhere near the
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.400]  president you don't have free speech to tell the truth about a nutritional
[11:24.400 --> 11:28.800]  supplement and how it might prevent arthritis or prevent cancer well you
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.000]  don't have that free speech right but you do have the free speech right to lie
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.120]  about winning the Medal of Honor wow where's the honor in that see that's
[11:39.120 --> 11:41.880]  the thing that's what's happening in America the honor is disappearing and
[11:41.880 --> 11:47.800]  it's okay to lie but you are punished for telling the truth that's the real
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.040]  contradiction that is emerging in this culture of total runaway government
[11:52.040 --> 11:56.560]  criminality the thuggish behavior the complete deception the lying the
[11:56.560 --> 12:00.880]  unethical behavior the the pedophiles at the TSA and much more this is what's
[12:00.880 --> 12:06.120]  taking over our country today but moving on with other news natural and
[12:06.120 --> 12:09.520]  organic items are grabbing a bigger share in the marketplace this is
[12:09.520 --> 12:12.760]  interesting because it shows that people are paying attention to what they put
[12:12.760 --> 12:15.760]  in their bodies hey maybe they don't want to get cancer from eating a lot of
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.800]  pesticides but I got a warning to tell you you know and my nickname is the
[12:20.800 --> 12:24.760]  health ranger this this is the area that I study the most a lot of the so-called
[12:24.760 --> 12:30.000]  natural claims on products are completely bogus not all of them not all of
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.840]  them but the word natural just so you know is not regulated by the FDA in
[12:35.840 --> 12:43.000]  any way whatsoever so anybody can make any any product a snack chip a soda even
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.440]  with aspartame in it and they can claim it's natural anybody can claim anything
[12:46.440 --> 12:50.440]  is natural it's not regulated so beware of that term make sure you read the
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.160]  ingredients and know what you're actually getting but anyway the natural
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.800]  and organic grocery sector market is growing very rapidly here's something
[12:59.800 --> 13:02.640]  that'll freak you out you know the you know the highly addictive pain-killing
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.160]  drug oxycontin you know about this drug you've heard about all the addicts and
[13:07.160 --> 13:10.880]  all the break-ins and the pharmacies of people trying to steal this drug and how
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.320]  how how can destroy people's lives once they get hooked on the drug and then
[13:15.320 --> 13:18.560]  they need it and they can't get off the drug and then they go to other
[13:18.560 --> 13:22.760]  transition drugs and their lives are just destroyed well the Wall Street
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.560]  Journal has an article this was actually from a couple of days ago I got a
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.800]  printout right here in front of me the headline here it is July 2nd the
[13:31.800 --> 13:40.480]  headline is oxycontin trial planned for kids for children children as young as
[13:40.480 --> 13:51.000]  six years old six to 16 are going to be brought into a clinical trial to study
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  the effects of two daily doses of oxycontin on these six-year-old
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.400]  children who have quote moderate to severe pain who require opioid
[14:02.400 --> 14:10.160]  analgesics opioids yeah right so so now okay let me get this straight
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.160]  welcome to America you don't have the free speech right to tell the truth
[14:15.160 --> 14:21.080]  about nutrition but we do in the airports sexually molest the children
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.280]  through the TSA agents and now we're going to put children on highly
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.600]  addictive pain-killing drugs when they're six years old not to mention
[14:29.600 --> 14:34.320]  shooting them up with endless vaccines which we are we're gonna show later in
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.360]  the show how at least one of those has been completely faked for over ten
[14:38.360 --> 14:42.320]  years faked we're gonna show that we're gonna have a whole segment on that in
[14:42.320 --> 14:45.800]  the second hour here and then on top of that they put these kids on psychiatric
[14:45.800 --> 14:49.960]  drugs the mind-altering psych drugs the SSRIs the anti-depressants the
[14:49.960 --> 14:56.400]  psychotropics wait aren't aren't children supposed to be sacred isn't life
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.120]  supposed to be sacred aren't children supposed to be protected against this
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.400]  kind of exploitation by the drug companies it is insane that we allow
[15:07.400 --> 15:11.360]  pedophiles to run loose in this country and we allow the drug companies to treat
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.200]  our children like guinea pigs but that's what's going on that's okay moving on
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.840]  because I'll get into crazy areas of discussion about that topic this is in
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.080]  Forbes Forbes an article by Larry Bell you may have already seen this I think
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.920]  Alex mentioned it yesterday the UN agreement should have all go gun owners
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.760]  up in arms this is the UN agreement the small arms treaty and in his article by
[15:34.760 --> 15:39.080]  Larry Bell he points out that if this is passed by the UN and then ratified by
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.920]  the US Senate here's what it's gonna mean are you ready for this here's what
[15:42.920 --> 15:47.840]  it's gonna mean all of you legal lawful gun owners out there listen up it's
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.960]  going to it's going to quote ban the sale trade and private ownership of all
[15:52.960 --> 15:58.280]  semi-automatic weapons yeah semi-autos that means you know you pulled pull the
[15:58.280 --> 16:03.720]  trigger once you get one shot all gonna be banned and there's gonna be an
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.240]  international gun registry so if you own a gun you're supposed to register with

[17:15.000 --> 17:19.080]  info wars calm check that out the Daily Caller has a new article today formal
[17:19.080 --> 17:23.400]  complaint seeks the disbarment of Eric Holder in DC so they're gonna try to
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.160]  actually disbar this top attorney in the country think I mean think about it this
[17:28.160 --> 17:34.880]  is the guy that is the most powerful attorney in the nation in terms of just
[17:34.880 --> 17:40.680]  rank you know constitutional rank maybe rank is the right word but he and yet
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.640]  he's he's the one who masterminded the gun running into Mexico the complete
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.560]  violation of law so there's an effort now to try to disbar him that's been
[17:48.560 --> 17:54.560]  published at the Daily Caller and Mike Vanderbone and David Codrea filed a
[17:54.560 --> 17:59.280]  formal complaint with the Washington DC office of bar counsel alleging that
[17:59.280 --> 18:03.800]  Holder had committed quote professional misconduct during the congressional
[18:03.800 --> 18:08.600]  investigation into the scandal yeah you think so lying to investigators
[18:08.600 --> 18:14.800]  withholding evidence conspiring to commit felony acts in order to destroy the
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.280]  rights of people to purchase legal firearms for their own self-defense
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.320]  really that is that is that professional misconduct I guess we'll find out what
[18:24.320 --> 18:29.960]  we have here zero hedge China churns us and invest directly in Iran oil field so
[18:29.960 --> 18:34.160]  here we have more this is a strategic question of how China and Iran are
[18:34.160 --> 18:37.360]  forming stronger ties and by the way China is doing this all over the world
[18:37.360 --> 18:42.040]  forming financial and political ties with nations that have key resources that
[18:42.040 --> 18:46.160]  are crucial for the ongoing success of the Chinese economy if you look at
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.680]  supplies of things like natural gas petroleum and even concrete China's got
[18:50.680 --> 18:55.760]  them China's got the dibs on those resources and they're pulling them in
[18:55.760 --> 19:02.200]  and they're making sure that countries like the United States can't get access
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.760]  to those resources and at the same time at the same time by the way China has
[19:06.760 --> 19:11.280]  all the rare earth metals and minerals that are key strategic resources in
[19:11.280 --> 19:17.000]  terms of weapons and guided missiles and telecommunications equipment all those
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.640]  kinds of things China has a lock on those two so watch for that to get very
[19:20.640 --> 19:26.160]  heated in the years ahead all right here we go if you host a Bible study program
[19:26.160 --> 19:32.960]  in your own home you could be facing 60 days in prison and a $12,000 fine this
[19:32.960 --> 19:38.400]  is what happened to a couple in Arizona in Phoenix and he's been sentenced now
[19:38.400 --> 19:43.560]  to 60 days in prison and a $12,000 fine for hosting Bible study Michael Salman
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.560]  and his wife have been hosting gatherings for 15 to 20 people to discuss the Bible
[19:48.560 --> 19:52.560]  now they're going to jail because you can't teach people out of your own home

[24:31.560 --> 24:37.920]  $12,000 fine for hosting a home Bible study in Arizona now this this man this
[24:37.920 --> 24:44.520]  couple was hosting what 15 to 20 people to teach concepts about the Bible share
[24:44.520 --> 24:51.040]  some food to discuss their their creator and their religion and now that
[24:51.040 --> 24:55.640]  he's being sentenced Michael Salman is being sentenced sentenced to 60 days in
[24:55.640 --> 25:00.120]  prison and a $12,000 fine police officers a dozen or almost a dozen
[25:00.120 --> 25:06.040]  raided their home and gathered quote evidence of their quote crimes which I
[25:06.040 --> 25:12.320]  assume would have included Bibles and he was then found guilty of 67 code
[25:12.320 --> 25:16.280]  violations and now he's going to be ripped away from his family and put in
[25:16.280 --> 25:21.360]  prison for two months and the assistant city prosecutor is asking the court to
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.680]  revoke his probation and convert it into a two and a half year jail sentence
[25:26.680 --> 25:31.520]  well that's a real God hater right there a Bible hater since he continues to
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.720]  hold worship gatherings on his property despite court orders oh so let me get
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.920]  this straight if you have a birthday party for your seven-year-old now you
[25:39.920 --> 25:42.960]  don't need permits you don't need any of that you just have a little birthday
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.840]  party or if you have friends over for a dinner you can have 12 15 20 people over
[25:48.840 --> 25:53.000]  for a dinner just just a little party even a crazy drinking party you can have
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.880]  15 to 20 people over as long as you don't make too much noise and I can't
[25:56.880 --> 26:01.920]  imagine that Bible study was was a huge amount of noise it probably weren't you
[26:01.920 --> 26:05.880]  know partying out in the backyard and slugging down vodka that's probably not
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.640]  what happened in Bible study and yet they get arrested and raided and now
[26:09.640 --> 26:14.320]  facing two and a half years in jail this is this is insane this is what
[26:14.320 --> 26:20.160]  America has come to and regardless of whether you follow the Bible or any
[26:20.160 --> 26:23.440]  particular religion don't we have a First Amendment right in this country don't
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.400]  we have the right the freedom of religion and freedom of expression to just
[26:27.400 --> 26:30.920]  have friends come over to their house and and talk about ideas without being
[26:30.920 --> 26:34.760]  raided at gunpoint by a bunch of cops and thrown in prison is this what it's
[26:34.760 --> 26:41.000]  come to insane absolutely insane and with that story is up on well end of the
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.240]  American dream calm is it up on info wars I hope so that should be up on
[26:45.240 --> 26:50.600]  up on info wars maybe it is speak of info wars I saw something yesterday that
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.160]  I wanted to just mention because I did research about this there's a there's a
[26:55.160 --> 26:59.520]  new sponsor on info wars is sponsoring some pinhole glasses I got to tell you
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.280]  there is a there's a cover-up behind conventional eye doctors and what's
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.760]  going on there now these pinhole glasses really work and if you go to info
[27:08.760 --> 27:12.680]  wars.com you check them out you can get these pinhole glasses they exercise your
[27:12.680 --> 27:16.480]  eyes and for many people they really do improve vision now I don't have any
[27:16.480 --> 27:19.520]  financial ties to this this is an independent review but here's here's
[27:19.520 --> 27:22.520]  what I found out when I wrote about this like I don't eight months ago or
[27:22.520 --> 27:30.080]  something the mythology of conventional eye doctors is they say the reason your
[27:30.080 --> 27:34.720]  vision gets blurry is because your eye changes its shape yeah they say your
[27:34.720 --> 27:42.000]  eyeball got longer or shorter now that doesn't make any sense is that skull
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.880]  still around here we could actually show it but anyway it was out using last
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.440]  week for his documentary on anthropology and so on but if you look at the human
[27:50.440 --> 27:56.320]  skull you'll notice that the eye sockets are surrounded by bone well the the
[27:56.320 --> 28:00.760]  shape of your eyes not going to change unless your skull changes its shape the
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.680]  only way your eye can get longer is if your your head gets jammed into a trash
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.320]  compact or something I mean seriously seriously how's your eye going to change
[28:09.320 --> 28:13.880]  shape your eye is a gelatinous mass it takes on the shape of the socket in which
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.600]  it resides so the reason we get blurry vision for some people not all types of
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.960]  not all types of vision problems but for many of them it's because the muscles
[28:21.960 --> 28:28.120]  that change the shape of your eye lens those muscles actually get weak and when
[28:28.120 --> 28:32.800]  those muscles get weak you can't refocus on the proper portion of the back of
[28:32.800 --> 28:35.400]  your eye and you may say well why does that get weak
[28:35.400 --> 28:39.960]  are you gonna turn this off before I get on there may say well why why do your
[28:39.960 --> 28:43.760]  muscles get weak it's because you're not working them out so just like if you
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.160]  don't work out your legs and you don't go to the gym and pump pump weights and
[28:47.160 --> 28:49.560]  you don't work out you're going to atrophy your muscles you're going to
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.040]  get weaker well your eye muscles if you don't live out in the country or
[28:53.040 --> 28:56.680]  somewhere that you're focusing on distant objects and then close in objects
[28:56.680 --> 29:01.080]  and back and forth distant and close in that exercises the muscles that change
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.900]  the shape of your lens they change the concavity of your lens that help the
[29:04.900 --> 29:07.920]  image focus on the back of your eye I hope I'm not getting too technical here
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.400]  but your eyeball needs exercise that's the bottom line anyway these pinhole
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.840]  glasses actually do exercise your eyes it for many people they they can recover
[29:16.840 --> 29:20.200]  their vision eliminate the blurriness and they never need glasses because of
[29:20.200 --> 29:24.400]  this so I just wanted to you know go on a record say that that's something to
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.760]  check out and I did an independent review of it and that's what I found out so
[29:27.760 --> 29:32.320]  that could save you a lot of money and a lot of hassle sure I'm gonna get mail
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.200]  from some eye doctor saying no the eyeball changes shape whatever whatever
[29:36.200 --> 29:42.080]  skull doesn't not after you're like six anyway stay with us we'll have a lot
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.840]  more straight ahead right here on the Alex Jones show a lot more in the
[29:45.840 --> 29:50.000]  segment coming up about the future of humanity

[30:15.920 --> 30:20.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.120]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.280 --> 30:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.560 --> 30:36.280]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[33:09.880 --> 33:15.560]  we got a lot of mind-blowing information coming up for you in this segment this
[33:15.560 --> 33:20.640]  is the Alex Jones show Mike Adams filling in for you today hope you've
[33:20.640 --> 33:23.720]  enjoyed the show so far and it's just we're just getting started believe me
[33:23.720 --> 33:27.960]  there's so much more coming up your mind is about to be expanded beyond belief
[33:27.960 --> 33:32.400]  and no substances required just information and awareness that's the
[33:32.400 --> 33:35.920]  best part of it now along those lines by the way I don't even get a shot of
[33:35.920 --> 33:40.880]  those guys but I have on the on the Info Wars desk here for those of you
[33:40.880 --> 33:48.120]  watching on PrismPlanet.tv I have a salt lick a mineral lick for cattle and
[33:48.120 --> 33:52.680]  you can go out and buy this at any animal feed store I'm gonna mention this
[33:52.680 --> 33:57.320]  later I don't even get a shot of whatever anyway it's a trace mineral lick
[33:57.320 --> 34:01.800]  it's kind of brown-colored looks like a brick actually but it's for animals to
[34:01.800 --> 34:08.680]  consume to get trace minerals but but if you dare prescribe trace minerals to
[34:08.680 --> 34:13.880]  humans suddenly you're in violation of the FDA so we'll talk about that in a
[34:13.880 --> 34:20.680]  little bit why do animals get the nutrition but not humans ask yourself
[34:20.680 --> 34:23.560]  that question as you listen in but the big the big thing coming up in this
[34:23.560 --> 34:29.520]  segment begins with an amazing documentary that Alice Jones and the
[34:29.520 --> 34:35.280]  Info Wars crew put out yesterday after many many days well many weeks of
[34:35.280 --> 34:40.240]  production and many days of rendering here it is humanities well there's the
[34:40.240 --> 34:46.200]  shot for those viewing it the trace mineral salt lick yeah good stuff but
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.000]  here's the here's the you got to see this documentary it's humanity's greatest
[34:50.000 --> 34:57.760]  secret stairway to the universe this was put out yesterday by Alex Jones the
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.640]  Info Wars crew you got to see it go to info wars.com watch this documentary I
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.720]  think it's about 20 to 30 minutes something in that range this is amazing
[35:07.720 --> 35:13.840]  this is big big picture thinking and if you really want to understand why all of
[35:13.840 --> 35:18.480]  this matters why we need to defeat tyranny why we need to expose the globalist
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.560]  agenda why we need to take a stand against GMOs and and stealth viruses and
[35:23.560 --> 35:27.800]  vaccines and domination over the food supply and intellectual property
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.320]  domination over genes and life and seeds and everything why do we need to achieve
[35:32.320 --> 35:36.520]  victory in all of this watch that documentary humanity's greatest secret
[35:36.520 --> 35:43.600]  stairway to the universe now what's what's amazing to me about this this is
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.480]  almost bizarre just a few days before this came out I put out a video called
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.120]  the God within which is also a documentary and that's available you can
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.920]  view that right now at divinitynow.com which is a nonprofit non-commercial
[35:58.920 --> 36:02.280]  website just about expanding consciousness and awareness from a
[36:02.280 --> 36:07.060]  spiritual perspective and that there's so many tie-ins between these two
[36:07.060 --> 36:10.160]  documentaries you would almost think that we must have sat down and met
[36:10.160 --> 36:15.840]  together to to discuss these ideas but we didn't what's fascinating is that
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.400]  we're thinking in parallel where info wars is going we're going also over at
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.080]  natural news we're talking about the big big picture what is the overarching
[36:25.080 --> 36:31.240]  spiritual victory path to bring us into a place of of true awareness of what's
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.160]  going on true freedom I'm talking about universal freedom from tyranny I'm
[36:36.160 --> 36:42.960]  talking about honoring life I'm talking about acknowledging the existence of a
[36:42.960 --> 36:47.320]  creator of this universe those are the kinds of concepts that we are getting
[36:47.320 --> 36:52.880]  into and here's why here's why this really matters if you look at the
[36:52.880 --> 36:58.880]  overriding philosophy or you could say that the the the undercurrent philosophy
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.000]  of the the scientific dictatorship that is trying to dominate humanity right
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.880]  now it is one of what I call a zombie universe and I'm going to read you some
[37:08.880 --> 37:12.560]  quotes here that will absolutely blow your mind because I think most of you
[37:12.560 --> 37:15.800]  listening you agree that you are a conscious self-aware individual you
[37:15.800 --> 37:19.000]  have free will right you can decide what to do you have consciousness it's
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.440]  self-evident you can experience it at every moment you're awake you're alive
[37:22.440 --> 37:27.760]  right and most of you believe there is a creator a god and an intelligent
[37:27.760 --> 37:33.240]  consciousness a vastly greater intelligence behind our universe and behind
[37:33.240 --> 37:37.600]  life and the magic and the miracle of life and artistry and everything that we
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.400]  witnessed that's so beautiful around us and yet the scientists the conventional
[37:42.400 --> 37:47.440]  scientists out there who are dominating the the political agenda the scientific
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.320]  dictatorship they think there's no consciousness they think there is no
[37:51.320 --> 37:55.360]  creator you don't have free will and you are nothing more than a biological
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.760]  robot all right I'm going to read you quotes this is from Stephen Hawking who
[37:59.760 --> 38:04.120]  is one of the most widely acclaimed physicists in the realm of conventional
[38:04.120 --> 38:11.600]  physics and he says there is no heaven and it that whole story he says is a
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.760]  fairy tale for people who are afraid of the dark and this is in the Guardian I'm
[38:16.760 --> 38:19.920]  holding the story right in front of me the Guardian this was published in May
[38:19.920 --> 38:25.640]  May 15th of 2011 there is no heaven it's a fairy story for people who are
[38:25.640 --> 38:30.000]  afraid of the dark now Stephen Hawking goes on to say in another book that I
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.840]  researched and wrote about quote it's hard to imagine how free will can
[38:33.840 --> 38:37.960]  operate if our behavior is determined by physical law so it seems we are no more
[38:37.960 --> 38:44.360]  than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion that's what he
[38:44.360 --> 38:48.200]  says he says he regards the brain as a computer which will stop working when
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.520]  its components fail there is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers
[38:53.520 --> 38:58.560]  that's his point of view and it's not just Hawking it's not just people like
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.520]  that it's also if you go back it's Francis Crick the co-discoverer of DNA
[39:03.520 --> 39:07.240]  he said that awareness is nothing more than a feeling he says he says quote
[39:07.240 --> 39:12.240]  that your joys and sorrows your memories your sense of personal identity and free
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.040]  will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nurse of
[39:17.040 --> 39:20.680]  nerve cells and their associated molecules in other words you're not
[39:20.680 --> 39:25.320]  even human people you're not even alive now why does this matter because this is
[39:25.320 --> 39:30.800]  the scientific underpinning the the dark destructive philosophical
[39:30.800 --> 39:36.320]  foundation from which tyrants can destroy lives and justify it if they
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.800]  want to commit mass genocide if they want to kill off 5.8 billion people on
[39:40.800 --> 39:43.680]  the planet and bring it down to just 1 billion people if they want to use
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.880]  children for vaccine experiments and exploit their their bodies they think
[39:47.880 --> 39:54.120]  it's totally fine because they have they worship a philosophy of the zombie
[39:54.120 --> 40:00.000]  universe no free will no creator nothing is divine nothing matters in fact
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.840]  you're not even alive you have no free will you have no consciousness and
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.480]  therefore if they torture you if they abuse you if they kill you there is no
[40:07.480 --> 40:14.440]  moral consequence to their actions you see how dangerous and deadly that is so
[40:14.440 --> 40:20.440]  for us as info warriors as truth tellers as people who wish to aspire to the
[40:20.440 --> 40:25.840]  greatness of human civilization who wish to protect innocent life who wish to
[40:25.840 --> 40:30.440]  expand the diversity of life and beauty on this planet and that's what Alex's
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.280]  documentary gets to humanity's greatest secrets their way of the universe and
[40:34.280 --> 40:39.200]  this is what my documentary talks about the God within if we want to achieve
[40:39.200 --> 40:44.800]  this greatness we have to first respect the existence of consciousness that we
[40:44.800 --> 40:48.040]  are conscious beings that we have free will now stay with me here I know this
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.840]  was not this was not run-of-the-mill politics all right this is not current
[40:52.840 --> 40:57.840]  events news you're not going to get this on CNN or even Fox News this is what is
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.120]  above everything that we are dealing with right here in the battle for freedom
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.520]  and liberty when you want to achieve victory over tyrants you have to first
[41:07.520 --> 41:13.240]  have a philosophical foundation that respects and understands and values the
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.360]  sacredness the sacredness of life on this planet and that means you have to
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.320]  respect the fact that we have a creator that the universe has a creator that we
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.480]  are conscious beings and therefore therefore we are responsible for our
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.200]  actions you see you see how the philosophy of the zombie universe the
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.840]  dead universe the unconscious universe that's pushed by modern physics and
[41:34.840 --> 41:40.120]  those scientists who are mostly just atheists by the way that philosophy is
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.560]  one of nothing matters you're not responsible for your actions in fact
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.640]  this is set up for pre-crime because they can say that if they predetermine
[41:48.640 --> 41:51.560]  that you're going to act out in a certain way in the future they can arrest
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.720]  you today under pre-crime because you can't control your actions because you're
[41:55.720 --> 42:00.080]  a biological robot it's also a get out of jail free card for criminals who do
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.360]  go out and commit murder and rape and theft and scheme and plot and destroy
[42:04.360 --> 42:08.240]  which is everybody in Washington these days it seems those people are given a
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.320]  free pass because again the scientists say well those people aren't responsible
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.400]  for their actions either they're just acting out like a giant biochemical
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.840]  neurological pinball machine it's cause and effect they have no free will they
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.000]  have no choice they couldn't help themselves so when someone goes out in
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.880]  murders and rapes and steals they can't help themselves these scientists would
[42:28.880 --> 42:32.040]  argue because they have no consciousness and they have no free will that
[42:32.040 --> 42:36.320]  philosophy Fred's that is going to lead to the destruction of society it is the
[42:36.320 --> 42:40.680]  devolution the the erosion of everything that matters in a society that is
[42:40.680 --> 42:44.760]  supposed to achieve greatness and that's why we have to battle this
[42:44.760 --> 42:50.200]  ignorance at every level including the spiritual level so it's not just about
[42:50.200 --> 42:54.240]  let's stand up for our first and second amendment rights and fourth amendment
[42:54.240 --> 42:57.280]  rights and so on even though that element is crucial it's absolutely
[42:57.280 --> 43:02.600]  important we also have to and Alex Jones totally gets this he's completely on
[43:02.600 --> 43:08.000]  board he's he's aligned with this message we also have to win the spiritual
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.320]  war so that there is an underlying value for life otherwise how are we going to
[43:13.320 --> 43:16.840]  protect the next generation if people don't value the future of life on earth
[43:16.840 --> 43:22.320]  how are we going to protect the the seeds apply if we don't value heirloom
[43:22.320 --> 43:28.880]  seeds and the the creation generation after generation of food provided by the
[43:28.880 --> 43:33.160]  creator and provided by mother nature how are we going to continue life on
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.560]  earth if we don't have a philosophy that even values life and consciousness and
[43:37.560 --> 43:45.320]  creation you see why this matters so if you look behind every tyrant every TSA
[43:45.320 --> 43:50.400]  pedophile every corrupt criminal in Washington if you look behind them if
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.960]  you peel away that biology and look at their soul you're going to find a dark
[43:54.960 --> 44:02.040]  demonic destructive zombie soul that is headed for annihilation that is headed
[44:02.040 --> 44:06.400]  for total destruction because that is what they worship and they want to take
[44:06.400 --> 44:12.920]  as many of you with them as they can now in contrast to that but most of you and
[44:12.920 --> 44:17.720]  myself and others here if you if you look at our souls we are in effect
[44:17.720 --> 44:24.680]  defenders of life of consciousness we are working hard every single day and
[44:24.680 --> 44:31.400]  then most nights even to work in the protection of these ideas of protecting
[44:31.400 --> 44:37.200]  the innocent seeking justice telling the truth that allowing the emergence of
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.760]  reality to be acknowledged by everyone out there so that there is no more
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.520]  deception there is no more destruction that people are free to live their lives
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.800]  with a sense of liberty and with a sense of spiritual connection to that which is
[44:49.800 --> 44:56.160]  divine which is all around us everywhere that is what we fight for so
[44:56.160 --> 45:01.800]  don't ever think that when you listen to the Alex Jones show or you you're
[45:01.800 --> 45:06.800]  reading for don't think it's it's only about the day today you know fighting
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.320]  for freedom of speech fighting for liberty that's crucial but there is also a
[45:11.320 --> 45:17.720]  spiritual element behind it above it you might say that imbues the the words
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.240]  of the writers and the speakers with a sense of serving that which is the
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.520]  future of humanity which is honoring life the sacredness of life honoring the
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.880]  creator and I got to say to every day that you have I don't mean to get
[45:31.880 --> 45:36.280]  preachy here it's just that this is just this is just flowing right now but
[45:36.280 --> 45:41.320]  every day that you have left in your life is a gift it's a gift from your
[45:41.320 --> 45:46.200]  creator and that gift is your opportunity to set the record straight for
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.880]  your soul I mean most of us believe that our souls are eternal they exist
[45:50.880 --> 45:55.480]  beyond this particular biological existence right I mean it's written
[45:55.480 --> 45:59.760]  right into Christianity for one thing after life there's a day of reckoning
[45:59.760 --> 46:03.360]  there is a judgment your life is reviewed and you either go to heaven or
[46:03.360 --> 46:08.080]  hell depending on what you did well even if you don't believe that literally I
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.000]  believe something like that definitely does happen there is a reckoning there
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.640]  is judgment what you do does matter that there is an accounting for your life so
[46:17.640 --> 46:21.640]  every day that you have remaining I beg of you out there every day of your life
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.760]  you have remaining is an opportunity to set your karmic record the record of
[46:26.760 --> 46:31.600]  your soul into the positive realm how many people did you help how many people
[46:31.600 --> 46:36.080]  did you defend how many innocence did you help protect did you mentor a child
[46:36.080 --> 46:40.640]  did you spread awareness and awakening did you go online and help people
[46:40.640 --> 46:44.600]  awaken to the truth did you do those things because all of all of those
[46:44.600 --> 46:50.680]  increase your positive almost you could call it a karmic score and or in
[46:50.680 --> 46:55.120]  contrast to that we're getting were you a destructive person did you harm people
[46:55.120 --> 46:59.320]  did you deceive people did you lie consistently and in a harmful way did
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.160]  you kill people who who shouldn't have been killed you know were you a
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.640]  destructive person that's also written on your karmic record and when you face
[47:06.640 --> 47:09.680]  that day of reckoning that day of judgment it's going to be like a balance
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.240]  sheet it's like bringing up an excel spreadsheet oh here's the balance sheet
[47:13.240 --> 47:16.720]  of your life you did all of these positive things that's plus one plus five
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.480]  plus 10 oh but then you did all these negative things minus seven you know
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.760]  minus 12 I mean everybody's made mistakes but can you now make up for them
[47:25.760 --> 47:30.760]  can you engage in more good and more positivity than any of the negative
[47:30.760 --> 47:33.680]  mistakes or harm that you might have inadvertently done before you really
[47:33.680 --> 47:37.240]  you awaken before you really realize what was going on and did you fight
[47:37.240 --> 47:42.320]  against tyranny did you fight against the domination agenda the controllers who
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.720]  are trying to suppress we think about it if free will is granted to us by the
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.160]  creator then the creator wants us to express freedom wants us to express the
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.240]  divine principles of liberty so any force out there that attempts to impinge
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.160]  upon that liberty that attempts to disconnect us from that which is divine
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.160]  which is granted by the creator those forces are then by definition evil so
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.000]  when you stand against that when you exercise free speech just by standing up
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  for what is right and what is true you improve the positive score on your
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.560]  balance sheet and believe me that one day when your physical existence is over
[48:18.560 --> 48:22.040]  on this planet and you face that creator and you look at your balance sheet
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.600]  your whole life is going to be reviewed out right in front of you like a like a
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.440]  giant billboard oh here's your life let's watch it over again it's like a
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.640]  movie in fast motion let's review what you did and God help all those people
[48:34.640 --> 48:37.920]  who work for the TSA today God help them because they're going to look at their
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.880]  movie and they are going to be ashamed they're going to be ashamed of what they
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.480]  did and who they harmed and they sold their soul for a paycheck are you
[48:47.480 --> 48:56.360]  kidding me how cheaply can you compromise your your soul and so many people are
[48:56.360 --> 49:01.880]  selling out today for a paycheck it is absolutely unconscionable now okay
[49:01.880 --> 49:07.920]  enough on this enough on this I'm I got I just hope it resonates with you I hope
[49:07.920 --> 49:11.560]  you get the seriousness of this this is not just an info war this is a spiritual
[49:11.560 --> 49:16.760]  war and if anything if anything if you look if you think if you think that the
[49:16.760 --> 49:21.000]  info wars team is being attacked for telling the truth about operation
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.440]  fashion furious and about spy drones and about all these other things you just
[49:24.440 --> 49:30.000]  wait until this message of awareness and consciousness and and the divine you
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.480]  just wait till this message really starts getting out because the attacks
[49:32.480 --> 49:37.360]  will be even stronger against all of us because they know that this is the key
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.240]  this is the key if you understand these fundamental philosophical and spiritual
[49:42.240 --> 49:46.800]  principles you are unstoppable like for example did you know your soul is bullet
[49:46.800 --> 49:52.720]  proof did you know that I mean your soul cannot be harmed by bullets only your
[49:52.720 --> 49:56.360]  physical body which is a you know a small blip of time on this planet in
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.000]  terms of the greater cosmos your physical body can be harmed but your soul
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.720]  cannot be harmed in fact if you are let's say killed standing up for what is
[50:04.720 --> 50:10.000]  right and what is just defending the lives of innocent children defending the
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.480]  future of life on our planet defending humanity if your physical body is
[50:13.480 --> 50:18.640]  killed for that you know so be it your soul actually is redeemed through that
[50:18.640 --> 50:22.800]  action if you had the intention of protecting life and protecting that
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.080]  which is sacred so your soul is bullet proof they can't hurt it your soul is
[50:27.080 --> 50:31.080]  radiation proof you know even the worst accident Fukushima can't destroy your
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.040]  soul and that's the beauty of it all it's there that's that's the real you it's
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.800]  not this hand it's not this arm the real you is what you decide to do with your
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.280]  free will with your heart with your spirit that's what matters and that's
[50:43.280 --> 50:49.840]  why we will be victorious in this fight for freedom and justice for all of us
[50:49.840 --> 50:55.520]  across across the cosmos it's it's that big all right we get back to some other
[50:55.520 --> 51:01.240]  topics when we return stay with us right here on the Alex Jones show let me ask

[54:25.840 --> 54:30.880]  spiritual war going on here there's a destructive force there is a demonic
[54:30.880 --> 54:35.760]  evil force on this planet that we've got to defeat if we hope to have any future
[54:35.760 --> 54:41.080]  whatsoever so get out to info wars calm watch that documentary humanity's
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.040]  greatest secret stairway to the universe that is a massive eye-opener I
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.360]  strongly endorse the message of that documentary and if you want to watch my
[54:50.360 --> 54:54.040]  take on it I just released another documentary four days ago that's at
[54:54.040 --> 55:00.400]  divinitynow.com which is a site that is about spirituality it's about the
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.360]  existence of a creator it is about consciousness it is about exploring
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.680]  reality and no no doctrine nothing for sale there it's just this is this is you
[55:09.680 --> 55:15.480]  know we're fighting for the future of survival of humanity so I know you're
[55:15.480 --> 55:21.400]  part of that join in all right this is heavy stuff if you really understand
[55:21.400 --> 55:26.120]  what we're dealing with here you can't help but be moved by it you know we've
[55:26.120 --> 55:32.600]  so sorry but all right we do have we do have the trace mineral salt lick on the
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.320]  desk here I'm going to talk about that coming up in the next segment before
[55:36.320 --> 55:39.400]  that a couple of lists that are really important I want to run by you here in
[55:39.400 --> 55:44.160]  this segment remember the recent power grid failures in DC and the eastern
[55:44.160 --> 55:48.800]  seaboard now some very important things to learn about this in terms of
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.600]  preparedness and there are a lot of info wars sponsors that offer preparedness
[55:53.600 --> 55:56.840]  items and I really encourage you to check those out because they can be truly
[55:56.840 --> 56:04.480]  lifesaving but check it out 9-1-1 failed in many areas cell phones failed their
[56:04.480 --> 56:08.720]  fragile technology the internet went down in many areas Netflix Pinterest and
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.800]  Instagram were all down the Amazon cloud that powers them went down most
[56:13.800 --> 56:18.760]  people have no clue what to do in an emergency they were not prepared and
[56:18.760 --> 56:22.400]  therefore they worsen any crisis because they become a burden on the system
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.720]  this is a story that I believe this is this is on natural news it may have been
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.400]  posted on info wars as well a national grid down situation would be far more
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.160]  complex to repair than the localized grid down that we saw in the eastern
[56:35.160 --> 56:40.360]  seaboard and also modern cities are built on systems that have little or no
[56:40.360 --> 56:44.560]  redundancy think about the things you rely on if you live in a city you rely
[56:44.560 --> 56:49.000]  on the water supply you rely on the power the natural gas emergency services
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.040]  to keep the order you know just to keep the criminals from mugging everybody on
[56:53.040 --> 56:58.400]  the street modern cities do not have redundancy in all of those systems which
[56:58.400 --> 57:03.400]  means a cascading failure can kick in and be very very deadly very quickly so
[57:03.400 --> 57:08.160]  and mother nature will humble humanity that's another message now similar to
[57:08.160 --> 57:12.680]  this here's another list article this is on info wars.com from Michael Snyder at
[57:12.680 --> 57:17.400]  the economic collapse 25 signs the collapse of America is speeding up as
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.960]  society rots from the inside out and again if you think about why is society
[57:22.960 --> 57:26.000]  rotting from the inside out if you look at the underlying philosophy that we
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.160]  talked about in the last segment it's because the scientific dictatorship
[57:29.160 --> 57:34.440]  believes you're a dead zombie literally they think you have no mind you have no
[57:34.440 --> 57:39.560]  will you have no soul they literally believe that anyway points from this
[57:39.560 --> 57:46.520]  story homicides in Chicago are 38% ahead of where they were a year ago
[57:46.520 --> 57:52.320]  roaming gangs of youths are causing havoc along the magnificent mile in
[57:52.320 --> 57:57.760]  Chicago a lifeguard in Florida was fired for attempting to save a man that was
[57:57.760 --> 58:02.440]  drowning outside his patrol zone oh how dare you leave your patrol zone and try
[58:02.440 --> 58:06.480]  to save a life see this is it they don't value life you get it you get it
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.920]  that's why they can euthanize people time magazine how to die kill granny this
[58:12.920 --> 58:18.440]  is why they don't value life these are stealing identities and filing fraudulent
[58:18.440 --> 58:24.520]  tax returns to get large refunds that are not owed to them the secret service
[58:24.520 --> 58:27.080]  well you know all about the secret service and all their scandals
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.640]  everything is going down in flames and we've got to get to a fundamental
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.240]  philosophy of valuing life and creation if we're gonna save this to stay with
[58:37.240 --> 58:41.040]  us a lot straight ahead on the Alice Jones show
[58:42.400 --> 58:49.240]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.600]  in this short segment but first I want to start off with this one check this out
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:55.320]  that NASA has released some new pictures of Mars and Fox News is reporting this
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.920]  big picture on Mars NASA rover snaps stunning view of red planet you know
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.720]  what's fascinating I don't know if you saw these pictures they were all over
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.440]  the internet yesterday I took a look at them something's different about these
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:12.920]  pictures did you notice it they have stopped doing the red shifting photoshopping
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.240]  of the Martian sky in the Martian landscape now those of you know what I'm
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.600]  talking about you're probably laughing right now because you're like yeah that's
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.160]  exactly right they stopped making it look red the new pictures don't show a
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:32.400]  red sky they show a landscape that looks a lot like Wyoming I mean seriously if
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.560]  you look at the pictures of Mars from the 1970s and the 1980s in the 1990s they
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.160]  were all essentially photoshopped or redshifted by NASA before they released
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.320]  them they were all shown to be really really red like it's a really red sky
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.680]  and it's really red soil okay here we go some pictures coming up right now for
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.720]  those watching on prisonplanet.tv the atmosphere in these pictures it's kind
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.840]  of a purplish gray the mountains in the distance look like you know the the
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:10.320]  smoky mountains in the US almost this is a change it's a powerful change no one
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.080]  in the press was talking about this and for those of you who have looked at the
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.200]  history of NASA you know that NASA has been very very reluctant to really tell
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.240]  the truth about you know signs of bacterial life on Mars and things like
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:28.480]  that evidence of water on Mars or water on the moon all these kinds of things so
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.720]  this now with these pictures coming out this is a shift they've taken away the
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.520]  red sky and the red soil now they're showing it as a regular landscape that
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:44.640]  could be from any other planet it could be from planet Earth and what I think
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.720]  about it this is this part is just conjecture but I think I think that they
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.160]  are prepping the public to announce some kind of discovery of life on Mars
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.880]  microbial life I'm not talking about little green men running around I'm
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.680]  talking about microbial life proof of it but they're trying to prep people for
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:06.800]  it so they're releasing these photos of a normal looking atmosphere on Mars all
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.920]  right I want to give a shout out to world that daily and Jerome Corsi and W&D.com
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.960]  has put out another story about Obama's missing year at Columbia now being
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.360]  found this is a great article I'm not going to go into all the details here but
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.360]  I just want to say world that daily and Joseph Farrah have done some really
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.200]  amazing reporting on even the birth certificate was that was that world that
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.160]  daily or was that Newsmax anyway I think that's world that daily on the birth
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.000]  certificate and Jerome Corsi of course has done amazing research but if you if
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.880]  you look at the social security number and the birth certificate issues it's
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.840]  W&D I'm sure those are powerful pieces of investigative journalism just want to
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.440]  give a shout out to anybody out there who's investigating the truth and
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.280]  actually backing it up with evidence you know a lot of people on the internet
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.720]  that are just saying whatever you know all kinds of weird theories and weird
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.080]  conspiracies and weird attacks on people but they don't back it up with
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.040]  anything they don't have any evidence they don't have any documents nothing
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.480]  what I try to do and I know what what Curt Nimo does here and Paul Watson and
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.400]  people like Corsi here and many others we provide the evidence we provide the
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.280]  documents so people out there if you read something on the internet don't be
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.760]  just sucked in by somebody's words anybody can spout words and there are a
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.480]  lot of really great liars out there including you know in Washington DC very
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.360]  very effective liars I mean just look back at the past presidents and current
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.840]  president and you have some really good liars look for the evidence what is
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.920]  documented what can be proven and we're gonna have a lot of evidence coming up
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:47.280]  right now after this coming break with John Rappaport about Merck and the drug

[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.840]  July 9th 2012 Mike Adams the health ranger sitting in for Alex today thank
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.840]  you for continuing with us here we've got a very powerful segment coming up
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.280]  here right now John Rappaport from no more fake news.com joins us but let me
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.280]  give a quick introduction of what we are talking about we've got GlaxoSmith
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:03.480]  Klein pleading guilty to criminal fraud and now paying a $3 billion fine yeah
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:09.400]  with a B $3 billion fine to settle the criminal and civil charges we've got
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:14.240]  two whistleblowers from Merck two virologists who went public with a false
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.800]  claims act claiming that Merck had spiked the results of falsified tests
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:24.120]  dated to fabricate a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% in order to keep selling it
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.920]  to the United States government we've got evidence coming out a lawsuit also
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.080]  filed against Merck that says that they engage in a decade-long scheme to
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.440]  falsify and misrepresent the true efficacy of its vaccine that it tried
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.600]  to conceal the evidence that it threatened its virologist with going to
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:50.040]  jail if they spoke out and went to the FDA that the the allegations here are
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.840]  just absolutely huge and then we've got Pfizer being sued by retailers over its
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.760]  anti-competitive scheme they say that the company has conspired to keep
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.800]  generic versions of cholesterol drugs off the market so that Pfizer can keep
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.800]  selling its nearly ten billion dollars a year worth of Lipitor without any
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:17.840]  competition so all of this is going to be now discussed by none other than John
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.560]  Rappaport one of my favorite guests he knows his stuff he joins us now by Skype
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:28.840]  video John welcome to the show hi Mike great to be here yeah let's get into the
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.520]  chemical warfare section of the show let's get let's get right into it man
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.000]  but let's start with the fact that number one you and I and Alex and others
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.760]  who've been talking about this we are completely vindicated at this point
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.320]  because we've talked about the criminality of Big Pharma and now here
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.000]  it is it's a matter of public record now three billion dollar fine for criminal
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.960]  activities that the company has pleaded guilty to yes it is vindication and for
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:04.400]  all those people who have been saying that you know we're just a bunch of
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.280]  kooks and we don't know what we're talking about we don't have the facts
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:14.440]  and we're just anti something or other I don't even know what it is they're
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:21.640]  wrong and we're right and that's the way it is they have been lying media have
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:26.960]  been supporting these drug companies on and on and on and on and on they don't
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.160]  see the continuing conspiracy of criminal activity on the part of Big Pharma
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.440]  they don't want to see it but it's been there for a long time I've been in
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.160]  touch with mainstream reporters for years trying to convince them to cover
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:48.280]  this one aspect or another and they just shut it out because they know that they
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.000]  won't be able to they're not all out to well they know where their salaries come
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.520]  from where media gets its money is largely from the pharmaceutical companies
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.880]  but look at this John even when the false claims act came out that the two
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.400]  whistleblowers from Merck went to the government and said the government is
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.480]  being defrauded of hundreds of millions of dollars with a false vaccine a
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.840]  mom's vaccine that doesn't even work at the claim rate the government said we
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.920]  don't want to investigate they just said forget it let the company keep doing
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.880]  business that way I mean the government doesn't even care we are talking
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.280]  about a deep deep collusion between government media and pharma what are
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:35.440]  your thoughts John well that's what it is Mike it's been going on for decades
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.760]  decades and decades and decades and they're so far in bed together that
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  they can't get out or separate themselves from each other occasionally a
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.480]  scandal erupts or three of them that we're looking at here and so they pay
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.160]  a fine or but but nobody goes to jail nobody's really punished and let me
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.560]  indicate as far as GlaxoSmithKline is concerned you know they have to pay
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:06.240]  three billion now for criminal actions related to three of their drugs Paxil
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:13.440]  well Butrin and Evandia hiding the dangers of Evandia and inducing doctors
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:20.440]  to prescribe Paxil and well Butrin for what's called off-label uses in other
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:26.280]  words uses where it could be even more dangerous than where it was before say
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:32.840]  for children yeah well during the period about which this fine covers the
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:39.640]  three billion those three drugs made GlaxoSmithKline twenty seven point nine
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.920]  billion dollars so three billion is just a slap on the wrist you know and so and
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:52.400]  they had already set aside the money to pay the government right knew this could
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.440]  come down and so they sat in their corporate boardroom and they said okay
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.920]  well how much could this cost us I mean I don't know two billion three billion
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.920]  all right let's set it aside so we can pay because you know we're making 25 27
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.040]  billion off the three drugs what do we care this is the thinking and the
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.720]  government goes along with this because the government knows that the three
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.360]  billion doesn't even begin to make a dent in Glaxo it's like it's like Alex
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.000]  uses this story of a guy robbed a bank and walks away right out of the bank
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.600]  with a million dollars in cash and the police show up and we caught you robbing
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.800]  the bank now pay us ten thousand dollars and you can go free so the
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.800]  robber takes out ten grand hands it to the police and walks away with nine
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.080]  hundred ninety thousand dollars that's that's a pretty good day and that's what
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.800]  big pharma does every day that's right that's what they do every day the
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.960]  government goes along with it and as you and I have discussed before you know
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.520]  the public starts to look at this and they say wait a minute is somebody
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.960]  gonna be put on trial is somebody actually from these companies going to
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:10.520]  go to jail go to jail for 10 years 15 20 years because this is endangering the
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.240]  public I mean these are dangerous drugs and vaccines that we're talking about
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.280]  here and when these companies lie about the safety of them and the government
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.160]  just looks the other way now let's somebody's guilty here of a serious
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.160]  crime but yet no one is ever prosecuted for criminal offense you nailed it you
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.800]  nailed it does nothing let me go over some of what Glaxo Smith Klein pled
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:41.280]  guilty to here bribing doctors bribery outright bribery of doctors gave them
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.640]  luxury vacations and lucrative paid speaking gigs even concert tickets to
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.360]  Madonna concerts apparently was part of that was in the documents it turns out
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:58.680]  also this came out to the the celebrity doctor Dr. Drew had received 275
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.720]  thousand dollars from Glaxo to help promote their anti-depressant drugs
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.000]  apparently that's being reported I think that was in the Wall Street Journal
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.080]  Glaxo fabricated drug safety data lied to the FDA defrauded Medicare and
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.080]  Medicaid out of billions of dollars deceived regulators about the effectiveness
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.240]  of its drugs it relied on these deceptive practices to earn billions of
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.680]  dollars while selling potentially dangerous drugs to unsuspecting
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:33.880]  consumers and medical patients this is just some of what Glaxo is guilty of in
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.320]  Wall Street Journal reports oh yeah that was that's about Dr. Drew two hundred
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.560]  seventy five thousand dollars was billed to Glaxo for quote services for
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:50.320]  Wellbutrin services and then he went on to promote that drug in speaking
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.920]  engagements and I believe on his radio show yeah exactly but apparently
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:59.000]  according Wall Street Journal he did not disclose that to his listening
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.160]  audience so a lot of people getting caught up in this right now taking money
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.640]  from a company that is now pleaded guilty to criminal behavior that's right
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.440]  that's quite a list of charges that Glaxo has been found guilty of and when we
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:21.840]  say fabricating drug safety what that means is the company is saying we've
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:28.520]  done studies on on these drugs they're safe like a vandia you know which was
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:33.800]  there an extremely dangerous drug oh it's safe no problem and here are the
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:40.840]  studies that back it up so what does that mean that means that they were lying
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:47.960]  in the studies they cooked the data they fabricated results they buried results
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:54.200]  that would be negative to the so-called safety of the drug right they cheated in
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:00.520]  every possible way and these studies were published in major medical journals
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.940]  so that doctors could read them and say well we now we know that these drugs are
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.320]  good and safe and so we can prescribe but none of those studies are going to
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:14.800]  be retracted though John because the the fraud has to be allowed to sort of be
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.240]  catapulted into the consciousness of the medical community right so oh and and
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.000]  as you mentioned nobody's being arrested nobody is going to jail over this
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.040]  now think about this John if if you or I went out and sold a product to the
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.240]  government for millions or billions of dollars and we bribed doctors and we
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:41.120]  defrauded the government and we lied and we we we contrived the study results
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.560]  we did all that you think you think they wouldn't arrest us of course they
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.960]  would we'd be in prison like that but these drug companies get away with
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:56.280]  felony crimes and they nobody's held accountable for it nobody exactly I have
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:02.680]  a statement here from Dr. Marsha and gel who was the editor for 20 years of the
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.320]  New England Journal of Medicine which is the most prestigious journal in the
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.600]  world and when she left she eventually wrote an article for the New York Review
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.320]  of Books that said it is simply no longer possible to believe much of the
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:23.640]  clinical research that is published or to rely on the judgment of trusted
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:32.640]  positions or authorities yeah yeah this is one of the premier people in the
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:38.120]  world of medical journals and she's basically saying the system has
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.520]  collapsed it's broken don't the whole things are fraud if if you're taking
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.600]  prescription drugs if you're taking vaccines you're you've been you've been
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.200]  tainted you've been exploited you've been fooled are we gonna go to break John
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.320]  but we'll come back with a lot more on this including statements from Glaxo
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.720]  Smith Klein about how they're now going to be monitored by the government to be
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.520]  more compliant yeah right stay with us on the Alex Jones show we'll be right
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:04.360]  back with more I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was

[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:19.680]  We are exposing Big Pharma's criminality right here on the Alex Jones show with
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:24.760]  John Rappaport our guest and my name is Mike Adams the fill-in host today for
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.920]  Alex and John I got to relate a story to you about how this goes on now I'm
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:34.240]  looking at a BBC article and it talks about Glaxo Smith Klein has been found
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:39.200]  guilty of paying kickbacks to doctors and the quote from US Attorney Carmen
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:46.000]  Ortiz says the sales force of Glaxo bribed physicians to prescribe Glaxo
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.200]  products those are their drugs using every imaginable form of high-priced
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.920]  entertainment from Hawaii vacations and paying doctors millions of dollars to go
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:00.360]  on speaking tours to tickets to Madonna concerts now the last time I took a
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.480]  vacation to Hawaii which must have been eight years ago I don't think I've even
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.200]  been on vacation in years but the last time I was in Hawaii I was staying in a
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.760]  hotel where there happened to be a continuing medical education course
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.480]  they're called CMEs you know about these John many of our listeners may but
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.600]  every doctor is required to have a certain number of hours of CME continuing
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.360]  medical education to keep their state medical license so the CMEs are
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.720]  sponsored by drug companies and in this case I don't remember the drug company
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.560]  name but the drug company would pay to fly the doctor and their entire family
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.360]  out to a luxury resort in Hawaii I wasn't even staying at this resort it was
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.600]  that high-end I was just walking through there and using their pool actually
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:53.640]  that's a funny story but in any case I saw this hall of all these doctors
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:59.040]  walking in signing their names and leaving and I asked one I said what do
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.960]  you what are you doing what is this I said oh I you know I'm a physician and
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.560]  we're here for continuing medical education and I said well I saw you just
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.900]  sign your name and you're leaving what's what's the deal what's going on and he
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.400]  says ah we don't really have to attend we just have to sign that we did attend
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.640]  and then we're pretty much free to go tour Hawaii all day with our families
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:25.200]  ah that's continuing medical education and it's paid for by the drug companies
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.640]  it's just one of the forms of bribery that takes place in America the whole
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.480]  thing is a fraud John have you seen anything like that go on first hand
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:41.720]  like I did well what I've seen and told about this by doctors and also ex sales
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.400]  people for drug companies they're called detailed men or detailed people and
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:52.400]  they go into doctors offices I'm from such-and-such drug company and here's a
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.600]  bunch of free samples of our drugs and I want to talk to the doctor and they set
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:01.560]  up an appointment and now the drug rep sits down with the doctor and says look
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:08.120]  here's this new drug that we've got x3 now we know that the FDA has only
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.560]  approved it for use in adults it's not approved for use in children but of
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.000]  course you as a doctor legally can prescribe this drug for anybody you
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.160]  want to and I just want to tell you you know get off the record doc that this
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.920]  drug has been having amazing results with children so you should feel free to
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.520]  be able to you know prescribe this for children and by the way and now you know
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.280]  the inducements here's a few tickets to a concert you know we're having a
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:39.600]  conference in the Bahamas next year and I'm sure that we could do something for
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.800]  you either an attendee or maybe even a speaker and this goes on every day in
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:50.160]  doctors offices oh yeah it isn't just the payoffs but what the payoffs are for
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:57.720]  oh yeah no danger the lives of children by conning doctors who are supposed to be
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:02.200]  resistant and intelligent and took the Hippocratic oath it's all about getting
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.000]  doctors to prescribe more of the drugs obviously the drug companies actually
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.800]  buy the data of how many of this prescription that that doctor prescribed
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.000]  they have all that the spreadsheet and they know which money to pay out to
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.680]  which doctor and you know who's also a culprit in this John from no more fake
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.560]  news.com by the way if people want to check out your website who's also a
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.240]  culprit in this is the doctors themselves they they have said for years
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.640]  oh we're not being bribed no that's consulting money that's that was
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.840]  continuing medical education even though they didn't even attend the classes
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.400]  they said oh no that that was a speaking fee yeah a two million dollars speaking
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.560]  fee come on it's a bribe they don't care if you speak to anybody they're just
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.760]  giving you money so you keep prescribing the drug you doctors out there you are
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.560]  liars you are you are con artists you are fraudsters for taking this money and I
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.920]  hope you go to jail for being part of this I hope they track down everybody
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.640]  who took money from Glaxo and throws them in jail and prosecutes them for
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.520]  accepting bribes. Well that's exactly it because that is another crime accepting
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.840]  a bribe so these guys should go to jail. I should. And this tells you something
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.840]  about their medical training you know we're led to believe that this is the
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.920]  most pristine form possible education in the world somewhere along the line
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.560]  these people are learning to be criminals you know the people that are in the
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.640]  doctor's office. Criminals in training yeah. The criminals in training is what
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:23.480]  they're learning because they understand the game you've got to be
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:28.440]  prescribing the drugs you've got to be playing the system within the system
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.080]  otherwise you're out and you know of course Mike on the other side of this
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.360]  look at all the what we've exposed here in just the last you know half hour so
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.720]  with these three giant drug companies. Oh there's more coming up we're going to
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:47.280]  break here John sorry to interrupt you. There's more coming up on Merck and what

[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:17.280]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:22.760]  Well, Alex is off today. This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:28.600]  and I'm joined now continuing with John Rappaport from NoMoreFakeNews.com. We
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:33.160]  are discussing the amazing revelations of total runaway criminality in the
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.920]  pharmaceutical industry with GlaxoSmithKline now pleading guilty to
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:42.680]  $3 billion. Well, pleading guilty to felony crimes resulting in $3 billion
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.760]  worth of fines. And now we're going to talk about Merck. But first, you know, I
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.600]  got to say there's a love the sense of humor here at Infowars. There's a sign
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.080]  in the studio. I just got to share with you a sign that says, at least twice
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.160]  weekly, we must do whistleblower interviews for one hour. Not complying
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:04.600]  will result in tazing. Does that apply to me too, guys?
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:10.440]  This is a technical question. All right, the taser will be brought out later,
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.680]  apparently. Okay, continuing on, you know, if anybody should be tased right now,
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:19.160]  it's the drug reps and it's the doctors who took bribes from GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:23.320]  How come these people aren't being arrested? Why are they allowed to break
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.880]  the law, to accept bribes, to put our children on drugs, to falsify data, to lie
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.280]  to the FDA? And the government says we don't even care. We want you to just keep
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.920]  doing it. Why is this allowed to go on? Why the runaway total pharmaceutical
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.560]  corporate fascist government criminality in America today, John? What is
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.080]  happening? How do we stop this?
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:50.520]  Well, certainly we stop it by exposing it because we still have the freedom
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.440]  to not take these drugs. Yeah, for the... Yeah, they know this.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:57.560]  No, Obamacare is mandated on everyone, by the way. Yeah, well, that's another
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.240]  question we can get into, I mean, because these companies are going to do quite well
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:05.640]  under Obamacare. But, you know, as long as we fight for the freedom
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.480]  to either take a drug or not take a drug, that's the bottom line.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.320]  Because, and the drug companies understand this, believe me, that's why
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.440]  they're going after the natural health industry so heavily. I mean, can you
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.600]  imagine what would happen if, oh, well, the government has found a company
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:26.600]  called Ubladi that is selling vitamin C to the public, but it's actually vitamin E.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.600]  Wow, and it's contaminated, and they're lying about it to
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.600]  health food stores saying this, that and the other thing, and blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.920]  blah, blah. Oh, yeah, they would have everybody in that
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.640]  nutritional company in jail for 20 years. Absolutely.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:44.840]  But when Glaxo does it, well, you pay a $3 billion fine from your
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:49.480]  war chest of $27 billion and just go along with business as usual.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.960]  No, no, it's even worse than that, John. When the FTC goes after natural supplement
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:58.520]  companies, they conduct the raids, they haul the people in the court, and they
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.720]  confiscate the customer lists, they confiscate the computers, they confiscate
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:06.760]  the inventory, but they make these companies refund everyone who ever bought
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.600]  that nutritional product in the history of the company. So why doesn't the
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.200]  Department of Justice go to GlaxoSmithKline and say, oh,
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.200]  you got to refund everybody who ever bought your drugs that you
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.360]  deceived us on? Why don't they do that? Yeah, why don't they?
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.000]  Well, you know, we get into the deeper part of this, Mike, because
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.400]  drugs debilitate people. The overall effect of pharmaceutical drugs
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:37.960]  is to tranquilize, sedate, dumb down, debilitate and kill
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:43.480]  at least 100,000 Americans a year. By statistics, we got the report,
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:49.240]  Starfield Report. What does this do for the powers that be?
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:55.400]  It completely weakens the people of the United States of America and allows
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:01.160]  whatever agenda of power and control to be imposed on these people because
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.840]  they can't fight back. I mean, this is, to me, the bottom line.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.360]  We're not just talking about advertising money, we're not just talking
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.440]  about profits, we're not just talking about who
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:17.800]  colludes with who here, but why, as you say, why do these people continue to go
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.000]  free? Why does one attorney general after another
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.920]  pay no attention to this? Because this is a bigger
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.480]  agenda than the U.S. government or even the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:35.000]  This is an agenda of destroying and rotting out the country from the
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.800]  inside one individual at a time. It's chemical warfare,
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:44.360]  these are the drugs, and when the country is submitted to that kind of chemical
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.360]  warfare, they can't fight back. Well, I think you're nailing it.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.880]  You've really hit the point here that there is an
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.920]  intention to zombify the nation, to dumb down the cognitive
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.600]  function, to disconnect the neurology of the bodies of the
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.120]  people who are going to be the voters and the consumers and the
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:07.880]  taxpayers. I mean, you're right, you're right. This is, why is this criminality
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.560]  allowed to go on because it fits the agenda of keeping the entire
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:16.200]  sheeple population herded into a dumbed-down mentality while the global
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.280]  controllers take over the money, take over the economy, take over the food
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.240]  supply, take over the genetic capital of the
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.240]  planet through seed patents and animal patents and all these other things.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.600]  You nailed it. You're exactly right. It's allowed
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:35.720]  because it fits the agenda. That's it. And here's another thing which I've
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.120]  discovered, you know, 30 years of being a
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.200]  reporter. Connections to various mainstream
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:45.880]  reporters, politicians, I mean connections meaning
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:50.680]  I find out things about them. So many of these people are on these drugs
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.520]  themselves, right? They're on the tranquilizers,
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.520]  they're on the antidepressants, they're on all of these things. So now for them
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.200]  to turn around and even begin to question
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.600]  what the agenda really is that we're discussing here is impossible because
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.400]  these people are brainwashed into believing that they can't even function
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.280]  without the drugs in their system. So they're slaves, they're captives to
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.600]  farmers and so. No, if we lived in a rational society, we should say
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:24.520]  that no one can be elected to a position of Congress
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.880]  or even the executive branch. They cannot serve in the public
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.720]  interest if they're on psychiatric drugs for one thing.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.400]  Because those things mess with your head. They are by definition mind
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.920]  altering drugs, psychotropics, antidepressants,
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.360]  everything prescribed by psychiatry. And yet how many members of Congress
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.840]  are probably on those drugs and statin drugs that sap your energy
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.360]  and that cause early dementia and Alzheimer's? I mean,
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:59.000]  we are being led by a bunch of drug harmed legislative and judicial
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.360]  and executive leaders in our country who are not in their right presence of mind.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:10.040]  Literally. Absolutely. You know, every time they get up to cast a vote
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:13.640]  or give a talk on the floor, they should say,
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:18.680]  my name is John Smith. I'm a representative from Ohio
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.440]  and full disclosure, here are the drugs I'm on.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.360]  Paxil and then they put me on Prozac and they took me to Paxil and then they said,
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.360]  I wasn't really suffering from clinical depression. It was actually bipolar.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:37.320]  So now I'm on a depocote which could of course kill me tomorrow,
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:41.480]  but I'm seared. So by the time they get done, everybody in the country is going to know
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.760]  we're being run by a bunch of completely deranged lunatics.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:52.520]  Well, here's a direct example. This was raised about Supreme Court Justice Roberts
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.720]  and he being on, was it an anti-seizure medication, I believe?
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.600]  That's right. Yeah.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.440]  And there were questions raised. I think it's legitimate to raise the question,
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.720]  did that affect his judgment? Did he flip flop because of that?
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.680]  But not just him and not just that issue, but all of the Supreme Court Justices.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.200]  I remember one of them was on chemotherapy at one point.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:18.040]  Yeah, which is like saying, oh yeah, we're attacking this justice with chemical warfare
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:23.720]  that we used in World War I. Don't expect him to say anything that makes any sense.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:31.960]  I mean, even in the military, isn't there a procedure by which if a commander has lost
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.320]  his presence of mind and is no longer, quote, fit for command, that his subordinates can say,
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:43.320]  we're relieving you of duty. You're not fit for command. That should be invoked across all of
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:47.160]  Washington DC for all the people that are on these drugs that are altering their judgment,
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.960]  altering their memories and their behavior. I mean, we are a nation of druggies.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:56.680]  Absolutely. And Washington DC is the medical drug capital of the world,
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:01.960]  especially the psychiatric drug. Yes. On and on and on. So they've been infiltrated.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:06.840]  You know, if we look at this for what it really is, Mike, it's like chemical warfare. Okay,
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:12.680]  Washington DC has been infiltrated. All of these people that work in Congress and various
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.680]  federal agencies and so on have been infiltrated by destructive chemicals that are in their
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:25.880]  systems every single day, every hour of every day. This is warfare. This is a tactic of warfare.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.440]  And when you finally see it for what it is, then you begin to make sense out of what's
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:36.360]  happening to this country. Because as we started this with in any sane country,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:41.560]  all of these drug executives and more would be in jail for 20, 30, 50 years.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.200]  Absolutely. Hey, in China, they would be sentenced to death.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.640]  Yeah, exactly. They would just take them out and shoot them in China. That's what they did to the
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:55.080]  manufacturer that put the melamine in the infant formula. They just executed them.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:00.360]  I'm not saying I'm in favor of the death penalty because it's so corrupt, but I'm just saying that
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:04.200]  China doesn't mess around on those issues. You know, China is obviously very corrupt in its own
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:09.080]  way. But to your point, you're correct. Why is nothing happening to these people? Check out
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.800]  this statement. This was in the BBC. GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement that it would pay the fines,
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:21.000]  the $3 billion fines, through quote, existing cash resources. They have $3 billion just lying around.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.880]  Yeah. In the closet. Open the door over there and get out the $3 billion.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.560]  Yeah. And it's just a fraction. And here's the other thing. From, this is Mr. Witty,
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  but I'm not making this up. Andrew Witty, the chief executive of Glaxo said, quote,
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:43.720]  we have learned from the mistakes that were made. Yeah, you got caught. And quote, when necessary,
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:46.920]  we have removed employees who have engaged in misconduct.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:53.240]  So wait a minute. You defraud the government of hundreds of billions of dollars and somebody
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:57.800]  just loses a job over it? That's it. But the company can keep doing business?
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.480]  We've learned that when we get caught, we have to pay a fine. So we're going to be more
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:09.000]  devious now than we were before. I think that's what the statement means. That's what he's saying,
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.680]  basically. That's what he's saying. But we got to move on to Merck. This is an even bigger,
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:19.960]  more outrageous issue in many ways. And I know you've already looked into this as well. Check
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:26.280]  this out. Merck virologist Stephen Crowling and Joan Wolchowski, trying to get that name right,
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:32.600]  they claimed in a 2010 False Claims Act document, which we posted. I did a big write up of this on
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:38.440]  naturalnews.com. That's on the screen right now. And today's article is on infowars.com as well.
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:44.120]  According to these virologists, Merck, quote, falsified test data to fabricate a vaccine efficacy
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:49.480]  rate of 95%. Turns out to be completely false, according to them. They spiked the blood test
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.320]  with animal antibodies in order to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.640]  The Merck pressured the two virologists to quote, participate in the fraud and the subsequent cover
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:07.480]  up that they use the falsified trial results to swindle the US government out of hundreds of millions
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:13.320]  of dollars for a vaccine that does not provide adequate immunization, that they intimidated
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:19.400]  the scientists, threatened them with having to go to jail unless they stayed silent. And in doing
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:25.800]  all of this, Merck actually contributed to the spread of the outbreaks of mumps, which is of
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.880]  course the very thing that the CDC cites to push everybody to go get more vaccines. So you talk
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:38.280]  about a grand fraud total runaway criminal scam. This is what's being described by these former
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:43.800]  employees. It is incredible. And everybody who went out there and got injected with a mumps
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:50.360]  vaccine, if this is all true, you got suckered. You got suckered big time. And once again,
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.040]  we were right, John. We were right. Don't get vaccinated. It's a scam.
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:59.960]  Completely. And not only were you cheated if you got the vaccine, but you can't sue
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:03.960]  the government. Oh, no, they all have complete immunity.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:10.120]  Yeah, the drug companies, government immunity, right? All they can do is just sit there and
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:15.960]  say, well, we got cheated. Now, people have to understand that when they say that they used
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:22.680]  animal antibodies, just to give you a gross version of this, it would be like you make a
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.200]  solution in a laboratory in addition, you say, okay, now we're trying to prove that the vaccine
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:33.720]  is really effective here. And so we want to see some real action in this liquid, but we don't see
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:41.160]  any. So obviously, we, you know, we failed. It's no good. So bring that bold, big bowl over there
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:46.600]  of animal blood. Yeah, pour it in here and let's see if we can get some foam going. Oh, yeah,
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:52.680]  that's great. Okay, now we can prove that the vaccine is effective. You know, that's basically
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:59.800]  what they did. It is outright fabricated fraud. It's almost as if you faked your birth certificate
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:05.320]  and tried to pass it off as real. Nobody would ever do that. Nobody, nobody would do that in America.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:13.320]  No, but check this out. According to these virologists, Merck's mumps viral strain is 45 years old.
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:18.600]  Here's the explanation from the complaint. For more than 30 years, Merck has had an exclusive
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:24.040]  license from the FDA to manufacture and sell the mumps vaccine in the US. The FDA first approved
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:29.800]  it in 1967. It was developed by Dr. Maurice Hilleman. You remember Hilleman? InfoWars has
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:34.120]  played the recordings of him and his crew laughing about all the cancer stealth viruses in the vaccines
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.960]  at Merck's West Point Research Facility from the mumps virus that infected his five-year-old
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:46.680]  daughter, Gerald Lynn. Merck continues, get this, continues to use this quote, Gerald Lynn strain
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:52.840]  of the virus for its vaccine today. That means this mumps viral strain is 45 years old and it's
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:57.880]  been weakened through multiple generations of what's called passaging to have it prepped for
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:03.160]  processing in a vaccine. This is a total fraud. If this turns out to be absolutely true, it is a
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:10.280]  complete scientific fraud at every level. It's unbelievable. They say all the time, oh, the
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.840]  viruses are mutating, they're mutating, they're changing. We have to completely revamp and
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:22.120]  vaccines every year in order to keep up with this. But hold on, in the case of the mumps vaccine,
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:28.520]  we're quite sure that it's been the same virus without mutations for 45 years. And so we can
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:34.600]  use my daughter's virus and make the same vaccine over and over again. It's a lot less expensive.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:39.160]  Who cares if it doesn't work or if it kills you? That's just a break. You can't sue us,
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:46.200]  so just shut up and take your vaccine. Yeah, yeah, that's it. You know, you gotta get down to this.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.480]  Think about all the doctors and all the so-called skeptics and science people who said,
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:55.960]  no, these vaccines are all perfectly safe and perfectly effective. It's the best science in
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:01.080]  the world. It's the gold standard of scientists. We wouldn't lie. We have PhDs. Oh my God,
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.400]  you know, now they're all fools. They look like complete fools. I mean, the whole thing,
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:11.400]  it was fabricated according to these two virologists. They didn't go so far as to say that people like
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.560]  you and me are terrorists, right? Oh, yeah. I mean, we must be in total terror right now.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:19.960]  We get people not to take vaccines. And of course, in doing that, we'll be destroying the
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:26.680]  entire country. So they have the science. I mean, it's rock solid. Oh, wait a minute. Oh,
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:32.920]  the whole month's vaccine is a total fraud from the top down. Wait a minute. I think I have to
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:40.120]  take a vacation. A medical farce is what I say. So all of you people out there listening today on
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:47.880]  this Monday, if you have been vaccinated with MMR or a month's vaccine made by Merck in the last,
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:56.200]  what, 45 years, you need to take a second look at who swindled you into that deal and what may
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.680]  have actually happened to you. Instead of being immune from the mumps, remember, we talked about
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.400]  this. The Institute of Medicine put out a report that said one of the biggest side effects of the
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:13.640]  mumps vaccine is the mumps. Correct. This is comedy. This is perfectly effective. I mean,
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:22.840]  aside from getting the mumps, the mumps vaccine is a miracle. And it's so ridiculous when you
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:29.160]  start to, you know, pick this whole thing apart. Oh man. Oh man. And then on top of this, you know,
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:34.680]  what happened to Merck was even when they took the big bowl of, you know, animal blood, so to
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:40.600]  speak, and poured it into the dish, the results were still not very good for them. Right. They
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:48.280]  had to fake the results a second time. You know, that fraud did work. So let's just conceal all
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:53.400]  of the findings that we've got up until now. All right, we got to take a break. We'll just lie
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:58.840]  about it. We'll be right back, John. Stay with us, folks. We'll be right back with more. Stay with us.
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:07.480]  Oh man. Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:11.720]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:17.080]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead. Here's why. Solar power
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:22.440]  generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:27.240]  Their emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:32.840]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:37.480]  from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:42.040]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:47.080]  power outages again. When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:52.040]  generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information.

[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:26.840]  is in the fraud of the vaccine and all the people who fell for it, all the doctors,
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:32.040]  all the pharmacists, all the CDC officials. Hey, John, I got a Jeopardy! quiz question for you.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:39.720]  Where is the former president, I'm sorry, the former head of the CDC who was running the CDC
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:45.640]  during all of this alleged fraud that went on with the fake vaccine? Where is she now? Let our
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:54.360]  audience know. Couldn't be with a drug company, could it? Of course not. That would be too funny.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:59.000]  That would never happen. That would never happen to Dr. Julie Gerberding,
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.360]  who is now running one of the top vaccine companies' international divisions.
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:12.680]  But that's, see, this is the thing. This is the thing. I guess if the lie is told by enough
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:18.040]  authorities and enough doctors with people with medical degrees, as my friend Robert Scott Bell
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:25.160]  likes to say, I guess the lie becomes reality and then if the lab tests don't match the lie,
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.920]  they just spike it with some animal blood. They just throw in, they change the numbers,
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:33.000]  roll the dice, do whatever they want, invent something, send it over to the FDA and sell it
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.320]  to 200 million American children or all over the world. That is probably not 200 million children,
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:43.800]  but 200 million Americans overall got these vaccines. So that's a big number. That's a lot
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.960]  of people who got hoodwinked. Absolutely. That's what they do. They establish, okay, this is
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:57.720]  reality. Everybody's on board. Everybody knows we can't rock the boat here because we've gone too
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:03.240]  far. So now if anything comes up that really contradicts what we've been saying here and
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:07.640]  claiming, we've got to lie about it. Everybody understand that? Everybody understands? Yes,
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:12.600]  yes, yes, yes. Okay, let's move forward now. And that's what they do. And what they're taught
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:17.400]  and what they learn is how to sound like they know what they're talking about. I mean, this is
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:25.080]  media, this is doctors, this is all of these people. Their main skill as far as dealing with people is
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:31.160]  I sound like I know what I'm talking about. I mean, I see people on television all the time
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:37.800]  talking about medicals, you know, stuff. I mean, analysts and commentators like Bill Maher and
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.600]  so forth, as if they have the slightest idea of what they're talking about, they have no clue.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:47.160]  And where are they getting their information from? You don't find them in medical libraries
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.760]  reading through studies and calling up researchers on the phone. They're just taking their clue
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:59.160]  from all of the other lying idiots and criminals who have access to and control the media,
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:08.040]  basically. And so we're pointing out here the lies and how deep they go. And they go all the way to
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:15.800]  the bottom. This rabbit hole has no bottom. Yeah, absolutely. By the way, can you stay with us a
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.800]  little bit into the next hour because there's still so much more to cover here. This is huge
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.800]  breaking news. Absolutely. This is okay. Now think about the application. Once we understand the depth
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.360]  of the fraud. And by the way, the mainstream media is practically refusing to cover this.
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:37.000]  You're only going to get this on places like Infowars, Natural News, Drudge Report, places like
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.640]  that. But if this has all, if this has been faked for the last at least 10 years, then now you got
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.600]  to look at all the mandatory vaccination policies that have been put into place, like in Texas,
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:52.760]  where before you go to a university, you have to be injected with the fake mumps vaccine.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:58.040]  You know, in California, the mandatory vaccines, don't these state governments now have to take
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.200]  a new look and say, wait a minute, how can we mandate something that's total fraud?
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:09.080]  I bet they won't. I bet they'll just, oh, well, that was an interesting article. Okay, so let's get
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:14.280]  out the vaccines and, you know, keep on. That's what they do, you know? And then if you argue with
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.880]  them, they'll say, you know, you could be a terrorist. Oh, yeah. Well, look, it's the end of
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.200]  sanity in America. It's the end of truth. It's the end of justice. The country is being run by
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:30.840]  totals, zombie, runaway, criminal-minded, insane, psychotic, sociopathic bureaucrats,
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.360]  and doctors and drug companies executives. It's crazy. We'll be right back
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:50.280]  with John Rappaport and much more straight ahead continuing here on the Alice Jones Show.

[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:12.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:21.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:26.280]  Continuing into the third hour of the Alex Jones today, this is Mike Adams,
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:32.680]  filling in for Alex with our guest, John Rappaport from NoMoreFakeNews.com. Now, John,
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:38.280]  because this segment is not carried by all the radio affiliates, I want to depart for just a
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:46.600]  moment and get onto this. I've got a trace mineral block in my hand here in the InfoWars
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:52.600]  Studios. This is about the size of a brick here. Hold up for you here for the camera you can see
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:01:00.840]  on the PrismPlanet.tv. This is a mineral lick for animals. And the ingredients include zinc,
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:09.000]  oxide, ferrous carbonate, iron, obviously, manganese, iodine, cobalt, and salt, and some
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.320]  other minerals. John, can you explain to our listeners why is it that in America we use
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:22.200]  trace minerals to keep our cattle alive, but anybody who tries to prescribe trace minerals to
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:32.600]  humans is considered a quack. What's going on with that? I guess the animals are more important
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:41.000]  than the humans. And secondly, the drug companies have a complete stranglehold or trying to on the
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.960]  market. So, imagine what would happen if people began to take enough trace minerals in the right
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:55.160]  way so that their health suddenly blossomed. Yeah. Now, you know, the people from doctors
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:59.080]  office call up and say, well, you know, you're scheduled for your check and we told you to come
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:03.080]  and so forth. Well, you know, actually, I don't have to come because I have to tell you, I'm
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:07.400]  feeling so healthy. It's ridiculous. What do you mean? You're feeling so healthy.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:13.160]  You mean you're not sick? No, I've been sick in a long time now that I'm taking my minerals.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:21.000]  What minerals? I mean, this is now, you know, a distinct threat to the multi trillion dollar
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.280]  establishment. You can't have healthy people running around in the country. No, you don't
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:31.640]  need minerals, John. You need a mumps vaccine. That's right. You need a mumps vaccine. It doesn't
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:37.240]  work. Yeah, that's what you really need. You know, maybe they'll start putting minerals in the
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:46.280]  mumps vaccine. That'll be the way of combating the sales of natural minerals. It's just stark.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:51.880]  It's that stark, Mike. It's the same idea. You know, if you're marking a product that actually
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.960]  works and it's not a drug, I mean, this is one of the reasons why they went after Stan
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:04.120]  Brzezinski so hard in Texas MD treating cancer patients with extraordinary results for decades
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:09.720]  now has been subjected to how many grand juries, at least seven, they've been trying to shut them
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:15.880]  down, you know, in every possible way. Well, one of the problems is, is that Dr. Brzezinski
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:22.920]  developed his own medicine. This is like a cardinal sin. No drug company is producing it. He
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:27.880]  produces it himself. Well, now you're really talking about this is like holding a gun to the
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:33.240]  drug company's heads. We have to get rid of this guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, check this out.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:39.160]  So so info wars, a lot of people are drink tangy tangerine. So I there's a bottle here on Alex's
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:44.120]  desk. I just grabbed it. Look at the minerals in this. This is the the equivalent of the mineral
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:48.040]  supplement to the cattle that you want to keep alive. If you want to keep your people alive,
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.800]  you got to have minerals. So this has iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, chromium,
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.280]  and potassium, and plus probably some other trace minerals as well. But so, you know,
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:03.720]  this is the kind of thing if you want to stay alive, or if you want to keep your animals alive,
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:08.440]  you got to have trace minerals in your biology. But yet, if you go by the sugar, if you go by
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.320]  the wheat that's processed, the bleached white flower, all the minerals are stripped away.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:18.920]  So humans are being fed this diet that is devoid of been of minerals. That's if it's even in the
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.960]  soil to begin with, which usually it's not anymore, because the soils have been essentially mined for
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:29.880]  the minerals long ago. So, you know, we have a nation of mineral deficient and vitamin D
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:33.800]  deficient people, and they say the answer is more drugs, and the drugs turn out to be total
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:40.440]  fraud. Wow. Yeah, and the drugs strip other minerals out of your body. But, you know, eating all the
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:46.200]  deficient foods is great business for the pharmaceutical companies because they say,
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.520]  well, this is terrific. No more topsoil. And they stripped all the minerals out of the food
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:55.720]  fabulous because now we've got to go to break, sorry to interrupt. We'll finish up with Merck
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:59.000]  on the other side. And then we have a guest coming up us army medic straight ahead.

[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:07.080]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:12.200]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:17.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:22.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:28.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:33.160]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.480]  thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar
[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:42.120]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:46.360]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:53.240]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:59.800]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.

[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:27.880]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the third hour of the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams,
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:32.440]  the Health Ranger Editor of NaturalNews.com filling in for Alex today. Thank you for
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.720]  continuing with us. We're continuing. We held over John Rappaport for just a few minutes to wrap
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:43.800]  up this section. Blockbuster news about the total fraud and criminality of the pharmaceutical and
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:48.520]  vaccine industry. This is all becoming public knowledge now on the record, and then we're
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:54.920]  going to be joined in a few minutes by a U.S. Army medic who was, he went through a very difficult
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:09:01.640]  court martial because of his refusal to be injected with experimental vaccines by the military.
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:06.040]  He'll be joining us by Skype with comments on that in just a few minutes, but catching up
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:13.880]  and then wrapping this up, John, GlaxoSmithKline again, please guilty to bribery, fraud and other
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:21.000]  crimes, $3 billion fine. Two Merck virologists come out and say the company spiked its blood
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.040]  samples, falsified its test results and defrauded the government of hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:32.520]  Now, and they say, by the way, quote, the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:37.320]  year are being injected with a month's vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:43.000]  of protection. The failure in Merck's vaccine has allowed this disease to linger with significant
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.040]  outbreaks continuing to occur. So there we go, Merck's own former employees saying that Merck
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:55.240]  is causing the spread of infectious disease that their vaccines claim to actually prevent.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:59.880]  But on top of that, John, here's where I want your comments. And thank you for staying with us.
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:06.680]  I really appreciate it. The Chaitam Primary Care has filed a lawsuit against Merck now,
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:12.440]  claiming that they were defrauded by Merck because of a quote, decade-long scheme to falsify
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:18.680]  and misrepresent the true efficacy of its vaccine. Says that Merck knows and has taken
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:24.680]  affirmative steps to conceal that its month's vaccine is far less than 95% effective and
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:33.240]  that this has been going on since at least 1999. Wow, this is a long-standing ongoing situation.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.400]  So are you familiar with the details of that lawsuit, John, or you have any comments on it?
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:44.120]  Well, the comment that I have is, I'm happy to hear this because since the Department of
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:49.880]  Justice will do absolutely nothing to prosecute the people at Merck responsible for this,
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:57.480]  then if you can pile on with more lawsuits, that's a good thing. If you can get different
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:04.680]  groups who were actually defrauded, just like this one was, to take them to court and say,
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:11.720]  well, we were defrauded too. So pay us out as well because what this is saying basically, Mike, is
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:20.520]  if a drug company defrauds intentionally, 100 million people, those 100 million people deserve
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:26.440]  something in return. Yes, at least a refund. At least a refund. It's not more punitive.
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.600]  Yeah, quite a bit more because they were injected with something. It wasn't like
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:36.360]  you bought a toaster and toast the bread. It did probably test their brain a little bit though.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:44.520]  Yeah, you would deserve more. Well, yeah, but see, this is the big picture here is that
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:50.200]  there's immunity granted to the drug companies over vaccines. So you can't have a class action
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.640]  lawsuit now. So the government has created a situation where there is no justice for the fraud
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:01.480]  that's now emerging from the vaccine industry. There is no justice. Well, that's what they did.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:04.760]  That's how they covered themselves. The vaccine companies went to the government
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:10.680]  10 years ago, a little bit more and said, well, guys, basically, we're going to get out of the
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:14.360]  vaccine business because there's too many lawsuits and we can't make any money.
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.800]  And so there were meetings, they sat down in a room and they started to hammer out this whole
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:23.800]  kind of agreement and the government said, well, you know, I mean, we got to keep making vaccines.
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.040]  I mean, come on. And the drug companies are kind of laughing up their sleeve and they said, well,
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:35.000]  look, if you grant us immunity from lawsuits and you create some kind of hokey little government
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.080]  payout system with a lot of red tape, then we can make a deal. And the government said, yeah,
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:46.840]  sure, why not? We can do that. And that's what happened. And that's why you've got this very
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:52.120]  limited window of opportunity to make these drug companies pay for what they do.
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:57.800]  Well, something has got to happen. Last drug company to be mentioned here today is Pfizer,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:02.680]  now being sued by retailers over what is deemed an anti competitive scheme.
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:10.120]  The largest, many of the largest pharmacies in the US are now suing Pfizer and this is reported
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:16.200]  on by Reuters and other sources. The lawsuit claims that Pfizer obtained a fraudulent patent
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:21.240]  engaged in sham litigation entered a price fixing agreement to delay the arrival of
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:27.080]  cheaper generic drugs and entered arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers to force retailers
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:32.840]  to buy more Lipitor, their cholesterol drugs. So now we have, look at all the parties that
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:37.800]  are potentially harmed and all this. Now we have the pharmacies claiming that they're the victims
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.600]  of anti competitive monopolistic price fixing behavior by Pfizer. This is getting deep.
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:49.080]  Oh, yeah. This is getting very deep because, you know, if you're selling basically
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:55.080]  a fraudulent, dangerous product to begin with, it stands to reason that you're the type of criminal
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:14:01.560]  mind who will do whatever you can to maximize your profits, right? And so price fixing, we don't want
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:07.720]  those generic drugs on the market. We want pharmacies to keep selling Lipitor, whatever.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:11.800]  They're going to do that. They're going to just keep pushing the envelope wherever they can.
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:15.800]  And now suppose they get fined. I don't know how much they're going to have to pay out a few
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:20.360]  hundred million dollars. Where does that rank against the sales of Lipitor? It's just like,
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.680]  you know, a little minnow in the ocean. Yeah, yeah, right. All right. Last thing,
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:28.680]  John, then I'll let you go again. I appreciate your time. I'm going to ask you nine, eight or nine
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:34.520]  rapid fire questions. I want to yes or no from you and whether you think yes or no only.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:38.920]  Is it a pass or fail? This is, yeah. Now you are, you already passed. We just want your comments.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:44.600]  Would big pharma engage in the following behaviors? Yes or no? John Rappaport,
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:49.800]  number one, would they falsify efficacy data on other prescription drugs?
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:54.280]  Yes. Would they exploit children for deadly vaccine trials?
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.560]  Absolutely. Yes. How about this? Would they invent fictitious diseases to sell more drugs?
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.160]  Yes, with exclamation points. All right. Only yes or no. No exclamation marks.
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:11.160]  No. Sorry. Would they? Okay. Here's, here's, here's, this might stump you. Would they unleash
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:17.400]  bio weapons to cause a pandemic that would make them money? Yes. Okay. Would they conspire with
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:24.680]  the CDC to spread fear about a pandemic to promote more vaccination sales? Yes. That's a no-brainer.
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:31.400]  Would they silence whistleblowers who try to go to the public with the truth? Yes. Wow. Okay. Would
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:37.160]  they give people cancer via stealth viruses and vaccines to sell more high profit cancer treatments?
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:43.480]  Yes. Would they destroy the careers of medical scientists who question big pharma and the vaccine
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:50.120]  mythology? Yes. This is all yeses. Okay. Fine. Last question. Would they force a medical monopoly
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:56.840]  on the entire U.S. population via socialist healthcare legislation? Gee, let me think about that.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  Yes. All right. All right. A plus John Rappaport. A, you got A. Okay. A plus for you, man.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:09.800]  Send me my diploma. I'm going to say you got a Ph.D. for that one right there. Thank you
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.000]  for joining us, John. It's always great to have you on. Thanks so much, Mike. You're doing great.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.480]  All right. John Rappaport, everybody from nomorefakenews.com. If you'd like to learn more from John
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:23.000]  and John, thanks for playing along with my impromptu pop quiz right there. And yes,
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.080]  you pass with flying colors. Okay. Now we've, I'm sure I'll hear about that later from John.
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:34.360]  Anyway, coming up now, we've got a guest joining us. Let me ask the producers, is he on the line?
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.160]  Not, not yet. Okay. I'm going to give you an intro of what this is all about.
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:49.160]  He is a U.S. Army medic. And his name is Sean. What's, how do I pronounce his last name? Neemey
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:58.840]  or Neemey? Neemey? I think, I think it's Neemey. Okay. Sean Neemey, who has gone through a very,
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:04.600]  very difficult time. He was court-martialed essentially, went through a court-martial
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:10.120]  process. Be sure to keep getting him on the line. Let me know when he's on. He did not want to be
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:16.760]  vaccinated by the military's experimental vaccines. And so he filed for a religious exemption. He went
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:22.920]  to his priest, pastor, and explained his beliefs. And by the way, he's being represented by attorney
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:29.000]  Patricia Finn, who is a vaccine rights or an anti-vaccine rights attorney that has been,
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.160]  who has been featured on Infowars and Infowars Nightly News as well. So he applied for the
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:41.080]  exemption. And that exemption, according to military law, is allowed to be granted to you
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:47.240]  as long as your commanding officer agrees to it. Well, his commanding officer, for some reason,
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:55.720]  did not agree to it and put him through what he describes as a hell type of experience.
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:00.680]  Okay. His name is Neemey, I'm being told. That's the correct pronunciation of his last name.
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:06.120]  He went through hell. And he's now out of the military, and the military actually took money
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:11.000]  out of his paycheck, he says, actually taking money from him while he was trying to get back
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.040]  on his feet with his family. It sounds like this is a story of just incredible medical abuse in
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:22.440]  the military. That's why we wanted to have Sean on the Alex Jones show today. Sean, thank you for
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:31.240]  joining us and welcome to the show. Can you hear me, Sean? Yes. Okay. Thank you for joining us.
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:35.800]  Yeah, I can see you. Thank you. Welcome to the show. How are you feeling, man? I'm doing great,
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:41.800]  Mike. How are you? I'm doing just fantastic. I gave a brief introduction to your situation there,
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:46.440]  but say, tell us in your own words, we've got a couple minutes before the next break.
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:53.720]  Go ahead and run down what happened to you in your own words, please. All right. Back in 2009,
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:59.560]  if you all remember that we had a little bit of an H1N1 scare or an invented scare,
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:06.680]  I found out that the immunizations that they were handing out, that the military was handing out to
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:11.480]  us was an experimental version. It wasn't the same version that the rest of the world was getting.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:18.120]  U.S. military was the only people getting this experimental version. I decided at that point,
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:21.240]  I wasn't going to give it to my soldiers. I wasn't going to take it myself.
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:25.880]  And what was your position there? You were U.S. Army medic, correct?
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:33.640]  Yes. I was the Cavalry troops senior medic. And what group were you with? Where were you stationed?
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:37.800]  I was stationed in Afghanistan at the time with the 10th Mountain Division.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.240]  Okay. All right. We're going to go to break. Your story, please continue with us on the other
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.160]  side of this break. We want to find out what happened to you, what you did about it, and what
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:51.960]  this means for all soldiers in the military today. Right here on the Alex Jones Show, stay with us.
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:20:03.400]  We'll be right back with all that much more. Let me ask you a question. What does freedom mean to
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:07.560]  you? The freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to worship. How about the freedom to

[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:16.040]  Okay, we're continuing here on The Alex Jones Show. Welcome back. Here we go.
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:23.240]  So we're continuing with U.S. Army medic, Sean Nimai. That's the right pronunciation.
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:30.200]  He joins us by Skype to tell us what happened to him in the military and his attempts to protect
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:35.800]  his body, his health from the experimental vaccines that are being forced on soldiers every day, it
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:41.560]  seems. So go ahead, Sean. You were telling us where you were stationed. Please continue with your story.
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:49.480]  Yes. As I said, in 2009, I was in Afghanistan, stationed there for a year deployment with the
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:58.680]  10th Mountain Division. I refused to receive or give the H1N1 experimental vaccine at that time.
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:08.120]  It was received at the time with a little bit of distrust from my chain of command.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:15.560]  But once I explained to them that it was an experimental version, I didn't feel safe giving
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:24.440]  it to soldiers when I didn't even have a pamphlet that normally comes with medications
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:31.800]  and immunizations. We had no literature at all. So they just said, here it is, take it, and we're
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.960]  not going to provide any information about it. Just trust us. Basically, is that what they said?
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:45.800]  It was generic labels on the bottles. All I said was keep refrigerated, and this is the
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:53.080]  dosage. We were told about it. So what caused you to have red flags about it? Why would you even
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:26:01.400]  suspect the safety of it in the first place? Well, part of the biggest reason that I questioned it
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:11.480]  to begin with was the fact that there was no literature. I'm kind of OCD about making sure
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:16.440]  that I read all the literature to all the medications that I'm supposed to give to my soldiers.
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:25.640]  When there was no literature brought with the vaccines, I requested from the Brigade Medical
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:30.520]  Services Office, you know, hey, you guys forgot to send the literature with this.
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:36.200]  They said, no, there isn't any. Just follow the directions on the labels that are on the bottles
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:43.400]  and you'll be fine. So at that point, I decided that it was time to look a little deeper into
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:49.160]  things. Found out that there was actually three different batches, three different formulas of
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:57.880]  the H1N1 vaccines that were being mass produced for human use. Two of them were being distributed
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:05.880]  to civilians all over the world. The third one was being distributed to US military members only.
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:14.440]  That raised a couple of red flags. Yeah, the special soldier edition with no documentation.
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:19.640]  So let me ask you, how many soldiers were you in charge of in terms of their medical care?
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:27.560]  I don't remember the exact number. There's a little over 100 of the US soldiers from my unit
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:34.760]  and a couple other units that were co-located with us. And then approximately 250 Afghan
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:40.920]  national forces that we did different missions in conjunction with them.
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:45.560]  Okay. And where did you receive your medical training? And can you describe it just briefly?
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:49.240]  So everybody has a background of your medical background, so to speak?
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:59.160]  Yeah. After basic training at Fort Leonardwood, Missouri, I went to AIT's advanced individual
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:06.120]  training, which is medic school at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. Spent I think it was about
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:14.760]  four and a half to five months there learning not only an EMT civilian side of emergency
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:24.520]  medicine, but also the army side of tactical combat casualty care, which is a little more,
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.760]  I don't know what the exact word would be. It's a little more goal oriented in keeping
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:36.520]  people alive, not so much keeping them pretty. Keeping them alive is a good thing. But then,
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:40.840]  so it sounds like with the vaccines, you were concerned about the implications of that experimental
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:46.760]  vaccine on the health of your, of the people whose health you were at least in part responsible for.
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:53.000]  So when did you start getting resistance to this and how did that emerge in your experience there?
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:58.840]  What happened to you? Because I saw at one point you were being threatened with even being being
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:06.920]  fragged. Correct. How did it lead us to that point? What happened? After that deployment was over,
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:13.000]  we got back to Fort Drum, New York and started the reset for the next upcoming deployment, which
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:19.720]  was going to be about a year to a year and a half out. So we started train up, reset,
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:26.360]  getting new equipment, getting new soldiers. At that point, we have to go through the medical
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:30.920]  screening. All right, Sean, I got to interrupt you. We got one more break right here and then a
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:36.600]  long segment on the other side of this. But I want to hear your story of how you got threatened with
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:41.880]  even being killed if you didn't go along with their vaccine agenda. That straight ahead, stay with us
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:55.240]  right here on the Alex Jones show. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the

[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:17.560]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones show. Thank you for continuing with us. This was Mike Adams
[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:23.720]  filling in. Today, we're continuing our interview with Sean Nimai, US Army medic who was just telling
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:28.440]  us what happened to him with the experimental military vaccines that he didn't want to give
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:33.240]  to his men because he thought, well, it might not be safe and there was no literature that came
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:38.600]  with him. So sorry about the interruption there, Sean. Go right on ahead with relating your story.
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:47.320]  Please go ahead. Yeah. So like I was saying, part of the preparation for the next upcoming
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:53.720]  deployment was we would have to go and have our medical records screened, get whatever
[02:33:53.720 --> 02:34:02.120]  immunization shots, eye tests, dental screenings that's needed in order to go overseas. At that
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:08.760]  point, I decided, well, I'd already decided up until that point that I wasn't going to receive
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:16.120]  any more of the immunizations vaccines. I talked to my wife and we were in agreement that
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:24.440]  because of our religious convictions, that it wasn't right for us anymore for me to be receiving
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:33.960]  me. At that point, I put in what's called a religious exemption request to basically
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:43.720]  give me an exemption from any and all vaccines, immunizations, prophylaxis, medications such as
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:52.520]  the malaria pills. Yes. I'm sorry. I said yes. Now, that's a normal accepted procedure in the
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:59.480]  military. So why wasn't that accepted in the chain of command? What happened there? Well,
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:11.960]  part of the problem is that that sort of an exemption is only approval denial up until
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:19.240]  a company level of command. It doesn't have to go any higher than him. And my company level commander
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:25.240]  in a cavalry unit is called a TRU. I don't think he liked me very much.
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:32.520]  I have an affidavit here. I'm sorry, your voice cut out.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.600]  That's okay. I was just saying that there'd been a history between him and myself during
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:44.840]  different training exercises and such. And I really don't think he liked me very much. So
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:51.320]  he had already made up his mind before he looked into the regulations and whether or not I was
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:57.400]  even allowed to request such a thing. I'm pretty sure he already made up his mind that he was
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:03.000]  going to deny it and give me an order to go get shots. So it sounds like this was a punitive,
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:10.680]  vengeful type of action targeted to you personally because of personal disagreements. Is that a
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:17.560]  fair characterization? I would definitely say so, yes. And then I have an affidavit here sworn
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:27.080]  affidavit by a Sergeant Medic team leader, Anthony Komau, who supports your story and says that this
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:35.400]  captain began to refer to you as quote, bacteria man and said they want to throw you inside a
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  wall locker and throw a hand grenade in with you. Correct. So that's a pretty serious accusation
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:52.600]  and a serious crime in the military, if true indeed. Yes. Even the act of stating anything
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:58.040]  about fratricide is actually a crime. It's against the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So even if
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:05.560]  he didn't ever try to go through with any kind of a plan like that, just stating that he was
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:11.720]  thinking about it is actually a crime in the military. Okay. Wow. And so there were witnesses
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:20.040]  to this threat that according to this paper was made by Captain Rupasky. Is that the name?
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:25.720]  Correct. Captain Rupasky, yes. Captain Rupasky. And so what happened next? I mean,
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:30.840]  you're out of the military now. So how did you get out with an honorable discharge? What was
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:41.000]  the situation? Well, right after he denied my request for religious exemption, he immediately
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.440]  gave me a direct order to go get all the vaccines and shots and so on and so forth that I needed
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:51.800]  for the upcoming deployment. I told him at that point, sir, well, I'll do respect to your gradient
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:56.840]  position. I cannot good conscience do that because it violates my religious beliefs.
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:03.400]  And at that point, he had one of the other NCOs in the medical platoon escort me to
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:11.720]  the readiness center at which time I told the team leader there, I'm not getting the shots.
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:17.640]  You know, go ahead and take me back. Did they try to force the shots on to you at that point?
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:26.920]  No, no, they with the smaller women that are nurses at the readiness center, I don't think
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:32.040]  anybody was going to force me to do anything. Okay. So you stood your ground and then what happened?
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:41.160]  Um, we get back to we get back to the unit area. And I'm informed at that moment that
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:49.480]  that Captain Rupaski was going to be filing papers and to request an article 15. And what
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:57.480]  what an article 15 is, it's a it's again, another kind of another kind of punishment under uniform
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:05.080]  code military justice to where I could lose all the rank that I gained, lose a large sum of money.
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:14.280]  I could be put onto restrictions, so on and so forth. There's a long list of possible punishments
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:23.240]  that go along with an article 15 punishment. By the way, let give out your website for those who
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:27.640]  want to learn more about this after the show. What's what's the web address where people can hear
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:36.440]  or read about your experience? Yeah, I have a blog. It's vaccine battles.wordpress.com.
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:42.360]  Okay, vaccine battles.wordpress.com. That's a good that's a good name. So there are you are you
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:47.320]  continuing to blog there and give updates to the developing elements of the story?
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.920]  Well, I'm I'm trying to keep up with it. You know, I'm husband and father. So
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:57.000]  right, get a little busy. I'm getting ready to go to school next month, too. So
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:03.880]  alright, so section or article 15, they tried to get you on to that. Did they succeed or what
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:11.640]  what happened? The interesting thing about this is that under an article 15 proceeding,
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:18.360]  I have the right to either accept the punishment from article 15 or request court martial,
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:27.080]  which is basically I go to court, tell the judge my side, possibly tell a jury of my peers,
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:34.120]  so to speak, my side of it. And we let the judge decide instead of letting the commander just go
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:42.360]  ahead and decide what he wants to do with it. So I, I obviously I requested court martial because
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:48.280]  I firmly believe that I was right. I don't remember ever signing away my religious rights,
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:53.400]  or any other constitutionally guaranteed rights when I signed up for the military.
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:41:02.120]  Right. So I requested court martial at which point pretty much everybody in the room. I honestly,
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:08.360]  I thought that everybody had saw a ghost at that moment because apparently people don't request
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:14.440]  court martial very often. Well, well, you know, military justice, but so okay, so take us through
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:20.760]  that. What happened at the court martial hearing? Well, we, the court martial proceedings actually
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:33.000]  lasted for over a year, at which point I had gotten a court ordered military attorney, guess
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:40.920]  that I don't mention his name. Yes. I had also acquired for myself civilian attorney, Patricia
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:49.880]  Finn. Between the two of them, they, they kept me going. One of them would say, just take whatever
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:54.760]  deal you can get. The other one would say, keep fighting. And then they would, you know, the
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:00.120]  prosecution would come back with another offer and then it would be role reversal. One would say,
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:03.960]  that sounds like a pretty good deal. The other one would say, no, keep fighting. So I went back
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:09.560]  and forth and I was under no impression that I was ever going to give up because I felt that I was
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:16.040]  right. And if that meant being convicted and fit and going to federal prison at Fort Leppenworth
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:21.000]  for a year, then that's what we do. Let me ask you this though. What, what was the opinion of
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:29.240]  the soldiers whose health you were responsible for as a medic? Did, did they support your decision
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:33.640]  not to have them injected with an experimental vaccine or did they want the vaccine? What was
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:41.880]  their take? Well, I would say that an overwhelming number were very supportive. I had already known
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:48.600]  most of those soldiers for a couple of years and they trusted me implicitly. If I said,
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:54.040]  you don't need this, then they would, they would fight to the end saying, I don't need
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:59.720]  this injection, this shot. If Doc says it and it's the word of God, as far as I'm concerned.
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:07.320]  Now in retrospect, gotta ask you, we know that the H5N1 pandemic was mostly a fraud. It was,
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:12.200]  it was designed. I mean, we covered a lot of the fraudulent news today about what's come out
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:16.120]  about the vaccine fraud from one company, in particular whistleblowers coming out.
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:23.240]  And we know that the, the, the H5N1 pandemic was a fraud designed to sell vaccines. So do,
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:29.000]  as you monitor all of this news coming out, doesn't this really vindicate your decision?
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:34.200]  I mean, there, there was no pandemic happening over there that that vaccine would have stopped.
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:42.520]  Right. The worst part about all of that is that the entire time that we were deployed during the
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:50.520]  supposed pandemic, I got reports on a weekly basis about in-country medical status for all
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:59.160]  the units in country. And I don't remember seeing a single soldier that was positive with H1N1,
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:04.600]  H5N1, or any other swine flu derivative. That's because it was a hoax, man. The whole thing was
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:10.600]  a hoax. Exactly. And so the, well, let me tell you, let me, let me give you a little bit of
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:18.120]  behind the scenes too. What this is, is the drug companies making money by treating U.S. soldiers
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:23.960]  like chemical pin cushions, and then convincing the higher ups in the military to just, you know,
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:27.640]  spend all this money on the vaccines, the drug companies go cash the checks at the bank,
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:33.960]  and the, the JPMorgan controller bank, by the way. And then the soldiers get treated like human
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:39.240]  guinea pigs. So you were trying to stop that. And it seems like you did so from a rational,
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:43.880]  ethical basis in the protection of the lives and health of the, of the men who you were
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:50.760]  responsible for. So in my opinion, you should be given a, a, a, a medal or something for doing
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:59.400]  that, but instead they wanted to throw you, throw you to the wolves. Correct. It was, it was tougher
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:05.320]  on my family really than it was on me. I've dealt with military, you know, at that point for about
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:12.840]  six years. I knew how they are. And I already knew that we were basically considered to be just big
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:19.880]  dumb animals there to enforce foreign policy. Right. So. All right. Well, tell us then how did this
[02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:28.760]  conclude? Okay. So my, my military attorney is actually the one that found this little known
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:40.520]  regulation, where if any decision goes against the military's ideas, and it's based on a real,
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:48.200]  honest, sincerely held religious belief, then that soldier can request from the secretary of the
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:57.000]  army, in this case, John McHugh, to be released because of, I forget the exact wording, but it's
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:03.320]  a, it's called a chapter five dash three. And you can look that up on Google pops rate up.
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:11.160]  Okay. But basically the wording that I got in my letter from Secretary of the Army McHugh was,
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:17.240]  we're very sorry, Specialist Nimai, that the army is no longer able to,
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:27.640]  to abide by your religious beliefs. So please accept our apologies. And here's an honorable
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:32.840]  discharge. You can keep all of your benefits, your veterans, affairs benefits, GI bill, so on and so
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:38.280]  forth. So that that sounded like good news, but then something else happened, right? Oh,
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:43.880]  more things are happening on a daily basis, it seems like. So you got out with an honorable
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:50.600]  discharge and you're supposed to have your benefits intact. Correct. So in my last,
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:54.760]  I guess it was about three or four days in the military, I'm doing all of the,
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:02.040]  check the box, turn all this gear back in, go to finance, make sure that my final paycheck
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:09.320]  is going to be okay. When finance tells me that supposedly I owe a part of my re-enlistment bonus
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:19.320]  back. So, okay, how much was your re-enlistment bonus? It was $13,500 back in 2007. So now because
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:24.760]  you're exiting the military, they argued that you needed to pay a portion of that back? Correct.
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:31.320]  And how much did that come to? Just under $5,000. So they docked your final paycheck or what did
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:37.240]  they do? Send you a bill? Well, both actually, they took our final paycheck and then sent me a
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:43.480]  bill for almost $1,000. And of course, you had no job. I mean, you just got out of the military,
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.080]  you had no employment at that time, right? Correct. That's another thing that happened
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:57.640]  along the way out was all military medics are trained and certified as emergency medical
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:05.560]  technicians. Well, when I went to re-certify earlier this year, well before my re-certification
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:13.400]  date was due, I was told basically that I didn't have enough classes, enough of the continuing
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:22.840]  education unit classes to re-certify. So I went back through my files, pulled out all of my diplomas,
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:29.400]  all of my little certificates and whatnot and found out yet not only did I have enough,
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:36.520]  I had more than enough. I had an excess of continuing education hours needed to re-certify
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:44.200]  my EMT. I called back every other day to both the National Registry of EMTs in San Antonio
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:51.400]  and my local medical training facility at Fort Drum and tried to get it straightened out. But
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:57.480]  as of right now, I'm still not licensed. Wow, wait a minute. Do you think that somebody in an
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:03.640]  act of revenge is messing with your records to deny you employment? Is that your theory or is
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:11.400]  this just some paperwork snafu that military is sometimes famous for? Well, at first I thought,
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:18.520]  okay, military, going between a military organization and a civilian organization,
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:24.040]  paperwork's going to get messed up, computers are going to be down sometimes, okay, fine.
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:29.560]  But after about three months of arguing back and forth with these people on both sides,
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:35.160]  both of them blaming the other one, of course. Meanwhile, you're out of work, you can't get
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:42.600]  work as an EMT. Right. So. Okay, so is this situation still not resolved at this point?
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:49.480]  What are you doing for work right now? Right now, I'm unemployed. I'm getting ready to start
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:54.280]  possibly next week or the week after with volunteer fire squad here in East Tennessee.
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:50:01.480]  And I'm going to school next month, going back to college. Wow. What words do you have for other
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:06.040]  soldiers in the military or people considering going into the military? I mean, you've been
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:10.120]  through quite an experience here. Do you have some wisdom to share with others who may be
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:20.040]  considering that? Well, to the people that are already in, I would, before you file a religious
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:25.800]  exemption request, I would ask the commander, your unit commander, ask your first sergeant,
[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:33.160]  ask your chain of command. What do you think of this? If they tell you flat out that they're not
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:40.040]  going to approve it, then expect the same type of treatment that I got. If they tell you that
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:47.480]  they're, they're open to take a look at it, then go ahead and file it. It's a regulation dealing with
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:53.640]  that is AR 40-562. All right, we're going to go to break here. We'll be right back. Stay with us,
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:57.480]  Sean. We'll continue with you on the other side here on the Alex Jones show. We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:05.800]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:10.520]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:14.680]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have all performed even
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:19.080]  gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our
[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:23.880]  friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:29.800]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:33.560]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:39.400]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:48.760]  them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:55.320]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:51:55.320 --> 02:52:00.760]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:04.760]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors in every relationship, and one of the biggest is
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:09.720]  that men are losing libido or sexual desire, especially if you're a man over 40. The problem
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:14.680]  could be declining testosterone levels. Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man in every
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:19.720]  way. That's why we created TGen. TGen is an all-natural formula with ingredients proven to

[02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:22.280]  All right. U.S. Army medic Sean Nimai is continuing with us. We're about to wrap this up. Sean,
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:31.400]  I want to say that on behalf of all Americans, I'm ashamed at the way that the U.S. government
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:37.400]  treats its soldiers in so many cases. Just the Veterans Administration treatment that soldiers
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:43.800]  are given. But this thing, the way they treated you, is an embarrassment. And I want to wish you
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:51.000]  well in your civilian life, and ask if you have any final words you'd like to add to this interview.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:55:00.200]  Like I was saying before the break, any soldiers, current soldiers, or any other service members,
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:06.680]  the regulations are a little different for Air Force Navy Marines. But anybody that has questions,
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:16.920]  feel free to ask me. I put out the blog address. I have links to my YouTube page and Facebook
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:25.000]  account also on there. Feel free to ask. I can help guide you through the very, very ridiculously
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:31.640]  difficult path of trying to get a religious exemption. For soldiers, service members that
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:40.040]  are thinking about joining, I would say don't wait till you get to your unit. Try to get your
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:45.960]  exemption with your recruiter. It's a lot easier to get an exemption before you go in than after
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:52.680]  you get there. Well said. And the web address is VaccineBattles.wordpress.com. Sean Nimai,
[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:55.480]  thank you for joining us today. It's been a pleasure talking with you.
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:58.600]  Thank you, Mike. Have a good day. All right, you too. Take care. By the way,
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:03.240]  we have an article about that situation. It should go up tomorrow morning on naturalnews.com
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:08.600]  with some more details about Sean's situation. We've been investigating that for roughly a week
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:18.520]  or so. Bottom line here is some of what we've gone over today. The nation has a sacred responsibility
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:24.680]  to treat its soldiers with respect and dignity. And that is absolutely not happening. That was
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:29.960]  just one example that we saw with Sean there. The truth is these experimental vaccines, which are so
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:36.600]  often based on complete medical quackery and fraud, these vaccines are sold from the drug
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:41.560]  companies to the government with these under the table deals, these secret deals with kickbacks
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:47.480]  and bribes and all these kinds of incentives to the decision makers. And then they're dumped
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:54.840]  essentially onto the troops. The troops are treated as a biological vaccine disposal system.
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:59.320]  So that the vaccine companies can just make more money selling a vaccine. They don't even have
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:04.440]  any proof that it works or that it's safe. They don't even include documentation of any kind
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:10.280]  whatsoever. There's virtually no testing done for long-term safety and efficacy of these vaccines
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:15.880]  across the vaccine industry. You're looking at runaway total criminality and fraud throughout
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:21.160]  the vaccine industry. And unfortunately, that spills over into the military. Speaking of the
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:27.960]  military, by the way, check this out. $9.2 billion was spent in just four days according to a business
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:34.200]  insider.com article. That's up from $4 billion the week before. And $6 billion of that was used
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:40.280]  to pay 11 commercial shipping companies to ship Department of Defense stuff around the planet.
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:46.840]  So there go your taxpayer dollars and check this out. Hey, there's $146 million of money
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:54.680]  that was sent to the Boeing company for foreign arms deals. This is to provide weapons to nations
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:58:01.480]  like the Republic of Korea and then Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, India. Shouldn't the customers
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:07.960]  buy their own military gear? Why do taxpayers have to pay to build missiles to ship over to
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:13.480]  North Korea for their defense? Shouldn't they buy their own stuff? I mean, come on. This is crazy.
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:17.720]  Anyway, thanks for joining me today. It's been great being with you on the show here on the Alex
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:24.200]  Jones show. I want to thank the crew for doing a great job. And I thank Sean, Nemi, and Nimae,
[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:29.880]  and John Rappaport for being with us today. Get informed, folks. Get informed and realize it's
[02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:35.160]  not just an info war. There's also a spiritual war going on. Get informed. We can win this thing
[02:58:35.160 --> 02:59:00.440]  together. Retransmission begins now. Join us on Nightly News. This is Mike Adams. Take care.
