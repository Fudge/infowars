[00:40.840 --> 00:49.160]  we are live we are broadcasting worldwide and we have a special guest a highly decorated military
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.560]  veteran who's also an artist and a second amendment activist joining us coming up in
[00:54.560 --> 01:02.560]  studio in the third hour to get the perspective of a veteran on the world today met Mario Lopez
[01:02.560 --> 01:09.520]  down in San Antonio at the open carry rally at the Alamo and he lost an arm most the flesh
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.360]  office face in an eye in an IED that's not we're having him on he's an amazing artist and and just
[01:15.360 --> 01:21.680]  his story of adversity and fighting through it is booing to my heart I think it will be to yours
[01:21.680 --> 01:30.720]  as well so that is coming up and he will be in studio with us today in the third hour with
[01:30.720 --> 01:37.320]  the balance of the transmission the first two hours we will be taking your phone calls covering
[01:37.320 --> 01:42.800]  the news man cal said his phone died the battery died we went to break and so he'll finish his
[01:42.800 --> 01:48.680]  story the real reason I got a mom is not the nine and a half million dollar buy-off plan to go to
[01:48.680 --> 01:55.600]  a pro-Obama radio show the real reason I wanted to have a mom was talking to a major Hollywood
[01:55.600 --> 02:02.560]  star who personally knew Obama and actually lived with him for years he was saying and so that's
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.920]  that's some real intel there and we want to get him back on to talk about that a little bit for
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.920]  about five ten minutes at the bottom of the hour to finish finish the rest of the story obviously
[02:13.920 --> 02:20.080]  it's just an overload of news we declared a semi victory yesterday when the Seattle police
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.560]  department that put in NSA spy boxes hooked into the federal government via the threat
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.120]  fusion centers we declared a semi victory that they had at least said okay we're gonna turn
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.280]  off these devices all the city council looks at it because the council never even authorized them
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.720]  to be turned on it was a grant last year of the systems being put in right now the city wanted
[02:39.720 --> 02:43.960]  to review it to find out what it's doing with violating privacy the police of course under
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.440]  homeland had it on that's what it's all about it's about the bureaucracy doing whatever it
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.840]  wants totally illegally just like the DEA is in all the NSA data systems spying on Americans
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.400]  without warrants than using it in court it's all completely illegal it's all completely
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.040]  selectively enforced it is the people that run this country that ship in the vast majority of
[03:07.040 --> 03:12.320]  the narcotics they're the same big banks that on the military industrial complex that on the big
[03:12.320 --> 03:18.200]  insurance complex that on the big pharma complex they push the legal and the illegal drugs on
[03:18.200 --> 03:24.840]  you and I would just advise young people never get on any of it including coffee because once
[03:24.840 --> 03:31.000]  you get addicted to something it's not fun I'm addicted to coffee I've battled tobacco my whole
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.720]  life haven't had any tobacco other than I think a couple cigars the last three and a half years
[03:35.720 --> 03:42.760]  and I'm always on and off pipes cigarettes chewing tobacco if it grows on a tobacco plant I want
[03:42.760 --> 03:51.680]  to put it in my body but the issue is that imagine this is the modern slavery they put out
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.840]  these chemicals they put out these plants that have always been there people been using forever
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.160]  that in the 20s and 30s you could buy at any drugstore you can send a five-year-old in to buy
[04:01.160 --> 04:07.840]  a box of cocaine or a box of opium a bottle of opium then they make it illegal it puts all this
[04:07.840 --> 04:13.280]  money into it it creates a huge crime culture corrupts the police well yeah when did they
[04:13.280 --> 04:24.760]  get rid of prohibition 1930s early 1930s when did they make all the other drugs illegal right
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.640]  then they needed a new business the only reason I'm concerned about getting rid of the drug war
[04:29.640 --> 04:36.960]  is that you've got such a criminal culture now that the criminals will go to other things we
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.400]  know this from countries that have decriminalized it's made crime drop massively except for a
[04:41.400 --> 04:46.800]  few things kidnapping and stuff but doesn't matter justice be done may the heavens fall
[04:46.800 --> 04:53.760]  big Obamacare news big military news big NSA news it's all coming up but I'll finish up with
[04:53.760 --> 05:02.160]  the fact that the police did not turn the Wi-Fi system off of course now Alex Jones here and I

[08:34.160 --> 08:42.320]  Jones we're gonna be here live for the next three hours president Obama is giving a press
[08:42.320 --> 08:53.040]  conference slash speech yet again selling the propaganda that is the Obamacare the scam care
[08:53.040 --> 09:03.040]  now going over the latest on Obamacare here today businesses cut full-time workers to meet
[09:03.040 --> 09:14.120]  Obamacare mandate study finds Christian science monitor oh really it was written to lower wages
[09:14.120 --> 09:22.720]  and incentivize part time because the globalist want a poor population that's a set agenda 21
[09:22.720 --> 09:31.840]  you in official policy is to make you poor and a renter let's continue can we I know you've heard
[09:31.840 --> 09:37.440]  this a thousand times here but now it's happening in mass public college sites high costs of Obamacare
[09:37.440 --> 09:47.440]  in canceling students health plans it goes on and on and now Obama is out giving a speech here
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.800]  here here let's hear some of the latest lies that he's reading off of a teleprompter help you
[09:53.800 --> 09:59.720]  bring down the cost oh so if you received one of these letters I'd encourage you to take a look at
[09:59.720 --> 10:04.920]  the marketplace even if the website is working as smoothly as it should be for everybody yet
[10:04.920 --> 10:10.040]  as smoothly as a person told us you browse costs for new plans where you intentional
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.560]  comedy working just fine oh it's working just fine won't solve go to one of our navigators
[10:15.560 --> 10:22.880]  and rolling the Democratic Party and a lot of people doing more will require work with Congress
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.000]  and I've said from the beginning I'm willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to fix
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.400]  problems as they arise this is an example of what I was talking about we can always make
[10:32.400 --> 10:41.360]  this law work better it is important to understand though that the old individual market was not
[10:41.360 --> 10:48.160]  working well and it's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going
[10:48.160 --> 10:54.520]  back to too often it works fine as long as you stay healthy doesn't work well when you're sick
[10:54.520 --> 11:01.720]  all right let's go back to it in a minute ladies and gentlemen we had the lowest cost on record
[11:01.720 --> 11:08.800]  highest quality health care in the world 50 years ago on record that's on record all the royalty of
[11:08.800 --> 11:15.960]  the planet Saudi Arabia and British Dutch Japanese they all came here lowest cost highest quality
[11:15.960 --> 11:25.080]  let me say that again lowest cost highest quality quickest delivery lowest cost highest quality quickest
[11:25.080 --> 11:34.040]  delivery on record government got involved with select mega corporations and big banks that got
[11:34.040 --> 11:40.360]  into the insurance business and wrote regulations and set things into the markets to control and
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.360]  monopolize the markets and to then introduce government money into the markets Medicare
[11:45.360 --> 11:52.360]  Medicaid and other systems that now drove up the price just like education we had the highest
[11:52.360 --> 11:58.640]  quality education in the world on average one of the highest college graduation rates the highest
[11:58.640 --> 12:12.160]  physical IQs the most inventions until the 70s okay America was the longest lived on average
[12:12.160 --> 12:18.480]  America was the biggest savers on average we were the most wealthy on average we were 4% out of
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.960]  100 of the world population and we had half the wealth we've lost almost all of that now
[12:23.960 --> 12:32.320]  globalism is a curse globalism is insider groups robbing everyone so they wreck the old system
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.840]  and then give you something 10 times worse it's probably 20 times worse and then they're going
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.520]  to as I told you write new laws to make it even worse and worse and worse and worse and worse
[12:43.520 --> 12:51.120]  and by then Obama the puppet will be long gone and you'll be under globalist fascist death care
[12:52.960 --> 12:57.600]  let's go back and hear what this literal foreign agent
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.960]  here to sell the trendy TV watching public hey he's got a neat suit he's a Harvard lawyer
[13:04.960 --> 13:11.200]  you know he he's half black this must mean there's a difference no the same mega banks the same
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.200]  old evil white men are the ones running things who've got everybody black and white at the ground
[13:17.200 --> 13:23.680]  level fighting with each other and it's the ultimate joke to them to put up Obama and it's
[13:23.680 --> 13:30.320]  been a devastating victory he has been incredibly successful he has been the most successful tyrant
[13:30.320 --> 13:36.480]  of the 20th century the 21st century or other tyrants were very successful in the 20th
[13:36.480 --> 13:43.680]  he is undoubtedly Obama I'm giving him this title now is the most successful tyrant liar
[13:43.680 --> 13:52.480]  con artist fraudster fake idea Madison Avenue manufactured propaganda coup d'etat that that
[13:52.480 --> 14:00.560]  has been around in the 13 almost 14 years that is the 21st century let's go back to the pure
[14:00.560 --> 14:08.400]  manifestation of an actor reading off a teleprompter selling you total betrayal here is the con
[14:08.400 --> 14:15.280]  artist in chief and you know regardless of what congress does ultimately I'm the president
[14:15.280 --> 14:21.040]  of the United States and they expect me to do something about it so in terms of how I intend
[14:21.040 --> 14:27.600]  to approach it I'm just going to keep on working as hard as I can around the priorities that
[14:27.600 --> 14:32.640]  the American people care about and I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win
[14:32.640 --> 14:40.160]  back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues
[14:40.160 --> 14:50.960]  in general and you know that's on me I mean that we fumbled the rollout on this health care told you
[14:50.960 --> 14:56.640]  folks there are a whole bunch of things about it that are working really well oh which people didn't
[14:56.640 --> 15:02.480]  notice like saying brain cancer is working really well because they weren't controversial so making
[15:02.480 --> 15:07.840]  sure kids could stay on their parents plans till they're up through the age of the parents get
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.280]  thrown off the plan you lie in fact right this counts on the prescription drugs there were a
[15:11.280 --> 15:17.200]  whole bunch of stuff that we did well over the first three years but we always knew that these
[15:17.200 --> 15:23.840]  marketplaces creating a place where people can shop that's enough and through they always knew
[15:23.840 --> 15:30.160]  that it basically increased the price the last three years by around 50 before it even kicked
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.640]  in it got rid of the laws blocking insurance companies from stopping competition
[15:34.640 --> 15:42.560]  and now it's ended a bunch of competition it's made 50 million people not 35 million
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.840]  go out and get insurance it's going to kick another 52 million off of it and it is the greatest
[15:47.840 --> 15:54.160]  criminal transfer of wealth I've ever seen not even do a government but to these big banks
[15:57.840 --> 16:02.560]  and you have to understand folks we've got to get out of the system to not have things collapse
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.920]  it's designed to collapse in a in a stepping fashion and I told you first civilians would
[16:07.920 --> 16:15.440]  fall on her sword when this came out then obama would fall on his sword and say it's my fault
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.440]  the buck stops with me because it came out even in the associated press two weeks ago
[16:19.440 --> 16:26.560]  that guy searched this i want to show tv viewers insurance companies warn obama not to scale back
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.760]  obama care was the headline and they were actually in their big consortium lobbying group
[16:31.760 --> 16:38.640]  issuing a public statement saying listen buddy fall on that sword take the blame claim it's the
[16:38.640 --> 16:44.160]  computer not working because it because they need to blame the computer not working it's working
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.400]  folks it's designed to kick you off your plan it's designed to create a pool of people who they
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.600]  have your id to then make you get insurance at double triple quadruple or even above that some
[16:55.600 --> 17:02.080]  people are paying 700 percent more on average it's 200 percent more humanity in texas 400 and
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.960]  excuse me 539 increase on families with no pre-existing conditions doesn't cover pre-existing
[17:08.960 --> 17:15.440]  conditions this is a wish list of the most bloodthirsty vicious insurance companies the world
[17:15.440 --> 17:20.720]  has ever seen the ones that took over our health care and screwed it over and the poor average
[17:20.720 --> 17:26.320]  democrat goes man health care he's like half my paycheck or i can't get health care or this is
[17:26.320 --> 17:31.360]  a scam this is screwed up this and and and the government's like we got a plan just go along
[17:31.360 --> 17:35.120]  with this you're really going to love it and now you now it hits you like a freight train and they're
[17:35.120 --> 17:40.800]  going to this is how they do it folks because they've learned in psych warfare that if you
[17:40.800 --> 17:47.760]  create a process and just stall things people then become accepting of it this is their main
[17:47.760 --> 17:56.800]  philosophy their main system of doing this and i'm like a football coach that's been watching
[17:56.800 --> 18:01.680]  these people for 20 something years and knows all their plays and moves and the general public
[18:01.680 --> 18:09.680]  doesn't even know the game they don't even know it's a game and and that's why we're here folks
[18:09.680 --> 18:16.080]  is to tell you how the scams work because listen once you're aware of this stuff you would cry
[18:16.080 --> 18:20.720]  at how obvious it is if you're a new listener i know there's a thousand flavors of media and all
[18:20.720 --> 18:24.880]  this dis info out there and the rest of it folks there's a real globalist system they've carried

[19:24.000 --> 19:30.160]  technocracy hyper eugenics warfare plan adopted by hitler from the british that he planned to

[27:42.400 --> 27:47.040]  over and over again he said it stops with me i take the blame because he's been told listen
[27:47.040 --> 27:52.000]  we'll prop you up but we're gonna politically destroy you for now we'll rebuild you later
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.560]  you can be just like bill clinton and get a hundred million bucks of money saying it's for
[27:56.560 --> 28:02.320]  Haitian kids and keep all of it or you know your your five million dollar trips with private jets

[34:47.840 --> 34:57.680]  huge amnesty news huge news on so many fronts but i wanted to get eric mancal muller uh
[34:57.680 --> 35:04.720]  syndicated radio host fox host a hit show on history channel with his brother uh mark muller
[35:05.600 --> 35:10.320]  god guns and automobiles has other big tv shows in development you know we had him on
[35:10.320 --> 35:14.080]  yesterday i noticed on info wars dot com and on the youtube video that went up this morning
[35:14.080 --> 35:19.040]  a minority of commenters were like this guy didn't get offered nine and a half million dollars
[35:19.760 --> 35:23.760]  for a three-year contract for another radio show that's not even that much for three-year
[35:23.760 --> 35:29.440]  contract folks for those that don't know and uh you know they're the media obama's not trying to
[35:29.440 --> 35:34.800]  buy people off you know he didn't get an offer to go uh not bash the political system folks i've
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.160]  gotten those offers it's all over the news they're buying off the media through corporate conduits
[35:40.160 --> 35:45.440]  and mancal has made that type of money i happen to know he didn't like to brag in a year in the past
[35:45.440 --> 35:52.400]  when his when when talk radio wasn't collapsing you know back in years like 1998 years like that
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.440]  during the tech boom i know what went on in radio back then folks i know all about it because i've
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.440]  been in it for 18 years and i work with a small network that doesn't censor me so i'm paid basically
[36:03.440 --> 36:08.240]  nothing by the gc and radio network i want to point this out here give me some inside baseball
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.400]  that's why i have my own advertisement my own product that's how i funded this whole media
[36:12.400 --> 36:19.040]  operation nobody else does it the way i do it i invented this to be able to get the word out
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.960]  by trial and error but that's a side issue i want to point out that it took a lot for him to come on
[36:22.960 --> 36:29.040]  here and talk about that yesterday and and that he had a lot of courage that's why we got him on
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.120]  because he told me about it and i said you have the will to tell that on air and he did tell that
[36:33.120 --> 36:37.600]  on air and then you've got fools out there that don't know that rush limbaugh makes 45 million a
[36:37.600 --> 36:43.440]  year that glenn meck profits and keeps over 100 million a year uh that people like michael sabbage
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.720]  make incredible amounts of money they just don't know so so instead of saying wow what a hero for
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.640]  saying no to all that money people say oh man cow's making that up well i'll tell you what he's not
[36:54.640 --> 36:58.560]  making up because this will all go on record right now and i know he's telling the truth because i've
[36:58.560 --> 37:04.160]  had those exact same offers harry linux and that's why i got him back on the show he's got to go so
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.720]  it's a brief interview man cow dot com you can follow him on twitter we'll put that up on screen
[37:08.720 --> 37:13.200]  for tv viewers and i'll give it out to radio listeners i'm a fan of harry linux just when i've
[37:13.200 --> 37:18.000]  seen him in movies and stuff he's a very good actor and it turns out he's basically the same age as
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.440]  obama and is will a good had been friends with obama and basically lived with obama is how he
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.080]  put it might as well have lived with him was the words he said to man cow he came on man cow show
[37:28.080 --> 37:35.280]  but he got a chance to talk to him off air and of course he's now the the hit actor on a blacklist
[37:36.160 --> 37:43.760]  but he joins us to to to break down this inside intel on on what he said behind the scenes about
[37:43.760 --> 37:50.000]  obama so man cow thank you so much for coming on with us today and and and repeat what you said on
[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  your radio show to me about harry linux we'll put harry linux up on screen for folks that may not
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.720]  recognize the name i'll go ahead alex alex look i do want to say msnbc and all of these people
[38:02.720 --> 38:09.120]  are dying your model is a brilliant model for the future um someday i want to come on and tell you
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.640]  the truth about glenn back i actually know the truth that nobody else knows it is uh it is somewhat
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.920]  heartbreaking when you reveal these things and uh and of course you're dealing with morons that
[38:19.920 --> 38:25.920]  don't know and they go no no no no no they want to they want to believe the matrix and i understand
[38:25.920 --> 38:30.640]  that they still want to believe the hope and change they want to believe obama care uh look i sold
[38:30.640 --> 38:36.320]  my condo and the politician today since in chicago i just couldn't handle the taxes the hassle
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.440]  it's such a hassle to to live in obama's down yeah they're doubling the property taxes even
[38:41.440 --> 38:47.280]  though property values down in chicago land yeah but but somebody said to me that a politician
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.040]  jack frank you can look up who he is i i think he's one of the good ones but he said to me
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.840]  because may account thank god you sold your condo because now every house and condo that sells
[38:56.880 --> 39:01.840]  five percent of every sale in america has to go to obama care and i said oh that's a joke

[43:18.160 --> 43:24.320]  told me this yesterday that they are friends and knew each other for years uh but uh that's right
[43:24.320 --> 43:31.680]  he says he's known him since 1992 spent many hours with him at his house talking for hours uh he's
[43:31.680 --> 43:38.320]  the only person that knows him better than him would be michelle obama unbelievable and he went on to
[43:38.320 --> 43:45.680]  say that he's a rat bastard and and amazing uh tell folks uh thanks for talking to us uh
[43:45.680 --> 43:50.880]  please put man cal back on thank you man so man cal this is at the end of the interview he's leaving

[43:54.880 --> 43:59.600]  get audited you and i you and i get attacked every year i get audited illegally every year
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.560]  they've never gotten one time and also you have to understand something harry linux has to work in
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.760]  hollywood um and i i i really love the guy and i hope i don't get in trouble by revealing this
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.320]  but he did say i know him probably only michelle knows him better than i do and he said he's very
[44:14.320 --> 44:19.680]  stupid he's been taught to act like this and i said here here's the thing that i want to
[44:22.960 --> 44:28.720]  to me this is the bomb bring up the cia stuff yeah yeah bring that up well i i cia brother i
[44:28.720 --> 44:33.120]  don't know cia no no no tell me what you told me but i mean get into the fact that you're saying
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.600]  he knew he would be president forever i mean repeat what you told me off air well you just told
[44:37.600 --> 44:45.520]  my thunder well go ahead and say it now look look i said i said how long did he know he was
[44:45.520 --> 44:51.520]  going to be president he said well he knew from 1998 and i said from childhood he goes i don't know
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.760]  i i said but definitely 98 he goes and maybe earlier now this is this is a man that hadn't
[44:57.760 --> 45:04.560]  done anything and and alex you and i talk about this do i have time are you going to talk about
[45:04.560 --> 45:11.840]  time do it okay folks you know i i understand people you know you hate george w bush but then
[45:11.840 --> 45:17.280]  the people that love obama and he does all the same stuff i i don't care if people hate obama or
[45:17.280 --> 45:24.320]  hate bushrate as long as they're intellectually honest this party first nazi attitude you know
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.000]  well yeah they're rounded up my neighbors i love but i'm paid i'm part of the party
[45:28.880 --> 45:33.440]  this party first had to frightens me i just want people you can hate me you can hate alex you can
[45:33.440 --> 45:37.920]  love obama you can hate the bush you can hate whatever but i just want you to to be honest with
[45:37.920 --> 45:43.040]  yourself have you known anyone i think of my friend russie umphrey's who's dad was killed
[45:44.080 --> 45:50.240]  in vietnam is a couple of little you know blurry pictures anyone in your family any anybody
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.320]  you've ever known that went to vietnam they had a couple i mean think of what the technology was
[45:54.320 --> 46:00.640]  and yet john carrey had film crews john carrey was a nobody john carrey has color footage of him
[46:00.640 --> 46:09.680]  fighting in vietnam the boy from ho barkinsaw from a divorce family a nobody bill clinton has
[46:09.680 --> 46:17.840]  pictures as a child of him hanging out with jfk Dwight d isonhower's granddaughter told me
[46:17.840 --> 46:24.320]  that these people know from birth i think of the boys from brazil that that that will move
[46:24.320 --> 46:31.280]  people whatever i just wonder are i mean it really obama knew in 98 he was going to be
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.640]  president who are you alex you claim to know i i you know you've been right on so much
[46:37.360 --> 46:45.120]  i don't i don't have any clue 100 bill clinton was a cia project he is the son of the former
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.800]  governor uh the rockefeller governor his mother was a lady of the night they decided to have the
[46:50.800 --> 46:55.200]  baby that's why he's broken down and cried on tv and said there were only two people that
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.520]  thought he could be president in 1962 when he met kennedy and that was his mama and david
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.320]  rockefeller thank you david rockefeller and he broke down and cried because the rockefellers took
[47:06.320 --> 47:10.480]  care of him because he was an illegitimate child of the family he was then put into a cia program
[47:10.480 --> 47:17.760]  in high school he then became one of the head cia people by the late 60s under the cia section chief
[47:17.760 --> 47:24.320]  we have the names with hillary uh in england and then he was sent to russia as a deep cover spy
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.320]  he's been cia since high school at least same thing with obama his mother his grandfather
[47:30.320 --> 47:36.320]  his mother that's all been partially declassified yeah i mean i know it it is amazing that bill
[47:36.320 --> 47:42.480]  clinton was hanging out in russia when he was uh but but anyway look alex i i don't know i i look
[47:42.480 --> 47:49.120]  i don't know who is who's picking these people but it does seem scripted it does seem like i mean
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.880]  look everything that bush did and you can play all the audio everything that bush kid obama's doing
[47:54.880 --> 48:00.400]  so no matter how we vote we get more of them and i mean the government i mean look at my senior
[48:00.400 --> 48:08.320]  center cell out of the cia look at uh look at bush jr clearly was in the cia earlier and and and
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.880]  all of this is how they put in just like foreign governments used to try to bring people into a
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.800]  country get them to run for president or prime minister later to infiltrate that's why we have
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.360]  rules against foreign born being president here like sports and anger it's the same thing but this
[48:21.360 --> 48:29.200]  is a corporate long-term strategic takeover plan a brother i look you know like everything else you
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.960]  say i hope it's not true uh i kind of i hope i i mean i'd like to think that any child can be born
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.640]  an american and if he does it right he can be president i don't know sure but let me ask you this
[48:40.640 --> 48:51.040]  yeah linux rising actor top actor on tv movies great actor why do you think he started uh
[48:51.040 --> 48:58.640]  uh off air talking so much trash about obama well i you know what alex the show is over
[48:59.440 --> 49:05.120]  uh i don't know that i i didn't know the man and i i want to tell you he's one of the finest human
[49:05.120 --> 49:12.400]  beings i've ever met in my life uh i i i don't know that he wouldn't have talked about it on
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.600]  air and i hope i'm not violating a confidence but look this guy walked out and said it in front
[49:17.600 --> 49:22.560]  of my whole staff hey hey hey i would have said this is off record exactly he should have said
[49:22.560 --> 49:29.040]  that so it's on record well and and look i i have you know my show is broadcast on tv in chicago
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.240]  tv cameras in the studio yeah i had i you know we're the fox studios in chicago right on michigan
[49:34.240 --> 49:40.720]  avenue i mean i had i had camera people producers um four or five people we stood around and we
[49:40.720 --> 49:45.200]  listened to them i i don't think i'm violating the confidence i hope i don't hurt the man i think the
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.240]  blacklist is too great i don't like uh you like you i don't like any of this mainstream tv i happen
[49:50.240 --> 49:55.280]  to like uh the blacklist a great deal i don't want to hurt the man but uh he did say it he did
[49:55.280 --> 50:01.600]  and if you want if you watch the guy it's funny i mean he is obama and he says obama's a nothing
[50:01.600 --> 50:07.680]  alex i told i spent time with obama i spent time with obama before he was anybody and and there's
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.800]  nothing there look i i could explain to everybody who obama is it if you give me 30 seconds i'll
[50:12.800 --> 50:20.880]  explain it do it okay i dated a girl that was severely abused by several stepdats she was molested
[50:20.880 --> 50:28.880]  she was abandoned and she was whatever you wanted her to be okay and and and what i mean by that is
[50:28.880 --> 50:34.160]  it's a defense mechanism i think obama probably had a miserable childhood and he's a nothing
[50:34.880 --> 50:39.600]  there was no father there was the mother that abandoned him she she was chasing after
[50:39.600 --> 50:45.600]  her you know so much has been hidden about her but she was it wouldn't have been too hard to
[50:45.600 --> 50:51.920]  sleep with her no no no his mother was in porn so so she you know she was he was dumped off in

[54:28.320 --> 54:34.640]  screen for tv viewers uh here in a moment but he was getting into harry linux who's a big actor
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.600]  we looked it up on record been friends with obama for 15 years or so or longer
[54:40.320 --> 54:46.640]  and he told mancal and i mean mancal in your words a folks can follow you at mancal muller uh
[54:46.640 --> 54:52.080]  on twitter zett and in front of your whole tv crew there at the fox studios in chicago
[54:52.080 --> 54:57.440]  she also a tv show there folks that just tuned in and of course you also are a contribute to
[54:57.440 --> 55:02.320]  fox national he told you in front of all these people that he's horrible i basically you know
[55:02.320 --> 55:08.400]  lived with him he shadowed me i mean this shows that they hired an actor to to literally try to
[55:08.400 --> 55:14.480]  train him up i guess for the senate seat and in at the state level and then the federal level
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.200]  and he did just come out of nowhere this is bombshell news but i don't expect them to even pick
[55:19.200 --> 55:23.440]  this up because the establishment obviously doesn't want this info out but but but recap
[55:23.440 --> 55:28.960]  anything else that linux said and finish your point well look um because i don't know where to
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.320]  begin alex uh he said that obama shadowed him that he couldn't shake him it was kind of like a
[55:34.320 --> 55:39.120]  booger on your finger uh it's kind of the feeling i got that he couldn't shake him and that there's
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.200]  nothing there and that's the point i wanted to make about abused children that that you know in
[55:43.200 --> 55:49.280]  order to protect themselves they want to make everybody happy so as i said talking to obama you
[55:49.280 --> 55:53.600]  know he was christian with me he was muslim with the next person that came over and talked to him
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.720]  and uh he's whatever you want him to be but there's nothing there and that's basically
[55:58.720 --> 56:02.880]  what linux was saying there's nothing there he's he's that he's just a he's an empty vessel he's
[56:02.880 --> 56:10.240]  whatever you want him to be and uh perfect to be manipulated a perfect puppet you know uh i i i
[56:10.240 --> 56:15.360]  thought about um when brian henson was in my studio and kermit was sitting there and it was just a
[56:15.360 --> 56:21.360]  green a green glob but it came to life once his hand was there you know once the hand uh was
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.120]  manipulating and that's kind of obama he's he's just kind of there's nothing there it's dead
[56:26.320 --> 56:32.000]  uh until uh his backers his controllers uh what the what's what you know what he needs to say on
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.120]  the teleprompter uh there's nothing there i mean he's very stupid i i talked with him alex you know
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.240]  that i spent time with him before he was anybody i knew more about the church that abomination of
[56:42.240 --> 56:48.560]  a church before i knew about obama but but linux uh is a brilliant actor uh i i and and if you watch
[56:48.560 --> 56:56.560]  him that's what obama's supposed to hack alike to take charge leader and it's weird because when
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.240]  you watch linux i thought he was copying obama and superman and and in tv shows and stuff and i
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.280]  guess that's why linux is irritated because he's seeing he trained obama and now he sees him up
[57:07.280 --> 57:12.320]  there destroying the country playing the part of harry linux this is huge man cal thank you so much
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.080]  for the time in your career hey hey alex yes sir i i i want to say this i really believe that linux
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.960]  is one of the finest people i've ever met i think that uh he probably wasn't aware of of how this
[57:22.960 --> 57:29.360]  would go with obama uh he did know back in 98 that that you know that obama was telling him he was
[57:29.360 --> 57:34.400]  going to be president i don't think harry believed that and i do think that harry linux loves this
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.360]  country so i i i really do believe that yeah and i think for harry's own safety it's good this is
[57:39.360 --> 57:43.360]  out now and contact linux hey help us get him on man cal we'll have him on with you so i think we
[57:43.360 --> 57:48.320]  should flesh this out now this is a big deal thank you very much man cal see you all right there goes

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:29.360]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.440]  all right here's the deal i'm gonna crystallize for you in fact guys i meant to ask you in the
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:42.960]  break we print me a transcript of that abomination uh let obama just put out his whole 30 minute
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.080]  regurgitation of old lies because for the nightly news tonight but also on the radio show today
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.880]  we have all the clips of him saying you keep your plan under this legislation obama care period
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.600]  and then he said i never said that and then he said okay i did say it i'm sorry and the today's
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.720]  like well it's not working as well as it should but it's working pretty darn great but by the way
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.800]  i'm gonna let you have your old plans now this is exactly what they did with the whole banker
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:18.480]  bailout bill in 2008 and the subsequent bank regulations and all the housing market changes
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.440]  were okay we'll let you keep your house now if you sign this new agreement which even waived
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.640]  more of your rights and then they take your house like we're gonna let you as soon as obama got in
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:34.320]  in 2009 i'm gonna let you keep that house now and then you just pay six months more and then they
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.760]  screw you out of that money they just came in with a deal to let you get deeper into the mortgage
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:45.360]  and that's exactly what this was i was just watching cnn and they were saying obama's gonna
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:52.080]  get a big boost out of this turning defeat into victory snatching uh you know victory from the
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:02:00.080]  jaws of defeat this is a great plan you're gonna let you keep your plan he's gonna fix it and and
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.280]  all they're doing is stalling it and of course larry summers said this yesterday the architect of
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.480]  the derivative scam the chief scam artist living uh i mean if you want to say somebody's captaining
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.720]  the ship of scam it's him here's summers but if you look at the medium run in the long run the
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.560]  important thing that's happened for growth is that in the last three years since obama care was passed
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.320]  we have bent the curve on health care costs for the first time uh since the second world war
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:35.840]  hilarious care as a share of gdp has uh stopped going up and that offers huge promise with respect
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.480]  to the future of the federal deficit which looks much more serious much less serious than it did
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.400]  even a couple of years ago it means much less burdens on businesses which means more competitive
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:54.640]  american producers it means the ability to pass on higher wages to american workers so let's keep
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:01.520]  some perspective here we have had an outcome with respect to health care costs that is well
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.600]  beyond what anything the average health care cost has doubled and that's on record you lying piece
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:13.920]  of trash i mean i just but you gotta understand people watch cnn and msnbc when that snaggle
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:21.520]  tooth lizard gets up there and he could literally sit there in the backyard with labrador retriever
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:27.360]  droppings and put it in white bread and tell people it was a chocolate sandwich and i'm telling you
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.640]  his supporters would shove it in their mouth and eat it i mean i hate to talk like that but
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.240]  these people literally are telling us to eat you know what oh i just can't handle it anymore this
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:44.640]  job man i need a vacation i tell you the fact that i have to focus on these scumbags all day i got
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.080]  to do it though we've got to stop them i know people are in denial or they uh it's like you're
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.440]  sick of looking at these people and i get it it's funner to go learn about male soap operas like
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.120]  football and you know have all your guys you got crushes on and everything and a giant latent
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:04.880]  homosexual country but you know the whole issue here nothing against that guys you like it i understand
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:10.400]  and watch the quarterback get down there by the center and everything and rub on his rumpus and
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:17.600]  everything i'm gonna stop right there i'm sorry i just a little bit of humor i apologize i apologize
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:25.120]  i'm gonna stop right there it's gallows humor it's sarcasm ladies and gentlemen uh to a point
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.720]  but you know all real funny humor has a large kernel of truth at the heart of it uh but uh
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.800]  we're gonna go to break it i'm gonna reset and try to get focused just looking at larry summer
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:44.480]  is in his total bs mobile uh is something hard for me to deal with and uh oh bozo again is now
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.880]  promising that he's gonna fix the plan what's i told you now all his idiot supporters will just be
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:55.440]  roped up again until the country totally implodes follow the big insurance companies isolate everyone

[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:42.160]  issues with him coming up but we're going to have open phones right now and cover the news what's
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:48.320]  your response to the frontman in chief the fraudster in chief up there for 30 minutes saying okay now
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.720]  they're going to let you keep your existing plan that 10 plus million people have been kicked off
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.400]  of mclatch he says it'll be 52 million that are kicked off total and then there's no move to do that
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.480]  you're just going to call it your existing plan but then increase the plan so this is the scam of
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:12.640]  scams going on and meanwhile the bigger scam is that they're kicking off more than 40 million
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:19.200]  people are being cut to part-time wages because obama care was written by big business to lower
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.720]  wages of the average american yeah that's why they're going to raise the minimum wage again but
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.040]  you're going to only get half as much work and then they're going to tell you supplementary
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.880]  go on welfare so that is the basic basic plan on that front and if you go over the transcript
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.840]  of his speech i know i've watched clips of it um it's basically reissuing the same line now
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.240]  he's already gone through you can keep your plan under this bill period then he said i never said
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.880]  that and he said okay i'm sorry that the plan isn't perfect but it's working pretty good now he said
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:57.120]  that again but said now we're going to work on letting you keep your old plan but you've already
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.040]  been kicked off of it and they're just going to kick you off and you're going to say that's not true
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.400]  and see how do i know this well i've watched it so many times in other countries in here
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:11.120]  2009 they had these assistance acts passed and stimulus acts and a bunch of other stuff passed to
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.520]  have homeowners not kicked out of their houses but all it would do was basically increase your
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.400]  mortgage and then if you ever missed one payment you waive all your rights and instantly lose your
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.720]  house so it it let the banks get a little more money out of you and then take the house cleaner
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:33.200]  later and waive your rights because they had you in fraudulent uh mortgages and it sold them so so
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.760]  oh i got a deal for you you're going to be able to keep your house the deal is i waive my rights
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.280]  and you're allowed to screw me and then i lose my house but by the millions people toddled in and
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.160]  signed the agreements and then lost their houses anyways and more money it's the art of betrayal
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.000]  this is how con artists operate this is how i've been saying this for several months how the
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.360]  nigerian emails work they get 5000 promising 15 million then oh my gosh prince of booby needs
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.760]  another 10 000 and then he will call you and you will get the 15 million
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.480]  we're sorry prince of booby has been detained and arrested he needs 20 000 to get out of jail
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.640]  and he will give you 50 million then you never hear from prince of booby again
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.120]  now ted cruz and anculture have now picked up my exact analogy which is great that's what everybody
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  does all of them glenn beck you name it i like that that's the real power of the show is not even the
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:34.560]  15 million we reach a week or the millions a day with info wars dot com it is that we speak
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.000]  common sense and now we're actually creating a common sense talking point for folks to understand
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:49.200]  so the toll free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 first time callers your take on obama's speech
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.200]  do you believe him this time if you do i've got some oceanfront property in arizona and from
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:02.320]  my front porch you can see the sea and of course if you'll buy that i'll throw the golden gate in
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:09.440]  free and if you buy that i wrote that song not george straight i'm being sarcastic he george
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:15.040]  straight at least no sing it the point is i think i was in like high school on that song came out
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.880]  that's a joke folks i'm not saying i wrote that i'm acting like you know the absurdity of i've got
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:24.240]  some oceanfront property in arizona and from my front porch you can see the sea and if you'll
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:32.080]  buy that i'll throw the golden gate in free because i don't love you now if you'll buy that this is the
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:41.840]  entire art of betrayal over and over and over again as everybody's isolated everybody that's
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.360]  why they don't want families they don't want men and women together they want listen women are just
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.840]  as smart as men are smarter they have triple the connections between left and right hemisphere
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.200]  hitler said first you get the women and you've got the children so fall the men 83 percent last
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.680]  time i checked of purchases are decided on by women and so most the propaganda targets women
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:10.720]  and women on average are more emotional and so the whole system says women you're in charge now
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:16.720]  your man's the problem you get him in line will run society safe that's what house slaves were in
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.680]  rome and then in other civilizations were the women because you could they found slave masters
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:27.440]  going back thousands of years in babel on egypt you name it and then rome women made better
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:34.880]  administrators under a government over men and that's what all this is you get women in you say
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.760]  we're doing this to be reasonable we're doing this to be friendly in a in a in a and they will try to
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:47.440]  be compliant and try to work within the system and that works great in a village of a hundred people
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.840]  the men all come in you know from battle or whatever bleeding the women take care of them
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:57.440]  cook feed them send them back out as machines to go get the food and go kill the enemy for us
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:03.680]  but in a modern system we come back and we're with a programmed creature programmed with
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.480]  all these false ideas where the man's always weak the man's always bad the man gets home
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.880]  he's working two jobs you're working one job it's still he needs to clean gloria steinham said
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.800]  the kids don't even need to clean he needs to clean and if you make him dinner that's a lowly
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:25.200]  thing that way your family's broke up the state's your man he's your pimp and then you create kids
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.720]  it'll be warriors and workers from the state you're now a drone the woman's a drone the man's a drone
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:36.800]  that's a modern feminism which they sell as it's for the women's cigarettes oh i better smoke those
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:45.440]  it's for the women don't ever have kids it's for the women and they sell the idea and then look
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:52.960]  how disempowered women are making less money than ever totals objects the society degenerating around
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.200]  us so that we're all isolated and now and of course the men are taught go look at guys four
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:06.480]  hours a day while your wife's upstairs go look at the other men all day in spandex grabbing each other
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:13.280]  with other men all day imagining looking at so-called warriors in simulated combat and
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:19.920]  then bragging to each other the strategy and how male you are because you figured out all the moves
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.320]  and all the plays and and you know what the coach is going to do you're supposed to be combat
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.720]  measuring the government you're supposed to be affecting the future battlescape you're supposed
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.200]  to be in combat in business you're supposed to be in combat raising your sons and daughters
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.120]  to be strong and honorable and not trusting corrupt people and and learning how to only work with those
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.560]  that are honorable and good you're supposed to be building a family name building a family empire
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.640]  aggressively defending each other aggressively having fieldy towards one another as a combat unit
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:57.840]  that this planet has been total war total death against big cats big bears lions tigers
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.640]  cobras rattlesnakes the elements starvation other tribes attacking and your tribe didn't get it
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.240]  together as a cohesive group you were gone and they've come in and just ruined everybody so that
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:18.080]  we're all just easy to roll over to the point of now they've taken the most aggressive freedom
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:23.600]  oriented wildcatting freebooting country the world's ever seen and turned us into the most
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:30.000]  dumbed-down slovenly lazy welfare junky fools with those of us still working holding the whole
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.680]  thing up with total warfare black against white hispanic against white old against young man
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.160]  against woman children with all the cartoons taught to be bad rebel against their parents
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.600]  don't discipline your kids so they're out of control this is what the bible talked about
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:52.000]  at every civilization that was collapsing it talked about that and we know first you get
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.400]  the women then you've got the children so follow them in the words of adolf a lois hitler look them
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:04.080]  up and joseph gerbils also paraphrased that it was the women in nazi germany that demanded
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.280]  in a kind of mutated spartan idea come home with your shields are on them
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.080]  and again that's normal for the woman to be demanding go out there and kill the enemy
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:22.480]  go out there and bring me a bunch of meat go out there i'm with these kids in the in the cave okay
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.200]  defending when you're away only women aren't wimps under this empowered natural human system
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.880]  they're empowered and see now we're isolated we're broken the globalist corporate system
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:43.440]  is rolling in moving in taking over the total destruction of the human family by design and
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.280]  now they're going to get rid of the healthcare they're going to get rid of the jobs everything
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:52.320]  is destroyed the male role model because once they've taken down the individual man there's no
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:59.680]  one to stand at the village and the women believe they're having victory against the men with the
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:06.400]  state they believe they're having a victory when they have an abortion they believe they're having
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.080]  a victory because they've imprinted on the state and then men have imprinted in a in a arrested
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:18.000]  development on going and staring at men's rear ends all day watching the nfl
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.360]  and then fantasizing that that's what men do and that that's what meant men are on growth
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.520]  hormone and steroids and run around running into each other on a field all day
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.320]  so it just totally takes all male instincts for three-dimensional chess and survival where to go
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.920]  hunt where to go how to prepare where to travel that army's too big we've got to flee we've got
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:49.760]  to move as nomads that there's no understanding none of it all of our development on this planet

[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.000]  let's go ahead uh george straight's from right around here from just north of san atonio got his
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.720]  star pretty much the broken spoke he won't play austin anymore i heard at least for a while because
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:45.520]  they're so smug and trendy they anyways let's go ahead and talk to uh matt in canada matt you're on
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:53.200]  the air then adam paul dean and justin uh so what do you think of uh lord gracious dear leader obama
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.440]  saying that he will give you will give you lower health care prices and that obama care is a great
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.440]  success what do you think about that new speech well i was just uh thinking about that uh not about
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.880]  football and obama actually but if uh nobody has health care and there's a wave of uh radiation
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.520]  sickness coming from bukasima i was just wondering if you thought there was any kind of correlation
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:21.840]  between those two things you know the globalists don't care uh that 91 of the 420 plus reactors
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.680]  are leaking now they just blow up and leak all the time no one's having an issue now they just turn
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:31.840]  the alarms off when they melt down or have partial meltdowns in the us now it's just a minor footnote
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.080]  so they've waved a magic wand and say radiation is good and unless our leaders are really blood
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.880]  drinking lizards uh that like radiation they're crazy and of course i don't think they're blood
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.000]  drinking lizards that like radiation so i just think it shows the nihilistic disconnect but
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.720]  yes obama care is meant so you can't get real health care and so you can water down the quality
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:56.000]  of care and then deny people health care it's all in the legislation uh it's a torpedo to the
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.120]  broad side of the country to lower the wages make us a part-time nation forces on welfare
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.160]  let the insurance companies lower the quality of care and force 50 million people to buy it
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:12.000]  and kick everybody off of it and make them double down so it and it's a private tax ruled by the
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.160]  supreme court to foreign banks that own the insurance companies i mean could you think of a
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.680]  better screw job well yes now they're moving towards in north america uh taking money out of
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:27.520]  your account yearly to give it directly to private banks in bail ins like cyprus so uh if you don't
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.960]  like that we can throw in uh guillotines for free maybe they'll start chopping our heads off and
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.360]  telling us that it's eternal life and obama can have a press conference about that and tell us
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:43.360]  that down is up and up is down and black is white and left is right and cable or elves are real how's
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:50.240]  that sound oh it sounds great i mean uh also with uh a lot not a lot of canadiens being awake um they
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:54.320]  don't even know what a bail in is let alone that they're planning to do this to us with well you're
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:59.040]  right your new budget does announce they're planning to take your bank account money and i mean why
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.840]  not have a yearly deal they mean it worked in cyprus america puts up with uh oscama care
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.120]  obamination care why not take canadian's bank accounts you don't like that we'll throw in a
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:19.040]  swat team for free you don't like it mad i appreciate your terrorist call i say give everything
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:25.440]  you got to the government terrorist let's talk to justin and georgia you're on the air go ahead
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:34.800]  go ahead yes um i know this is a little bit off topic of the health care issue and everything
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.920]  and probably not that important in the grand scheme of things but my uh question was about talk show
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:46.480]  host and i've noticed there's been a change in uh shon annity he's sounding a little bit more
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:56.320]  like alex jones and i've also listened occasionally to michael medved and do you know he is yeah he's
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:02.480]  a movie review guy as a tiny audience i know he is yeah but do you think this guy is look he he was
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:09.840]  so against ron paul he's trashed your show a lot and he he just seems like he might be working for
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.640]  oh there's no doubt there's no doubt medved's like a southern prairie law center type guy

[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.360]  i am going to go right back to your phone calls i hear just a moment and back in
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:43.760]  the huge nsa domestic spy grid breaking news huge news on the open borders front and a lot more
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:54.080]  today the toll-free number to join us on eras 800 259 92 31 but first off there's a lot of reasons
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:00.160]  that i created info wars life calm and came out with the first of many products but you
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.480]  notice we could have already rushed out a lot of products we haven't done that because quite
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.000]  frankly we go to laboratories that are the most established the most elite and where products
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  can cost 10 $15 a piece in some cases $20 stuff we're developing that i could buy for a dollar and
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:25.280]  a half from the big factory leading competitors bottled like like i could buy vitamin d for a
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:32.800]  dollar and a half bottled i'm buying it for $10 the most organic unbelievable off the chart types
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:39.680]  whatever i'm going to start taking whatever we've done research on new radically for years and
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.520]  since launching this the last two months we only have one product out that's because that was years
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.760]  of research and months of development and finding the very best and we've got five or six other
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:56.560]  products in the chain one is about to be produced it took us months to just get this particular
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:05.360]  ingredient from to bet and normal products like this would sell for $100 this product that's coming
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.520]  out it's going to sell for $35 just to give you an idea how much these ingredients are costing us
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.720]  in many cases it's half the cost most supplements folks have four or five times the markup and
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:22.080]  i'm not saying that's bad in a free market the point is is that it blows me away that a lot of
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:26.640]  the people that talk the most about how you know they've got such clean pure great stuff it's like
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.720]  literally two dollars a bottle three dollars a bottle not us folks we are neurotically researching
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:41.200]  like i've got a brand of coffee coming out i use coffee obviously love coffee found a type of
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.320]  coffee that i enjoyed the best that i've been drinking for 15 years we had the deal the contract
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.520]  they got scared because they're nationally distributed it comes from Chiapas which is basically
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:58.480]  like Guatemala but even better in south central Mexico it's my favorite coffee arabica they backed
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:05.360]  out it took me a year to find a connection to the exact same supply that only comes in once a year
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.800]  that's the type of coffee i'm putting out when it comes out in a couple weeks
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.880]  multi years in the works and when it's sold it's sold that's all we could get
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:22.560]  that talk about fair trade this is directly from the Chiapas rebels you're like well they're
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.360]  like commies why would you do that they're not even really commies folks just the only thing
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.880]  they know they're fighting the corrupt Mexican government whatever the point is they're actually
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:34.640]  free market the point is is that that's the type of stuff i bring you i'm like what is this coffee
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.840]  like 15 years ago my wife was drinking it she's my girlfriend it started drinking that coffee tried
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.480]  everything it's the best from my view we'll see if you like this coffee like i do it's not out yet
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:53.040]  the point is survival shield atomic nascent iodine i mean i was told by the medical doctor
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.680]  scientist nutritionist you need iodine the best is nascent i did research most the other brands
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.160]  are not really nascent just iodine stuck in alcohol there's some real nascent alcohol but it tends
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:10.880]  to break down we have it in the organic glycerin base that literally nobody else has and it is done
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:17.280]  with a proprietary system of sound waves and electricity that is is just unbelievable and
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.400]  ladies and gentlemen i want to just show you one thing it's not just protective thyroid
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:26.320]  increased radiation levels all the rest of stuff look at this harvard study i want to show folks on
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:32.400]  document cam with our tv viewers harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's iq and then
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:38.960]  it goes into its compounded lesions on the brain if you don't have iodine now even the garbage
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:45.760]  iodine the government put in the salt back in the 20s and 30s and 40s increased and there's a
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:51.600]  business insider article iq's 15 points a major study shows that's business insider
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.720]  but now they've removed it in the last 30 years and put halogens in in the water like hydrofluorosalic
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:06.720]  acid fluoride other forms of fluoride all the rest of the garbage that's why that's the biggest
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.440]  reason people are zombies for my research so what do we do we bring something to fund our media
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:17.440]  operation that i believe in that i've done the research on that i use that i've had dramatic
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:21.920]  brain effects with i mean there's no doubt this is not placebo plus the study show it the only
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:29.360]  problem is i'm i'm so crazed already that it's really it's hard being this sober and this awake
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:34.480]  it's like being on a drug just being awake and alive i take a vacation it's like i'm on a drug
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.760]  after getting a break you know what i mean it's like people take drugs and dumb themselves down
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:43.440]  i know why it's hard to be this conscious the point is we've got a bunch of it in now it probably
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.200]  won't sell out for a few weeks we're trying to get more right now but it's so proprietary they've
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:53.920]  got one calibrated machine uh that that that can make it in the country uh its survival shield nascent
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:39:00.160]  iodine from info warslife.com we have it right now you could order it it's we've caught up now on

[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:12.800]  okay so info or store.com okay that's a long plug we emit air refueling that's how we fund the whole
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:19.280]  media operation i don't get paid by the radio network ladies and gentlemen i get paid what i
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:28.560]  originally under contract got paid from genesis in 1997 i get paid two thousand dollars a month
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.360]  never changed the deal and because i have an advertising deal to have half the advertising
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.080]  and so that's what i get paid so technically i do get paid but i fund an operation that costs
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.400]  eight million dollars a year now to run eight million a year that that has the effect of
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:47.680]  operations that have billions thanks to the grace of god with your support selling high quality
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.880]  products and so that's the bottom line so there's my plug for the day police support our local
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.160]  AM and FM affiliates if you're a local business it is your duty to support the local sponsors

[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.920]  because we had we can beat them they're trying to shut us up support alternative media spread the
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:20.960]  word about it spread the word about our local stations like 1530 in chicago stations like
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:26.240]  that that is so essential ladies and gentlemen we have a chance to turn this around okay let's go

[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:39.280]  for holding hey alex this is the first time call for me by the show and what you do um my first
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:44.640]  question before i did just give you my take on obama care was my next-door neighbor he is actually
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:49.920]  a truck driver and he told me he's also a gun owner and he had mentioned something to me about
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.080]  two types of bullets coming out which one was aluminum and they could go through everything
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.880]  and then these plastic bullets that have microchips in them that they could track when you fired it
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:04.560]  where you fired it where you know it's like has all this information so if someone stole it from you
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:08.640]  you know if you had this you can get blamed for something you didn't even do have you ever heard
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:16.800]  of that yes they uh they call them safety slugs the air marshals use them because it won't shoot
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:23.280]  to the aircraft but but into somebody's body it absolutely what like like i've seen demonstrations
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:28.720]  have done it myself you should shoot wet phone books that simulate human flesh they've been
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.520]  soaked for a day in water and a normal bullet won't even shoot through it say from 357 magnum
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.560]  but you shoot these would say i think the name sure safety slugs you shoot it with a sure safety
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:45.600]  slug it just balloons it out and just puts all its energy in in the first few inches and just
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:52.960]  just splatters everything and they've got a lot of different versions they've got sabos or sabos
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:59.520]  depending on how you want to pronounce it they can have a different types of composite cores
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:06.080]  don't have to be metal aren't be steel or lead and then you've got a plastic jacket that accelerates
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:14.640]  it down the barrel of the gun chips and rfid chips i don't know anything about putting chips in guns
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:21.600]  to track people but they do chip a lot of weapon systems to track them and they do put a lot of
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.800]  secret chips on weapon systems internally so they can track them by satellite rfid
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.080]  okay my take on the obama care thing i mean fortunately i don't have to have that right
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:37.360]  now i got another year left on my alternative medical care which is basically the lesser of
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:42.480]  two evils but i'm hoping that this whole thing implodes with it because even though i try to
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.960]  warn people that i know like wait don't go on to this thing because it's not meant to work they're
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:52.160]  like oh well you know i'm just going to take my chances and you know if i'm wrong i'm wrong but
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.760]  they don't understand when you're wrong with something like this it's going to cost you
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.880]  exactly don't listen this out works obama care in 60 seconds they put the myth out it's free
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:05.600]  you go here you sign up you go there all of those is grab your data give it to the cia and nsa
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:10.560]  that's now mainstream niche and then it's conduit it off and then you get into a process now
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.600]  standing in line going well i've already been here so long what do i do what you vote for us again
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.480]  and we'll and you'll get your free health care someday and then meanwhile you just get your
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:28.400]  tax refund confiscated go ahead yeah well that's why i'm not i'm not too anxious to get on that
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.360]  myself and it's like i'm just thinking that why would anybody be stupid enough to actually take
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.440]  this when you clearly see even the mainstream media starting to cover this now that they're
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:42.080]  saying don't go on it it's fake you know i mean if all the problems that they're having i mean
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.040]  would this supposed to be such a high tech world that we supposed to have all of this technology
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.680]  they try to get us to believe that oh it's a computer glitch that's causing all this problem
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.920]  i mean let's wake up no they have to make it about the site being broken because the bill
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:02.080]  never gave anybody free health care it doubled tripled and quadrupled and beyond so again it's
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:07.360]  a bad we knew this would happen we know how their scams run god bless you great points uh let's talk
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:13.920]  to dean in california i hope you're not an extremist racist you better support obama care
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:21.040]  or you're a racist go ahead racist i'm a trendy and i just support it so much that's more like
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:27.280]  it talk like that go ahead i just can't believe you just don't accept obama class as just your
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.960]  your savior too you know obama cares about me that's why he wants me to take shots and
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:37.760]  wants 11 year olds to have abortions without mommy knowing i think that's reasonable i like him as
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.880]  in bc saying our children belong to the state i i like seven of those are supporting now say tongue
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.680]  who killed 85 million people i think all the new head start programs teaching kids that the state
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.600]  is god and two plus two equals five i think that's normal i think everything's fine oh that's
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.880]  that's awesome i think that's perfect too hollywood's all in on it and i'm behind them all i love all
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:04.320]  the anti-family messages on television i think it's for my own good they put the floor in the water
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:10.400]  because they care about me oh yeah i just thought you know alex i tell everybody about you i even
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.640]  have your i have a little sticker on my name badge it says info wars dot com so people can

[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:33.680]  three weeks it's awesome i have a pro q water filter love it i'm a subscriber i just think that
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:38.320]  we're just being undermined we've been undermined since at least woodrow wilson the adult signed
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.000]  us into this whole system and then he signed a letter admitting it was a globalist takeover and
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.760]  then they poisoned him yep you know at least you know i admire woodrow wilson he was an academic
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.800]  they conned he believed in globalism for freedom he found out it was a bad deal and he wrote a
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.880]  letter saying he was going to go public and they poisoned him that night on the train
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:04.960]  edward mandel house was involved unbelievable oh that guy edward mandel house that rock child
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:10.480]  operative was the beginning of the undoing of everything that we loved in our country and they
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:17.040]  pulled my gosh this is scary you know history oh my it's scary oh a lot of people say that
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.800]  they think you're showing off when you give them history no you're trying to inform them
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:25.200]  but the average trendy though they just want to just blissfully hop around with a big
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:30.640]  handlebar mustache and and socks that don't match and tattoos all over them and again i'm not against
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:36.080]  handlebar mustaches tattoos all over them but you'll see like some supermodel with some loser
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.920]  who doesn't even have a job because she thinks she's going to win because the tv said this is
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:44.480]  what's cool and of course she leaves him in a month and goes for another trendy she thinks someday
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:48.320]  if i get the right trendy i'll be successful and then they're like all scared you know women are
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.800]  like scared of like men that actually own companies and run things but that's how screwed up this
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:59.920]  society is anyways go ahead it's just like these new shows out nowadays like the the the one with
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.120]  all the the scientists on it uh that everybody watches i can't read the big bang theory or
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:11.040]  the i always say that if they ever wrote a real man into that show he'd steal every one of the girls
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:18.080]  on there well i mean i mean number one it listen you can see people trendies literally trying to
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.040]  live out television like it's real like because again like dogs humans are very similar to dogs
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:28.000]  we are social creatures we learn off social stuff but in a real pack you would emulate the real alpha
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.760]  that knows how to win but they create false alphas on television and then the males and the females
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:39.280]  all follow it and then wonder why they're such losers it's designed as a virus a psychological
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:46.240]  warfare virus to make you malfunction along with the vaccines you know and all that force
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.800]  trapped it's going to be forced on it it's going to just help them flow this even that much faster
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:56.480]  absolutely listen to folks we want to be successful see with power that's what you do run around the
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:59.440]  woods at night and get your tongue hanging out well they're right back ladies and gentlemen

[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:21.760]  i remember about 14 years ago seeing a kind of gone paper that was on the mit website
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:26.720]  where they were going to have drones that fly around and face scan you and then kill you if
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:33.040]  you're on the kill list in america but they also have them with tear gas and knockout gas this is a
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:39.360]  cbs pitchburg cmu facial recognition technology could be future of catching criminals how about
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.960]  we send these drones the white house and it goes on to say it's mounted in drones to fly around the
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.920]  city yeah and there in uh pitchburg actually uh we want to lawsuit against them if one of our
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:55.120]  reporters skirt roads was our lawyer is constitutional lawyer they arrested do with the mainstream
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:58.640]  media they go oh you're you're not mainstream but you're up on the hill videotaping us beat
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:03.680]  people we're gonna arrest you and they took them to a torture center where they strapped everyone
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.400]  out in the rain for about eight hours and then screamed and yelled at them and uh did other
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:12.400]  things i won't mention on air because people don't want these humiliating things hurt on air
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.400]  oh yeah sometimes you get abused and didn't happen to do it happen to others we know
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:27.040]  you don't want to talk about that's america so you need to understand what really goes on they
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.080]  had the army in there bunch of guys that probably run places like abu graib they had them at an army
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.560]  base that's what goes on in america they trained 24 seven to take us on while naming the veterans
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:43.360]  as the new terrorist by the way uh here it is obama claims enforcement discretion in his
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:50.000]  latest speech if you can call it that then the latest spillage of lies to make obama care changes
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.040]  that's the washington times and then um the weekly standard has howard dean saying quote i wonder if
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:00.720]  obama has the legal authority to do this no he doesn't but it's all a giant scam they're not
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.840]  gonna they'll they'll let a few people have their plan with the insurance company it's the lottery
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:12.080]  ticket phenomenon so folks believe that oh you can get your old plan back you understand how that
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:16.960]  works okay good remember we told you what would happen before it happened i'm trying to explain
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:24.560]  people we're not winging this we know exactly the enemy attack profile okay it's very very simple
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:30.320]  what's going on it'd be like a bunch of wasps were swarming around your front door and we said hey
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.600]  you might not want to go under those you want to kill those they might sting you and my mother was
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.400]  actually hornets once i already moved out i was like 19 i went over their house and with these big
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:46.640]  green yellow hornets right above the door in a hole above the door they'd gotten into the bricks and
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:51.360]  i said mom you got to kill those they're going to sting you hornets are really me when you're slamming
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.600]  the door those things just chased me in the other day when i came over to her visit she said i don't
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:01.200]  like to kill things alex they're mine and you're not going to kill them this is an exact quote
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:06.400]  my dad has a beehive he won't let me kill and i like bees man this is another house they have now
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.840]  and these stinking bees are out by their hot tub i won't even bring my kids over there at the time
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.800]  when those bees because they're aggressive they even had a bee scientist out from ut when i was
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.400]  demanded maybe killed a few years ago and he's like well these are actually an ancient middle
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.640]  eastern variety that someone brought over here and very rare they are aggressive but not africanized
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.800]  you can't kill them and we'll remove them if you want them my parents are out of town i'll go there
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.520]  and kill those things right now they just stung me a few months ago twice in one day rob do got
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:36.480]  stung by him he came over after we took the kids white water rafting we went over there to get
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:44.480]  the hot tub stinking bees attacked him anyways my mother my mother got stung right between the eyes
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:48.960]  by the hornet and couldn't see for a couple days when her eyes will shut needless to say my dad went
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:54.080]  and got that wasp ray that shoots 12 feet and they were dead he went to the store that day
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:59.440]  they went of course they don't sting my dad and my mother it's like the bees know who they are
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.920]  and you know what i told him when he left town they're out of town i think i'm gonna go over
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:09.280]  there today run over to the hive with like a can of flea bomb or something hit the button and
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:15.440]  cram it in the hole i don't like killing bugs either man but i have been attacked by these things
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:20.800]  for 15 years they've lived in that house i've probably been stung eight nine times rob do was
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:27.120]  attacked they were in his hair like in a cartoon they chased him and he and we're like and they live
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:32.880]  on four acres the middle of town it's a great place but i mean you know there's also a lamp

[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:37.200]  you said has come to fruition no not really because i wish i would have been proven wrong
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:41.520]  and and and now it's even worse than i thought it could be quite frankly and it just gets more
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:47.840]  crazy by the minute but i do feel good that people are finally understanding we're in trouble uh
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.960]  and so people need to realize though it's not just up to an alex jones or whoever else is out there
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:57.920]  it's up to all of us to to resist tyranny wherever we see it but thank you for your kind words brother
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:05.600]  but i'm just trying to survive here so please don't commend me i wanted to ask you another
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:10.560]  question if you had the time um what do you think is going to come down this hall what do you think
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:19.440]  is going to happen maybe before uh 2016 uh what do we have to look forward to well that depends
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:25.200]  on what we do to stop this we either totally discredit the system and stop complying with
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.240]  everything we can and just point out that it's an alien criminal globalist operation
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.560]  or they're going to be able to carry out their plans to shut off the economy
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:40.000]  to enslave us and collapse us under government and corporate control so we're under attack it is a war
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.400]  words cannot describe how big a war it is it's a silent sneaking cold war against freedom
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:52.160]  and uh it uses all our institutions against us the institutions themselves aren't even bad
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.200]  they're just commandeered we're like an army tank by itself is not bad it can be used by
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:04.720]  good people or bad people our government has been seized and then grown into a giant uh behemoth uh
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:09.600]  and and and and we deserve it though not not my listeners or myself so much but none of us are
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.720]  perfect but the culture got very decadent off with our forebears and the greatest generation
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:21.680]  you know the uh and and folks built for us and they were a great generation i don't think they
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.440]  were as great as the 1776ers and some of the other folks but you know they came back and
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:31.040]  demanded civil rights mainly mainly veterans white combat veterans came back particularly
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.440]  said we're not going to be part of this there was sagebrush rebellions all over the country
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:39.440]  and people said we're going to have freedom uh and kennedy said we're going to have freedom and
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:44.640]  they blew his head off so that's what it comes down to is there's corrupt elements that want to
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:49.760]  continue all this but uh if we don't stop them they're going to stage false flags bring in total

[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.280]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:18.720]  united states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of

[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:33.680]  to chime reflecting on my past life ladies and gentlemen out out brief candle is what
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:42.880]  william shakespeare wrote that's what life is like it goes by like dusk till dawn what matters is
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.560]  doing the right thing while you're alive on this planet and building a better world for future
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:53.520]  generations that is not even service that is fulfillment and it is in service to humanity
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:59.760]  and no service is perfect no no cause is perfect but in the final equation it's having a heart that
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:05.440]  tries to do the right thing that stands for justice is what in the final equation will be judged by
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:11.040]  the creator of the universe and your calls will come up at the bottom of the hour for those that
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:16.480]  are holding i've got some other news on the united states for surveillance grid you name it our guests
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.120]  will be riding shotgun with us throughout the hour we're going to talk about his story exclusively
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.200]  until the bottom of the hour but then he'll be with us for the rest of the hour and hopefully do
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:31.680]  an interview for expanded coverage on the info wars nightly news coming up at seven o'clock
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:38.800]  central tonight but i a few weeks ago two and a half weeks ago was down in san antonio for the
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:47.360]  open carry rally which under state law you can have rifles openly anywhere in public spaces
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:53.360]  in texas but the police chief said i'll arrest you if you do that so this is the real cutting
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.160]  edge of the civil rights human rights god given rights movement and so we went down there over
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:04.320]  a thousand people showed up with the open carry texas and other groups and i gave a speech with an
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:09.760]  m4 strapped on my back and we weren't sure even we went there whether they were gonna arrest us
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.560]  or not but they backed off the next day they started arresting people that legally had guns
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:20.480]  but now lawsuits have already been filed so so that's what all of this is really about
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:26.640]  and it was the first rally since the alamo happened in 1836 because it was a warehouse until
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:30.960]  the fifties when they made it a historical site and then there's never been a rally allowed there
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.640]  and it's fitting it was a second amendment rally because the alamo was about people
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:37.920]  coming to take the guns that's what started the texas revolution just like the revolution
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:42.640]  against king george uh the third started when they came to take the guns hollywood tries to
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.880]  make it a racial issue or all this other stuff no it was about guns that was the heart of it period
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:52.160]  at gunzolas they came to take the guns that's how it all started period that's the main that's
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.760]  like 80 of it not study the history big time that family involved on both sides of my family
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:02.320]  my mother and father's sides involved in that historical situation so i'm there
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:09.360]  and i talked to hundreds of people i was there but i was really touched by by speaking with
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:17.200]  and hearing the things uh that army veteran uh mario lopez uh had to say to me and he was a
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:23.280]  combat uh army a combat engineering unit in iraq and then afghanistan and the second term
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:30.640]  was in a ied explosion and then he gave me his card i went and looked at his paintings online
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:39.280]  and uh wow really an amazing artist and the work he's done is very touching and very poignant
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:44.160]  and also very archetypal and powerful at the same time especially the combat art the uh
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:49.120]  the art that gets into what soldiers go through soldiers that are wounded soldiers that are
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:53.360]  missing a piece of the puzzle uh as he basically paints it and then i talked about it and i said
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.960]  hey did you sell out when i talked about he said we'll sell out all the time anyways uh because
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:02.160]  it's such good art and i think it's really a testament to all that he's gone through so many
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.480]  people my dad you know would complain about stuff when he was a kid because they were upper
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.720]  middle class but they would send him to work with local farmers fields they would send him to go
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:15.760]  help carpenters when he was 10 years old because he wouldn't be lazy and he complained about it
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:22.240]  and he'd say hey i complained i had no shoes so i saw a man who had no feet and and and that's really
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.800]  what it's all about is that i see people that've gone through adversity and gone through great
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:32.480]  trials tribulations many times that it turns out have even discovered more of their humanity
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.360]  and are more thankful about life now that they've lost so much and i think it really is a decadent
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.320]  slob like entitlement in this country that is allowing this nation to collapse
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:52.880]  and so army veteran mario lopez joins us here in studio his website is paintings by mario lopez
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:13:00.320]  dot com he also has his christian ministry website how i know dot or g and i want to invite him back
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:06.240]  at least once a year on the show to see what he's doing with his art and it's good to have him here
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:10.720]  with us but we can click on that image of him before his injuries and then we'll uh you'll
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:16.800]  talk to him here in studio if you're a radio listener you can go to info wars dot com for
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:22.560]  its last show and actually see the interview here with us right now but mario it's so great
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:26.560]  to have you in studio and thank you for traveling up here from san Antonio with your lovely wife
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:31.200]  yes sir thank you it's nice to be here thank you you've got the floor you said you wanted to talk
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:35.680]  about your experience in afghanistan iraq first then get into your art and then talk about your
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:41.200]  ministry and and obviously you know what you've been through how it's changed you mentally not
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:48.320]  just physically yeah iraq was a good experience you know uh actually in iraq i learned about
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:56.720]  uh some of the some of the things um that the inconsistencies uh as far as uh 9 11 goes and
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:03.840]  whatnot and uh so it it helped me to to open my mind a little bit and uh came home for a year and
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:10.640]  a half went to afghanistan and uh we're scheduled to be there for 18 months but i was just there for
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:19.680]  four months and uh got hit with an id got pinned underneath got burned and um had a lot of miracles
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:27.680]  during that time um after my injury i just um said got aside and then said i said you know what like
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:34.240]  these doctors and psychologists and did a little fix me so but got aside and uh didn't work out too
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:44.720]  well for me um i had experienced some stuff in the supernatural and and uh then um i just
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:49.840]  told it was just PTSD it was just just a normal thing that soldiers go through and not to worry
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:57.120]  about it so i went about my life living the way i thought i saw fit and and uh then uh about a
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:06.000]  year and a half after after that experience um i got 108 fever and uh 105 fever you can you can um
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:13.920]  you can die or have brain damage i had 108 and uh crossed over again to the other side and then um
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:20.320]  had an angel help me and then um after that i uh i i woke up and i said all right mom my mom's a
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:27.680]  minister in uh san Diego texas uh and uh and uh i told all right mom you're right everything everything
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:35.760]  you've been telling my whole life is true and uh so i started during research of creation science
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:43.760]  and um then uh i just did a lot of research and then later on i met my wife which is uh which
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:51.440]  was an ex biology um high school teacher and she went to Stanford university and we met and uh we
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:57.360]  just debate for three months straight and uh and and uh i finally wanted to date you know and uh
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.280]  we're going to talk about that but i want to get back into your experience because i've talked to
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:05.360]  so many people and i've had non-personal experiences i'm not going to talk about those because the
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:11.520]  media would make a big issue out of it yeah but there is we see such a small spectrum of the
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:15.680]  universe science has proven that right there's all these dimensions all this other dark matter you
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:20.080]  name it but in every culture people that only believe in angels and god atheist you name it
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:25.600]  for thousands of years they have the same experience right and i've talked to so many people like uh
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:31.920]  colonel uh craig roberts and others who died for 10 minutes totally dead for five you know just
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:36.640]  brain dead and literally went up the angels guardian angels whole life the portal you're
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:41.920]  being sent back doctors couldn't believe it he's alive like 16 17 years later after that cancer
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:48.800]  it's about 20 years and uh he was a marine then army and then police officer swat team commander
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:53.920]  helicopter pilot survived all this stuff but so many other people they talk about that experience
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.760]  and and for folks that have never had these experiences i feel sorry for them you know they
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:03.760]  say that people that have died before or gotten very close that's that's that's actually almost
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:08.800]  a gift because you get a lot of enlightenment when that's happened yeah there's no atheists in
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:15.200]  foxhole you know well tell us about just people that don't know the face of real war tell us
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:20.880]  about the ied we're going to skip this network break uh the ied it was a 300 pound id so i'm
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:27.360]  told uh by the cid unit that that went out and uh and uh eod that went out and checked it out it
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:33.760]  was a 300 pound id they had a hard line um wired it and they buried the wire in sand and we just
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:43.200]  rolled right over it and uh when i got uh i got hit um i just uh saw gray everywhere i knocked out
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:50.320]  for a couple seconds and then i woke up and um i saw and smelled flames and uh and uh and i just
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:56.720]  looked up and and i was like all right lord i'm coming to meet you you know and uh i had nine
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.200]  two or three rounds trapped to my chest and uh two or three rounds for people that don't know
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:07.680]  what that is it's uh it's a um it's like a golf ball sized shotgun shell but it has a grenade on
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.480]  the end of it instead of a slug and i had nine of them they didn't go off and my weapon was
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:17.280]  completely destroyed non-functioning you know uh as you can tell i was burned pretty bad
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.400]  and uh so that was one of my first miracles and you lost your arm and i lost my arm they
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:29.200]  had to pull me out of the flames uh um uh to save my life so they had to cut your arm off to get you
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:37.760]  out well uh they they pulled me out and it was just uh mangled mangled up pretty bad and uh and
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:44.080]  um i i looked down and i was like oh my beautiful arm you know because uh i i've heard those descriptions
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:49.520]  of the guys have to go back in there while it's burning too they a lot of times get burned um yeah
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:53.920]  luckily the guys that pulled me out didn't thank god in fact the other guys didn't get hurt as
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:19:03.760]  bad as you uh no uh um so my battle buddies they have uh back problems and and PTSD and stuff like
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:11.520]  that and uh but no yeah i was i was the worst one out because i was pinned down so wow i mean how
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:17.520]  long were you pinned inside that armored vehicle uh i have no idea because i got knocked out but uh
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:25.600]  i could imagine it was maybe five minutes or so uh that i can remember you know it was a while
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:31.200]  you know in the flame in the flames yeah so you literally were in i mean like in a barbecue pit
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:37.360]  for five minutes barbecue pit heard the cracking the of the flames and you know just it was just
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:42.480]  it was surreal a surreal experience what's it like for you now and you see like yuppies and
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:46.080]  trendies that are lazy and stupid and people that don't even care about their kids they have
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:50.640]  everything they got their arms their eyes everything and and and then they just could care less about
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:57.280]  anybody but themselves uh i think they need to really wake up and and see what's happening out
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:03.040]  there because uh it's going to affect them too and they'll be they'll be the ones you know in in
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:09.440]  the trenches you know they'll be the ones hiding and and they'll be like oh um i can't believe this
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:15.200]  is happening to us and and um then they'll remember people like you and me telling people uh
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:22.080]  uh the realities let's talk about let's talk about the the angel talk about talk about that near
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:31.840]  death experience uh what happened well uh i had um started bleeding internally after the surgery
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:37.040]  and they're going to put a uh it's a medical device underneath my skin underneath my back
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:45.840]  and um i started uh uh bleeding internally and they gave me pints four pints of blood
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:54.080]  each pint uh they're hoping the the bleeding would stop internally and um it it didn't i just uh
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:02.240]  i just kept bleeding and and uh the last the last pint was a bad batch of blood and so i got a
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:09.760]  108 fever and they had to move remove the device and uh when they removed the device uh
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:16.560]  and they um when they moved the bad batch of blood they couldn't use that same needle because it was
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:25.440]  obviously tainted so while i started getting 108 fever i couldn't get another IV so i was just out
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:33.280]  there on my own no IV you know they had to put me in um ice packs and stuff and then about that time
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:44.320]  i started uh uh crossing over to the side and i saw i saw a couple demons um uh one uh uh was a
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:50.000]  demon of lust uh she looked like angeline a jolly you know she was really gorgeous but she had green
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:57.680]  skin and she was wearing a black sticky garment and uh and uh i mean she didn't say i'm the demon
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:02.320]  of lust or anything but i could just put two and two together you know that's what she was there for
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:07.920]  and and uh that sticky garment i associate that with lust is because it's hard to get away from
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:12.480]  you know it was like flypaper trying to get you to choose to go to hell it was almost a battle
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:16.800]  right there yeah yeah it definitely uh that happens a lot of people that are right on the edge yeah
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:21.520]  uh there was this other little it's like in the bible and they fought over moses's body go ahead
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:26.720]  there was this uh classic looking demon he was actually on my bed and he had a big nose he was
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:33.840]  red he had like maybe two feet tall long uh fingernails and he was just scratching at my uh
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:38.960]  at my spirit trying to separate my my body from my my soul from my body by the way i never even
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:46.320]  heard this story yeah yeah go ahead and he was trying to separate it uh and um and there was
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:53.200]  this also this uh um like a rock looking demon he uh i associate him with like a demon of pride
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:58.720]  because i had a lot of pride in my life and uh uh he looked like the uh fantastic four
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.360]  guy you know that rock you know that rock guy van grimm yeah he looked like that it's clobberin
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:16.320]  time yeah but he uh he was uh like uh maybe brownish color and so while i was going through all this i
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:21.600]  just i just was like oh man you know this happening again you know and uh i was like man i didn't
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:26.320]  learn my lesson they just they just uh started laughing at me not with their mouth but in their
[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:30.560]  mind they started laughing at me like you didn't learn anything you know and you're going with
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:36.000]  you're going uh with us to hell tonight you know and then this angel as my mom was there praying
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:42.800]  beside my bed and i couldn't move you know just see her there praying um this angel just came out
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:49.520]  of the ceiling like a whirlwind and uh as he was coming down he struck the biggest guy in the room
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:57.200]  that rock demon and uh and uh and then that's all i remember i do remember what he looked like he
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:06.240]  he looked like uh uh he had blonde hair blue eyes and uh he was like 10 feet tall and he looked like
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:13.760]  the biggest uh wrestler that i've ever seen in my whole life and uh he had armor on and uh his armor
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:21.920]  was silver uh glistening silver with outline with gold and he had this sword wow and uh this this
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:29.360]  sword uh was pretty was pretty big it had um it had holes in it and i don't know anything about
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:35.600]  swords or or that i'd like guns i'm a soldier you know and uh and while i was doing research on
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:42.000]  swords i come to find out that uh uh swords and knives and stuff like that with holes is to make
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:47.120]  them lighter or just as strong to make them lighter and i was like wow you know like stuff i
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:53.840]  didn't even know that i that i learned while i was you know dying you know well sure you can get
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:57.600]  knowledge in these type of things that then actually comes true later yeah and it's like
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:04.000]  interdimensional yeah makes me cry just hearing about it so so amazing that the average person
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.240]  doesn't know what's really going on out there yeah yeah they definitely don't see it in the music
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:13.760]  industry and uh even in their schools being taught uh Darwinism you know they just don't see
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:18.800]  what's really happening and just people just need to really wake wake up and open their eyes and and
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:23.520]  be open minded well everything says you're an animal you're not made in the image of the creator
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:30.560]  right well that's what they say that's not the truth exactly yeah yeah uh that's what me and my
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:39.920]  wife go over we go over creation science and and uh just uh to prove that that um that we aren't made
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:48.480]  in the image of god and that um yeah i don't know there's so much information like what do you make
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:52.960]  have you seen all the news where they tell christians that they can't even be christians or they give
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.480]  money to a christian group they'll be court marshaled i mean that's religious freedom in america
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:03.200]  it's like soviet russia yeah that's just completely uh taken away from our constitution like that
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:09.040]  that is uh what are we fighting for we're fighting completely for them you know uh we're we're supposed
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:16.320]  to be fighting for this nation first we were we're we held up our right hand and uh uh we swore to
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:21.600]  defend and protect it and and it just seems like they're just completely overriding it and i just
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:30.240]  don't understand now why why uh why don't we just uh i feel sorry for all the people that don't know
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.280]  there's a spiritual battle going on i snuck into behemian grove i've covered skull and bones i grew
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:41.840]  up in dallas texas and saw amazing stuff going on and the elite know there's the occult and they
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:46.080]  have been given power over this world because they serve the god of this world and it's totally real
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.480]  for them and then they've convinced everyone that none of this is even going on it's it's funny to them

[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:29.040]  questions to mario lopez a veteran the u.s army in iraq and then afghanistan he was in a combat
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:35.920]  engineering unit and was pinned after 300 pound improvised explosive device for at least five minutes
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:44.720]  while he was conscious uh under it um and burned and lost his arm and an eye and other parts of
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:51.760]  his body but he his human spirit shines through and he's here with us today and he has had an
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:57.520]  experience that other cultures that aren't even christian and now they've been able to
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:03.440]  translate the sanskrit and all the other different hieroglyphs that this is this is this is the
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:09.440]  experience people have this is what this is what goes on uh when you die there have been so many
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:14.480]  atheists and people that have died and then then been resuscitated to become christians i don't
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:19.040]  mean establishment christian that's that's totally taken over and is like the system putting itself
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:22.720]  in front of that but there is there are things we don't know about this universe i'll tell you
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:27.920]  right now and the people running things know it and are obsessed with it are programming us with
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:33.600]  symbols and whether you believe what david ike believes or you believe what people like myself
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:39.840]  believe uh there is something out there that that that there's a lot of unseen out on this planet
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:46.160]  and space we only see a very small spectrum of what's going on i want to go to your phone calls
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:51.040]  but i wanted to be able to give us his view and creationism you know people always ask me what
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:58.720]  is my view on this uh here's the issue if you go back about 180 years ago the establishment
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:04.720]  wanted to discredit christianity and bring in their occult systems that were even older
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:10.240]  and so they made it oh you're not scientific and then in the last hundred years they would
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:15.120]  do fake piltdown man and fake cavemen proving the missing link over and over again with fraud just
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:21.120]  like global warming all the rest of it a lot of fraud establishment science to say we're just animals
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:26.000]  to say there's no soul to say there's no spirit because if you don't know there's a war going on
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:31.360]  for your decision in this universe which side even if you're like want to call it new age you believe
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:36.800]  in light or darkness i'm trying to just quantify this now because the preachers want to beat people
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:40.400]  over the head with it and make it about whatever religious group you're in only their christian
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.640]  groups the one that's the good one that's meant to keep everybody divided it's another tool of the
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:51.200]  devil in my view but the bible talks about you know other creations and and things destroyed
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:57.440]  before you know adam and even all of that so i don't debate the real age of this planet
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:02.560]  i don't debate all these other things that are going on a day was as a year here was as a day it
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:08.000]  says in genesis you know how god chooses to describe how the planet was built its darkness
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:13.600]  and then and then and then god creates you know out of the void new things and then the light and
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:18.960]  then you go to the science that's basically you know just stalled how it was done and so much of
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:23.280]  what was science fact 20 years ago now they admit isn't true so many genetic engineers
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:30.240]  now become religious because they can go and see the design in it and and the claim that out of a
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:35.840]  bunch of sand or water cells were thrown together that are a billion times more complex than a fine
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:41.280]  swiss wrist watch again about a fine watch in the sahara that wasn't made by someone because over
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:47.520]  enough time sand blew together to make it look at prometheus the elite actually i did a video on this
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:54.720]  on the review of you know secrets of prometheus revealed where they believe for the exact scientific
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:37:01.280]  name of it i think it's transpermia or whatever the point is that we were ceded by master say it again
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:08.720]  panspermia that that we were ceded by aliens well see see i mean even the scientists now
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:15.040]  are going it's aliens it evolution isn't possible the way we say i'm not saying things don't breed
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:20.720]  things don't change cars don't evolve people don't change people don't you know develop certain
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:27.360]  traits that's certainly there but the lie of darwin who was an occultist who said he was given his
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.720]  knowledge by dark angels see that's an interesting thing the theory of darwinism is like he saw an
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:39.600]  angel in a near-death experience darwin actually said that entities gave him his knowledge and
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:45.920]  and and and it's totally wild his whole family set up eugenics that hitler came out of so see
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:51.120]  people don't really know where darwin comes from he's like this icon god when he's really just a
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:55.920]  malthusian we don't know who mouth this was look it up so i've given you some background where i
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:02.080]  stand i believe it's all a false debate clearly the official stories were told about how old
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:07.680]  the earth is and about how things work have been proven wrong even top scientists admit no things
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:13.600]  just show up on the developmental line suddenly during times of incredible mutation but they can't
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:19.920]  ever find the mutation so that's what's going clearly this was designed clearly this was built
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:26.240]  and clearly it didn't grow even out of space rocks that had microbes in them okay folks this was
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:33.760]  engineered this was engineered and now all of the atheist people are now saying it's aliens well
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:37.760]  then you're not even atheist are you you just are people that say we're not allowed to have a debate
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:43.120]  about this when all the agents in every culture said angels came here that's where humans basically
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:47.360]  come from well that's what the bible says and it says that there were angels coming down and
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:53.440]  basically having sex with women the nephilim and that there were genetic genetic abominations
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:57.760]  created and then a cleansing and then now look at the genetic engineering today look at what the
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.520]  elite do trying to destroy all the creation and then and then Noah was the only one who had perfect
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.480]  in his generations not in his behavior he got drunk and stuff ran around naked and got made
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:13.840]  fun of by his kids the point is he was perfect in his genetics so it's archetypes to explain this
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:17.200]  to us now i've given my view i'm going to give you the floor now for about five minutes to give
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:21.120]  your view on creationism and also point out you go and speak for free at churches and give your
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:26.240]  testimony that i think is very important if folks want to contact you at howineo.org and paintings
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:34.960]  by mario lopez.com but give us your take on on on on on creationism because i just agree with
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:39.280]  how some of the preachers they describe what creationism is and then that and then we're
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.160]  supposed to listen to them or the Darwinists don't know how about i go read the bible i decide what
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:50.320]  i'm really seeing there go ahead i believe in the six day creation uh it's very explainable in the
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:57.920]  bible and uh you know six day creation what what about my position because i'm saying i don't know
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:04.720]  i believe the bible and i'm and i'm saying they've created a fake debate by men the preachers uh with
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.680]  the scientists in a fight making it about them when the i has not seen the arizona heard the
[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:16.800]  things of god uh yeah i think you're talking about um uh whenever they uh believe in the gap theory
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:23.680]  i think that's what you're talking about uh the gap theory doesn't really it doesn't really mesh
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:30.000]  for all well with the bible because then you can leave in room for evolution uh but i think the
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:35.120]  way to attack their evolution theory is to point out they admit it's all crud now i mean they still
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:42.000]  teach school kids it's a fact yeah but but but uh if you look at it it it it isn't the way they've
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:49.360]  said i mean their theory is wrong yeah there's uh uh hecklers uh drawings i think it's heckler uh they
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:58.000]  have um um uh these uh primord they have they have these um i don't really my wife is the one that
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:03.200]  that she's a biologist yeah she's a biologist you know i just but uh they had these drawings
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:13.760]  that they tried to explain um how uh we all come from uh the uh single cell organism and we take
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.240]  the same steps like a human take the same steps as a as a doctor whatever well they've been they've
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:24.800]  proved that since wrong since the 1850s and they're still in textbooks in some form today no that's
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:29.120]  the thing at actual science level they admit the whole thing's a fraud and they believe space aliens
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:33.120]  did it that's what most biologists and scientists don't believe i mean they'll say somebody brought
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:38.320]  this here it's a master engineer it's but but still they teach as you said 150 year old crud
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:44.400]  to school kids yeah well um this whole deal with aliens they're demons you know well exactly i'm
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:48.960]  not saying i agree with that i'm saying oh yeah i know in real academia they've had to admit it's
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:56.160]  all pure bull yeah yeah they turn it into well it's not fact it's it's a philosophy and and and uh
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:02.320]  it's just a way of looking at things and then uh their whole theory breaks down i'm saying the
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:09.040]  bible manifestly proves that it's accurate and is revelation but then people have ancient
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:15.040]  interpretations of it that are interpretations of men we then take those on as as the real spiritual
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:20.720]  interpretation when i look at it take revelation there's no way somebody 2000 years ago on an
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:25.920]  island came up with that without divine inspiration right you read it it's what's actually happening
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:31.040]  right but then they'll argue well that's self-fulfilling prophecy that the elite have taken this plan
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:36.400]  well regardless it's being manifest yeah it's nothing that that you can't you can't change
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:42.720]  it it's gonna happen you know uh so all we all we can really do is just uh just warn people and
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:48.560]  try to point them to the christ you know that's all we can we can really do well well it's amazing
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:57.360]  hearing your story about the near death experience and um dr um craig roberts well does dr paul craig
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:02.160]  roberts the the the economist and there's colonel craig roberts my friend uh but you know he talks
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:08.400]  about dead for 10 minutes bled out on the table you know you know uh stomach surgery for cancer
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:13.920]  dead they gone all he walked off it was like shoot you know zip him up he's dead i declared dead
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:20.320]  10 minutes stop resuscitating front four five trying to resuscitate and just the whole nine
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:27.120]  yards i think they call that uh that medical phenomenon the Lazarus effect yeah yeah but
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:30.880]  i mean atheists have it and they go well it's your brain trying to sort things out no it's
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.840]  you're taken to a portal there's hell right there heaven right there he's brought right up to like
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.560]  the decision point the portal and literally he was given and this happens to a lot of people
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.640]  here's all this dad when he came back he was so much smarter he understood things he was given
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:50.080]  discernment and literally just like in the tv shows and stuff you know because they archetype
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:59.600]  that literally sent back with a mission yeah yeah just imagine we're on this planet in space
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:04.320]  and there's this whole interdimensional war going on all around us of course we're an incredible
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:09.840]  creation and and there's incredible missions we have in the future and and literally god is
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:15.920]  deciding you know is literally getting his his people in this test this is a this is a real free
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:20.880]  will test because we god's gotta give free creatures see the angels only have i guess
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:27.840]  as you call it semi free will uh and and or it's very complex but then we have free will we are
[02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:32.720]  made in the image of god right and so we have to be given the free will that's why god puts us
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:38.640]  through all of this yeah it's like uh he if you want someone to love you you can't make them love you
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:42.880]  you know and that's what this whole thing is about you know it's about are we going to love god and
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:50.240]  then uh whenever i uh visited hell um i accepted it i knew i deserved to be there and and uh
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:54.000]  is that the first experience like this or the second experience the first describe the first
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:00.160]  experience we're going to call us okay first experience a little bit more uh traumatic but uh
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:04.560]  i you don't have to talk about it if it's hard to talk about no i can talk about i i stand up in
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:12.320]  front of people and talk about it but uh i uh think i overdosed one one night um i remember
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:17.680]  taking a lot of pills and and as i was as i could feel my heart beat slowing and this is after you
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.480]  been injured this after i've been injured uh i could feel my heart beat slowing and and my breath uh
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:28.320]  not being as strong and and just thinking wow you know you could you could die tonight and i was like
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:33.920]  you took a lot of pills and just well i i told myself well you deserve to go to heaven after
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:37.440]  everything you've been through after everything you've done for your country you know i i had this
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:47.840]  false uh uh thinking that my good works could got me into heaven you know and so i fell asleep
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:53.840]  uh when i fell asleep uh it was like i saw myself in my spirit and it was like if you blow out a
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:58.880]  candle you know how the smoke rises in in uh and when you blow out a candle the smoke yes just like
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:04.320]  that that's what my spirit looked like and uh my spirit started traveling down instead of up and
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:09.840]  i was like uh oh you know the same good and uh i traveled through earth and i saw this uh orange
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:16.560]  pinhole of light and i got closer and closer and closer to it dimensional gate yeah and uh as i got
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:22.560]  closer i could feel the heat and and then uh next thing you know i i smack down the to the middle of
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:28.960]  hell and i fall into i fall inside a house with no roof and there's a hurricane of fire going on the
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:36.320]  outside when the houses tumbling like tumbleweeds in the hurricane of fire and um and then i saw um
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:43.680]  uh some creatures in there and it's a woman levitating on an altar and she was she looked
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:50.080]  what you would think uh what which looks like uh she had black sack cloth as a garment and uh she
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:56.640]  had uh missing pieces of uh of white hair and she was very veiny she looked like she was 150 years
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:02.400]  old and she was just levitating and these creatures this one he looked like a gargoyle he just pulled
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:09.280]  me without even touching me to this lady and then i woke up but while i was there the same same exact
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:14.640]  time while this happened so quickly um i felt three things there was the only three things i was
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:20.880]  allowed to feel because i'd probably be dead right now uh i felt uh hate the hate was like a tangible
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:25.680]  thing it was like uh you could bottle it if you wanted to you could cut it the hate with the night
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:29.440]  and that's the thing about the new world order they hate us they come to kill steal and destroy
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:34.400]  people go why do they do all this they hate people and especially children innocent sweet little

[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:44.080]  that's right yeah it's exactly right and uh i felt the hate and i mean people can feel hate when
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:47.360]  you walk into a room if you there's a bunch of people that don't like you can feel the hate
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:53.840]  sometimes well this is like a million times over and uh and like i said you could bottle it if you
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:48:00.320]  wanted to it's like a tangible thing and uh then i felt the heat and i i know what being on fire
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:05.200]  feels like i know what heat feels like on earth and i was underneath you know the debris for five
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:14.160]  minutes the heat uh was like an acid in hell on earth it's like uh it looks the way it feels it

[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.680]  hopelessness i that's why they like to torture children for long periods they like to create
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:43.200]  hell on earth the baby being helpless the three four five-year-olds their favorite begging for mommy
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:51.440]  that's what they like yeah and uh the hopelessness was like um i i can attribute it to like uh drinking

[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:48.160]  a lot going on and the state is not god hollywood is not god it is a facsimile it is something wanting
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:53.600]  to control our perceptions and take our free will and it is evil by every stretch the imagination
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:58.000]  they tell you oh there's no good or evil that's so you don't have any gauge of what's going on
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:04.480]  let's take some phone calls savage in finland you're on the year with army veteran mario lopez go
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:12.800]  ahead good evening sir hey buddy how are you alex i'm fine thanks for calling in and holding
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:18.480]  while we had our guests on you want to talk about obama care well yeah well actually i had a few
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:24.880]  points before going into that if you don't mind sure go ahead well first of all i heard like
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:31.600]  a few weeks ago you talked about like people who wanted to affect this system and wake people up
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:38.400]  at the same time and i've actually thought of this myself and uh i'm actually thinking of getting
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:44.480]  involved in finished politics and going for the congress in finland well that's the answer good
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:49.280]  people need to run for office uh maybe mayor first or water district head or something
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:54.880]  convenient but it's also good to aim high but everyone should run for office who loves liberty
[02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:58.800]  and then we would overpower the system if we just got up off our butts i agree that's a good idea
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:07.680]  yeah and also uh i was like a few times i've heard you saying that you're a weak person
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:14.960]  do not ever say that because you're one of the strongest persons i know of you're like the courage
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:24.000]  that you have of taking upon these comebacks these obama obamans and these globalists you have a
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:30.080]  like you're not weak at all you shouldn't say that at all ever well i know that but at the same
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:33.680]  time i feel like i should do more i mean i have all these ideas of things i could do and then i just
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:38.240]  run out of energy and i then i can't by like six seven at night i can't make the right decisions
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:43.280]  and get tired that's just it's frustrating to see the enemy coming down on you and not being able
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:48.720]  to move them i mean we've had a bunch of victories but it's just still it's very frustrating to watch
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:57.360]  them get away with all this uh what do you think of our guest testimony well i think that uh it's
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:04.160]  amazing what he's talking about because uh the thing is that i myself completely believe in
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:12.880]  extraterrestrial and uh that like human life evolved with their health and like whenever you
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:19.520]  look like wherever you look i mean in the historical site you can see paintings of aliens and stuff
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:26.960]  like for example i'm persian so i know persian history for example the uh that torshtian
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:36.400]  history it's a religion where they like uh what where they keep uh fire as holy and uh the symbol
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:43.840]  of uh of that christian it's like a bird thingy with a man inside it sure you don't have the zoo
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:49.920]  astrians uh i have no idea how it's pronounced sure sure i got a jump because that's the end of
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:54.320]  this hour but see there's the issue i see that and god bless you sir i see that as the first step
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.240]  see the atheist there and of course we really know they're cult leaders they don't want people
[02:57:58.240 --> 02:58:02.480]  even thinking that there's something outside it's all just boring the planet's nothing you know
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:06.720]  there's nothing spiritual there's nothing we don't know it's at least one step for the a lot of the
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:12.560]  atheist now to admit that that that evolution uh is a fraud and something built this see i see that
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:17.520]  as positive what he was just saying yeah i mean even though you would say and i would say those are
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:22.080]  obviously those are fallen angels those are manipulators right yeah that's i agree with that
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:27.200]  they're completely dirt demons and you know why do you think they want to destroy us because they
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:33.040]  hate us they hate us like that's that's a while because we're made in the image of what cast them

[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:32.960]  army veteran mario lopez joins us paintings by mario lopez dot com how i know dot or
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:36.960]  we're taking your phone calls you're making some points about project blue being the government's
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:43.040]  admission of uh blue book or well there was blue book and then blue but but no you're right blue
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:48.000]  book on the whole ufo phenomenon and and and repeat what you said because that reminded me of that
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:54.160]  the air force general said that uh they were uh that the spacecrafts were as mesospherical which uh
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:01:01.840]  i believe the definition is uh spiritual that these uh these entities that were driving these vehicles
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:08.400]  could not withstand those those g forces and would be completely smashed yeah in our gravitational
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.280]  field the one one millionth of it would smash them up against the wall like a pancake the
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:19.360]  gravitation right and i mean these things are you know going 50 000 miles an hour to making
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:27.360]  right hand you know right angle turns right and so that's the whole point is that it's not of this
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:34.560]  dimension right they're they're interdimensional craft and uh they somehow get some sort of energy
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:45.920]  and they are able to to come into our dimension in in and uh have us uh see see them and just so
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:52.400]  they can deceive us they're the great deceivers of of this world is it like it's almost like a
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:57.600]  science fiction but it's like a military interdimensional force that wants wants our soul
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:03.600]  that's in this earth suit it wants to suck that out yeah i've heard someone i don't i don't believe
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:11.200]  this but i heard someone say that uh that they use our energy as as fuel and as food i don't know but uh
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:17.440]  yeah that's why it's like being burned because they're like sucking you dry is that what they're
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:23.360]  saying i never get into all this stuff the point is the elite are obsessed with it and and and and
[03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:28.160]  it's very interesting to just see how similar the bible is to all the science fiction and then
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:32.400]  but then they're like saying oh but the bible has nothing to do with it it's all discredited and
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:36.800]  everything but then it just fits into the whole cosmology and then the establishment is obsessed
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:43.680]  with it uh i mean if you look at skull and bones they believe they're worshiping fallen angels
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:50.320]  that's skull and bones yeah they believe that they're uh they're worshiping the the real god
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:55.600]  like because they they've been deceived and and uh it's like luciferianism they've been
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:03:01.200]  deceived in thinking that that uh their god is really the right god and you know which is
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:05.840]  and then they got all the symbolism and but look at the fruits of these people right yeah what are
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:12.800]  the fruits of it and and uh i have a quote on my on my uh on my uh website on my website the how i
[03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:22.800]  know and uh on food for thought uh it talks about um figuring out the attributes of god like if you

[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:05.680]  caller um four-year um listener i want to give a shout out to uh my brother there mr lopez um
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:10.720]  you understand what you do um appreciate what you're doing keep it going brother all right thank
[03:10:10.720 --> 03:10:17.040]  you well that was real quick man um i've i've been in for quite a while just recently got out
[03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:24.400]  been in spec ops pretty much the whole time uh few things that's why i've not identified my name but
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:30.480]  never the last laugh when we went to uh i don't hear this mentioned a lot we went to uh clean up
[03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:38.000]  hurricane andrew in 92 in the 82nd we were told to remove our patches we be aware of that um
[03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:44.400]  you want to identify it as a regular army that's that's something that's pretty pretty standard i guess
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:50.240]  nowadays i wouldn't go to katrina uh second thing what these guys are doing in the military the men
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:58.800]  with the brass are telling the younger um soldiers that you know you got a you took an oath to against
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:06.400]  any enemy foreign domestic what they're making the younger guys believe is that the terrorists which
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:12.960]  are myself and mr ropaz and yourself but your zones are the the domestic terrorist that's what
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:18.000]  exactly they spin it and they go enemies foreign and domestic and then they say patriots who are
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:22.960]  just pro-liberty that we're the terrorist when enemies foreign and domestic means people like
[03:11:22.960 --> 03:11:29.040]  obama who is overthrowing the country that's clearly the domestic usurper so enemies foreign
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:32.800]  and domestic they're flipping in fact that's what i've been told so they're from what you know
[03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:37.200]  they're teaching them oh enemies foreign and domestic teaching them they're supposed to operate
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:43.040]  domestically against the american people exactly they're they're saying these guys are gonna stand
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:48.480]  up their militia you know this that and the other they're the domestic ones when you know it it's
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:53.360]  just a brainwashing technique and i'm sure mr ropaz there knows exactly what i'm talking about
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:59.360]  uh the next thing was the main reason why i call it i have a brother that's a fellow ranger um
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:06.080]  and he's recently got out looking for jobs so and so forth as we all do uh he's pretty good
[03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:12.080]  looking fellow and he's been doing some um stand-ins for acting just not a real good actor but you
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:16.960]  know he's just doing a lot of stand-ins because of his there's a lot of soldiers i know are getting
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:23.440]  hard to do acting but yeah go ahead there uh i sent you a link uh there there's a bunch of uh
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:29.200]  different sites calling in atlanta area this was the disturbing part and the buzz was going around
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:35.280]  with all the actors in atlanta they're really getting scared because he and i both are listeners
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:41.920]  and he and i are waking as many people up as we can but the boys go around this is that i actually
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:47.760]  read it for myself because you know i verify everything even things that you say um they're
[03:12:47.760 --> 03:12:56.160]  looking for paramedics they're looking for army personnel active or out firing with their own
[03:12:56.160 --> 03:13:03.280]  attire uh like i said paramedics they're looking for military in or out they're looking this is
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:09.440]  the disturbing one they're looking for amputees for something coming up in atlanta that are
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:15.280]  not announcing what it is and for those that don't know they'll they'll have a real bomb go off blow
[03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:21.440]  up a couple people but then have amputees and people for a drill splatter fake blood on them
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:26.080]  and then they get confused and they go well you it was a drill you just so happened to happen
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:29.840]  in fact we know this was going on at boston then they cover up the drill in the news but we were
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:33.520]  able to get it documented and found news where they admitted weeks before they were having a drill
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:38.960]  that day and then it confuses and conflates the whole thing and then they tell them well for
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:42.560]  national security you know you're going to be arrested if you tell anybody about this and we
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:48.800]  know that's going on is that basically what you're saying exactly and uh he knows not to
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:53.760]  participate in any of it and but he's wanting all the others don't participate in it especially if
[03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:59.520]  you're in uniform um you work for a paramedics so and listen they could tell you show up with
[03:13:59.520 --> 03:14:04.240]  your own stuff blow something up and say you did it see that's how this works folks we know the
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:09.200]  seven seven bombers were like pretty much secular muslims who were trying to get better jobs and
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:12.960]  everyone said we'll be part of this drill we know there was a drill and some of them figured it out
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:17.600]  and ran they gunned them down the street covered that up but it did come out in the news uh just
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:21.600]  incredible and it's not saying there aren't some real terrorists out there but the whole issue is
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:26.880]  they script these events and it doesn't mean that just because they're trying to hire thousands
[03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:31.760]  of people for some drill that it couldn't be a real drill most the drills are real but then
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:37.200]  some days they have a drill and that's when the staged event happens uh send us at showtips
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:43.760]  at info wars dot com sergeant x or whoever else is out there these links to them trying to hire
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:47.520]  people for this drill because we've found a bunch of other stuff they're doing very similar things
[03:14:47.520 --> 03:14:54.160]  that look very suspicious thank you so much and god bless you sounds like uh mario you're saying
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:15:00.720]  you've been a little bit uh involved in research of false flags did you connect anything he was just
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:06.640]  saying oh yeah yeah like i was looking up the stuff with the boss and bombing and and uh i was
[03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:13.280]  actually me and my wife traveled down to missouri uh for my father-in-law's uh birthday and uh
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:19.920]  where the the world series was going on and there was a uh there was a uh
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:28.320]  uh uh dhs drill that they announced on the local news and so actually emailed y'all to let y'all
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:33.520]  know but i don't know what happened and again they might have 400 drills that are normal but also
[03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:37.200]  to demonize whoever the target is it's always like a domestic group it's the bad guy so it's
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:41.120]  brainwashing but then they'll have the real event we just seen they always run a drill
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:45.600]  as their cover so if they're operatives that are one percent of the drill a small team get caught
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:50.800]  i'm part of the drill yeah russians do the same deal uh and you also fund the terror attack through
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:55.680]  the drill as well that then launders it so that the intelligence agency spine don't know what's
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:16:01.200]  happening uh let's go ahead or cloaks that i should say it said it launders it uh carolin
[03:16:01.200 --> 03:16:06.800]  in idaho you're on the air thanks for holding welcome good morning alex i want to tell you how
[03:16:06.800 --> 03:16:13.120]  much i appreciate you and mario i want to thank you for taking meals uh and everything you've
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:20.640]  done to help keep me and my family free um i want to bring up the point about the
[03:16:20.640 --> 03:16:29.040]  seattle city council saying that they didn't know about the surveillance being on and um
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:40.160]  there's an article from when uh the police chief uh resigned last may about how he was happy to have
[03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:51.520]  of innovation in place um and how um a city councilman tim burgess who was running for mayor
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:59.600]  and i don't know if he was elected um said deus was too slow to adopt the strategies for preventing
[03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:07.040]  crime uh by the doj that's why they're putting federal pre-crime systems in that grab all your
[03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:12.080]  data illegally and then and then they turn it on when they're not supposed to and they say they're
[03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:18.800]  turning it off and don't again it's a culture of pure deception against us i mean you would be less
[03:17:18.800 --> 03:17:24.640]  deceptive to a foreign enemy i mean this is just they just as a rule they're changing the culture
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:32.400]  towards total fraud so that brings up the point that the city council already knew about this
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:37.920]  being in place oh of course the cops the cops the council they're all going to play dumb until it
[03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:41.760]  blows over i mean that's what i'm saying they're all just a bunch of federal minions and the feds
[03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:46.000]  themselves are run by globalists send us that article at show tips god bless you thank you very

[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:08.720]  does this happen like five person other things like you warned us and now with some of my wife's
[03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:13.040]  out of the blue says man we got all these weird posts this nsf uh charges and people have their
[03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:18.080]  money so you know yeah that's what's happening and here's an example like flash trading they
[03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:22.480]  hooked computers in right there at the stock exchange that just steal money by doing these
[03:19:22.480 --> 03:19:27.680]  flash trades that they control total fraud and then yes that's the new move they're getting all
[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:34.240]  the laws changed or regulations totally illegal quietly to just start taking your money but the
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:38.640]  word is and i've been told this for several years it's been happening they will grab money out of
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:44.320]  your account only for a few hours but they'll do this to hundreds of millions of accounts worldwide
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:49.680]  pool it make deals with that money and then put it back in your account so again it's all digital
[03:19:49.680 --> 03:19:56.240]  it's all fraud and uh i mean what type of weird uh you're just weird fees weird seeing stuff she's
[03:19:56.240 --> 03:20:01.440]  never seen before right like we had money in there but she had we had an nsf posting on our
[03:20:01.440 --> 03:20:05.840]  account on our account she goes what in the world is that so i'm just asking or perhaps you're
[03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:12.160]  doing an nsf posting is uh non non-sufficient funds just like something tried to go through but no
[03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:17.280]  money was there at the time and so it so there's a charge automatic that nobody can do nothing
[03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:21.920]  about you have to manually go in there and fix it if if it was yeah well this is happening everybody
[03:20:21.920 --> 03:20:27.200]  i know especially old people because they've done actuaries test and know that they're not a savvy
[03:20:27.200 --> 03:20:32.960]  every old person i know on phone bills cable bills gas bills credit cards are being given
[03:20:32.960 --> 03:20:39.520]  fines and fees that aren't true and they found most people just pay it so it's just a it's a look
[03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:45.840]  it's a culture of evil uh send us intel on that send us show tips for other folks in banking
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:51.760]  we'll try to get a story out on it but i'm again this is thank you so much this is what it's like
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:57.280]  mario lopez here in studio with us to live in a culture of evil that's why third-world countries
