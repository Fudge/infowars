[00:35.880 --> 00:42.560]  for joining us today the news is intensifying the frequency of just
[00:42.560 --> 00:48.800]  earth-shaking events are accelerating we're gonna have a jam-packed transmission
[00:48.800 --> 00:55.320]  for you today joining us from Beirut the one the only international TV host
[00:55.320 --> 01:01.280]  Max Kaiser will be joining us from the Middle East with breaking news coming
[01:01.280 --> 01:06.600]  up in the next hour he's got breaking news and developments dealing with
[01:06.600 --> 01:11.720]  blackwater training in Israel and planning a strike in Lebanon it's also
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.640]  been confirmed that their training with with South African mercenary companies
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.800]  all over Africa for intensified strikes there as well not just in and around
[01:23.800 --> 01:29.900]  Palestine we also then have joining us part three of the live interview with
[01:29.900 --> 01:34.280]  Pastor Lindsey Williams with his inside oil company connections remember in
[01:34.280 --> 01:40.320]  October when oil was $65 $70 a barrel he said it would soon go to 150 within
[01:40.320 --> 01:44.920]  six months to a year that's now moving up in that direction he was told that by
[01:44.920 --> 01:49.680]  a former CEO of one of the big three oil companies known to myself we can't
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.160]  give you the source of course Ken from was the former head of operations for
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.800]  Atlantic Richfield died last December so we can now reveal that source
[01:56.800 --> 02:00.480]  continuing we have Webster Tarpley popping in in the last 30 minutes to talk
[02:00.480 --> 02:03.560]  about what's happening in North Africa and the Middle East and the domino
[02:03.560 --> 02:09.840]  effect generally triggered by commodity prices increasing due to ongoing
[02:09.840 --> 02:15.240]  dollar devaluation and speculation so we're gonna be breaking that down Bernie
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.760]  Madoff did a big interview with New York magazine I continue to be impressed by
[02:20.760 --> 02:27.000]  the interviews that New York magazine gets and they did a tape jailhouse
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.960]  interview with Bernie Madoff where Madoff basically told the truth whole
[02:33.960 --> 02:38.360]  government is a Ponzi scheme he went on to say Goldman Sachs is a Ponzi scheme
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.080]  and the media kind of spun it like well this guy's a crook well yeah the founder
[02:42.080 --> 02:49.960]  of the Nasdaq I mean the the modern derivatives investment banking system
[02:49.960 --> 02:54.760]  since the end of Glass-Steagall in 99 is a Ponzi scheme I mean how many top
[02:54.760 --> 03:03.920]  economists do I have to have on to explain that but the issue here is all
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.200]  of these entitlements all of these interest payments to these private
[03:08.200 --> 03:14.440]  banks are are are based on always increasing the amount of debt because
[03:14.440 --> 03:19.000]  it is a Ponzi scheme and we're now entering those final phase of the
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.920]  situation where it it basically becomes amplified and where the hyperinflation
[03:25.920 --> 03:31.720]  begins to rear its ugly head just last week they had another big Treasury
[03:31.720 --> 03:39.480]  auction and record numbers of the Treasuries went unsold to government's
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.040]  institutions and private individuals so the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
[03:43.040 --> 03:46.800]  just monetized it and that's what Zimbabwe has done the last few years is
[03:46.800 --> 03:50.320]  what Argentina did in the last decade that's what's happened in Mexico over
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.640]  and over again with peso devaluation it's what the Russians have done with the
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.480]  ruble it's what the Germans did in Weimar Republic that helped usher in
[03:57.480 --> 04:02.880]  Adolf Hitler and that's the problem with this historically that that that
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.960]  governments tend to start wars to get out of depressions and governments
[04:06.960 --> 04:13.560]  almost always try to have police state crackdowns as their answer to these
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.040]  type of economic developments this type of economic climate so we're gonna be
[04:18.040 --> 04:25.320]  going over all of that as well today and we come back after the break also I have
[04:25.320 --> 04:30.440]  predicted it here at nauseam because I understand the mindset the modus operandi
[04:30.440 --> 04:36.320]  of the globalist and I have the executive order signed by Bill Clinton and
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.320]  they normally put stuff on the books decades before they implement it the TSA
[04:41.320 --> 04:45.840]  is rolling out on the streets of America now searching even small children on
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.600]  street corners and getting off trains now they want to take your DNA to get on
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.120]  the airplane and it's all a psychological warfare test this is our
[04:54.120 --> 04:58.400]  prisoner enslavement training we're gonna come back and cover that stay with
[04:58.400 --> 05:00.360]  us
[05:04.360 --> 05:10.160]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.880]  says that the state is God the United States has now recognized globally as
[05:14.880 --> 05:19.200]  one of the most oppressive police states on earth this film conclusively

[07:03.040 --> 07:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.560]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[07:11.560 --> 07:15.600]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.480 --> 07:23.760]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.760 --> 07:27.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:27.920 --> 07:32.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:32.240 --> 07:35.920]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[07:35.920 --> 07:40.120]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[07:40.120 --> 07:43.480]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[07:57.440 --> 08:08.440]  3270365 he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.560]  feels like a Monday but it's a Tuesday I just got back nearly morning hours from
[08:15.560 --> 08:23.400]  New York City where I was on CNN the view and some other national TV outlets
[08:23.400 --> 08:29.240]  talking about the whole Charlie sheen situation before this hour ends I've
[08:29.240 --> 08:37.080]  really had time to cogitate and think a lot about this whole scandal and so I'll
[08:37.080 --> 08:44.240]  have some brief but but focused comments on that coming up towards the end of this
[08:44.240 --> 08:49.560]  hour then Max Kaiser joins us from Beirut Lindsay Williams for part three of
[08:49.560 --> 08:54.560]  the live interview we started a few weeks ago and of course Webster Tarpley
[08:54.560 --> 09:00.200]  in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today here are just some of the
[09:00.200 --> 09:04.520]  headlines that we have here today that I'm going to be going over in detail this
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.360]  is out of a WM you are television bill would make some airport screening
[09:09.360 --> 09:15.080]  sexual assault well I've had district attorneys on the district attorney from
[09:15.080 --> 09:18.560]  the county where San Francisco's base for the airport space saying that they
[09:18.560 --> 09:24.000]  have their officers in the airport and that if they see them touch the genitals
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.040]  through the pants it's a misdemeanor if they go in the pants as they've been
[09:27.040 --> 09:32.240]  doing now in the last four months that they will charge them with felonies my
[09:32.240 --> 09:37.440]  crew my camera guys fly all over the country interviewing folks for prison
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.560]  planet TV as you know and everywhere they've gone the last three months the
[09:41.560 --> 09:46.720]  scanners are turned off I flew out or got into the airport at about six and my
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.040]  flight was delayed for many hours but it was very busy there at the Newark
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.520]  Airport where I was flying out of New York from and when I flew in the
[09:56.520 --> 10:01.800]  scanners were all turned off Sunday and when I flew out last night Monday night
[10:01.800 --> 10:05.920]  all the scanners were turned off at three checkpoints in fact I made a point
[10:05.920 --> 10:13.200]  of walking up and down and surveying the you know whole terminal area where you
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.320]  enter and none of them were on zero zero and my crew reports to me that all
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.600]  over the country the scanners are completely turned off listeners report
[10:24.600 --> 10:29.040]  that they're either completely turned off or not in heavy use and I've also
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.520]  talked to a lot of pilots who've told me that they are turned off all over the
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.160]  country including lax so what does that say about the system well I guess that
[10:39.160 --> 10:44.480]  Michael Chertoff and others have made collectively their billions of dollars
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.240]  off of the systems and they know that the people have revolted against them and
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.440]  they hate it because if we have victory against this we will learn that
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.040]  collectively we can have victory against every other un-American police
[10:59.040 --> 11:04.000]  state development and so the globalists are basically just lying low right now
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.120]  and playing possum though when I flew out of Austin and flew back in when I
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.640]  got in about one o'clock in the morning last night when the airport wasn't
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.320]  having any more flights out they were like busy bees at the three checkpoints
[11:18.320 --> 11:25.440]  putting in the naked body scanners and I walked up to the TSA agents that were
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.800]  still there guarding the workmen from the evil Americans and I said so you're
[11:30.800 --> 11:35.560]  putting in the microwave machines and they leered at me like how dare you a
[11:35.560 --> 11:39.600]  lowly surf what do you think this is the United States of America talked to us
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.640]  and I said well know this you think you're gonna hurt us with your little
[11:43.640 --> 11:46.720]  microwave machines that have been documented to be linked to cancer and
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.400]  DNA damage who it really hurts are those of you that work around them all day so
[11:51.400 --> 11:58.040]  I said 100% cancer and looked them all in the eyes and they looked at each other
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.160]  and then looked down at their feet so 30 seconds into the conversation they
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.080]  weren't arrogantly getting off on their little uniforms now that said when I
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.440]  flew out the TSA two of the officers wanted to shake my hand and said we
[12:12.440 --> 12:16.040]  appreciate what you're doing I don't want to get them in too much trouble but
[12:16.040 --> 12:21.840]  they told me some other things one of them whispered in my ear so certainly
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.640]  certainly they're awakening I also had one of the airport officials who I've
[12:27.640 --> 12:31.400]  known for years come to my office last week and tell me off record something
[12:31.400 --> 12:36.000]  just amazing horror stories of the of some of the TSA leadership at the
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.120]  Austrian Berkstrom International Airport but then of course I can't reveal
[12:40.120 --> 12:45.600]  those stories because then it would it would finger exactly who told me those
[12:45.600 --> 12:49.880]  stories because some of this happened behind closed doors but can you imagine
[12:49.880 --> 12:55.280]  the type of sexual harassment that goes on if you've got TSA people harassing
[12:55.280 --> 12:57.800]  women who are going through checkpoints imagine what they do to other
[12:57.800 --> 13:03.440]  airport workers and we've seen cases of this where the TSA will make fun of
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.560]  someone's genital size repeatedly until they finally punch them in the nose and
[13:07.560 --> 13:12.920]  that's another TSA agent we see the pilots becoming outraged but the good
[13:12.920 --> 13:17.920]  news here is the people are beginning to wake up to what's happening and getting
[13:17.920 --> 13:23.600]  angry and realizing that this is sexual assault we don't really need any new
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.680]  laws government is not above the law here's another great illustration of
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.640]  this if you've got a dental office or you've got a clinic or you've got an
[13:33.640 --> 13:42.360]  emergency room every month by federal law not just regulations under OSHA they
[13:42.360 --> 13:46.240]  have to do full calibration readings to make sure that they're not
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.240]  malfunctioning because even a low-powered x-ray can become many
[13:50.240 --> 13:56.240]  times more powerful than a chest x-ray and a chest x-ray or a MRI you saw the
[13:56.240 --> 13:59.600]  New York Times last year admitting that MRIs all over the country are
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.360]  basically causing cancer killing people hitting them so hard with radiation
[14:04.360 --> 14:09.160]  that their hair is all falling out well it's the same situation with these
[14:09.160 --> 14:14.560]  naked body scanners that depending on which system have 20 plus to 50 plus
[14:14.560 --> 14:18.880]  times the radiation source on that Los Angeles Times and other major
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.240]  publications in the last two years that have reported on that and Congress
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.360]  about nine months ago requested ordered and that's the government the elected
[14:28.360 --> 14:35.360]  government that Homeland Security give them the OSHA calibration records and
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.080]  maintenance records of the naked body scanners because they've been putting them
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.080]  in for four years but only at what five or six airports now they're going in at
[14:43.080 --> 14:49.720]  over 200 and guess what Homeland Security said they said no way Jack so
[14:49.720 --> 14:54.600]  Bush can order torture it's completely illegal but he writes memos and then
[14:54.600 --> 14:57.600]  when their own minions get caught doing it the minions go to prison and then
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.120]  Bush writes a book and gives speeches saying he'd order torture again above
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.500]  the law they think they are the Fuhrer precept same thing with the TSA hey we
[15:07.500 --> 15:12.720]  don't have to wear any stinking radiation badges we don't have to calibrate
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.200]  these we don't have to have them serviced we don't have to have radiologists
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.760]  technicians come in and and run the machines and and do test and get
[15:21.760 --> 15:29.200]  readings we can do whatever we want this shows how the precedence being set for
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.560]  them to just to engage in any activity they wish now suddenly we're seeing the
[15:33.560 --> 15:39.000]  plans that Homeland Security announced eight years ago coming to fruition at
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.960]  bus terminals in Florida at train stations in Boston and New York and
[15:43.960 --> 15:48.280]  California the reports are coming out almost every day I'm seeing them every
[15:48.280 --> 15:51.440]  few days and I'm not even looking for them so I'm sure there's more out there
[15:51.440 --> 15:56.960]  but you can just search boy patted down getting off train woman patted down
[15:56.960 --> 16:06.280]  getting off bus TSA Viper teams run checkpoints on highway in Houston or you
[16:06.280 --> 16:11.200]  can pull up Fox News from about a year ago in upstate New York National Guard
[16:11.200 --> 16:17.720]  helps arrest 2,000 people for drugs and guns and there's a newscast with super
[16:17.720 --> 16:24.240]  high-power x-rays having families drive their cars under them and the National
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.280]  Guard under Homeland Security directives being trained by TSA is standing
[16:29.280 --> 16:37.280]  there right beside the scanners I mean do you have any idea how dead these
[16:37.280 --> 16:42.840]  people are let's see it's funny to them they think they're bulletproof it's like
[16:42.840 --> 16:46.720]  a young person that starts smoking cigarettes and you feel like you're
[16:46.720 --> 16:50.160]  invincible you feel like you're always gonna be young and five minutes
[16:50.160 --> 16:54.120]  figuratively goes by it seems like five minutes and you're 67 years old and
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.580]  hey buddy you got lung cancer we're gonna chop one of your lungs out or it's
[16:59.580 --> 17:02.800]  like an alcoholic that doesn't believe that you know drinking a bottle of Jack
[17:02.800 --> 17:05.680]  Daniels every day is gonna pickle their liver and they don't listen to their
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.680]  doctor and they go into liver failure or kidney failure I mean you sit there
[17:11.680 --> 17:15.320]  and you talk to these TSA people and I do it all over the country and a lot of
[17:15.320 --> 17:18.080]  them either shake your hand and go we know we know we're trying to unionize
[17:18.080 --> 17:22.920]  but or they laugh at you and get angry and and here's the issue we've
[17:22.920 --> 17:29.200]  confirmed that TSA agents are called in and asked you have a problem patent
[17:29.200 --> 17:32.080]  people down putting your hands down their pants you have a problem with the
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.760]  radiation from these things and if you say yes two weeks later you get a pink
[17:36.760 --> 17:45.840]  slip oh we're laying you off so they're building an army of unthinking
[17:45.840 --> 17:52.560]  automatons who will plus the more I think about it this is all hidden in
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.400]  plain view those x-ray machines and I was looking at some of the specs a few
[17:56.400 --> 18:00.160]  months ago we had a radiologist on air as many of you remember that there's all
[18:00.160 --> 18:05.160]  sorts of splattering and leakage out of the regular x-ray machines they run your
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.480]  luggage through that you're walking by but it's one thing to walk by it it's
[18:09.480 --> 18:17.160]  another thing to sit there all day on top of it by the way there's more news out
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.360]  today dealing with the US government radiating disabled Americans injecting
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.880]  them with syphilis injecting them with dioxin of course you heard last year the
[18:26.880 --> 18:32.480]  government had to apologize for injecting Guatemalans with syphilis we
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.800]  have a scientific technocracy with a bunch of ruthless control freaks who
[18:37.800 --> 18:43.360]  get off on playing god they don't they're not into football they're not
[18:43.360 --> 18:47.160]  into going to parties they're not into going out dancing they're not into oil
[18:47.160 --> 18:54.040]  painting they're not into gardening they're in to play in God and and and
[18:54.040 --> 18:59.800]  many of these scientific elite types if you if you study their their their
[18:59.800 --> 19:08.000]  psychological makeup are classical Joseph Mengele types they they enjoy what
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.640]  they're doing they enjoy suffering they enjoy playing God now I started getting
[19:14.640 --> 19:20.240]  into the TSA because that's a segue is the state stand up and say those
[19:20.240 --> 19:25.480]  convicted would be tier 3 sex offenders because that's what it is if I walk up
[19:25.480 --> 19:28.840]  in a park and grab a woman's genitals I'll go to prison it should if a cop
[19:28.840 --> 19:32.920]  does it without an emergency situation and probable cause you know that she has
[19:32.920 --> 19:39.320]  a gun down her pants he's gonna go to jail and should how are these TSA workers
[19:39.320 --> 19:43.760]  above the law but I wanted to get to mention that first because now the TSA
[19:43.760 --> 19:49.240]  is going to be taking your DNA when you go to the airport and then on the side
[19:49.240 --> 19:53.360]  of the highway and as I told you years ago that's been the plan all along they
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.440]  want to set a precedent to forcibly inject you forcibly take blood get

[24:06.120 --> 24:12.920]  network all right coming up Kedafi loyalist failed to retake territory in 6
[24:12.920 --> 24:19.520]  hour battle with rebels Saudi Arabia since tanks to riot hit Bahrain report
[24:19.520 --> 24:24.960]  US special forces have now arrived in Libya in the eastern part of the
[24:24.960 --> 24:30.640]  country we're gonna get into Bernie Madoff's jailhouse interview saying that
[24:30.640 --> 24:35.920]  the entire government is a Ponzi scheme yep the Ponzi scheme started in 1913 with
[24:35.920 --> 24:39.680]  the private fellow reserve takeover and this whole police state control grid is
[24:39.680 --> 24:45.720]  to ensure that the private Ponzi scheme operators are able to take over this
[24:45.720 --> 24:49.840]  country and secure their ill-gotten gains that is coming up but again if you
[24:49.840 --> 24:55.600]  just joined us the good news is all over the country legislatures are moving to
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.240]  pass laws to make it illegal for TSA to grope you but it's already illegal I've
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.520]  had district attorneys and counting attorneys on there's no law allowing TSA
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.960]  to do this it's a 10th Amendment violation a bunch of federal goons
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.240]  running around doing whenever they want now expanding the highways and train
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.160]  stations and bus stations of America a house committee is scheduled to hold a
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.120]  hearing today on a bill that would make it a sexual assault for an airport
[25:24.120 --> 25:27.840]  screener to touch or view a person's breast or genitals without probable
[25:27.840 --> 25:33.680]  cause the bill HB 628 FN includes anyone working as a security agent of a
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.240]  federal state or local government and includes touching or viewing with a
[25:37.240 --> 25:42.280]  technological device so that also deals with the body scanners the bill this is
[25:42.280 --> 25:49.960]  in New Hampshire the bill states discussing or possessing a copy of the
[25:49.960 --> 25:58.120]  Constitution discussing the security apparatus of an airport and it continues
[25:58.120 --> 26:01.320]  being on the premises of an airport possessing an airplane ticket or any
[26:01.320 --> 26:04.920]  type of ticket for access to mass transportation driving a motor vehicle
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.280]  on a public way or ownership of firearms should not be considered probable
[26:08.280 --> 26:14.840]  cause anyone convicted of these offenses would be classified as a tier 3
[26:14.840 --> 26:20.560]  sexual offender okay let me just continue here now this is old news for our
[26:20.560 --> 26:25.800]  listeners but new news if you're a new listener and this all broke over the
[26:25.800 --> 26:32.280]  weekend after touching your junk TSA wants to scan and harvest your DNA it's
[26:32.280 --> 26:36.760]  not enough for the TSA to feel you up at the airport now they're experimenting
[26:36.760 --> 26:42.080]  with rapid result DNA scanners that can scan and analyze your DNA using just a
[26:42.080 --> 26:47.600]  drop of saliva that's because in your saliva are skin cells from the tissue in
[26:47.600 --> 26:53.040]  your mouth spit at the TSA agent who is molesting you in other words and they
[26:53.040 --> 26:57.120]  can use that saliva to scan your DNA and then store it in a government database
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.280]  well that's how the federal government has announced that they want to start
[27:02.280 --> 27:06.280]  taking under a Bill Clinton executive order from the mid 90s I covered my
[27:06.280 --> 27:09.920]  film America destroyed by design I go down to the DMV and protest and get
[27:09.920 --> 27:17.160]  arrested handing out copies of it on the footage in the film in there it's said
[27:17.160 --> 27:21.080]  to get a driver's license they would take urine blood or other tissue sample
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.280]  and now in England and Europe and in other areas of the world the one the
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.920]  police pull you over even for speeding they they're now pushing taking a swab
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.840]  of tissue they don't have to cut you to do it they just take a swab and put it
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.960]  on the inside of your cheek and it scrapes off hundreds of cells they then
[27:39.960 --> 27:46.320]  attach that to your ID in the database and now have your DNA now remember and
[27:46.320 --> 27:51.320]  this Mike Adams natural news article points this out that we wrote a story
[27:51.320 --> 27:57.000]  last year dealing we wrote a story but a decade before that as well dealing with
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.480]  the fact that we discovered 15 years ago when a nurse sent us secret documents
[28:02.480 --> 28:08.120]  that there is a giant secret DNA Pentagon database and all babies at birth
[28:08.120 --> 28:15.280]  for 39 years and this is done by the way through continuity of agenda for 39
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.480]  years is generally the number but in the last 35 at least some countries didn't
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.760]  start it until after we did but every major Western nation showing we're under
[28:23.760 --> 28:28.520]  this global management system that they take blood from babies telling you it's
[28:28.520 --> 28:33.160]  going to the health department to test for blood diseases as if a in-house
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.840]  clinic couldn't do it or as if the hospital couldn't charge you and do it
[28:36.840 --> 28:41.840]  and send it out to a private clinic they send it away to the health department
[28:41.840 --> 28:50.400]  and the blood test is not done it is saved and put into a Pentagon slash UN
[28:50.400 --> 28:56.440]  database and of course now listeners of mine in Minnesota and Texas hearing
[28:56.440 --> 28:59.760]  about this actually investigated in the last few years and have been winning
[28:59.760 --> 29:05.640]  lawsuits and basically getting up to date documents similar to those we
[29:05.640 --> 29:11.480]  received 15 years ago so the goal of government is to get in your space to
[29:11.480 --> 29:15.680]  set that precedent to have forced inoculation as they've been trying to
[29:15.680 --> 29:20.480]  push through the last few years to have a forced DNA retrieval it's about
[29:20.480 --> 29:23.680]  government getting in your space and they train you first take your shoes off
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.920]  take your belt off answer questions now we're gonna body scan you now we're
[29:28.920 --> 29:33.000]  gonna grope you on top of it first the hands are outside the pants or the dress
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.560]  now they're going inside always increasing what they do and this is
[29:39.560 --> 29:43.680]  just like people pulling up at a prison and basically being you know being
[29:43.680 --> 29:49.000]  broken and being stripped searched it's just like induction into a prison
[29:49.000 --> 29:55.440]  we'll come back with more we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.440 --> 29:59.520]  and the GCN radio network
[30:00.120 --> 30:04.520]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[30:04.520 --> 30:09.520]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[30:09.520 --> 30:13.760]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[30:13.760 --> 30:17.520]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the

[34:07.160 --> 34:16.240]  economy but finishing up with the TSA the TSA is the national low-wage
[34:16.240 --> 34:23.560]  brown shirt army of the federal government and there's this continuity of
[34:23.560 --> 34:27.520]  agenda if you want to blame George Herbert Walker Bush or you want to
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.080]  blame Bill Clinton or you want to blame George W. Bush or you want to blame
[34:31.080 --> 34:36.400]  Barack Obama you can't because their rhetoric may be a little bit different
[34:36.400 --> 34:40.880]  but if you look at what Homeland Security is doing itself an offshoot of
[34:40.880 --> 34:46.160]  FEMA and COG continuity of government preparations if you look at what
[34:46.160 --> 34:51.240]  presidents do after after the last president leaves the bureaucracy is
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.880]  moving in total lockstep in the same direction and so while we rearrange
[34:56.880 --> 35:03.240]  deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic and prepare to put in some Republican
[35:03.240 --> 35:09.800]  savior coming up the next year and a half to remove Barack Obama that is a
[35:09.800 --> 35:16.000]  strategy for failure if we teach the principles of liberty and freedom in
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.720]  the Constitution generally to the public tyranny will disappear like mist in
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.520]  the morning as Thomas Jefferson said like like like phantoms at dawn and we
[35:26.520 --> 35:30.120]  need to take the states back the counties the cities back we need to take
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.440]  each mind back by getting people to realize what a decadent corrupt area
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.280]  of the cycle of civilization we've entered and how dangerous it is for
[35:39.280 --> 35:44.160]  everyone if we don't restore the Republic and restore the Bill of Rights
[35:44.160 --> 35:50.840]  and Constitution that is the engine the true free market private property engine
[35:50.840 --> 35:55.800]  of everything good we know historically that everything the federal
[35:55.800 --> 36:01.960]  government is attempting to do is for a small cadre of elite inbred elitist
[36:01.960 --> 36:08.600]  banking house and royalty allied families who have nothing but disdain
[36:08.600 --> 36:13.800]  for the general public and disdain for private property for the middle class who
[36:13.800 --> 36:18.600]  has always been their hereditary enemy throughout history middle classes are
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.800]  always enemies of the establishment once the system begins to become a
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.160]  consolidated and vertically integrated look at ancient Rome look at ancient
[36:26.160 --> 36:32.560]  Japan China look at Mesoamerica look at what's happened in the last hundred
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.520]  years in the third world whether it's Africa Latin America Asia Eastern Europe
[36:37.520 --> 36:42.840]  the the corrupt strong men and plutocrats depending on what system you
[36:42.840 --> 36:47.240]  have always target the middle class because it's independent and self-sufficient
[36:47.240 --> 36:52.320]  and not under their control and is always in business competition against the
[36:52.320 --> 36:57.960]  consolidated inside crony capitalist ventures run by these systems you know
[36:57.960 --> 37:02.160]  you think the communists are our anti-capitalist but you look at China you
[37:02.160 --> 37:07.560]  look at Russia and its decline up until the early 1990s you had a very small
[37:07.560 --> 37:11.960]  group of people becoming fabulously wealthy and powerful and they use
[37:11.960 --> 37:21.200]  government as a tool to shut down their competition but continuing this is the
[37:21.200 --> 37:24.080]  last time I can fly out of Austin without them trying to put me through the
[37:24.080 --> 37:29.160]  naked body scanners now the good news is there's been such a revolt against them
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.640]  that all over the country they're in disuse because they don't want to give
[37:34.640 --> 37:38.760]  you a chance to come together as I said a year ago as I said five months ago when
[37:38.760 --> 37:44.920]  we launched the big national brush fire rebellion against this that it's the key
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.840]  issue for several reasons it is a central key operation for the globalist
[37:50.840 --> 37:57.280]  they must roll out their their national civilian security force that's just as
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.520]  big and just as strong as the US military as Barack Obama said not his
[38:01.520 --> 38:08.560]  agenda he's just putting it into into high gear so it's key because it's key
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.160]  for them their total federal domination the end of the ninth and tenth
[38:12.160 --> 38:18.400]  amendment ahead of this country going into full bankruptcy receivership 42
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.560]  states on the verge of being absorbed by the federal government by the way I
[38:21.560 --> 38:25.800]  wrote his name down I put it in my phone I've got to pull it back up but when I
[38:25.800 --> 38:35.880]  flew to New York the head of one of the biggest banks in the country investment
[38:35.880 --> 38:40.360]  banks was sitting next to me in first class I demanded the view give me first
[38:40.360 --> 38:48.240]  class you know it's Disney's money went on and he knew who I was and tried to
[38:48.240 --> 38:52.280]  convince me the global government wasn't a bad thing and that we should have a
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.080]  global corporation that runs things kind of like the speech that Howard Beals
[38:56.080 --> 39:01.600]  given by the head of the company that owns the network in the network he was
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.240]  trying to explain it all to me and by the end boy he gave me that that that that
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.160]  executive power trip look that only a globalist can give so I've got to go
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.440]  dig it out of my phone later I forget his name but I kind of knew who he was
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.760]  and I searched his name after I got the plane I was like unbelievable who I was
[39:18.760 --> 39:27.040]  sitting next to for three hours it was it was incredible but side issue on that
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.160]  front continuing with the TSA I'll get into all this other news it's key
[39:31.160 --> 39:37.880]  because this is their federal brown shirt Gestapo tent amendment destroying
[39:37.880 --> 39:44.400]  takeover and if we can stop them on this front we'll stop them on every front
[39:44.400 --> 39:48.800]  and if we have political victories like Washington George Washington had a
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.720]  military victory at Trenton against the Hessians it will show people that we
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.680]  have power and we are having more and more victories and the people are
[39:57.680 --> 40:01.880]  learning that there's a sport called real politics and called fighting for
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.960]  liberty that's exciting and dynamic and a lot more fulfilling than paying
[40:06.960 --> 40:13.640]  $300 to go to an NFL football game and buy glasses of $10 beer and eat hot
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.840]  dogs full of MSG that give you heartburn and to be groped by TSA trained
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.520]  thugs at the gate people find out how fulfilling it is to be informed and
[40:22.520 --> 40:26.080]  involved it's addictive to start learning how the world works tracking
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.360]  information and as people begin to more and more discover this the globalist
[40:31.360 --> 40:37.760]  can feel the energy of the of the world's intellect and the will turning
[40:37.760 --> 40:43.280]  against them so it's key because it's it's their tip of the spear but it's
[40:43.280 --> 40:49.160]  even more key and central and a perfect issue because it's something that isn't
[40:49.160 --> 40:53.040]  left or right that's what the media is desperately trying to make it
[40:53.040 --> 41:02.680]  Obama's TSA Obama is doing this because if they can make it about Obama who
[41:02.680 --> 41:06.600]  certainly a horrible teleprompter reading creature but nevertheless a puppet
[41:06.600 --> 41:12.640]  a Marionette then they can basically have all the quote liberals go well my
[41:12.640 --> 41:18.920]  football teams good and so I associate my personal power and my identity with
[41:18.920 --> 41:25.900]  Barack Hussein Obama and so I'm going to support the TSA then because it's
[41:25.900 --> 41:31.240]  being phrased by Fox News and others as something that the liberals are doing you
[41:31.240 --> 41:35.240]  notice Fox News have been critical to TSA though they love the Patriot Act secret
[41:35.240 --> 41:39.400]  arrest torture I mean this is there this is their game this is their bag they
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.920]  should love it but they're playing the part of the anti-establishment right
[41:43.920 --> 41:49.160]  now while while their arm of the New World Order their management team is
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.760]  quasi out of power though you do see them starting to tone down some of the
[41:53.760 --> 41:56.720]  rhetoric now that they can share at the trough controlling the House of
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.600]  Representatives so it's an issue that brings liberals and conservatives
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.760]  together in and around the Fourth Amendment in and around the Tenth
[42:04.760 --> 42:08.720]  Amendment in and around basic human dignity and it brings the people
[42:08.720 --> 42:12.760]  together and the and the social engineers who are masters of divide and
[42:12.760 --> 42:18.200]  conquer of balkanization of playing us off against each other cannot and will
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.040]  not allow and so that's why oh you're gonna have national opt out we're just
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.680]  gonna turn these off almost everywhere we're just gonna play possum until your
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.160]  anger dissipates but you notice it's not dissipating in the Austin line in the
[42:32.160 --> 42:36.760]  New Jersey line I was listening to men and women going I'm not gonna do it I'm
[42:36.760 --> 42:40.600]  gonna opt out and then when they try to touch me I'm gonna say no what are we
[42:40.600 --> 42:44.280]  gonna do what are we gonna do so I sat there in Austin after I went to the
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.880]  checkpoint and in New Jersey when I got off and when I came back on watching
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.760]  people almost no pat downs the ones they did were very light no body scanning
[42:54.760 --> 43:00.160]  and the TSA was extremely polite
[43:01.480 --> 43:05.000]  except for last night right as they were closing it down and I got there and
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.320]  tried to warn them and of course they didn't want to hear hey this radiation
[43:08.320 --> 43:13.480]  is gonna hurt you see I'm the bad man for foretelling them that like if they
[43:13.480 --> 43:20.280]  have a glass of cyanide they're about to drink it I'm telling them not to drink
[43:20.280 --> 43:25.640]  it and they just don't shut up it's good for me but you know denial as they say
[43:25.640 --> 43:33.160]  is not a not a river in Egypt okay again finishing up on that subject and I
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.800]  got a hurry because I got all this other news to get to we got guests coming up
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.640]  you know I have that tendency to spend the first 30 45 minutes on one article
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.480]  instead of getting into all the news after touching your junk TSA wants to
[43:43.480 --> 43:48.560]  scan and harvest your DNA this is from Mike Adams at natural news up on
[43:48.560 --> 43:54.240]  info wars dot com but it's all over the tech magazines all over the news here's
[43:54.240 --> 44:00.200]  a tg daily plans on scanning DNA at checkpoints where they basically get
[44:00.200 --> 44:05.120]  cheek tissue by having you spit or swabbing the inside of your cheek and
[44:05.120 --> 44:12.840]  they're saying that they're testing it to to do identity confirmation and they
[44:12.840 --> 44:18.160]  are moving forward with that so I've told you this is the plan and of course
[44:18.160 --> 44:21.560]  what they start last year in DC they give you a discount on your driver's
[44:21.560 --> 44:28.280]  license fee your registration if you give them a tissue swab or blood test so
[44:28.280 --> 44:34.260]  they're they're beta testing and getting the cadres prepared of DMV workers of
[44:34.260 --> 44:39.320]  TSA to take tissue samples just like they have federal grants the last decade
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.680]  or more now coming to a head here in Austin they do it where they take blood
[44:43.680 --> 44:49.000]  without warrants at checkpoints the police do under a federal grant
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.680]  medicalizing a cadres of police to be medical officers for forced inoculations
[44:54.680 --> 45:01.200]  and more of course before you needed a medical license as a nurse but not
[45:01.200 --> 45:09.640]  anymore the police want to grugal around you know in an RV medical center on the
[45:09.640 --> 45:13.560]  side of I-35 they're gonna do it and if you don't submit we've got a lot of
[45:13.560 --> 45:18.400]  cases where if you don't give the blood test they chain you down and taser you
[45:18.400 --> 45:25.480]  torture THX 1138 might as well have cattle prods just when you think the
[45:25.480 --> 45:28.560]  US Department of Homeland Security has enough wonderful toys to keep them
[45:28.560 --> 45:33.040]  busy they go out and out another get ready for your DNA screening by DHS
[45:33.040 --> 45:37.600]  according to the daily DHS has plans to begin testing a portable DNA scanner the
[45:37.600 --> 45:41.160]  device has not been revealed those reported resembles a desktop printer
[45:41.160 --> 45:44.880]  is expected to make genetic tests far more common especially in cases related
[45:44.880 --> 45:48.840]  to refugees human trafficking immigration yeah sure experts think it will
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.760]  soon make its way into everyday medical and law enforcement usage yeah like
[45:52.760 --> 45:56.480]  they've got thumb scanners going in almost all the police cars or lysis plate
[45:56.480 --> 46:03.120]  reading cameras all Pentagon developed here's another one DNA genetic Pat
[46:03.120 --> 46:08.320]  down introduced to airports by DHS here's our article last year newborns
[46:08.320 --> 46:12.720]  DNA routinely harvested for government biobanks Steve Watson it's not
[46:12.720 --> 46:18.000]  routinely I had I had with three children I've had them threaten me at the
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.880]  hospital and say it's the law and I go show me the law no it's a mandate to the
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.400]  health department you get money for it I'm not doing it you got it and they
[46:27.400 --> 46:32.360]  call an administrator and I say look I'm not stupid just like you tell public
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.240]  school kids it's the law you got to take all these shots there is no law see I
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.560]  mean even if you believe in them secretly taking your blood they lie about
[46:39.560 --> 46:44.200]  it and get caught how many years about have I been the kook for talking about
[46:44.200 --> 46:49.840]  this one it's just all admitted and they get all of us just to play along with
[46:49.840 --> 46:55.200]  our own destruction the TSA workers being roasted by these microwaves the the
[46:55.200 --> 47:00.320]  the DHS and National Guard all over the country with giant mobile scanners just
[47:00.320 --> 47:04.600]  standing under them all day just roasting themselves and and they just think
[47:04.600 --> 47:10.360]  it's magical delusional thinking oh Alex you know we say it's fine here's
[47:10.360 --> 47:15.320]  another one the mail reports America's shocking secret pictures that show how
[47:15.320 --> 47:21.920]  US experiment on its own disabled citizens and prison inmates yeah and this
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.280]  is just a whitewash itself but and of course they always go back to 50 60
[47:27.280 --> 47:33.600]  years ago this stuff's all going on right now continuing here I've got some
[47:33.600 --> 47:36.560]  other news I want to get to later perimeter security in the future of
[47:36.560 --> 47:42.560]  North American integration by Dana Gabriel up on info wars calm Paul Craig
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.840]  Roberts says that CIA may assassinate Julian Assange now that's some of what
[47:47.840 --> 47:52.600]  we're going to be going over on that front but let me go ahead now and get
[47:52.600 --> 47:58.120]  into the situation we'll cover this more with Max Kaiser coming up and then
[47:58.120 --> 48:05.760]  Webster Griffin Tarpley and also Lindsay Williams today US Titans military grip
[48:05.760 --> 48:14.000]  on Gaddafi naval and air forces close in on Libya as David Cameron plans no
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.240]  fly zone to protect civilians yeah when he's not bringing arms dealers to
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.120]  nearby Egypt the same arms dealers that sold the weapons to Gaddafi I'm no fan
[48:23.120 --> 48:28.080]  of Gaddafi everybody knows that but this whole thing is staged this whole
[48:28.080 --> 48:32.160]  domino effect is on record they know that the political climate is there for
[48:32.160 --> 48:38.600]  people to be angry and want to rebel against these disgusting King rats but
[48:38.600 --> 48:42.840]  at the same time meet the new boss same as the old boss when they're done they'll
[48:42.840 --> 48:46.960]  just put something even worse in place it's all part of this domino effect to
[48:46.960 --> 48:53.000]  not just fall in the Middle Eastern North Africa but all over the world we're
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.720]  going to see this continued upheaval unfolding they want no fly zones to shoot
[48:58.720 --> 49:02.600]  down in the aircraft talking about how horrible it is that no more Gaddafi
[49:02.600 --> 49:05.960]  reportedly has been strafing crowds of people even though it's trying to take
[49:05.960 --> 49:09.840]  over military bases but then meanwhile our government has over a thousand drones
[49:09.840 --> 49:14.280]  in Pakistan and Afghanistan and they saw the headline last year that they're
[49:14.280 --> 49:18.680]  killing quote no-name terrorist you got a turban on your head you got an AK-47
[49:18.680 --> 49:22.360]  they're gonna go ahead and kill you they say it's acceptable to kill several
[49:22.360 --> 49:26.800]  hundred people at a wedding or in a market to kill one bad guy no judge no
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.760]  jury it's it's just a robot drone you know drops a hell fire missile on you
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.440]  and but that's good though see when when the people running our country torture
[49:36.440 --> 49:41.560]  somebody or or murder a crowd of people to kill one person that's good but when
[49:41.560 --> 49:45.800]  somebody else does it there's all this moralizing and hyperventilating and oh
[49:45.800 --> 49:52.840]  my gosh Gaddafi is such a monster oh my goodness gracious gum drops this is
[49:52.840 --> 49:58.200]  just terrible and the aircraft carriers are mashing and NATO's gearing up and
[49:58.200 --> 50:02.680]  oh they're now US special forces are there reportedly backing the rebels and
[50:02.680 --> 50:08.240]  Gaddafi has again failed to retake territory in a six-hour battle with
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.040]  rebels Libyan soldiers and paramilitary loyal to Muammar Gaddafi at
[50:13.040 --> 50:17.200]  husband Tuesday to retake territory that has been seized by rebels but neither
[50:17.200 --> 50:20.360]  side appeared to gain ground according to accounts of the fighting from
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.240]  residents and officials with the opposition movement the Washington
[50:25.240 --> 50:30.280]  Post reports here's Paul Joseph Watson's detailed report at prisonplanet.com
[50:30.280 --> 50:37.080]  report US special forces arrive in Libya yeah they arrived it's like saying the
[50:37.080 --> 50:41.600]  Mayflower just arrived two days ago they've been there the whole time ladies
[50:41.600 --> 50:47.080]  and gentlemen and that's on record just like they've been in inside Iran for the
[50:47.080 --> 50:51.840]  last decade stirring things up most Americans strongly oppose US military
[50:51.840 --> 50:56.080]  action in Libya well what did Gates say a few months ago he said about Afghanistan
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.200]  he said I don't care of almost 70% of Americans don't want us to be there I
[50:59.200 --> 51:03.200]  don't care what you want this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[51:07.640 --> 51:11.680]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[51:11.680 --> 51:15.600]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[51:15.600 --> 51:19.600]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[51:19.600 --> 51:24.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[51:24.160 --> 51:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.960]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:31.960 --> 51:35.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[51:35.600 --> 51:39.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[51:39.960 --> 51:43.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[51:43.120 --> 51:46.760]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[52:25.800 --> 52:30.280]  invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[52:30.280 --> 52:34.520]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe
[52:34.520 --> 52:38.400]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.600]  global financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so
[52:42.600 --> 52:46.920]  it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[54:28.280 --> 54:39.160]  Beirut they're in Lebanon continuing with the situation we've got a big
[54:39.160 --> 54:43.560]  magazine reporter here today and he was saying he doesn't quite understand what
[54:43.560 --> 54:48.960]  we're getting at talking about the West triggering this domino effect the
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.840]  dominoes are already set up the main driver is global dollar devaluation
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.280]  being the world reserve currency with rampant speculation again driven by that
[54:58.280 --> 55:02.960]  driving up basic commodity prices in most of these third world nations the
[55:02.960 --> 55:09.080]  people make two dollars a day or less around half of their earnings in places
[55:09.080 --> 55:16.200]  like Egypt are spent on fuel and food basic subsistence necessities and so the
[55:16.200 --> 55:19.800]  climate is now there and it's like a controlled burn when you know a forest
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.840]  fires coming to try to control the outcome of that and that's basically
[55:24.840 --> 55:29.720]  part of the equation but we'll get more into it with Max Kaiser we'll get more
[55:29.720 --> 55:34.040]  into it with Pastor Lindsey Williams from his big oil company inside
[55:34.040 --> 55:40.040]  connections and we'll get more into it with Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up
[55:40.040 --> 55:45.680]  today but important report by Paul Joseph Watson at info wars.com US
[55:45.680 --> 55:53.800]  special forces arrive in Libya another war another proxy war US special forces
[55:53.800 --> 55:57.600]  have reportedly landed in Libya to train anti-Qaddafi rebels as a western
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.360]  back coup d'etat on the oil rich nation nears with British and French defense
[56:01.360 --> 56:05.200]  advisors that's in quotes also arriving to set up training bases in the rebel
[56:05.200 --> 56:10.440]  controlled eastern region of the country this is global empire neo-colonialism
[56:10.440 --> 56:13.920]  according to a report in the Pakistan observer hundreds of special forces
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.480]  personnel from the US Britain and France arrived February 23rd 24th in
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.160]  American and French warships and small naval boats off Libyan ports it
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.440]  continues so we're going to continue to break that down and see if that's true
[56:27.440 --> 56:30.920]  but we've seen all the indicators that it is and we know that that country's
[56:30.920 --> 56:35.760]  been riddled with a globalist spies and operatives for a long time again Curt
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.240]  Nemo's article reports that most Americans strongly opposed US military
[56:39.240 --> 56:43.280]  action in Libya according to Rasmussen a large majority of Americans agree with
[56:43.280 --> 56:46.600]  a common sense of George Washington during his farewell address the first
[56:46.600 --> 56:49.600]  president of the United States said the nation should beware of foreign
[56:49.600 --> 56:53.560]  entanglements on February 23rd Rasmussen reported that 67% of Americans
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.840]  strongly believe the United States should stay out of Libya and the Middle
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.720]  East similar numbers won us out of Afghanistan but again Gates secretary
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.840]  defense says he doesn't care the globalist their handpicked government in
[57:05.840 --> 57:08.800]  the district of criminals in the Pentagon are not listening they have
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.040]  dispatched the USS Enterprise and other warships to the waters off Libya the
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.720]  Enterprise was conveniently close having squandered millions of taxpayer
[57:17.720 --> 57:21.920]  dollars confronting ragtag pirates millions about billions off the Somali
[57:21.920 --> 57:27.880]  coast the Pentagon will not confirm one way or the other if its instructions to
[57:27.880 --> 57:31.720]  set up a no-fly zone and begin bombing the North African nation according to
[57:31.720 --> 57:35.880]  Colonel David Lappin a Pentagon spokesman the US military is moving
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.600]  ships closer to Libya in case they are needed here's the London independent
[57:41.600 --> 57:45.400]  reporting the price of food as I mentioned earlier is at the heart of this
[57:45.400 --> 57:49.160]  wave of revolutions no one saw the uprisings coming up really we said
[57:49.160 --> 57:53.120]  exactly what was gonna happen four months ago but their deeper cause isn't hard to
[57:53.120 --> 57:58.920]  fathom and it goes over the numbers here's a Paul Watson article also
[57:58.920 --> 58:04.080]  dealing with what's happening Obama encircles US war machine around Libya
[58:04.080 --> 58:10.000]  going through all the details on that front Saudi activists I protest wait
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.480]  for new cabinet Saudi Kings handed out 37 billion dollars and returned for
[58:15.480 --> 58:20.680]  medical treatment in Europe but I try to keep his country from falling again
[58:20.680 --> 58:26.480]  British created out of two nations there's other polls and reports are the
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.840]  Libyans don't want globalist intervention so that is all coming up but
[58:30.840 --> 58:35.400]  straight ahead we're gonna try to get Max Kaiser connected from Beirut and
[58:35.400 --> 58:43.680]  then we're gonna get into Bernie Madoff in this jailhouse interview thank you
[58:43.680 --> 58:53.640]  for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hundreds of nations have fallen
[58:53.640 --> 58:58.480]  to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[58:58.480 --> 59:02.760]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from
[59:02.760 --> 59:06.720]  underneath the Americans at home turning menace influence on our
[59:06.720 --> 59:10.920]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[59:10.920 --> 59:16.160]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[59:16.160 --> 59:21.320]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[59:21.320 --> 59:25.680]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[59:25.680 --> 59:29.840]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[59:29.840 --> 59:33.320]  Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody
[59:33.320 --> 59:39.560]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get

[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.520]  thank you for joining us of your station just dialed us in it is Tuesday the
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:36.400]  first day of March 2011 we got Max Kaiser joining us here in a few minutes
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:44.560]  from Lebanon there in Beirut we've got pastor Lindsey Williams live joining us
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.280]  part three of the interview we started a few weeks ago we've got Webster Griffin
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.160]  entirely on the economy and what's happening the Middle East North Africa in
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:58.240]  the last 30 minutes of the broadcast I also want to get if Kaiser wants to talk
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.560]  about it as a side issue Bernie Madoff coming out and telling the truth says
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.760]  whole government is a Ponzi scheme well this is the founder of the Nasdaq they're
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.840]  going oh well he's a crook don't listen to him why don't need Bernie Madoff to
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.720]  tell me the whole government's a Ponzi scheme since the 1913 takeover of the
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.160]  Federal Reserve has devalued our currency almost down to nothing and no
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.040]  matter how much we put into it how much tax money how many unions we cut it's
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.400]  all just putting perfume on a pig putting lipstick on a pig it does
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.640]  nothing you get rid of fractional reserve banking you have the Congress
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.080]  take back control the issuance of currency and credit we follow Ron Paul's
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.160]  plan and we could fix it if you don't we're going to be just like every other
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.320]  third-world country and that's the globalist system to bring us into
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:45.480]  economic bondage and Joseph Stick lets when he quit the World Bank in 2002 the
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.320]  documents got leaked we're not saying he did it where the IMF and World Bank
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.400]  cold-bloodedly planned this for third-world countries as well as the
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:02:00.080]  West but joining us now from Beirut is Max Kaiser on the situation in Lebanon
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.160]  we're starting to see rockets being fired again we've seen confirmed media
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:11.040]  reports of blackwater now XC working with the biggest mercenary firm out of
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.480]  South Africa in North Africa in Somalia Max says he has intel on
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.800]  blackwater training in Israel and planning a strike on Lebanon remember a
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.240]  year before Iceland fell to the bankers Max predicted it because he had inside
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.280]  sources he didn't predict that he knew it so we have to listen to Max Max good
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.560]  to have you here with us welcome to be back yes I'm here in sunny Beirut
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:41.280]  Lebanon and the word on the street is that we're waiting to hear about
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:48.720]  indictments from the UN relating to the Hariri assassination in 2005 and that
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.520]  Israel setting up some blackwater operatives to come in on the back of
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:59.920]  that announcement and start trouble again in Lebanon and so Israel not wanting
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.080]  to strike themselves because of the public relations disaster that would
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.400]  pose they're trying to fair it into the country blackwater operatives at this
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.920]  time and so that's kind of the buzz on the street everything hinges on this
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.920]  announcement on these indictments coming down on the Hariri assassination well
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.920]  can you I mean do you have anything that's bonafide or it's just your
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.240]  sources on the street well that's the buzz you know this is that just two years
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.400]  ago there is a 80 people got shot down dead in the middle of this two blocks
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:37.680]  where I'm staying as part of sectarian uprising you know Hezbollah is trying to
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:43.520]  protect the interests of Lebanon and Israel of course and and their allies
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.320]  are trying to tear the country apart so there's always a ready state of
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.320]  alertness I would say in the city of Beirut it's funny because you go down
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.880]  the street right now everything is calm and quiet but beneath the surface it
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.040]  can explode at any second so it gives this town a unique feeling a unique
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:07.480]  buzz all right I want to come back from break and get into why is Max Kaiser
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:15.440]  RT host Al Jazeera host BBC host Genesis Saturday morning radio host why

[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.520]  moment so don't start yet and then I want to shift gears into just the larger
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.840]  geopolitical area that you're nesting in right now max I want to talk about your
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:36.400]  view on what's happening in Egypt what's happening in Tripoli with Muammar
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:43.080]  Gaddafi in Libya the tanks rolling out to suppress people in the streets in
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:48.760]  Bahrain and other areas of Saudi Arabia I want to get your view on all of that
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.160]  and then Bernie Madoff's jailhouse interview saying the whole government's
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:05:01.000]  a Ponzi scheme swindler tells New York magazine I destroyed our family well there I but this is
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.360]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.560]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.840]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.200]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.280]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.800]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.920]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.600]  that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.840]  50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop

[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.200]  of GM Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.240]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he

[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.680]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress

[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.840]  many other economists and financial research we have on saying as the
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.280]  dollar devalues as the world reserve currency is going to trigger food riots
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:58.040]  and we've been seeing those intensify that clearly is one of the main
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.880]  ingredients in the political atmosphere but there's clear evidence that the
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:06.520]  globalist have decided themselves to trigger it so they can try to control it
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.920]  max why are you in Lebanon you wanted to go see all this for yourself money in
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.640]  motion money is in motion Alex Jones you've got revolutions happening all
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.960]  over the region North Africa Middle East and there's billions of dollars
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.280]  moving around and I'm talking with people meeting with bankers meeting with
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.360]  fund managers and high net worth individuals convincing them to buy
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.240]  silver and gold that principally silver as part of the war against JP Morgan
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.600]  to crash a few more gonna buy silver so I'm talking to people represent
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.760]  billions and billions of dollars I've got a Cairo tomorrow and you can see in
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.440]  the price of silver in a new 30 year high today gold is hovering at a new all-time
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.560]  high today it's the global insurrection against banker occupation when I
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.400]  explained to these people in Cairo and in Beirut and across the region that
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.840]  everyone's revolting the revolutions are all tied to the same guys the same
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.000]  corrupt bankers you know the housing the barbarics of the world are just puppets
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.800]  for the same Goldman Sachs JP Morgan scum so by buying so what do you see being
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.280]  behind all this then right now JP Morgan JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs the
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.000]  Wall Street banks are behind all of the puppet regimes because they're they
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.440]  milked them for all their worth so now that this money is in motion because
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.800]  anytime you've got regime change as you have people are moving lots of money
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.000]  and by the way you know I was on your show last six months ago when the UBS
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.280]  scandal hit and the credit Swiss scandal hit about how these banks in
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.680]  Switzerland were caught hiding money and laundering money I said at the time
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.200]  six months ago I don't know if you remember this but I said at the time
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.880]  that a lot of that money is gonna go to Tel Aviv it just came out today in the
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:54.280]  financial times you can look it up then in fact now Tel Aviv has been mentioned
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:00.640]  as the primary source where those funds are have gone after the all the UBS
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.800]  bankers advised their clients to get out of Switzerland and to put into Tel Aviv
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.800]  so Tel Aviv emerged as the new money laundering Switzerland but anytime you've
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.200]  got regime change like you do now it's billions are in motion so I know from
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.160]  my years on Wall Street that's the sweet spot that's the best time to go in and
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.720]  pitch people as to where that money should go some telling people directing
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.040]  this into precious metals gold and silver as a way to overthrow these the
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.480]  master regime JP Morgan Goldman Sachs the regime of the regime this is the way to
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.920]  take it down and we're seeing for example in Italy another big story that
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.400]  just came out I don't know if you saw it but bankers in Italy are now asking the
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.920]  government to go back to a gold standard yes I did see that what do you make of
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.400]  last week the Egyptian government moving to ban people taking gold out of the
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:55.440]  country well this is like I said there's huge there's huge currents
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.320]  cross currents and money is in motion so the people with the most money of
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:07.440]  course they don't respect boundaries much but they've got incredible buying
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.800]  power let me ask you this question we know that it's these big globalist
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.120]  interest that have you know used Switzerland the Caimans and other
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.680]  Luxembourg other areas is safe havens to hide their money I've noticed most of
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.640]  the people they've been targeting are folks that have hidden 5 10 15 20 million
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.800]  which sounds like a lot to you or I or the average Joe but his chicken feet so
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.960]  they're really not targeting the people that are hiding billions but we do see
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.840]  the Israel lobbying and others you know I've noticed a lot of you know their
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.840]  senators and house members have been really pushing to go after Switzerland
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:47.000]  is that so they can knock them out as the main money laundering slash tax haven
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.120]  and make Israel the new tax haven I mean is that just basically Israel trying to
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.600]  knock out their competition well that's what I said six months ago yeah that the
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.720]  that the u.s. in Israel wanted that business they didn't want to know you
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.920]  said that you even wrote about it you said that yeah your own record max
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.240]  Switzerland when the u.s. Israel can take that business and that's exactly what
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.400]  they did and that's what they're doing and that's it now it's come out in the
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.160]  press today there was a first story I saw on mainstream press that said yeah
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:17.120]  well the UBS bankers are now going for another round of investigation because
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.880]  it's come out that they directed the clients when they were under
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.920]  investigation to go and open accounts in Israel and other places but look at this
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.800]  story that just came out today Alex financial Times quote from the Pentagon
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.400]  financial terrorism suspected in the 2008 economic crash now on your show I
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.480]  refer to the 2008 crash as a direct result of financial terrorism let me
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.720]  stop you I've sold it again we're not tuning our horn here we're calling it
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:50.720]  exactly like it is in Obama deception and fall the Republic which you're in you
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.920]  we all call it financial terrorism we broke here first when we got the
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:04.800]  congressman on from California Brad Sherman he came on the show then later
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.840]  senator inhofe confirmed and that's what I was arguing with this big banker on
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.160]  the airplane about with when I flew to New York this weekend he was saying well
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.400]  Paul said meant we would have martial law if things collapsed no they went to
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.440]  the House and Senate in closed-door meetings Paulson Bernanke and others
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:26.240]  and said we will have total implosion we will have martial law if you don't do
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.960]  this and then when Congress was getting a thousand to one phone calls and that's
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.920]  what Barbara Boxer reported or was it Feinstein a thousand to one phone calls
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:41.680]  against the banker bailout takeover it was on record that the the head of the
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.120]  Treasury the head of the private Fed they all went out and said it's over
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.600]  depression and destroyed confidence themselves and engaged in financial
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.080]  terrorism then last year you called it that thousand point drop in a day was a
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.600]  shot across the bow and and now and now the Pentagon saying oh my gosh that was
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.280]  financial terrorism but they're going to claim that the Easter Bunny did it well
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.840]  they're claiming it came from the mid-east
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.200]  Islamic states or the Chinese military it says right here in this story
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.680]  sufficient justification to question whether outside forces triggered the 2008
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.880]  using financial terrorism coming from the Middle East state Islamic terrorist or
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.720]  Chinese military well the same thing six months ago but with Stuxnet and Israel
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.000]  in the US brag that they jointly developed the Stuxnet but then I see
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.080]  headlines government says we must have cyber security act that takes over the
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.480]  web the internet kill switch because of things like Stuxnet when they launched
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.400]  it well who has the most advanced financial terrorist weapons in the
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.200]  world it's Wall Street JPMorgan Goldman Sachs high-frequency trading
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.120]  algorithmic trading all of the things we did cost the crash of 2008 as we talked
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.560]  about on your show were the result of by crashing the system on purpose it wasn't
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.000]  something that was came out of nowhere it wasn't economic it was it it was an
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.840]  act of financial terrorism and we've seen it since then now the Pentagon in this
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.400]  report is calling it for what it is acts of financial terrorism they
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.160]  mistakenly point the figure to outside forces they need to point the figure at
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.400]  the finger at what's happening internally on Wall Street because that's the
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.880]  source of it max again you'll be reporting for us more in the next few
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.040]  days when you get to Egypt but what do you make of the jailhouse interview that
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.760]  New York magazine broke over the weekend where Madoff says whole government is a
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  Ponzi scheme Goldman Sachs is a Ponzi scheme we don't need Madoff to tell us
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.640]  that and he is the founder of the Nasdaq but really what he's done is small
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:43.360]  fry compared to the 1500 quadrillion in derivatives created that they've gotten
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:49.600]  us to basically underwrite with our with our tax money with our labor I mean
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.200]  Bernie Madoff is talking about the trillion ton elephant here in the
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.920]  living room it's counterfeiting you know goes even the Ponzi scheme at the end
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.120]  of the Ponzi scheme at least it starts off with a dollar and then you go through
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.080]  Ponzi scheme and but there's something at the end of the day that started the
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.400]  Ponzi scheme but this is actually just ranked counterfeiting US Treasury bonds
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.800]  are being counterfeited there they're being issued with no collateral
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.120]  whatsoever there's nothing in the piggy bank to justify any of the issuance of
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.280]  the US trade and now and now instead of the Ponzi scheme operator going to
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.120]  prison like Madoff the bankers hold you hostage at the end of the Ponzi scheme
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.320]  and say give us everything and then we'll fix it but then it always only gets
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.120]  worse I mean how many times can they pull off this trick well I mean okay
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:39.560]  just to do a search for a story just looking at here it's called the
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.640]  counterfeit economy and it just goes into these great details it's a great
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.160]  story that just came out in the last half an hour but it just talks about the
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.440]  fact that at the at the core of this of this economy this financial system you've
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.480]  got what basically our counterfeit operations counterfeit US Treasury bonds
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.880]  how long can it go on well if you look at the price the dollar is is cold is
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.840]  moving sharply lower and precious metals are moving sharply higher that I mean
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.320]  that's your litmus test that's your barometer of how long can go on as
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.640]  gold keeps going higher because the world is saying we don't want your
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.960]  counterfeit money anymore so it's going higher that are the banksters approaching
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.640]  their water loom well I think that as I've said on your show many times before
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.920]  that the day will come when the announcement made that the US dollar is
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:32.480]  devalued by 50 or 60 percent in one day and the gold will be a lot higher three
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.480]  four five thousand dollars an ounce and then you know it'll be too late to do
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.440]  anything at that time but that they'll happen in it all of these types of
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.360]  devaluation to be looked historically they happen overnight they don't talk
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.720]  about it for six months well it incrementally happens and then comes to
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.680]  a head then they do it overnight they do it in one flip and swoop and this is
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.160]  that they've been the history of it and that's coming in because the world is
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.120]  rejecting the dollar that's why the dollar is hitting new interim lows today
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.920]  gold's hitting a new all-time high today it's happening right about last week
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.800]  when they had a treasury auction and people didn't buy the US government is
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.640]  buying its own treasury the US government issues bonds and then the US government
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.160]  buys its own bond and also this rally in the in the Dow Jones for example if you
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.200]  look at the ratio of insiders buying to selling something like a two hundred
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.840]  million dollars worth of insiders but billions tens of billions sold in the
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.640]  last quarter insiders are getting out of this market the only thing keeping the
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:36.760]  Dow Jones up to where the levels are now are the artificial buying by bots and
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.920]  algorithmic trading on the floor the exchange again acts of financial

[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.360]  Thursday graciously max geyser max geyser dot com but but you can really see
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.360]  him getting ready and saying oh we're gonna have a recession now we never
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.160]  left it we're in a depression because of what's happening the Middle East and now
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.120]  they're saying oh there may be a cyber attack or even a solar flare that knocks
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.560]  out the satellites and and destroys the stock market they're really introducing
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.640]  into the public mind that there's gonna be this big financial attack and it's
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.920]  gonna cause the depression and then they'll tell all the yuppies that and
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:41.800]  then they'll they'll they'll hate brown men in caves for losing their 401ks
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.800]  what do you see happening I see the people in Wisconsin who are revolting
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:53.640]  against the corrupt governor there joining forces with people in the other
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.080]  nations that are in state of revolution as part of the global insurrection so
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.440]  in Madison, Wisconsin they've got a revolution going on you got a corrupt
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.920]  banker who runs the place this guy Scott some Scott Walker who's a tool of the
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.160]  Koch brothers and the people are revolting just like the people in
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.240]  Tunis and the people in Cairo well being Cairo tomorrow and people are talking
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.200]  about the people in Madison, Wisconsin and the people in the US the people in
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.600]  Athens the people in Dublin they all have common cause we're all beings
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.640]  subjected to tyranny by these banks well Max I think it's over wherever I go I
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.240]  go to him into Beirut I meet people in the cafe who pull out a silver dollar
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.120]  they know the story they said I bought my silver Max we're gonna crush JP Morgan
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.360]  this isn't Beirut Lebanon I expect to see this here the same thing in Cairo
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.480]  Egypt tomorrow it's a global revolution against these tyrannical bankers and by
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.600]  the way you don't blow hot air another historical thing I'm proud that you
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:54.040]  launched Operation Crush JP Morgan here on this show it was the 11th of
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:58.880]  November silver was 26 and a half it's now 34 and a half that's in less than
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.960]  what three or four months we're crushing it but but I don't want to give you I
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:09.720]  don't want to give you an eye well I don't want to give you an eye all the
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:13.160]  credit even the listeners we could see the writing on the wall and basically
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:18.040]  pointed it out but I I I do want to give you the credit for the idea Max it's
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.240]  amazing but but you know this whole man is he did the Google bomb and that's
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.560]  what made the thing work okay the idea of buying silver academically that was
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.240]  made sense on paper but you fly the info wars Google bomb and it had a
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.960]  devastating effect I noticed that Google is changing all their algorithms are
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.120]  they trying to is that part of the info wars yes no they're they're trying to
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:43.640]  block us they've said it's for alternative media websites and aggregators
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.360]  though we have a lot of original news as well they don't like our analysis and
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.240]  Google's blocked us out of Google news but our listeners are spreading the
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.720]  word faster and faster and because the people power is bigger than the
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.200]  authoritarian regimes whether it's Google or the political powers in North
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.760]  Africa or the walk Scott Walker in Wisconsin well everyone's on the march
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.280]  as Victor Hugo said no army can stop an idea whose time has come but when
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.960]  you're back on and about 48 hours on Thursday with us we'll get more into
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.040]  the situation I don't see the unions as the good guys or Walker as the good guy
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:23.440]  it's more sophisticated you notice the cops normally love beating up
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.440]  protesters all over the country but then now they're there because they know
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.080]  they might get their money cut I see this is kind of government people finding
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.400]  out they've been robbed by the banksters and now kind of waking up but if I did
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.320]  see the cops you know not attack an anti-war demonstration or not attack a
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.240]  group like that then maybe I'd feel better but you know there look we're
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.680]  running out of money we're bankrupt but I do agree with the fact because the
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.160]  numbers are there you could cut all the union money you could cut all the
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.000]  government it wouldn't pay a paltry amount of the overall you know trillions
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:04.720]  and trillions owed via fraud 244 billion and bonuses what do you mean we're
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.960]  running out of money you mean the bank stole all the money well that's exactly
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.560]  I'm saying you go after the bankers you don't have the red herring of all these
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.680]  republicans saying we'll fix it we'll cut the unions money I'm saying that's
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:24.680]  like a micron of the overall spending as you know max yeah absolutely the left
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:27.520]  right thing is not that the people who are demonstrating in Madison need to
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.120]  join hands with the rest of the revolutionaries around the world and
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.240]  understand the true dynamic of what they're oppression is what we liberals
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.840]  need to run Gadsden flags up buy guns join the true rebellion they don't want
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:42.360]  us to they don't want us to all come together max good hearing from you we'll

[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.520]  take a photo of them and there on the left you can see Barbara Walters and
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.640]  they're on the right you can see whoopee Goldberg and it was it was really nice
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:27.760]  to meet them in person because I had had a chance over the years to watch them
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.440]  on television but if you want to see a photo of them that I took just just go
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:40.440]  to go to your NSA CIA spy center Google dot com and type in skexie and you'll be
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.880]  able to see a candid photo when they didn't have their cloaking devices on
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.160]  and and I was actually able to take a photo it was David Ike was there with
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.000]  me and I was actually able to take a photo of them shape-shifting again I'm
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.760]  joking before the news goes with this and says I really think it's there's
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.920]  that there's gexies yeah those are the creatures from the dark crystal that's
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.680]  basically how they were behaving when the segment and they were going
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:19.880]  Walters was so more like a cross between David Rockefeller salacious crumb and
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.400]  the head skexie back let's go to YouTube now that I've gotten off of this we're
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.960]  gonna get serious go to Lindsay Williams pull up a YouTube clip of Skexies
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:31.200]  but let's play a short clip of Skexies for people who are watching this on
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:38.000]  prisonplanet.tv so people will know exactly exactly what I'm what I'm talking
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.800]  about because the only way to describe and I've been mean to whoopee Goldberg
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:47.520]  too but and in fact I'm you know this is all gallows humor I'm actually a
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.240]  little bit depressed over the whole Charlie Sheen thing I did not intend for
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.280]  that to happen when he was on air with me he's happy and standing up to he thinks
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:57.840]  he's been wronged I think he has at many levels but he's a good friend of mine and
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:05.600]  I just hope all of this ends well on that front we find a YouTube clip of just
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.960]  type the dark crystal into YouTube you'll get it instantly because this is
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.320]  this is key information here ladies and gentlemen all right now I'm digressing
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:19.320]  into silliness and I apologize you know here's the news oil climbs despite
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:26.120]  Saudi output pledge world oil prices advanced on Tuesday's by an OPEC
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:30.440]  kingpin Saudi Arabia pledged to ensure sufficient supplies to cover Libya's
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:36.600]  production shortfall Brent North Sea crude for April delivery rose 67 cents to
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:43.720]  $112.47 a barrel Golden Silver has also exploded in prices and again all of
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.680]  this is driven by overall dollar devaluation do you remember in mid
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.040]  October Lindsay Williams who was the chaplain for Atlantic Richfield and in
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.480]  on other big meetings as chaplains are very important position Ken Fromm was
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.480]  the head of operations for Atlantic Richfield and for years he fed
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.480]  information Lindsay Mr. Fromm died last December so we can now reveal his name
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.920]  and talk about it he has another oil company exact who was actually the
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.280]  CEO of a company I'll just leave it at that who is alive and told him in
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.200]  October watch in the next six months to a year oil prices at least 150 watch the
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:23.920]  Middle East explode the Lindsay said you mean war and he said no
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.440]  destabilization Lindsay really has broken a lot of this now but I wanted to
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:35.400]  have him back up for a part 3 interview because listeners have demanded it to
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.000]  kind of go back into the history of Ken Fromm and the larger geopolitical
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.240]  ramifications of the double crossing of the Arabs and North Africans the
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.520]  Treasury deal signed with them back in the 1970s with Henry Kissinger and I
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.440]  also have a major magazine reporter here should I mention who's here magazine
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:38:01.680]  reporter well we got the New York magazines here and he was asking me
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.800]  during the break because I mean we've covered this all in such detail over and
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:11.440]  over again that I tend to just do it do a gestalt or gestalt where we'll just
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:16.400]  kind of boil down what's happening even single explain to me why the West would
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.800]  want to trigger the implosion of these countries it doesn't mean the rebellions
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.480]  aren't real it doesn't mean people don't have a real beef or a reason to be upset
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:31.400]  and angry what it does signify is that the political climate was already there
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.920]  mainly over food and energy prices going up with people living you know at
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:41.640]  subsistence levels and so they send in albarity the week before it's all
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.400]  triggered five weeks ago to start the ball rolling in Egypt they've got their
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.960]  special operatives there run out of the State Department even the Washington
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.440]  Post reports that in Libya they're in there trying to gauge and control what's
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:39:00.080]  happening in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has now sent tanks to riot hit Bahrain
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:06.120]  it's being reported by RAA Novostat Saudi Arabia sent dozens of tanks to
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.480]  Bahrain where anti-government protests continued for about two weeks Egypt's
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.600]  al-Mazari al-Yom newspaper said today eyewitnesses reported seeing 15 tank
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:19.120]  carriers carrying two tanks each heading towards Bahrain along 25 kilometer
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.440]  King Fahd causeway which links the small island nation of Bahrain to Saudi
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:29.040]  Arabia protesters are mainly Shiites according account for about 70% of the
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.680]  Bahrainian population so this thing is going all over the world and so Lindsay
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.840]  Williams great to have you back with us recap just just as fast as you can as
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:46.280]  we're limited on time we appreciate you joining us recap what the double cross of
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:50.640]  the Arabs means what dollar the valuation means what you've been told of the
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.520]  reopening up of government-controlled oil production all over the United States
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:01.600]  including obviously up in Alaska that key sector and how that's going to affect
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.280]  us and let's go back to the stories about Ken from never told before and
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.840]  some of the things you can reveal from history that let us chart the future for
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:19.240]  the first time Alex I honestly wish I could say I was wrong instead I'm going
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:26.920]  to have to say this morning I told you so I don't know how to even express the
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:34.000]  way I feel this morning with Saudi Arabia moving tanks and troops right now as
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.400]  this program is on the air moving tanks and troops into Bahrain Bahrain is where
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.520]  they're all goes out and then through the start of our moves Saudi Arabia is a
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.920]  number one supplier of crude oil for the United States of America it has already
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:54.520]  been stated by where street that if there's a problem whatsoever in just one
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:41:03.480]  mirror mideast country that the price of crude oil is going to go to $225 now
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:10.480]  this was stated by a major Wall Street broker overnight where I live just at the
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:17.360]  gas pump gasoline went up 12 cents that's last night right now the first day of
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:23.120]  March it went up 12 cents a gallon to gas pump Saudi Arabia stock market this
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:32.480]  morning is reported dropped 6.8% overnight we're in trouble I have begged
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:38.400]  people to listen to me now for months as you know five months ago I stated on
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.400]  your program there's going to be a crisis in the Middle East I did not
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.680]  realize how far the elite were going to take it I knew that the dollar was going
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.960]  to be lit dead by the end of 2012 I knew because they had already told me that
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:59.200]  the price of crude oil was going from 175 to 200 dollars a barrel within nine
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:05.280]  to 12 months I'm beginning to believe that they have accelerated their timeline
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.240]  I have not been told that but it sure looks like well that was four and a half
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.440]  months ago and you said to be technical 150 to 200 and so it's right on time for
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.200]  the acceleration they said that we would see in six months and you're on record
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:24.240]  telling us that that's right it was on your program I I tried my best to warn
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.440]  people and by the way I know who the living former oil company big three
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:32.540]  CEO as we just obviously can't reveal his name we can reveal the other Mr. X
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:36.820]  can from because he's unfortunately passed but this is real folks it's on
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:42.240]  record and you heard it here first go ahead so I have to say one other thing
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:47.240]  that's more struggling than any of this this is going to drastically affect the
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:51.680]  economy the United States of America the price of your groceries everything that
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:56.360]  you do is going to be drastically affected as a result of this but there's
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:01.600]  one thing that to me is more startling than any of this we just got it the other
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:07.080]  day I don't think I gave it on your program before we were able to secure
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:13.880]  video and sound bite and Alex I'm sorry but I cannot apologize this morning for
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:20.680]  what we've just produced but I'll have to tell you we were just able to secure a
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:29.000]  sound video bite of chanting during the time of the Egyptian revolution and you
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:35.960]  will see it it is in the language of Egypt but yet the words in English we're
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.480]  putting over the top for that to try are you talking about stuff on YouTube
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.160]  where they're chanting death to Israel question back over a week ago when I was
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:47.720]  on your program you said Lindsey House is going to affect Israel well I have your
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:53.080]  answer for you they were chanting now this is a Muslim brotherhood at the time
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:59.160]  of the Egyptian riots and the Muslim brotherhood was chanting here we go
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.720]  folks please you need to write this down put it beside your calendar here's what
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:09.400]  they chanted quote to Jerusalem we are headed
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:14.800]  martyrs in the millions you haven't seen this Alex Alex have you seen the
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.320]  footage on this I've seen footage where they're chanting we're going to get
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:23.240]  Israel death Israel we're going to take back Jerusalem I think that but I saw
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.720]  that on YouTube about a week ago is that what you're talking about no no no
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:31.960]  this is another one this is one that I really don't know where our producers
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:37.360]  got it but this this is amazing you see it you can't doubt it you can hear it
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.600]  in the Egyptian language let's expand on that because from your research and
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.800]  and and what the oil company exec told you they are triggering this why do they
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.400]  want to trigger this unrest is it order out of chaos for the newspaper
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.920]  magazine reporter from New York magazine sitting in there explain to him first
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.200]  the double crossing of the Arabs what it means and the fuse it's lighting
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:05.320]  globally when Mr. Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State this was after of
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.480]  course there are fields have been produced by the Arab you remember that
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.880]  American oil companies the majors that have been formed at the time off the
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:21.640]  spindle top 1901 Beaumont Texas first time major oil found in America and of
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:26.600]  course the whole world was needing crude oil at that time to to fuel everything
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:32.320]  Texaco she all standard oil she ever on they all was found in the Arab world
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.080]  over 60 years ago these majors went in the Arabs didn't have the money to
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:40.960]  produce their own oil fields they couldn't do it they would have been
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:44.600]  prior to that nothing but no man's room because that's a spot in camels and all
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:49.480]  of a sudden out of a clear blue sky this oil is found these majors Texas
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.480]  Coastal Standard Oil and Chevron said we will produce your oil field we will
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:03.400]  build them for you and you pass back as you sell the oil then when Mr. Henry
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.440]  Kissinger was Secretary of State this is where the double cross began he went
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:14.000]  aboard to every one of these Middle East oil companies countries that were now
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.280]  producing oil they had paid the Americans back for what they had built in
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:24.600]  their oil fields and he said I'd like to cut you a deal he said we will not
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.800]  produce from our own soil this is so significant we will not produce from our
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.160]  own soil we know it's here but he said we will not produce from our own soil we
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:39.800]  will buy oil for you from you and the thing that we asked is that you take a
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.320]  certain percentage and they never told me the percentage they just told me they
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.360]  did it that we will buy did you take a certain percentage of what we buy oil from
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:55.080]  you with and turn around and buy our Federal Reserve oh please folks I'm
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:01.560]  pleading with you to hear this and to analyze what is being said buy our
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:07.960]  Federal Reserve tables and issues at this point it is obvious that they knew
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:12.600]  that America was coming to the financial crisis that it is today because
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:19.160]  somebody had to buy the interest on the debt never mind the $14 trillion debt
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:24.320]  that is not even in heaven that's insignificant the interest on the debt
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:31.040]  must be paid how is that interest on the debt paid it is paid by our producing
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.720]  countries by China by Japan by super rich people buying TBS which were
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.840]  considered to be the most secure currency on the face of the earth it was the
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.160]  reserve currency of the world so to speak the American dollar and it can get
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:54.800]  history said you buy our treasury issues our TBS we will buy your yes and they
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:00.960]  have felt the majority of the interest on the American debt over these years now
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:06.120]  they intentionally by design the Muslim Brotherhood is being supported by the
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:12.640]  elite I guarantee you I have ways of knowing this and they are going to start
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:17.760]  in Egypt I told you I pleaded with you to listen to me and I'm doing the same
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.680]  today five weeks or five months before it happened I came on Alex Jones show and
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.840]  I said within four to five months there's going to be a crisis in the
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.960]  Middle East I've been told it by my elite friends it happened within two months
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.200]  almost to the day exactly as we said it why they intentionally are creating the
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.240]  crisis it started in Egypt it went to Libya it's now going to Saudi Arabia
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:44.200]  Saudi Arabia is the greatest supplier of American crude oil when that oil is cut
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:50.040]  off you haven't seen anything you think gasoline 12 cents overnight at the gas
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.000]  pump went up wait till gasoline goes to seven and eight and nine dollars a

[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:25.640]  on record being an MI6 front why would the globalist go in and start
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:29.560]  triggering all of these revolutions why would CNN be telling us how it's like
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.720]  1776 but then promote sound cannons and microwave guns to be used on the American
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:40.840]  people I mean clearly the globalist love what's happening please continue this is
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.800]  the method of the new world order to bring in everything that they want to do
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:51.240]  by the end of 2012 I gave you that timeline over two years ago I've told
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:54.560]  you that I've been told by Mr. Trump that before you passed away that the
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:55:00.560]  timeline is the end of 2012 we're getting very close here's what basically
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.680]  you're going to see next when Kissinger went abroad and said I'll cut your deal
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:10.720]  you buy our treasury issues it was as sound as the dollar it's not that way
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:16.160]  today this Middle East crisis is all perpetrated by the elite I was told
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:20.440]  that and I reported it on your show before it ever happened it can't say
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.320]  you didn't hear it and I'm running it what's going to happen from here
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.900]  whenever this crisis grows to a fever pitch it is going to Saudi Arabia one
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:33.160]  where the other the Muslim brotherhood will see to it and March the 11th is
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:38.320]  their goal for the day of rage and when this happens Saudi being the one I'm
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:44.560]  more crude oil to America than any other country it will impact the American
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:49.000]  economy in society and the dollar the dollars just before going on your show
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.760]  this morning Alex I looked at it it was 76.73 and it is broadcasted when it
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:01.240]  hit 75 it will plunge that means that you go to the grocery store you're going
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:05.760]  to be paying phenomenal prices for groceries for hardware for everything
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:09.640]  imaginable what's going to happen in the Middle East as this price grows to a
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:14.760]  fever pitch in turn they will not be able to supply us with the aerial
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.920]  Bolivia just cut off 1.6 million barrels that went to Europe now when Saudi
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.640]  Arabia cuts off the United States of America can you even comprehend in the
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.560]  least what is going to happen this is not the worst part the part is so
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.560]  significant is when the dollar plunges the value of those T bills and federal
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:38.720]  reserve securities kind of holds one trillion dollars worth all of the Middle
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.600]  East countries were told by Mr. Kissinger it was his soundest currency on
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:47.120]  the world they have trillion dollars trillions of dollars worth whenever this
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.400]  plunges the American dollar goes down because they can't supply the American
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:58.740]  economy is affected this is an outright double-crossed folks do you have the
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.080]  slightest idea what they intentionally did they double-crossed all these
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:08.440]  nations sold them worthless paper now they're holding it and then when they
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.880]  realize what this country has done to them when China realizes they have one
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.780]  trillion dollars of worthless paper both I warned you I pleaded with you Mr.
[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:21.260]  Fromm told me before he passed away he said chaplain if it's written on a
[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:25.800]  piece of paper it's worth their paper it's written on and when America when
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.520]  they are they've done this intentionally in the Middle East in order to create the
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.720]  crisis so that they could bring about the Americans being in such a
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:40.520]  destitute condition that you will plead and beg with the New World Order the
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:45.400]  World Bank in the IMF for a new currency you will plead and beg with them to
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:50.920]  supply you oil you will do anything at any price at that point I have been told
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:54.320]  and I just said this days ago a three-time bid on Yorkshire for the
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.240]  first time last week Alex with this I was told that at that point we will open
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:04.400]  up four major oil fields in America produced from our own soil but you will
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:10.600]  be paying over $200 a barrel for it but it could be produced for $60 a barrel
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:15.260]  but at that point you'd be so destitute in America you would beg for anything in
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:19.040]  order to be able to drive to work and your dollar would be so worthless and
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:23.480]  the nations of the world are so angry at us the New World Order will be able to
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:29.080]  bring in all of that which they already have planned and they will pose as our
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:33.640]  gracious saviors and if you go back and read your book from 30 years ago it was
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:37.840]  all laid out right there and now here it is unfolding the question is can the

[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:26.720]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones well while the world is focused on the Charlie
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:34.520]  Sheen extravaganza that was launched on this show by accident last Thursday
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.720]  that's the number one story in the world right now all over the planet
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:43.320]  according to Yahoo Google and many other barometers we're seeing world
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:47.440]  government launch their takeover operation of the planet how bizarre that
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:52.840]  we're in the middle of both major stories tracking the serious situation
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.320]  with Pastor Lindsay Williams and also at the center of the Charlie Sheen
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:02.400]  situation it's well reality is much stranger than fiction that certainly is
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:06.640]  borne out by people who are living in reality and taking action in their
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:14.520]  daily lives you can certainly just see how strange this world truly is Lindsay
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:17.680]  for those that haven't done the deep research on all this I hope they
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.880]  realize that you're not just saying you made these predictions in October you
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.080]  weren't just saying three and a half years ago that oil would go from $50 a
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.280]  barrel to 150 in the next few months and it did then you said now it's gonna
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:36.040]  plunge down to 40 and then it did and then you said you've got two years it's
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:40.560]  slowly gonna go up and then it's gonna explode I mean you you you're not
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.720]  predicting you have these major globalist sources known to myself and
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:48.400]  Dr. Stan Montief and others obviously we can talk about Ken from now because he
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.320]  sadly died of cancer but we can't get into the other gentleman the former
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:59.160]  oil company CEO but this is a short segment I I wanted to go back in time
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:03.480]  because in the last two interviews we haven't gotten to the Ken from situation
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:07.320]  he was always hiding in plain view you gave a speech with him when he first
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.400]  went public he was then fired when your book came out later rehired that you
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:16.560]  told the story of the oil company CEO showing up at the back of the audience
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:20.880]  when he was speaking and when you were there I mean this all came out in the
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:27.720]  early 80s and this whole 50-year plan we've been on by the globalist briefly
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:34.560]  break down that Ken from story well Alex you know I'll be glad to but there's so
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:40.400]  many things here right now that I'd love to say but okay back in those days it
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:44.920]  was quite obvious he had told me when the Gar Island fine came in that this is
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:51.360]  what's so significant to right now and don't I just I'm pleading with you I'm
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.480]  begging with you this morning that you listen to these things you have never
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:58.560]  been affected in your lifetime like you're going to be affected the next
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:03.720]  few weeks time the Gar Island fine is recorded in my book energy nine crisis
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:08.800]  if Gar Island doesn't blow your mind this will and the day that I watched the
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:12.280]  largest oil pool on the face of the earth proven and brought in and the fall
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:16.960]  and within 24 hours the information was ordered classified and I asked Mr. from
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.800]  I said Ken why don't you bring this to the American people why don't you give
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.240]  us our great American dream why don't you let us have soft my own off my own
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:30.840]  soil and he said to me he said chaplain we are not going to do this we will not
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:34.840]  allow this information out close when my book energy nine crisis came out they
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.800]  went into orbit and of course later threatened me because of what I'd said
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:44.000]  but then they couldn't stop it it was already out there and Ken said to me he
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.520]  said we will not produce this oil from our own soil until we have crude oil
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:54.560]  250 to $200 a barrel it looks as though it's going to be $225 a barrel instead
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.800]  of $200 a barrel they don't open up for a major oil fields I was told this 35
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:05.640]  years ago it was in my book energy nine crisis what Mr. from said it's reported
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:12.680]  now I'm telling you online is in trouble Saudi Arabia is scheduled for a day of

[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:15.400]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned the
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:20.160]  nemesis influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:25.280]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:14.040]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for

[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:22.080]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:26.000]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.880]  biggest small-owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:34.360]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for

[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:09.720]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:17.440]  as you know I was on the view yesterday and Barbara Wolters almost had a stroke
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:21.960]  while I was on I started joking around about how she looked like a skexie and
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:25.040]  then and that's mean I don't mean just because you look old I mean the way she
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:29.480]  behaved the mannerisms for people that don't know what a skexie is if you're
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:34.760]  watching on prison planet TV I'm gonna play a clip of having dinner last night
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:39.320]  with the with with Barbara Wolters and some of the other people from the view
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:42.920]  this is a joke I didn't really have dinner with them and then we'll go back
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:47.720]  to Lindsay Williams and we are having some gallows humor here this is pretty
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:51.560]  heavy painful stuff we're talking about by being aware of the globalist plan we
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:55.400]  can hopefully turn it around and stop it but this is basically what Barbara
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:00.240]  Wolters acted like after the segment was over she was very upset and here is a
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:25.680]  clip of my meeting with Barbara Wolters
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:50.800]  there's Barbara there was the producer of the show okay that's enough maybe more
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:54.720]  we'll have that's behind the scenes of the view look I'm being really made and
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.960]  I apologize folks but I got to have some fun with us they invited me on actually
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:05.760]  I appreciate I'm having me on I actually liked you Bayhar I was on her show and
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.680]  seeing and she was nice but the others did that certainly did not like me okay
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.920]  going back to Lindsay Williams Lindsay this is pretty hardcore stuff you were
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.360]  you were trying to well during the break I asked you the 64 million dollar
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.800]  question it's been about a week and a half since you talked to your living Mr.
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:26.280]  Axe even more high-powered than Ken from and I asked you during the break I said
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:30.000]  if you talked to him again you said yes but I'm not allowed to tell you what he
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.440]  told me well I mean why do they even give you this information then I mean I
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.200]  know it's real I know the information is real but but I mean can you give us any
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:44.280]  idea what it was on Alex over 35 years since I was on the transfer last call
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.280]  pipeline and had the privilege of literally being invited to be the
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.040]  chaplain of the world for three years time on the chaplain of the elite of the
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:57.240]  world for three years time there has never been a single time that they ever
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:02.520]  told me anything that it didn't happen exactly as they said it okay but but why
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:08.960]  is he telling you stuff now that you can't reveal the mom's okay you keep in
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.320]  mind these people never knew what it was to come in contact with the chaplain
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.320]  before many of these people never met a minister of the gospel I was on the oil
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:23.040]  field they were not in my church and many times they have said to me chaplain
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:27.280]  to protect yourself you better do this and this and this and this is exactly
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:32.600]  that a week ago or about a week and a half ago your producer called me on the
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.360]  phone said there's anything new and I said you better bet there believe there
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.680]  is and I was willing to say what's happened gonna happen in the Middle
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.840]  East you see it on phone before your eyes now I know what's gonna happen
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:49.160]  tomorrow and I think the reason they say it is because of their own conscience
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:53.960]  if there is such a thing in the elite of the world remember one of the facets of
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:59.080]  their code of ethics is that they must tell the world everything they're gonna
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.240]  do before they do it there will be a point at which I can tell some of these
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.200]  things because you will see them happening before your eyes and I can
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.160]  right now I'm begging and pleading with you to watch Middle East watch
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.760]  Saudi Arabia but you're saying he told you something new but you're not allowed
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:19.160]  to tell us you can't give us a hint I'm telling you right now I'm begging of
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.600]  you the standard currency of the world is crude oil watch where you remember I
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:29.240]  was given here back about two years ago he said watch the price of crude oil and
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:34.200]  you will know the progression of the program of the elite what did it happen
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.040]  overnight you went up 12 cents per gallon at the gas pump here in my area
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:44.280]  overnight last night you are and what you're seeing happen with crude oil
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:49.240]  tells you where the timeline is do you realize that their timeline was the end
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:54.560]  of 2012 and it appears almost that they are accelerating that timeline can't
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:13:00.160]  read between the lines folks out there in the audience and realize what this man
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:04.320]  is telling me but if he told you so much why can't you specifically tell us
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.640]  what it is the name of the game is control and after they basically gained
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:15.640]  control of everything worldwide not just in America but worldwide and whenever
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:21.040]  they have at that point they begin to bring all of the world under the new
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.440]  world order out of its mess and over a period of I don't know how many years
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.000]  have never told me but over a period of so many years they will bring the world
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.440]  back to a position where they want it you will again have a little bit of a
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:39.840]  dream they're like a search word and it will be brought back again under the
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.120]  auspices of the new world order because the name of the game is okay I want to
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:50.000]  specifically go back you're saying that's what he told you that was new no
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.440]  I'm not saying that's what he told me why can't you tell us what he told you
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:57.600]  for you so that you can see it for yourself and I cannot give you certain
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.680]  things I probably will at the future remember I was threatened two years ago
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.480]  no I know Lindsay we appreciate you my whole family I I know that happened to
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.160]  John F. Kennedy he was a person of the United States of America I'm just a
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:13.880]  little peon sitting down here beside me okay so he tells you some stuff you can
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:17.240]  talk about my life for the sake of something that I'm trying to tell you
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.080]  between the lines right now you've got to read what the elite are saying by
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:25.680]  listening to their buzzwords all right now I want to shift gears here into a
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:30.640]  similar area oil prices rise on mid-east Bernanke comments he says it's gonna
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:34.760]  have little effect on our economy I mean how dumb do they think we are I was
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:38.600]  just talking to this reporter who's done the Kissinger profile he just did the
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:43.280]  Carl Rove profile for New York Mag he said Carl Rove told him and it's in the
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:48.840]  new piece that in fact what's the name of your piece I haven't read it yet he's
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:57.280]  out there what's the name of your new piece Joe do what
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.840]  God dang it baby we're making good time that's the name of the new Carl Rove
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:07.800]  profile piece in Newark magazine and Carl Rove told him there is no
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.120]  Republican establishment so now even saying that there's a Republican
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.840]  establishment like the RNC says that's a conspiracy theory and it doesn't exist
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.760]  now we have Bernanke telling us that we left the recession in June of 2009 a
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.160]  year and a half ago or more and now we have him telling us that oil prices
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.240]  going up doesn't affect the economy I mean how dumb do they think we are
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:57.520]  Lindsay they'll take us to be totally stupid in fact I told you two years ago that the elite were laughing at the average American I don't know how to say anything except the fact that there's more of us than they are of them and the faster you can wake people up Alex the quicker we're going to see something happen yeah I'm quite sure you realize that on Friday night of last week you were very busy over the weekend on Friday night of last week coast to coast a
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:19.520]  m had me on schedule for two hours at the end of two hours the audience was so alive so excited so exuberant they said they had not seen such as this before they asked me to stay on for a third hour three hours on coast to coast a m was sixty something million listeners I hope I hope to wake up America you just finished with Barbara
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:35.520]  you're trying to wake up America I'm on your show this morning I'm pleading with you to read what the elite said to me and I'm trying to say that every place I can say it you must listen to what is happening at the gas pump because
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:48.520]  no I understand this is earth shaking this is earth shaking Lindsay but so so what are the solutions warn people about the globalist agenda so hopefully as they implode the economy we don't take their solution for more
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:17:06.520]  they're going to open up four major oil fields in any one of these oil fields they can produce oil at sixteen dollars per barrel folks I am saying it to you you've got to hear it they are going to charge you two hundred dollars a barrel for it
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:22.520]  they can produce it for sixteen dollars a barrel it could be sixty cents a gallon at the gas pump throw out every one of those scoundrels in Washington D.C. we've got to have some honesty up there that will give America back its great American dream
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:41.520]  it could happen if millions of Americans and right here over this year in four worlds Alex Jones show today this movement could start I do not want a movement off rebellion I do not want people doing what they're doing over the
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:56.520]  land of Libya that is wrong but we've got to turn this thing back around again and give us back the great American dream stop the elite somehow you folks must listen to me and Alex I've got to please bear with me here do you want to know
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:12.520]  everything is going to happen at the gas pump do you want to know everything is going to happen at the grocery store do you want to know where the dollar is going we started out on Saturday filming a new production entitled the Middle East the rest of the story I thought we were going to have one DVD we went to two
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:33.520]  DVDs the camera crew was seeing that literally mesmerized the man who was operating the camera a young man he said I've never heard anything like this before we went three hours we are having a three hour presentation all of you last week who called in to our total free service

[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:51.520]  he's super hardcore a lot more than Glenn Beck and the fact that his shows getting top ratings and now being reared on the regular Fox channel shows that he's the big up and comer

[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:23.520]  we told people it's dollar devaluation and I know you had a gold and silver special last week haven't asked you haven't talked to you yet today because you just got back from the airport
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:34.520]  if you could still offer the deals on gold and silver you bought over a month ago and pass on savings and deals on certain silver and gold coins that nobody else can even get close to matching
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:44.520]  have you run out or has the price gone up what's the deal here's the crazy part about it Alex because I was tied up in New York with the sheen deal out there with you
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:54.520]  I didn't have a chance to change prices I just landed I got in at one o'clock and here I am sitting here 130 talking to you prices are the same because of that as of a week ago
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:09.520]  silver shot up I mean come on silver is at $34.55 today gold 1425 the Libyan oil thing is just driving that up Bernanke's saying that we're going to have short lived inflation and moderate
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:22.520]  I think he should be the one who's getting the drug test right now here we here we sit maybe he's got tiger blood huh well I mean Alex I'm offering three videos right now and three silver dollars for 97 bucks
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:37.520]  silver is over $34.55 yeah let's be clear you've got you've got what 100 year old eats even a semi numismatic silver coins $97 free shipping and three of my films that's a $70 discount
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:48.520]  I mean no one can beat that deal I mean you can't find silver dollars by themselves for the price you just mentioned Ted no you can't find silver dollars as a matter of fact I'm changing prices tonight because I can't find them either
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:27:02.520]  in addition to this I've got the Frank still at 308 they've shot up British sovereigns 386 all that stuff is up the US Eagles I'm just about everything you name the only reason why the prices are low Alex I haven't had time to adjust things
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:18.520]  I will be adjusting them tomorrow I can't have it I can't help it the market's just going nuts and you know we're talking about oil prices I mean oil you know gallon of oil a gallon of gasoline here is well over 350 a gallon in the in the state of Minnesota
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:29.520]  I mean it's it's going out of this world well I tell you what Charlie you know the whole Charlie sheen thing overshadowing all this world market news it's it's it's crazy
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:46.520]  it sure is man it's it's absolutely absurd I mean we're looking at possibly another third world war that's developing in North Africa right now I mean everybody the Chinese the the United States all of Europe we're all comes you know we're all coming together on this thing
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:28:04.520]  right on that Libyan thing is serious serious business driving the price of oil up the stock market is down today the dollars in the tank gold is going up silver shot up over $34.55 an ounce that means that we could be seeing $35 silver here very shortly
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:22.520]  and in addition to this $40 silver is just within reach it's not even unreasonable to think that and already silver eagles and that type of thing already up there touching that number so you know here we are I just can't say it enough right now if you haven't had a chance to take advantage of that offer
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:35.520]  we take credit cards just you know pick up three videos of Alex Jones I mean for goodness sakes if you're concerned at all about liberty and the and the freedom movement pick up these videos get the original
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:29:02.520]  they're free folks it's a great deal on silver eight hundred six eight six two two three seven so the brokers will stay there till tonight at midnight and then the prices are going up tomorrow it'll still be a great deal but those incredibly off the chart good deals tell them it's the Alex Jones special there's a big long list of different coins and things where you'll get the older price of when Ted bought the silver and gold a month ago but I mean have you already run out of that and are selling new stuff you bought at a loss is what you're saying that
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:26.520]  you know that's what that's basically what I'm saying Alex I have no more inventory at that older price I mean people want crazy and bought this stuff I know there's a little bit of delay because you're printing more videos for me they'll be here within about a week and a half and we'll get them right out to you as quickly as we can but if you want to take advantage of something I mean you and I both know people need to have precious metals in their portfolio makes way more sense than having this fee

[02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:32.520]  that's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:46.520]  governments every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:33.520]  now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:48.520]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is a historian author journalist lecturer and critic of US foreign and domestic policy Tarpley maintains the September 11 attacks were engineered by rogue network of the military industrial complex and intelligence agencies his writings and speeches describe a model of false flag terror operations by rogue
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:34:03.520]  network the military industrial sector working with moles in the private sector and in corporate media he also maintains the notion of anthropogenic global warming is a fraud Webster Tarpley is the author of several books including George Herbert Walker Bush the unauthorized
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:18.520]  biography the Obama postmodern coom making of a Manchurian candidate by the way all those books are available at info wars dot com and you may know all about this but your friends your family your neighbors don't they're ready to be awakened and he is a regular guest on this
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:36.520]  Saturday morning afternoon show here on Genesis and this commentary on international television routinely again as a doctorate in history is also an economist Webster you called the Middle East destabilization program just like Max Kaiser and so many others did via dollar
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:55.520]  devaluation I have New York magazine here big high powered writer who's done the Carl Rove profile this week he did the Kissinger profile he's here doing a profile on yours truly and you can put it so eloquently and succinctly before we get into all the other news
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:09.520]  boil down for him what who is behind the destabilization the Middle East why they want it what is the geopolitical trigger zone the order out of chaos system give him the evidence of that because he was asking me and I said wait till
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:25.520]  partly comes on I can I can break it down but probably can do it say in a five minutes the sink package then we'll get into what's happening with commodities Bernanke saying this won't affect us right now with the oil prices exploding Bernie Madoff saying the whole government is a Ponzi scheme that Goldman
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:40.520]  saxes yeah no kidding we'll get your view on that but but I mean you know you're here talking to New York Daily News not New York Daily News New York magazine and and in a nutshell break it down for him the overall
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:58.520]  strategy thank you Alex thank you for the for the chance to do this we're dealing with a large-scale imperialist rampage by the United States and the British this is imperialism this is a this is a kind of neo imperialism which involves
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:15.520]  overthrowing all the puppet governments that exist largely because these puppet governments are not dependent enough they're two autonomous they don't follow orders in the way that the US and the British want so it started back in
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:30.520]  November December in particular with the CIA limited to hangout self exposure operation known as WikiLeaks and we still have that going on with all kinds of sympathy gags designed to portray Julian Assange as a martyr but if
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:46.520]  essentially this was an operation ordered up by people like Cass Sunstein is sitting inside the Obama was a cognitive infiltration cognitive infiltration and and and even worse so that that then knocked over the relatively mild dictatorship or
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:37:03.520]  authoritarian regime really in in Tunisia and now we've got this this process rolling through a series of Arab Middle East North African countries the common denominator of this is that it aims at it either creating new puppet
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:18.520]  governments that will be much weaker and much more dependent on the US and the British or chaos civil war and and the division of countries by a successionism I think right now based on what you're seeing on on the
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:34.520]  news media Al Jazeera in particular Al Jazeera push vision which is the main channel of the destabilization in the coups you can see that there we're now getting close to the declaration of a no fly zone over Libya similar to what
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:49.520]  the same imperialists the US and the British did in Iraq at the end of the first Gulf War back in the back in the early nineties where they say we're not going to allow Gaddafi to take off with any planes I had tweeted about this in my
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:38:04.520]  Twitter feed you can go back and look on February 24th from Hamburg Germany where I was at the time I put out a thing saying watch out for a no fly zone followed by a NATO invasion goal among other things to seize the oil fields
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:25.520]  and possibly divide Libya into into two parts the basis of this no fly zone is the story that Gaddafi is using his military aviation is air force against these cities in Syrinaica in this area of Benghazi to book near the
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:40.520]  Egyptian border he's been accused of using using these planes to strafe demonstrations and so forth just now on Russia today we have the Russian general staff saying that their satellite imagery of Libya shows no such thing in other words
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:57.520]  it's another imperialist warmonger big lie it's in the same but why are they triggering this now what is the larger ramification not just for that geopolitical sector the Near East Middle East and Central Asia I mean is that all part of the Russian encirclement operation
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:12.520]  but expanding what is the plan in the markets I saw this coming they're now scapegoating the recession which they're now admitting never left us on what's happening there they're trying to use Stuxnet to bring in cybersecurity internet kill switch I mean give us the big picture
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:27.520]  what's the larger reason for this well in the in the in terms of the Middle East itself take let's take off new Mubarak he had been there for 30 years he was entrenched there was somebody who could say no to the U.S. and the British and what did he say no on
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:46.520]  he said no U.S. military bases in Egypt no troops for the Iraq war no troops for the Afghanistan war and then in 2009 the new Obama administration came with their new imperialist plan which is that you'd assemble a front of Sunni Arab states Egypt Saudi Arabia the Emirates
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:40:05.520]  Jordan along with Israel in a direct alliance with U.S. military bases in all of these countries including Egypt where Mubarak never one of them and that would then be under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and that would then be a group of kamikaze puppets the Arabs in
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:22.520]  the U.S. nuclear that would be played against Iran against Syria against his Bola against Thomas in other words the radicals the rejection front in the Middle East Mubarak said no Mubarak had to go in 2010 with the U.S.
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:38.520]  hysterically that all conceivable commercial ties to Iran had to be broken Mubarak opened up these direct flights from Cairo to Tehran and back so this was somebody who had become much too uppity much too rebellious another good case
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:55.520]  Bakhran we've got we've got the destabilization of the Emirate of Bakhran out there in the Gulf what was their original sin well it's that that's the base of the U.S. fifth fleet the one in the Persian Gulf or Arabian Gulf and the royal family there had put up a veto saying we
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:13.520]  forbid the United States to use this base for the purpose of attacking Iran and therefore they had to be destabilized Gaddafi of course is somebody that they have attempted to remove repeatedly back in 1986 using this cover story of the silly La Belle
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:30.520]  discotheque accusation against Libya with no proof Reagan bombed Libya tried to kill Gaddafi and ended up killing Gaddafi's one and a half year old daughter so they killed the baby but they couldn't get Gaddafi then of course we have the Shailer affair David Shailer of
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:47.520]  MI5 British counterintelligence says he was sitting in his office one day when he became aware that MI6 the CIA equivalent for the British was attempting to assassinate Gaddafi with the help of well Al Qaeda that they had hired an Al Qaeda
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:42:03.520]  allied organization given them a hundred thousand pounds of British taxpayer money and told them to try to kill Gaddafi they did attempt to kill him a bomb went off it didn't kill Gaddafi it killed a number of innocent civilian bystanders now this
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:17.520]  is obviously we're not saying Gaddafi's a good guy they know the political climate is there to allow overthrows the Domino's already set out by IMF World Bank dollar devaluation policy driving up basic living expenses like food and energy
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:28.520]  sure but but again what is the larger strategy humanitarian reasons they're not saying oh we're tired of this horrible human rights abuse so what how are they planning on the Domino's falling around the rest of the world
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:41.520]  we just finished the thing on Libya the Shailer scenario 1995 is what we're seeing now it's that you eliminate Gaddafi assassinate him then you have chaos you can take you can say Al Qaeda did it you can say Al Qaeda is there
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:55.520]  and then you can invade and I think the assets that the U.S. and the British would like to seize are in the Syrian area this Tobruk Benghazi along the near the Egyptian border that seems to be with the oil and the refineries are
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:08.520]  Tunisia's base is in another province of the Ottoman Empire on the other side of Libya that the Trip Tripoli Tania Tripoli area that's where that's where Gaddafi seems to be holding out and he may hold out there for a very long time
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:21.520]  so more broadly as seen from Europe in particular the first thing you see about this is Tunisia is descending into chaos the wonderful singing tomorrows of democracy and the color revolution the jasmine
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:30.520]  revolution has turned now into chaos and you've got both people and the boat people go to the other side of the Mediterranean but even before Italy there
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:42.520]  you have the Italian island of Lampedusa you have these other Italian islands and then you have Sicily so all of the Mediterranean states Spain, France, Italy, Greece places like this
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:54.520]  and now they want to they're reportedly moving special forces into the eastern area to back the rebels AFP was put that back on screen I believe that was AFP is reporting that the rebels have had a victory near Tripoli
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:44:05.520]  now who knows if any of the you don't know any of that yeah that's associated press we have no idea I mean they already told us two weeks ago the Gaddafi had or we can have a go ahead run to Venezuela
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:15.520]  yeah they're telling all these stories I would I would take all of this with lots of grains of salt because again we got the Kuwait incubator baby syndrome going we've got we've got these things
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:31.520]  we've got the syndrome claiming on 888 that the Russians attacked Georgia precisely so here we have these accusations that Gaddafi strafing his own people another thing that is going on is that black Africans are being lynched by the anti-Gaddafi forces
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:46.520]  that includes people from southern Libya are also black they're being lynched because they're being accused of being mercenaries for Gaddafi I don't know if there's any proof of that either so there are a lot of stories about what Gaddafi is supposedly doing
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:58.520]  and I think all of this is is is unreliable a couple of other things coming out of this you get the destabilization of Europe with maybe one to two million refugees right now as far as I can see
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:12.520]  plus of course you're driving up the price of oil and as the price of oil goes up this helps to solidify the dollar it helps to stabilize the dollar because at the higher the price of oil is the more demand for dollars you have in the world
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:30.520]  therefore the fewer dollars sloshing around and it means you can relieve the pressure on the dollar so that's dollars the Fed doesn't have to monetize what do you think about Lindsay Williams I know he is in contact with a former big three oil CEO and he's telling him that by the end of next year they are planning to kill the
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:46.520]  dollar as the world reserve currency and move to this SDR Bancorp backed basket so I mean I know Lindsay's being told these things but I mean how does this work for the dollar long term I don't I don't think this is realistic in the sense that you can of course remove the
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:46:00.520]  dollar as a reserve currency but all of these other things they're talking about to replace it are absolutely impossible unworkable for all kinds of reasons but just go back to the imperialist rampage though you look at Pakistan and you look at the case of this
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:16.520]  Ray Davis now this person now being held by the Pakistani government apparently is a CIA agent attached to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan this guy has all the earmarks from afar anyway of a terrorist
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:32.520]  controller this is what the Pakistani press is saying and not just any terrorist controller but somebody who may have been setting up and radioactive nuclear materials dirty bomb inside Pakistan that would have furnished a pretext for the U.S.
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:50.520]  to come on the scene arguing aha the Pakistani nuclear forces are not secure there's been a leak here of radioactive material therefore we the U.S. have to seize the bombs the entire Pakistani nuclear force so you can see you're in a
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:47:05.520]  phase of tremendous aggression of flight forward by the imperialist it's got to do of course with the the world economic depression can be relied on as it did in the 1930s to drive the imperialist bunkers they're going to
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:24.520]  what's your intel on full on NATO UN U.S. backed invasion of Libya that seems to be quite possible now you look at the assets right you have the British base in Larnaca Cyprus you've got now these US aircraft carrier enterprise
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:42.520]  plus the helicopter landing ship here Sarge moving some some cases through the Suez Canal and approaching Libya you've got the British base in Gibraltar one that's interesting is the NATO base at Sigonella Sicily as well as the NATO base in Aviano in
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:59.520]  northeast Italy would bear the scony a friend of Gaddafi allow NATO to use those bases we've had cases in the past where Italian Prime Minister proxy back in the 1980s would not allow the U.S. to do what they wanted with
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:14.520]  Sigonella there's a famous case about a clash about who was going to arrest some terrorists from the Akili Lauro case what you've also got is an attack on an axis it's Putin of Russia bear the scony of Italy and Gaddafi that is in
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:31.520]  some ways a combination all kinds of development deals all kinds of business arrangements the South Stream pipeline which NATO hates and between Berlusconi and Gaddafi you have quite a close relation in terms of business
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:47.520]  Gaddafi in the past has been an investor in fiat the company that now owns Chrysler so what the U.S. is doing is targeting these combinations or centers of resistance to it's like a new phase of imperialism it basically
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:49:01.520]  well that's the French mercantilism model of keep keep your quasi possessions destabilized and in proxy and fighting with each other show that you can come in and buy them up for pennies on the dollar and easily control them and pose as the
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  savior by the way let's let the French off the hook this time because they don't I'm not even talking about the French in today's standards I'm saying the model of globalism is it not Neo mercantilism
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:17.520]  no I wouldn't call it that it's British imperialism it's free trade globalized British imperialism
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:34.520]  wait a minute you're a doctor of history so you know mercantilism wasn't invented by the French they just gave it that name of not letting your possessions or colonies develop finished goods and to control them and this is an expanded extrapolation of that
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:42.520]  wanting to basically keep everybody every nation state dependent on globalist fiat currency
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:50:05.520]  yeah but the great historical example of this is the British empire which runs on the great game the great game and imperial imperial preference French mercantilism in the person of Jean-Baptiste Colbert one of the inspirers of Alexander Hamilton the French the French mercantilist system for France under people like well Louis the 14th Louis the 15th
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:19.520]  this had definite positive features it made France on the whole a more advanced industrial country but that's because they had an industrial policy still the overall policy was to concentrate power and vertically integrate right but I would call this this is simply imperialism
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:37.520]  this is British imperialism and you know you're hearing in the US media more and more British voices as the US policy begins to resemble more and more the British empire at its worst you're hearing more and more British voices on television and radio explaining
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:52.520]  why this must be the must be the webster stay there I want to come back in the final segment talk about made off saying the whole governments of Ponzi scheme what you see happening with the deterioration of the global economy what you see as hotspots just a bunch of little points I want to head on the next
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:51:01.520]  countries to face this type of insurrection will the globalist go after Saudi Arabia that's an important question
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:14.520]  the collapse of the dollar is imminent you can protect your wealth by buying gold silver and strong foreign currencies but what if the government confiscate your precious metals implements exchange controls or nationalizes your retirement

[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:23.520]  final segment with Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up in retransmission Max Geiser, Lindsay Williams and then of course again Tarpley but we'll be back tomorrow live 11am to 2pm
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:35.520]  Central Standard Time has some more informative and enlightening guests coming up all I can say about the Liberty Movement worldwide and the awakening to the globalist crime syndicate is winning
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:55:02.520]  we are certainly making headway thanks to all of you out there taking action we've got a fighting chance against this Anglo-American British Empire too that's not blaming the British people or the American people or the Chinese people we talk about corruption in nations or the Israeli people we talk about corruption in Israel or anywhere else it's the system this global corporate fascist system that we're dealing with Webster you heard all those questions I threw out
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:09.520]  what do you think about what's happening in Saudi Arabia what are the other spots they want to overthrow do the globalists want to overthrow all these puppet states
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:25.520]  one of the things you can see is an attack on the nation state itself and I think this is very important the essence of empire is that you've got a worldwide empire you can call it the new world order if you want to it's simply the old world order but in a more aggressive extreme form
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  it's the international monetary fund with NATO as the enforcers with the US and the British running NATO at least getting the assets that they need and this rules over the world and the nation states are destroyed they're carved into pieces
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:52.520]  Sudan has been carved into two parts Libya may be falling apart into at least two parts right now Egypt might be subjected to something similar detaching the Suez Canal
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:56:05.520]  so the true Balkanization breakup precisely the Bernard Lewis plan three Iraq's 560 rounds and so on down the line so everybody gets carved as a result which you've been saying for decades was their plan there
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:21.520]  I think so and now look at Algeria if they can bring this into Algeria they certainly will the things they're interested in in North Africa would be what Algerian oil Libyan oil the Suez Canal those are the assets those are valuable from the imperialist
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:32.520]  and they've just started breaking Sudan into and they're really moving and getting the oil there so again we're in an unprecedented imperialist grand page is this not basically a soft World War three I mean
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:56.520]  except the one thing you would say is if you compare this to 1848 in 1848 the British were destabilizing countries that were controlled by the bizarre of Russia or the Austrian emperor or the king king of pressure or whatever it was and sort of enemy states but now they're doing it to their own so-called friendly allies or puppet states or
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:11.520]  whatever you want to call it and it's this is knowing that if Egypt falls as one domino then states they don't control will be easier to fall precisely now again the with the Saudi Arabians I was in Germany last week there's a European press still a little bit better on these things
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:27.520]  there was an article in one of the German papers that Saudi Arabia is now doomed that they are they're going to be overthrown for sure now the way that the royal family in Saudi Arabia fights back it's very interesting is with generous concessions right King Abdullah has now made about
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:41.520]  thirty six billion dollars worth of concessions if you're living in Saudi Arabia you just got yourself a nice pay increase you've got your health care for less and so forth one of the things it shows go into the streets you might get somewhere
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:55.520]  one of one of the things that occurred to me is if the imperialists want to destabilize the world let's turn the imperialist destabilization of the world into a destabilization of imperialism that was my next question they're not they're not invincible
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:58:10.520]  they may not I mean is this going well for them right now right now they have the initiative for sure and you can see that there is there's a pushback from Russia in particular the Russian saying that the story about strafing is a complete phony we have
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:24.520]  we have Rogozin the Russian observer at NATO I tell you what Webster we're gonna do five minutes overdrive so you can finish plus okay I have new news that I knew was coming but it just blew me away we need to get it up on info wars dot com it's only on
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:44.520]  prison planet dot com right now Steve Watson bombshell with mainstream confirmed reports they're gonna put full chest x-rays frying your entire body in the airports this is psychological warfare it causes 15,000 deaths per year coming up
[02:58:44.520 --> 02:59:04.520]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network diamond gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the patriot movement they're offering a free CD t-shirt and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase diamond gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working
[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:24.520]  for a factory where a man can feed his family not worried about them moving south closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow I'm looking for America
[02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:34.520]  where American and be proud go to gusset dot com forward slash America
[02:59:34.520 --> 02:59:44.520]  seems like it just woke up one day and it was gone
[02:59:44.520 --> 03:00:00.520]  again go to gusset dot com forward slash America today coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:00.520 --> 03:00:15.520]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show we are live into the fourth hour here with Webster Griffin Tarpoli it's 2 p.m.
[03:00:15.520 --> 03:00:30.520]  central standard time thank you for joining us Webster I've got a huge story here I want to get into with with a TSA security theater Crete full strength x-ray body scanners touted for airports trials begin for devices that can scan your
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:45.520]  insides deep penetrating radiation scans cause 15,000 deaths per year they're exempt from radiation testing violates law violates OSHA and they're doing this all over the world I know we were just covering another subject but this just went up on
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:01:00.520]  prison planet dot com they're now having TSA at checkpoints on highways train stations this is the federal Gestapo force but what's going on with the establishment setting the precedent to now start chest x-raying the full body
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:13.520]  I mean what about the workers standing around this with no ledge shielding I mean what's the point to all this well it's probably a trial balloon but remember if the imperialists are on this worldwide
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:27.520]  rampage in foreign policy and destabilizations and pushes and color revolutions and coups then of course that has its reflection in domestic policy and this is what you're seeing there
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:32.520]  it's prisoner training and they can put us in a microwave now why not put you in a full fryer
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:51.520]  I would say the people should focus on the idea of saying no to a US invasion of Libya no to a no fly zone the most effective way to do this is for an anti-war candidate to challenge Obama in the Democratic primaries were less than a year away from Iowa and New Hampshire
[03:01:51.520 --> 03:02:04.520]  and if there's any anybody interested in peace avoiding war inside the Democratic party they better come forward now because otherwise the Democratic party is pretty much a dead duck concerning the issues that we were talking about if I may mention
[03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:11.520]  for those of you who are night owls out there I think I'm going to be on the coast to coast AM tonight so if you want to tune in
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:21.520]  good hours when Alex is not on the air and there's nothing to do anyway you might want to care less man I mean I'm I'm happy for folks to hear you tonight what what hour are you on are you on the whole show
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:27.520]  I think it's three hours but I'm not certain well well done Tarpley be sure and give me an info worst plug on there
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:41.520]  but I'm joking Tarpley but listen I continuing here I'm on Coast Coast all the time George Norris great and I'm glad he's covering hardcore issues on the show we appreciate him really changing course away from what Art Bell used to do
[03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:52.520]  that's why the show so successful but there was another question I was asking you before I came back I just hope folks will get this this full x-ray machines now shooting through your body
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:03:08.520]  also TSA lies justify illegal train station grew up down but but I mean in closing Webster to sit here and to watch the way CNN MSNBC Fox all in unity saying something must be done something must be done
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:20.520]  we must invade now and then now it's going to set the precedent to invade every country that has a dictator or a bunch of plutocrats suppressing people I mean I hope folks realize that this looks like the beginning of the launch of
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:32.520]  World War three with the with the cadre or derv to to intro it by going into help people in a humanitarian way I mean this is the full takeover of the Middle East North Africa
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:44.520]  this is the essence of Obama is that you don't attack countries based on the stories that Bush Cheney and the neocons were telling but now you have different stories that involve human rights and
[03:03:44.520 --> 03:03:58.520]  what he was running you laid it all out Webster it's incredible I mean I just have to say you're incredible partly well thank you very much but the question now is what can we do about it and I think the idea is people have to fight for their rights I think it means
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:04:08.520]  fight for your economic rights I have to tell you I'm pro Wisconsin I think if they're going to take your union rights away they can then come with a with an x-ray machine this is sort of the same idea
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:20.520]  so but the main thing right now is no additional war we got three wars now we've got Iraq still going we've got Afghanistan we've got Pakistan and now we're going to add Libya and North Africa to this
[03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:40.520]  these imperialists are just crazy and these charming ladies Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice hitting in the United Nations these people are these people are crazy this is a twilight of the gods for the imperialists the danger is with their flight forward they could indeed get us into World War 3
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:05:00.520]  Alright Webster we're out of time I want to say bye to you during the break retransmission from Lebanon with Max Kaiser and a lot more coming up I'm going to get into the TSS as well it's key information covered in the first hour please continue to spread the word about the broadcast great job crew we are winning we'll be right back stay with us
