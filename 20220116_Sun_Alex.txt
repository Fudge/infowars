[00:00.000 --> 00:09.520]  The White House published its framework today for how it intends to combat one of the most
[00:09.520 --> 00:13.680]  pressing national security threats, domestic terrorism.
[00:13.680 --> 00:16.320]  Domestic terrorism is on the rise across the country.
[00:16.320 --> 00:20.160]  We're now hearing from Attorney General Merrick Garland on one of the Biden administration's
[00:20.160 --> 00:24.120]  top security priorities, combating domestic terrorism.
[00:24.120 --> 00:28.800]  You understand they're going to stage terror attacks and they're going to declare martial
[00:28.800 --> 00:32.440]  law and they're going to come and they're going to arrest the opposition leaders and
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.120]  beat us to death in prisons.
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.920]  This afternoon we saw federal agents collecting evidence at a home there and they arrested
[00:38.920 --> 00:39.920]  Stuart Rhodes.
[00:39.920 --> 00:45.040]  He and 10 others now charged with seditious conspiracy, but essentially the feds believe
[00:45.040 --> 00:48.200]  he was simply trying to overthrow the government.
[00:48.200 --> 00:53.080]  So Jake, no doubt you're going to probably face some repercussions for even doing this
[00:53.080 --> 00:54.560]  interview with us today.
[00:54.560 --> 00:56.880]  Are you a little worried about that?
[00:56.880 --> 01:01.360]  I'm, you know, fear does not live in the hearts of patriots and, you know, it's time
[01:01.360 --> 01:05.840]  for the American people to band together and to stand behind the Constitution and to really
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.680]  support the January Sixers because we were the front-line patriots.
[01:09.680 --> 01:12.680]  This law is being terminated by the facility.
[01:12.680 --> 01:13.680]  Uh-oh.
[01:13.680 --> 01:14.680]  Uh-oh.
[01:14.680 --> 01:15.680]  Yep.
[01:15.680 --> 01:16.680]  Alright.
[01:16.680 --> 01:17.680]  Interesting.
[01:17.680 --> 01:18.680]  Someone didn't like that conversation.
[01:18.680 --> 01:25.680]  Somebody didn't like, but that's one of the reasons we're doing the story.
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.360]  It said, uh, I don't know if the folks could hear that, uh, this call is being terminated
[01:29.360 --> 01:31.040]  by the facility.
[01:31.040 --> 01:33.840]  Why do you call the attackers terrorists?
[01:33.840 --> 01:39.400]  But I can see why someone would take issue with the, uh, title of terrorist.
[01:39.400 --> 01:43.480]  It's gained a lot of, uh, notoriety in our vocabulary in the past few decades.
[01:43.480 --> 01:48.800]  And we have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across
[01:48.800 --> 01:52.800]  borders, but from violence that gathers within.
[01:52.800 --> 01:59.200]  This view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.480]  violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of the white
[02:04.480 --> 02:05.480]  race.
[02:05.480 --> 02:10.320]  According to the United States Intelligence Community, domestic terrorism from white supremacists
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.600]  is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland.
[02:14.600 --> 02:21.720]  We know now we must confront and defeat political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism.
[02:21.720 --> 02:23.760]  Don't dare call them protesters.
[02:23.760 --> 02:32.200]  They were a riotous mob insurrectionists, domestic terrorists, white supremacy, domestic
[02:32.200 --> 02:37.560]  terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.
[02:37.560 --> 02:44.920]  Madam vice president, fellow Americans, state the obvious.
[02:44.920 --> 02:53.800]  One year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked.
[02:53.800 --> 02:54.800]  Simply attacked.
[02:54.800 --> 03:00.520]  Since you asked my critique of the president's speech, I thought it was fabulous.
[03:00.520 --> 03:03.600]  And then they're going to devalue the dollar completely and start turning your power off
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.600]  on a regular basis.
[03:04.600 --> 03:10.960]  Our wind and our solar got shut down and they were collectively more than 10% of our power
[03:10.960 --> 03:11.960]  grid.
[03:11.960 --> 03:15.400]  That shows that fossil fuel is necessary.
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.040]  And inject your children with poisons until they slowly die.
[03:18.040 --> 03:19.520]  They're going to murder you.
[03:19.520 --> 03:20.800]  I went and got the jab.
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.600]  I did it at 11.30 in the morning in Hawaii.
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.600]  Everything was normal.
[03:25.600 --> 03:26.600]  I went to bed.
[03:26.600 --> 03:30.480]  I woke up at 3.30 in the morning with my heart pounding out of my chest.
[03:30.480 --> 03:32.280]  I went to the ER.
[03:32.280 --> 03:38.440]  They hooked me up quickly to EKG, IVs, did blood work, quickly determined that I was
[03:38.440 --> 03:40.800]  an atrial fibrillation.
[03:40.800 --> 03:46.240]  I could have stroked out at 100 feet trying to land an airplane with 40 airplanes lined
[03:46.240 --> 03:47.560]  up next to us.
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.440]  I could have just pushed down on that stick before the person next to me could do anything.
[03:52.440 --> 03:54.320]  We're in a...
[03:54.320 --> 03:56.440]  It's all over for a lot of people.
[03:56.440 --> 03:57.840]  Not a good scenario.
[03:57.840 --> 04:00.200]  Pete Buttigieg isn't telling you anything about this.
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.600]  The administration is not.
[04:02.600 --> 04:06.360]  The NIH, the CDC, they suppress all this stuff.
[04:06.360 --> 04:12.600]  There's a number of pilots out there that are fearful to come forward and speak.
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.040]  They're fearful of retribution.
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.480]  There's guys that are going to work with crushing pains in their chest.
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.000]  So everybody can sit around and play their games that they're in the government.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.680]  They're going to be part of the winning team.
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.440]  The fools working in the federal government going along with this are destroying themselves
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.160]  with us right along with them.
[04:31.160 --> 04:34.720]  Anniversary of a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol.
[04:34.720 --> 04:38.480]  See, they hide behind the classification of January 6th.
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.800]  We know how they did it.
[04:39.800 --> 04:40.920]  We know who did it.
[04:40.920 --> 04:46.440]  The freaking FBI ran the attack on the Capitol and we have all the damn information.
[04:46.440 --> 04:47.440]  Does everybody get...
[04:47.440 --> 04:48.440]  We're all going to get destroyed?
[04:48.440 --> 04:49.440]  These are serious killers, serious criminals.
[04:49.440 --> 04:50.440]  Bunch of damn criminals run in this country.
[04:50.440 --> 04:51.440]  Fuck them.
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.440]  Fuck them.
[04:52.440 --> 04:53.440]  I'm sick of their shit.
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.440]  Fuck these motherfuckers.
[04:54.440 --> 04:55.440]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the business of the
[04:55.440 --> 05:08.480]  building up for what the globalists are doing right now.
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.200]  This is their big offensive.
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.600]  This is their takeover.
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.600]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[05:15.600 --> 05:19.640]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[05:19.640 --> 05:20.640]  in the open.
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.200]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed.
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.600]  But they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut
[05:27.600 --> 05:29.440]  down people telling the truth.
[05:29.440 --> 05:32.720]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[05:32.720 --> 05:34.560]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.360]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.
[05:38.360 --> 05:42.160]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[05:42.160 --> 05:45.680]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[05:45.680 --> 05:47.680]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers.
[05:47.680 --> 05:48.680]  They are so good for your body.
[05:48.680 --> 05:52.440]  And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[05:52.440 --> 05:57.080]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[05:57.080 --> 06:25.320]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:25.320 --> 06:32.960]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Sunday, January 16th, Worldwide Transmission
[06:32.960 --> 06:37.560]  of the Year is 2022.
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.600]  You know, the reason I've talked about taking a few weeks off, I've never done, is I get
[06:42.600 --> 06:46.680]  so angry now that I blow up on air and that's not professional and that's not good.
[06:46.680 --> 06:50.400]  We need to lower the temperature in this country and around the world because Klaus Schwab,
[06:50.400 --> 06:54.760]  the behavioral psychologist that run the great reset and the global government, globalist
[06:54.760 --> 06:59.600]  takeover, say they want to raise the temperature and make society fall apart and make us commit
[06:59.600 --> 07:04.820]  suicide and make us hurt each other and family violence has exploded, it's tripled, suicides
[07:04.820 --> 07:05.820]  more than tripled.
[07:05.820 --> 07:12.120]  In the last few years, the drug overdoses have exploded to record, I mean we are in crisis
[07:12.120 --> 07:16.520]  and I don't care if somebody's black or somebody's white or somebody works for the government
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.000]  or somebody works for a big corporation or a small business.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.640]  We're individuals, we have to judge them by who they are but the corporate power structure
[07:25.640 --> 07:30.120]  is making its move on society.
[07:30.120 --> 07:34.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, a lot of stations have joined us at six after,
[07:34.120 --> 07:37.160]  we do the first five minutes for some stations that want to pick it up instead of local news
[07:37.160 --> 07:38.160]  or national news.
[07:38.160 --> 07:41.920]  I saw a John Bound report I hadn't watched yet but I thought, oh, let's just play that.
[07:41.920 --> 07:48.640]  It was very powerful about the corruption of both parties and how it's systemic and then
[07:48.640 --> 07:53.640]  it was me blowing up at the end, something that I'm really going to work on not doing
[07:53.640 --> 07:55.760]  even though it's popular with the viewers and the rest of it.
[07:55.760 --> 08:01.200]  It's not fake when I do it but it's kind of like letting the dog off the leash.
[08:01.200 --> 08:03.960]  It's the dog when it's on the leash, it's still the dog when it's off the leash but
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.880]  sometimes it bites when it's off the leash and at 48 years old now I need to do that
[08:08.880 --> 08:14.160]  because again, they want violence, they want us to attack each other and if somebody like
[08:14.160 --> 08:19.000]  me is losing their temper on air, well then other people might not have as much control,
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.240]  they might do something more and that's what they want.
[08:21.240 --> 08:26.080]  They want us to go crazy and have the black folks run over white people and have white
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.680]  people go in and shoot black people and they just want us killing each other to distract
[08:31.680 --> 08:36.600]  from what they're doing and so the left talks about unity out of one side of their mouth,
[08:36.600 --> 08:42.000]  a lot of the other they push for division and hatred and I don't want to be a hypocrite
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.440]  when I'm attacking them for pushing this unity when sometimes I also paint with two
[08:47.440 --> 08:54.320]  broad brush because this is a very evil time we're going into right now and I've always
[08:54.320 --> 08:58.960]  been really good at predicting what's coming next and I told you a couple years ago you're
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.080]  going to see massive inflation, you're going to see civil unrest, you're going to see power
[09:03.080 --> 09:06.760]  outages because that's what Klaus Schwab and the globalists said they would do, getting
[09:06.760 --> 09:12.960]  us ready for the collapse of civilization but if you tuned in Tuesday or Wednesday it
[09:12.960 --> 09:17.240]  had just broken in a local Illinois paper and they were reporting how great it was and
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.960]  Lister's thought I was joking but see how you thought drag queen story time and convicted
[09:22.960 --> 09:27.000]  pedophiles was a joke when we first reported it 10 years ago, now it's fun about major
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.600]  corporations all over the world and you're just like oh yeah that's what they do, well
[09:30.600 --> 09:36.760]  now the satanic temple is getting schools with elementary schools to have satan time
[09:36.760 --> 09:42.440]  where you learn how satan's good and how God doesn't exist but satan does and so now
[09:42.440 --> 09:50.560]  we just type in to any search engine the term satanic temple to host events at Illinois
[09:50.560 --> 09:54.840]  schools you'll then learn that it's actually happening all over the country and all over
[09:54.840 --> 09:58.360]  the world, let me show you because I want to show this to viewers, the point is that
[09:58.360 --> 10:10.000]  folks didn't believe this back on Wednesday, they thought it must be a fake story but now
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.600]  if you simply type it in you'll get hundreds of articles and what's crazy is a lot of them
[10:14.600 --> 10:24.160]  are promoting it and saying it's a good time, the satanic temple after school satan club
[10:24.160 --> 10:27.480]  and the first thing satan tells you is that satan doesn't exist, I wanted to start with
[10:27.480 --> 10:35.520]  that because then it moves into this area right here, this is out of USA today and this
[10:35.520 --> 10:43.520]  was in their Friday edition, California, this is the editorial section should abolish parenthood
[10:43.520 --> 10:50.160]  in the name of equity, that's right you even having a family, you even having children,
[10:50.160 --> 10:53.360]  other people might not have that, you don't deserve it, we need you to raise your children
[10:53.360 --> 10:59.480]  in government run communes and if you go to the UN, I was there last year, they have big
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.800]  posters up everywhere on the outside at the entrance saying you'll soon own nothing and
[11:03.800 --> 11:09.360]  have nothing and then it goes on to say you'll soon live in communes and there'll be no more
[11:09.360 --> 11:14.560]  private homes, I showed you that video, people are like well that's crazy that'll never happen
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.320]  but once they start turning off the economy for years and locking people down for years
[11:19.320 --> 11:22.560]  you won't have the money to live anywhere else and you'll have to go live in the government
[11:22.560 --> 11:30.680]  communes, China made 400 million of its farmers move in to the cities and over 100 million
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.200]  died as everybody knows on record, the Chinese don't even deny that, so we're going into
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.960]  a cultural revolution, a great leap forward of becoming robot slaves in the cities, so
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.360]  here's a real article USA today, California, that's where it all starts, should abolish
[11:46.360 --> 11:52.880]  parenthood in the name of equity and then it goes on to say if Californians ever achieve
[11:52.880 --> 12:00.440]  true equity, the state must require parents to give away their children, today's Californians
[12:00.440 --> 12:06.640]  often hold up equality, the goal of just society completely free from bias as our greatest value
[12:06.640 --> 12:15.560]  Governor Newsom makes decisions through an equity lens, oh and this is a serious article
[12:15.560 --> 12:21.160]  that goes on to say but the promises are no match for the power of parents and it goes
[12:21.160 --> 12:27.920]  on to say we can have a utopia if the state raises your children, what did the UN say
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.080]  21 months ago, they said the main goal is to get lockdowns going, habituate everybody
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.280]  to them and then finally we're going to take children out of the houses where even people
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.280]  aren't sick to shield them in place in government dormitories to train the families to give
[12:40.280 --> 12:48.280]  up their children, so this isn't satire, this isn't a joke, today's California often holds
[12:48.280 --> 12:54.080]  up equality, the goal of just society completely free from bias, a utopia, as our greatest
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.640]  value Governor Newsom makes decisions through an equity lens, institutions from dance enablers
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.360]  to tech companies have publicly pledged themselves to equity and again whoever defines equity
[13:07.360 --> 13:13.160]  you must follow, but their promises are no match for the power of parents, fathers and
[13:13.160 --> 13:17.960]  mothers with greater wealth and education or more likely to transfer these advantages
[13:17.960 --> 13:23.600]  to their children, oh you see, so we're learning what the real reparations mean in the great
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.240]  reset is you put yourself into a communal system, you put your money into a communal
[13:28.240 --> 13:33.400]  system and then the computer they claim is independent and free decides what percentage
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.560]  you get back and if you do have degrees and you sign on to this, up front you get a big
[13:38.560 --> 13:44.200]  percentage of your money back, but everybody's forced to be under the control of the AI that
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.880]  fairly distributes it out, of course it doesn't fairly distribute it out, it's all programmed,
[13:48.880 --> 13:55.800]  so you want a nightmare science fiction hell, Mark and the Beast, they're now rolling out
[13:55.800 --> 14:02.640]  where this leads, we have a breakdown of it on info wars.com, WDF USA Day calls for California
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.480]  to abolish parenthood, it's very serious and then here's some of the background articles,
[14:07.480 --> 14:15.960]  this is having children is not a life affirming, it's immoral, pure research, growing shares
[14:15.960 --> 14:20.920]  of childless adults that U.S. don't expect to ever have children and then it's praised,
[14:20.920 --> 14:28.200]  one legacy of the pandemic, maybe less judgment of the child free, California again should
[14:28.200 --> 14:35.760]  abolish parenthood, it's immoral to have babies in the era of climate change and then you've
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.040]  got Yonkin says parents have a fundamental right to make the cities about their children's
[14:40.040 --> 14:46.000]  education, that's now extreme right wing to say your genetic line and who you are has
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.280]  some rights, but not all and the Justice Department's investigating the Virginia parents that
[14:51.280 --> 14:57.480]  protest, their small children being told they're white terrorists as terrorists, they're being
[14:57.480 --> 15:06.080]  investigated as terrorists, so that's a small smattering of what we have here today.
[15:06.080 --> 15:10.400]  If you don't like Satan time at your school or drag queen pedophile time, here comes
[15:10.400 --> 15:20.080]  the FBI, if you don't like your children being taught critical race theory, well here comes
[15:20.080 --> 15:27.080]  the state, now when we come back I have a stack of news articles, it's everywhere, with
[15:27.080 --> 15:32.880]  the corporate media saying it's time to permanently lock up those that don't take shots in America
[15:32.880 --> 15:36.680]  and they go look at Europe, look at Australia, that's what we're doing next and this is their
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.840]  plan and they can get people to follow these orders, they can get you to follow any order
[15:40.840 --> 15:47.560]  because this is the door being shut on freedom, all of the world's being put into a prison,
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.800]  it's a prison planet and those that take the dead, the poison death shots, well they're
[15:52.800 --> 16:00.200]  going to go beyond just being in a prison planet, they're going to be dead.
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.080]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[16:05.080 --> 16:10.080]  the globalists are doing right now, this is their big offensive, this is their takeover
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.160]  and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves,
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.200]  now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[16:18.200 --> 16:23.240]  in the open, their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate
[16:23.240 --> 16:27.960]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[16:27.960 --> 16:31.400]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.880]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[16:35.880 --> 16:39.520]  you keep us on air, plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are
[16:39.520 --> 16:46.080]  back in stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun, both of these are on our top five best sellers
[16:46.080 --> 16:50.040]  that are so good for your body and if there's two things you do for your body, it's these
[16:50.040 --> 16:54.880]  two products, they're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.560]  the air, only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[16:58.560 --> 17:04.720]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp
[17:04.720 --> 17:09.720]  in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he
[17:09.720 --> 17:12.360]  didn't stand up and then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.360]  so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand
[17:17.360 --> 17:18.360]  up.
[17:18.360 --> 17:21.320]  Well the global social credit score that China is putting in, it's banning people to three
[17:21.320 --> 17:26.680]  hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again.
[17:26.680 --> 17:31.120]  Well that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.360]  passports, they even admit it, now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it, they're
[17:35.360 --> 17:38.880]  going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you
[17:38.880 --> 17:39.880]  can do.
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.200]  That's what the lockdowns are about, you'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[17:44.200 --> 17:48.360]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[17:48.360 --> 17:51.280]  like they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this
[17:51.280 --> 17:52.280]  nightmare as well.
[17:52.280 --> 17:56.440]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved
[17:56.440 --> 17:59.840]  by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.360]  It's time to protect your privacy, it's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.760]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[18:10.760 --> 18:15.880]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[18:15.880 --> 18:21.600]  you do so in the future under their globalist takeover they can shut you down.
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.800]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[18:25.800 --> 18:30.000]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.760]  That's why everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com, we're carrying a huge new line of very compliant

[18:59.280 --> 19:04.600]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist, I wanted to
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.280]  stop their agenda, I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before
[19:10.280 --> 19:15.160]  they went operational but we failed, yes a lot of people are awake, yes we're not getting
[19:15.160 --> 19:21.320]  caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[19:21.320 --> 19:26.200]  great restart and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[19:26.200 --> 19:30.320]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[19:30.320 --> 19:31.320]  the truth.
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.640]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda and we've
[19:34.640 --> 19:38.440]  also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[19:38.440 --> 19:44.040]  storeable food, we've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at InfowarsStore.com

[20:00.760 --> 20:14.760]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:14.760 --> 20:22.320]  We are back live on this Sunday transmission, January 16th, 2022, you know I'm going to hit
[20:22.320 --> 20:28.480]  the incredible martial law, COVID announcements and national polls, the vast majority of Democrats
[20:28.480 --> 20:34.520]  want martial law declared by the president, military on the streets and the Unvax locked
[20:34.520 --> 20:39.040]  up permanently until they starved to death, that's basically what Noam Chomsky also called
[20:39.040 --> 20:45.480]  for and they're now implementing it in countries in Europe and countries in the Pacific like
[20:45.480 --> 20:46.480]  Australia.
[20:46.480 --> 20:51.360]  I'm not joking, Utah's largest newspaper calls for Unvax to endure draconian lockdowns
[20:51.360 --> 20:58.200]  enforced by National Guard, CNN has another headline, Europe's Loud, Rule Breaking Unvaccinated,
[20:58.200 --> 21:04.560]  Minority are falling out of society, my father almost died for his country fighting in Okinawa
[21:04.560 --> 21:10.000]  today, his son can no longer walk the streets of Washington DC without his papers and then
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.040]  when I read this polls to you, just wait until you see this poll, fully vaccinated Canadian
[21:18.040 --> 21:24.080]  soccer player, sideline with microcardi, this is like happening every day, so are the deaths
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.200]  and here's the big poll I mentioned, poll reveals astoundishing percentage of Democrats
[21:29.200 --> 21:36.120]  support unparalleled COVID tyranny for the unvaccinated, but we'll hit that first when
[21:36.120 --> 21:41.280]  we come back next segment, but right now let me go ahead and get back into what I was covering
[21:41.280 --> 21:45.600]  because just like I open the show up with the safe Tannock Temple endorsed by the Democratic
[21:45.600 --> 21:50.040]  Party, they actually have a partnership with them having big events all over the country,
[21:50.040 --> 21:54.480]  major Hollywood blockbuster films promoting them and they say, we don't believe in God,
[21:54.480 --> 21:58.520]  we're just Satanists and we want access to children, then you research them and let me
[21:58.520 --> 22:02.680]  tell you, they know this is a spiritual battle, but they want to first tell your kids, oh
[22:02.680 --> 22:06.320]  the devil's not real and God's not real, but the devil loves you and he's going to teach
[22:06.320 --> 22:13.280]  you how to be powerful and be enlightened, it's really what we hear about in the Garden
[22:13.280 --> 22:16.880]  of Eden whether you believe in that or not, it's being repeated in front of you in the
[22:16.880 --> 22:23.280]  real world today, but I want to go back to Joe Matthews, a big globalist heads up stuff
[22:23.280 --> 22:30.440]  connected to the UN Davos group and he very calmly and very seriously in USA Today says
[22:30.440 --> 22:36.360]  it's time to abolish the family completely and he says, give your children to the homeless
[22:36.360 --> 22:41.000]  people down the street, what he's saying is sacrifice your children, they're not building
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.600]  a global community, they want you to have no connection to anybody, that's why the CIA
[22:45.600 --> 22:50.400]  funded the sexual revolution, that's been declassified, now I'm up here telling somebody
[22:50.400 --> 22:54.000]  that I judge you if you had more than one sexual partner, no, I'm just telling you,
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.680]  they promoted it and pushed it so you would slowly break up the family and have no one
[22:58.680 --> 23:05.720]  to stand up for you, then here we are a generation and a half later and it's all here because
[23:05.720 --> 23:11.760]  it was a plan, so let's read this article because this isn't a joke and remember, it
[23:11.760 --> 23:17.240]  was USA Today just last week endorsed pedophilia and said it's not a bad thing and it's just
[23:17.240 --> 23:26.320]  a lifestyle, you're like what are they doing, well they're waging war on us ladies and gentlemen,
[23:26.320 --> 23:30.040]  this is an anti-human move and that's why people are blown away by the censorship and
[23:30.040 --> 23:38.320]  the attacks and the corruption and people that protest at school boards being called
[23:38.320 --> 23:43.920]  terrorists is because this is a real breakdown and end of the family because they want you
[23:43.920 --> 23:53.440]  to become commodities programmed pod people and if you go out to lunch somewhere, a friend
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.920]  of mine went to a Japanese kind of open counter Benihana typegill today and he showed me a
[23:58.920 --> 24:05.000]  photo of more than 20 people around the big communal table, none of them were talking,
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.640]  none of their children were talking and everybody had a phone sitting there looking at them.
[24:12.640 --> 24:16.940]  And so you say let's get rid of the family, they celebrated here that people's attention
[24:16.940 --> 24:22.080]  spans are shorter and people aren't having children, the family is falling apart, yes
[24:22.080 --> 24:27.680]  so society, he says but soon we'll be able to plug these people in to a global commune
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.120]  through computers, yeah the matrix and it'll be a utopia and he says I know this sounds
[24:33.120 --> 24:45.360]  like a dystopia but it's a utopia, yeah folks, it's a utopia, this is the takeover, the enslavement
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.800]  of humanity and I'm part of it too, I get on these phones too much, I've been programmed
[24:50.800 --> 24:54.840]  with the dopamine receptors, I mean I'm right here with you, I'm just saying we need to
[24:54.840 --> 24:58.280]  be conscious of this and protect our children, become aware of it and pull out of this because
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.800]  all the studies show the screen time is not making you happy and I know I reach you on
[25:02.800 --> 25:09.640]  the screen, that's my point, is that we've all got to have our own reset against this
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.440]  and really have a fundamental shift and realize how much trouble we're under, so column, one
[25:15.440 --> 25:21.520]  week after they promote pedophilia, California should abolish parenthood in the name of equity,
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.400]  they go on to say we can create the utopia governor Newsom wants but only by getting
[25:26.400 --> 25:32.520]  rid of parents, fathers and mothers with greater wealth and reading from it and education
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.040]  are more likely to transfer these advantages to their children, so see any advantages
[25:36.040 --> 25:44.640]  which is what survival the fittest is, is what builds civilization, what makes it stronger
[25:44.640 --> 25:47.960]  but they want to get rid of that, fathers and mothers with greater wealth and education
[25:47.960 --> 25:51.900]  are more likely to transfer those advantages to their children, compounding privilege over
[25:51.900 --> 25:58.440]  generations as a result children of less advanced parents face an uphill struggle, oh so somebody
[25:58.440 --> 26:01.920]  else is an uphill struggle because you have a mommy and daddy, that's why I always told
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.800]  you they don't want you saying mother or father on the elementary school entrance papers because
[26:06.800 --> 26:09.560]  maybe somebody else doesn't have that, if somebody else doesn't have that you can't
[26:09.560 --> 26:14.800]  even talk about what you've got, social mobility has stalled, that's globalism and the taxation
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.920]  regulations and democracy has been corrupted, see the great reset, collapse society, collapse
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.440]  the world, make you depressed and then turn around and say oh live in a commune, you'll
[26:24.440 --> 26:28.280]  have nothing, you'll own nothing, you'll now be in a heavenly world, that's their
[26:28.280 --> 26:34.720]  admitted plan, more Californians are abandoning the dream, see they collapse California on
[26:34.720 --> 26:38.560]  purpose with regulations and taxes, bring in giant, terrible populations and say oh
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.760]  the fires, the dystopia, all of it, it's the mommy and daddy's fault, if we just gave
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.160]  children to homeless people he actually says that, it would fix it, more Californians are
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.880]  abandoning the dream, a recent public policy institute of California, Paul found declining
[26:52.880 --> 27:00.600]  belief in the notion that you can get ahead through hard work, yes, yes you can't get
[27:00.600 --> 27:04.360]  ahead through hard work, they've set it up that way and when you stop working everything
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.160]  collapses and we all starve to the death, but oh he's promising a utopia, this is the
[27:09.160 --> 27:17.800]  most illogical satanic poison worse than cobra venom injected into our body politic, my
[27:17.800 --> 27:23.520]  solution, making raising your own children illegal, it's simple and while we wait for
[27:23.520 --> 27:30.160]  the legislation to pass, we can act now, the rich and the poor should trade kids and home
[27:30.160 --> 27:37.600]  owners might swap children with homeless neighbors, now I recognize that some naysayers will dismiss
[27:37.600 --> 27:45.920]  such a policy as ghastly, even totalitarian, oh no not that, but my proposal is quite modest,
[27:45.920 --> 27:51.800]  a fusion of traditional philosophy and today's most common political obsessions and then he
[27:51.800 --> 27:57.040]  goes into it all and he endorses, where do I tell you all the eugenics comes from, Plato's
[27:57.040 --> 28:01.960]  Republic, he said we should either just kill all the poor people or take their children
[28:01.960 --> 28:10.520]  away and make the elites take care of them, but if they don't we'll just kill them and
[28:10.520 --> 28:17.040]  just look at that soft, arrogant, hateful person, imagine living with him, nobody is,
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.480]  imagine loving him, nobody is, he just wants somebody to give you your children, he just
[28:22.480 --> 28:28.440]  wants to be in charge of the computer that decides how big your 200 to 300 foot cell is,
[28:28.440 --> 28:32.560]  see oh they're emptying out all the prisons under COVID to put the dissenters in there
[28:32.560 --> 28:37.000]  but all of you then go into prisons as well, the coffin apartments pushed by Bloomberg
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.880]  and all of them, Jeff Bezos, all of them, they say we're going to take all your resources
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.800]  away until you can only survive, you will drink urine, you will eat bugs, you will have nothing,
[28:49.800 --> 28:54.920]  you will own nothing, you will get no meat, you will have no children, you will be obsolete,
[28:54.920 --> 29:00.400]  we're liberals, we're liberals!
[29:00.400 --> 29:07.080]  This 2021 is gone, it's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas

[30:06.840 --> 30:11.800]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars, it's really powerful.
[30:11.800 --> 30:17.480]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye opening and revolutionary.
[30:17.480 --> 30:22.680]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex, thank you
[30:22.680 --> 30:27.200]  very much for putting the course together, I found it to be awesome, it was worth it
[30:27.200 --> 30:28.200]  to me.
[30:28.200 --> 30:34.080]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[30:34.080 --> 30:35.080]  knowledge.
[30:35.080 --> 30:40.080]  This isn't about Alex Jones, so what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well
[30:40.080 --> 30:46.320]  documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power structure
[30:46.320 --> 30:51.840]  is censoring and is definitely afraid to think the way we were intended to think by God.
[30:51.840 --> 30:53.560]  That's what this series is about.
[30:53.560 --> 30:58.840]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[30:58.840 --> 30:59.840]  my hope.
[30:59.840 --> 31:04.400]  It's been helping me a lot, with a lot that's going on in my life.
[31:04.400 --> 31:08.360]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far
[31:08.360 --> 31:09.360]  and wide.
[31:09.360 --> 31:15.560]  There is an awakening, join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[31:15.560 --> 31:21.960]  Reset Wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also learn
[31:21.960 --> 31:22.960]  new material.
[31:22.960 --> 31:26.440]  I'm not disappointed, I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[31:26.440 --> 31:31.280]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more, it's moving me.
[31:31.280 --> 31:35.720]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like
[31:35.720 --> 31:38.280]  I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[31:38.280 --> 31:42.560]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[31:42.560 --> 31:49.000]  This isn't magic, this is the real code of the universe or what matched Plank 120 plus
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.720]  years ago called The Matrix.

[32:04.840 --> 32:08.600]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the ear, go ahead.
[32:08.600 --> 32:15.000]  Now, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior citizens
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.840]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.800]  or H-spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your X-2 for the last couple
[32:24.800 --> 32:28.480]  of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[32:28.480 --> 32:34.440]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought
[32:34.440 --> 32:39.200]  well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[32:39.200 --> 32:44.680]  but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately but over a period of time
[32:44.680 --> 32:51.680]  I started noticing okay this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, I don't
[32:51.680 --> 32:58.000]  have to put on derma blend anymore so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.560]  cleared up my skin.
[33:01.560 --> 33:08.560]  Ending of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.560 --> 33:42.080]  So if you watch my film, The Obama Deception and my film Endgame, we talk about Plato,
[33:42.080 --> 33:48.520]  the most famous philosopher and historian in all of history, probably even bigger than
[33:48.520 --> 33:52.480]  Shakespeare as just a writer period, he's probably the greatest writer, single writer
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.200]  in history and he gave out a lot of multifaceted views, he'd show one view and another view
[33:57.200 --> 34:03.040]  and a separate view and so many of the philosophies in the world come out of him and I've read
[34:03.040 --> 34:07.440]  a lot of his writings, I've read three of his books at least, that's pretty much most
[34:07.440 --> 34:17.040]  of his writings and I've seen quoted in other scholarly tomes by other philosophers.
[34:17.040 --> 34:25.600]  But he is the progenitor or the great granddaddy of eugenics, of Adolf Hitler, of communism,
[34:25.600 --> 34:33.000]  of basically Hegelian dialectics of everything.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.280]  And a dumb downed personal say, you just said he's one of the greatest writers, he also
[34:37.280 --> 34:40.560]  influenced Hitler, well yeah, and Frederick Nietzsche and everybody else, that much thing
[34:40.560 --> 34:44.520]  I agree with him, but he's the king.
[34:44.520 --> 34:50.480]  And so when I talk about him in all of these films and I explain, it's Plato's world.
[34:50.480 --> 35:00.320]  He also talked about spacespaces and flying cars and unlimited energy power and all the
[35:00.320 --> 35:07.840]  rest of it, I mean who knows if that existed, but the point is, is that he's the guy that
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.920]  had all this knowledge and he's the one the globalists follow and now they're doing it
[35:12.920 --> 35:19.960]  and now they got editorial articles in the USA today saying oh pedophilia is good, yeah
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.200]  you don't have a right to keep your child away from some big fat slob when they're five
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.040]  years old, let them just grab your cat in the backyard and the kid says they want to
[35:28.040 --> 35:31.440]  have sex, they're going to have sex, but oh a man and a woman in a Gillette commercial
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.800]  and a guy asks a girl out or tells her hey would you like me to buy a cup of coffee,
[35:35.800 --> 35:39.880]  that's rape, but oh having sex with a child, grab them out of their backyard, that's a
[35:39.880 --> 35:42.440]  good thing.
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.200]  And now the US today is back this week to throw it in our face and to manipulate our minds
[35:48.200 --> 35:51.680]  and just get us used to them doing whatever they want with the homeless and the fentanyl
[35:51.680 --> 35:57.360]  and the death and the government saying if you care about America and you want sovereignty
[35:57.360 --> 36:02.240]  and you question elections, you're a terrorist and if you protest and people get out of hand
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.280]  you're all terrorists, but if we go burn buildings down on purpose we're good people, says the
[36:07.280 --> 36:15.560]  congress folks, so it goes on in USA today, now I recognize that some naysayers will
[36:15.560 --> 36:21.200]  dismiss such a policy as ghastly, it's outlawing parenthood, making everybody be raised in
[36:21.200 --> 36:26.840]  communes and you've got to live in a commune too with communists over you, it's called
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.800]  a slave camp, even totalitarian, oh really even totalitarian, but my proposal is quite
[36:31.800 --> 36:39.040]  modest, a fusion of traditional philosophy and today's most common political obsessions,
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.320]  so I went and looked this guy up and sure enough he works for the UN, the globalists,
[36:42.320 --> 36:46.320]  he's a big monkey, he muck with them, and these other groups and he's dead serious about
[36:46.320 --> 36:51.240]  all this, because that's really what he wants to do.
[36:51.240 --> 36:57.880]  In his republic, Plato adopted Socrates sage advice, you know what they did to Socrates
[36:57.880 --> 37:05.280]  for that advice, that children be possessed in common so that no parent will know his
[37:05.280 --> 37:11.680]  own offspring or any child his parents in order to defeat nepotism and create citizens
[37:11.680 --> 37:18.320]  loyal not to their sons but to society, the state is God.
[37:18.320 --> 37:22.960]  Of course nepotism has its issues, wealth always has its problems, smart people that
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.040]  are wealthy learn how to not give their children a lot, make them work so they get stronger,
[37:27.040 --> 37:30.800]  but all the communism, all the hundreds of millions dead the last century, it all comes
[37:30.800 --> 37:36.040]  out of this, and this is what the communists quote, it takes a village to raise a child,
[37:36.040 --> 37:43.840]  and of course in a real village people do raise each other's children, but in the doctor
[37:43.840 --> 37:50.880]  spock world and all the leftist programs that were pushed out there in the 60s and 70s
[37:50.880 --> 37:54.360]  and 80s, don't discipline your child, don't tell them what they should be, don't tell
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.200]  them your values, let them be themselves, you mean let the state program them, and now
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.440]  he admits that he says, oh we need nothing from parents their children, we want their
[38:02.440 --> 38:10.040]  children taken like eggs from a hen when she lays it, factory humans, programmed humans,
[38:10.040 --> 38:13.200]  and he goes on to say, this will make the global system work better because you're
[38:13.200 --> 38:17.800]  going to be a creature of the corporation programmed by a computer to serve the greater
[38:17.800 --> 38:21.760]  good of all, but no one has independent will, no one has freedom, everyone is what these
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.380]  controllers want, these self-appointed monsters, I mean look at this guy, why do they always
[38:27.380 --> 38:28.880]  look so damn sliming?
[38:28.880 --> 38:34.040]  Well if you look like him or Brian Stelter, you'd hate families, you'd hate society too.
[38:34.040 --> 38:41.480]  Today a policy of universal orphanhood aligns with powerful social trends that point to
[38:41.480 --> 38:47.760]  less interest in family, Californians are slower to marry and are having fewer children,
[38:47.760 --> 38:56.080]  our birth rate is an all time low, he goes on to say how wonderful this is, and it goes
[38:56.080 --> 39:05.160]  on, my proposal should be politically unifying, fitting hand in glove with the most cherished
[39:05.160 --> 39:11.200]  policies and progressiveness and Trumpians alike.
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.920]  The left's introduction of anti-racism and gender identity in schools faces a bitter
[39:14.920 --> 39:22.000]  backlash from the parents, ending parenthood within the backlash, helping dismantle white
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.720]  supremacy and outdated gender norms, Democrats also would have the opportunity to build a
[39:28.720 --> 39:35.240]  new pillar of the safety net, a child raising system called the foster care for all, and
[39:35.240 --> 39:38.400]  they're going to act later like, well he's being tongue in cheek, but this is all the
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.000]  official plan, it goes on to say we're going to have a universal system where you all work
[39:42.000 --> 39:51.480]  for a computer and we're all centralized to fix the global problems.
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.560]  They may even say that they really desire is what the title orphan of the musical Annie
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.640]  demanded, I didn't want to be just another orphan, Mr. Warbucks, I wanted to believe
[40:01.640 --> 40:06.240]  I was special, but the only way you're special is by not having a family, which is what makes
[40:06.240 --> 40:15.400]  you special, and target, I've seen that book in target, let's summon demons, I mean it's
[40:15.400 --> 40:20.520]  just everywhere, it's a sabotage operation to destroy civilization, so whatever they
[40:20.520 --> 40:25.720]  know hurts civilization, they're aggressively injecting it with clower and piven, the great
[40:25.720 --> 40:28.800]  reset, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, and we're already deep into the collapse,
[40:28.800 --> 40:32.600]  the supply chains are already almost gone, food shortages are everywhere, hundreds of
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.000]  millions on the edge of starvation, more than 40 plus million, they admitted now extra
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.200]  starve to death, these lockdowns, and the left loves it, I'll get to the COVID news when
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.160]  we come back now, I spent a lot of time on this, but it's very, very important, this
[40:47.160 --> 40:53.360]  new world order system is a suicide pack, and everybody must reject it, and resist it,
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.560]  with every means that's legal and lawful, we don't want to get violent, even though the
[40:57.560 --> 41:00.880]  Declaration of Independence speaks, we have the right to defend ourselves at this point,
[41:00.880 --> 41:04.560]  because they're planning on that and want that, we just have to be very, very strong,
[41:04.560 --> 41:09.000]  and see what's going on, and pull ourselves out of it, that's why they want the churches
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.880]  shut down, that's why they want us alone, so they can get you into this funk, make you
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.600]  give up on life and take full control of your mind, now, let's go to their main attack,
[41:19.600 --> 41:23.520]  shutting down civilization, the COVID garbage, and the biggest developments yet, every day
[41:23.520 --> 41:26.800]  it's the biggest developments, it just gets crazier and crazier, rollouts all over the
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.800]  news of endless lockdowns, forced inoculations, and saying, let's imprison people that won't
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.880]  take the shots, well I've got all that for you, we come back separately, a lot of you
[41:36.880 --> 41:42.200]  probably heard ads running on the radio and TV ads running, where I'm saying, hey, I'm
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.680]  cutting this on January 6th, this is only going to run for another week, and then it's
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.960]  over, 50% off, vitamin mineral fusion, 50% off, X2 deep earth crystal iodine, 50% off
[41:51.960 --> 41:58.160]  on this and that, and Thursday passed, and here we are on the 16th, those sales are
[41:58.160 --> 42:02.440]  still up, because I've been so busy with so much breaking news, and so much going down,
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.920]  that despite the fact that vitamin mineral fusion is almost sold out, and X2 is getting
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.880]  close to selling out as well, and that's L2, that I haven't had time to go cut our
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.200]  news sale, but these are very important things, vitamin mineral fusion has all the vitamins,

[42:22.040 --> 42:26.080]  deficiencies people have, is iodine, most iodine is bound to something else, so a lot
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.800]  of people have trouble absorbing it, but not deep earth crystal iodine, non-atomic iodine,
[42:31.800 --> 42:36.280]  it is the most absorbable, and it funds the info war, it's available, 50% off, everything

[45:41.960 --> 45:46.600]  on air, and the world would be a much worse position right now than it's in.
[45:46.600 --> 45:51.080]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth
[45:51.080 --> 45:53.880]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.

[45:57.120 --> 45:59.640]  same time at InfoWarestore.com.
[45:59.640 --> 46:06.560]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[46:06.560 --> 46:11.520]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[46:11.520 --> 46:15.800]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[46:15.800 --> 46:17.560]  It's done by design.
[46:17.560 --> 46:23.600]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[46:23.600 --> 46:27.640]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.480]  Group, the Trilateral Commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[46:31.480 --> 46:33.600]  and the Rockefellers.
[46:33.600 --> 46:37.880]  Until ten years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't
[46:37.880 --> 46:38.880]  exist.
[46:38.880 --> 46:43.680]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee,
[46:43.680 --> 46:49.320]  it's called Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government, and if as
[46:49.320 --> 46:53.560]  a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on, about the second thing
[46:53.560 --> 46:57.000]  or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.120]  If you expose them, we can beat a measly.
[47:01.120 --> 47:15.200]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:15.200 --> 47:30.760]  My 17-year-old daughter this morning said to me that her high school history teacher
[47:30.760 --> 47:38.240]  was asking her about me, and was asking if I was for real, and she had the perfect answer.
[47:38.240 --> 47:44.720]  She said, yeah, that's my dad, 100%, but what you see on air is just turned up.
[47:44.720 --> 47:49.000]  So smart, I love her so much, she's so amazing.
[47:49.000 --> 47:54.680]  And then she asked me, she said, but he told me that globalism was just people that care
[47:54.680 --> 47:56.680]  about the globe.
[47:56.680 --> 47:58.680]  Not a bad thing.
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.720]  Yeah, they really care about the globe, the most rich, powerful, ruthless people on earth,
[48:03.720 --> 48:08.680]  on record say they want to depopulate us, but the left, and that's what almost all these
[48:08.680 --> 48:15.560]  teachers are, they think by pretending they're with the power structure they're somehow winning.
[48:15.560 --> 48:20.280]  It's called being delusional, it's called being a useful idiot, and so all these people,
[48:20.280 --> 48:28.960]  because they're put in positions of authority, keep following the system.
[48:28.960 --> 48:32.720]  That's a perfect meme for radio listeners, this is globalism, shows the children standing
[48:32.720 --> 48:37.800]  around the earth holding hands, what we were told it is all happy rainbows, and then what
[48:37.800 --> 48:43.520]  it really is, is a bunch of powerful elites deciding how to enslave and dumb down humanity.
[48:43.520 --> 48:49.680]  Let's see the planet as their property and see you as dumb and ignorant, and this might
[48:49.680 --> 48:56.960]  be swept away, and you know a lot of the public does fulfill that prophecy, but a lot of people
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.520]  don't, and so you don't have a right to play God, and it's wrong, that all our checks and
[49:01.520 --> 49:08.560]  balances are being swept away right now.
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.680]  And everybody that plays along, they're part of the power structure, lying to themselves
[49:11.680 --> 49:14.520]  and God's watching.
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.920]  So let me read you this first article, this will take a while to get through, and then
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.200]  coming up in the third segment of the next hour, we've got something really special for
[49:22.200 --> 49:23.200]  you.
[49:23.200 --> 49:29.880]  I'll just start telling you, I told you that now I make myself, at least for part of the
[49:29.880 --> 49:34.040]  day, not have the cell phone with me, because I'm constantly reading articles and taking
[49:34.040 --> 49:38.480]  calls, and I get a lot done with it, I'm not playing online games and screwing around,
[49:38.480 --> 49:44.200]  but it still dominates my life, and so this morning I went out to take care of some errands
[49:44.200 --> 49:49.160]  before that name dropping is just a great guy, Jesse James dropped by and picked me up,
[49:49.160 --> 49:53.880]  we went to his church, I'd go with him sometimes too, I heard a great sermon there, like a
[49:53.880 --> 49:56.920]  1030 sermon or 11 o'clock sermon.
[49:56.920 --> 49:59.400]  But before that I went to the store and I was getting gas and I didn't bring the cell
[49:59.400 --> 50:04.600]  phone with me, and I saw a woman in a brand new Mustang and I'm sitting there in my car
[50:04.600 --> 50:12.040]  while my truck's gassing up, and I watched this woman pull up, white lady, and blonde
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.520]  lady, not making fun of blondes, my mom's blonde, she's really smart, but I guess some
[50:15.520 --> 50:18.160]  women just think I'm blonde so I don't have to worry about anything or whatever, this
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.120]  was a dumb blonde, and she gets out of the car, and I'm thinking, there's something
[50:24.120 --> 50:28.320]  weird, why is she walking back and forth confused, and I go, that car's got new tags, and I'm
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.040]  thinking in my mind, why is this picture not right, because you know before your brain
[50:32.040 --> 50:39.040]  clicks, I'm sitting there drinking coffee, at 8.30 in the morning, and I go, oh my god,
[50:39.040 --> 50:44.680]  that's a brand new Tesla, and I go, I'm going to get my phone, and I reach for it in the
[50:44.680 --> 50:49.600]  cup holder and it's not there, but Alex Jones doesn't get mad, he overcomes, I sit there
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.640]  and watch her go around for about a minute, can't do it, I see other people laughing at
[50:53.640 --> 50:56.960]  her, and then she just gets in her car and leaves, and I'm driving home and I say, don't
[50:56.960 --> 51:00.480]  forget when you get home to get on the desktop, that's better for your brain, it's not always
[51:00.480 --> 51:10.720]  on the phone, I get on the desktop, and I type in, woman tries to gas up Tesla, dozens
[51:10.720 --> 51:14.960]  of results, here's one of the ones, and of course it's women, now the woman looked just
[51:14.960 --> 51:19.200]  like this today, not knocking blonde ladies, it was funny, it was a blonde lady, but it
[51:19.200 --> 51:25.000]  wasn't a Tesla, it was a, excuse me, a Mustang, my brain conflates these, I've already watched
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.400]  a bunch of Tesla videos, I'm sitting there looking and going, oh that's one of the new
[51:28.400 --> 51:32.560]  Mustangs, oh that's electric, and then it kind of clicked, why is she doing that, and
[51:32.560 --> 51:38.000]  then these are videos of Teslas, so, so much data, I just mix it all together in my head,
[51:38.000 --> 51:44.400]  but I witnessed this for myself, here's a dude, he's got his trendy liberal Patagonian
[51:44.400 --> 51:50.240]  thing on, he looks like he's Asian, only singling him out because we already sent him some white
[51:50.240 --> 51:54.440]  lady acting stupid, there's dumb people in every group, so here, he's got a brand new
[51:54.440 --> 52:04.880]  Tesla, and he doesn't understand that it doesn't take gasoline, bro, do they even know what
[52:04.880 --> 52:08.600]  unleaded it is, do they even know what let it is, do they know what diesel is, do they
[52:08.600 --> 52:14.720]  know what natural gas is, and that's why I've told people that own these cars, I've told
[52:14.720 --> 52:20.160]  them, I said, you know I can show you equations and make reports that an electric car to make
[52:20.160 --> 52:26.000]  it takes about three times the carbon of a gas car, and then for electricity, most of
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.920]  it's still generated by fossil fuel, and you lose on average about half of the power down
[52:30.920 --> 52:35.480]  a power line on the average transfer line, it's about half, they have international power
[52:35.480 --> 52:39.600]  associations and U.S. power associations, you can look the actuaries up and the numbers,
[52:39.600 --> 52:44.360]  but, and you're sitting there telling them, hey you know an electric car uses more carbon
[52:44.360 --> 52:47.640]  right, which is fine with me, I mean I think that's great, we need more carbon, more carbon
[52:47.640 --> 52:52.120]  based life form, we've been carbon poor, this is great that we're taking ancient carbon
[52:52.120 --> 52:54.720]  up from the ground and putting it back in the atmosphere, we're getting on a healthier
[52:54.720 --> 53:00.600]  planet, like it was in ancient times, even mainline paleontologists will tell you, so
[53:00.600 --> 53:04.160]  I told you I was going to get to this next hour and I just did it, but I'm actually showing
[53:04.160 --> 53:12.440]  you the videos, and then something it ties in with, so imagine if I saw a woman trying
[53:12.440 --> 53:18.040]  to gas up a new electric Mustang, and then I instantly tied, typed that in and instantly
[53:18.040 --> 53:22.280]  found it, imagine how widespread this is, and I started thinking about all the hundreds
[53:22.280 --> 53:29.760]  of videos of people trying to put gasoline in plastic bags, and it's almost always women,
[53:29.760 --> 53:34.880]  because nobody taught them about cars or about gas, and they hear, hey a hurricane's coming,
[53:34.880 --> 53:38.720]  every time a hurricane or storm's coming, the gas stations just fill up with women with
[53:38.720 --> 53:43.320]  plastic bags they get inside, and then they put the gas in, and then wonder why the gas
[53:43.320 --> 53:50.160]  eats through it and spills, and they just don't know.
[53:50.160 --> 53:55.520]  And you know what, Claas Schwab is probably right, that lady probably needs to be taken
[53:55.520 --> 54:01.080]  out by the FBI, who's our lords and saviors, into a field, and shot in the back of the
[54:01.080 --> 54:08.160]  head and put in a pit, I'm being sarcastic, no I don't really want that, they'll edit
[54:08.160 --> 54:11.120]  that out and put it on the news, but that's their fault for lying, no, we need to help
[54:11.120 --> 54:16.600]  that woman, we need to inform that woman, how alone was she through her life, no one
[54:16.600 --> 54:22.120]  told her, nobody talked to her, there's hundreds of these videos, she doesn't know how to screw
[54:22.120 --> 54:25.880]  in a line bulb, she doesn't even know where electricity comes from, so when the globalists
[54:25.880 --> 54:29.720]  say you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it, they know she's so weak-minded
[54:29.720 --> 54:33.880]  she'll hear that and believe it, when they come and imagine if she had kids, they say
[54:33.880 --> 54:37.280]  hey we're taking your kids from you, that probably would be a way to help her, because
[54:37.280 --> 54:43.480]  see they've already dumbed her down so much, they've already turned her into this thing,
[54:43.480 --> 54:50.120]  she just knows how to stand behind a counter and make hamburgers all day, and I'm not
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.440]  putting her down for that, but that's all she knows, she's got plastic grocery bags
[54:54.440 --> 55:00.160]  putting gallons of gasoline in it, what did they do to her, she wasn't taught basic skills
[55:00.160 --> 55:07.960]  and I've explained this a thousand times, my dad's dad was a farmer and a rancher and
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.360]  he knew how to run electricity, he knew how to butcher a cow fast, he knew how to fix
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.640]  tractors, he knew how to do it all, and he knew how to skin a bucket, run a trot line
[55:18.640 --> 55:25.480]  and kick your ass if you needed to, that man compared to my dad and compared to me was
[55:25.480 --> 55:32.280]  like a, look like a Greek god compared to my dad and me, and we're not like you know
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.960]  bad examples of the male, imagine like I'm a towering specimen compared to most of these
[55:37.960 --> 55:42.160]  people now, they have degenerated, they have completely fallen apart, they have no light
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.000]  in the future, and then the globalists are like hey, we need to just kill all these people,
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.280]  now look at this woman, spraying gasoline on top of the car, this is not a joke, it's
[55:54.280 --> 55:59.760]  not a game, she thinks that's how you clean your car, and she's got her mask on, of course
[55:59.760 --> 56:05.120]  she's safe from COVID-19 because the fouts he told her, the news must be the authority,
[56:05.120 --> 56:09.120]  she has no man in her life, nobody raised her properly, she was raised by television,
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.640]  and now she thinks she's got a car wash with gasoline putting it on the car, these are
[56:13.640 --> 56:19.800]  real videos, but we're not going to take her out in the field and shoot her like the Nazis
[56:19.800 --> 56:23.960]  would do, we've got to understand these are the folks that are voting, these are the
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.520]  people that when they say you're a white supremacist, if you don't want your five-year-old to be
[56:28.520 --> 56:32.040]  taught white people are inherently bad, they don't know the history of this, they don't
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.840]  know how evil that is, they don't know that messes kids up, they take on like a robot whatever
[56:37.840 --> 56:46.680]  they're told, and they are completely and totally mindless, so we'll talk about that
[56:46.680 --> 56:51.400]  next hour, I didn't get into the poll yet, because these are the people that are putting
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.920]  gasoline on the windshield of their car to clean the mildew off, these are the people
[56:56.920 --> 57:01.560]  that are putting gasoline in plastic bags and putting their trunk, these are the people
[57:01.560 --> 57:06.640]  that don't know what planet they're on, and they want you locked up in prison, they believe
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.080]  they're locked up, they believe they're wearing masks, they believe they're getting sick not
[57:10.080 --> 57:16.960]  from the shots, but from you not taking them, I saw a lady today driving into work later
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.840]  in the afternoon, I pulled into a store and she was in an army uniform and I said how
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.280]  are you doing, she said I'm doing fine, how are you doing, she said I know you, you're
[57:25.280 --> 57:29.360]  Alex Jones, this is a black lady, I said hey, did you take the shots, she goes yeah, sick
[57:29.360 --> 57:32.280]  of something out of my life, brain fog horrible, you're absolutely right, they made me take
[57:32.280 --> 57:39.080]  it, have a good day, she was in the reserves or whatever, so there you go, we'll do that
[57:39.080 --> 57:49.920]  back with our number two straight ahead.
[57:49.920 --> 57:53.600]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee, welcome.
[57:53.600 --> 57:54.600]  Hello Alex.
[57:54.600 --> 57:55.600]  Yes Malcolm.
[57:55.600 --> 57:59.280]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line,
[57:59.280 --> 58:04.160]  Alex I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, Super Male
[58:04.160 --> 58:09.600]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.600]  Super Male Vitality really, really works, it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[58:14.600 --> 58:20.720]  that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[58:20.720 --> 58:25.000]  that also work quite well but just aren't as strong, this is like a very fine wine,
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.400]  in fact each batch is different, sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay,
[58:29.400 --> 58:32.440]  people are like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[58:32.440 --> 58:33.440]  strong?
[58:33.440 --> 58:38.520]  It is, it's how it works, so it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super
[58:38.520 --> 58:49.400]  strong but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it.
[58:49.400 --> 58:55.000]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world from Australia to
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.040]  the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you
[58:59.040 --> 59:03.520]  do everywhere you go, then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[59:03.520 --> 59:08.760]  taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next
[59:08.760 --> 59:14.240]  year expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and
[59:14.240 --> 59:18.480]  put them in facilities for their safety, this is nothing less than martial law and one big
[59:18.480 --> 59:22.960]  thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made
[59:22.960 --> 59:29.240]  here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[59:29.240 --> 59:34.120]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.

[59:53.280 --> 1:00:16.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:29.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:34.800]  The FDA has allowed nanoparticles into the food supply under the generally recognized
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:40.200]  as safe provision because they claim that they are no more dangerous than their larger counterparts.
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:44.760]  Titanium is generally safe, therefore nanotium must be safe.
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:50.320]  But they also admit that known materials can exhibit new or altered physiochemical properties
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:55.800]  at nanoscale dimensions, including unknown safety hazards that they will continue to
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.680]  monitor for.
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:03.320]  In other words, the human trials for consumable nanotechnology is currently happening in the
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:06.320]  public without their knowledge.
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:11.200]  Nanoparticles can be absorbed into our immune defense system and into our bloodstream.
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:16.720]  And just like the FDA admits, materials at the nanoscale can cause unknown changes in
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:19.400]  a person's biological system.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:23.760]  Animal studies have proven that nanoparticles are changing the way our bodies absorb certain
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:25.920]  minerals, such as iron.
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:32.360]  FDA chemist Timothy Duncan wrote that nanotechnology in the food supply is being held back because
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:38.200]  the food supply industry is afraid of public backlash, and argues that nanotechnology will
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:41.200]  somehow make food healthier.
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:46.160]  The FDA is far more concerned with pushing more of these experimental nanoparticles into
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.360]  the food supply than they are with safety.
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:53.800]  Like they said about giving the dangerous experimental vaccines to your kids, we're
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:58.960]  never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:04.080]  At least 20 products are adding laboratory-made nanoparticles into the ingredients, and they
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:07.400]  are getting ready to coat bananas in new nanotech.
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:12.280]  The companies are not required to disclose nanosized ingredients, so we don't know how
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:15.080]  prevalent it is.
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:20.680]  Along with being a proponent of population reduction, forced vaccinations, and genetically
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:26.920]  modified foods, Bill Gates is also the biggest private farm owner in America.
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:31.840]  Does anyone doubt for a second that Bill Gates is allowing this dangerous nanotech the FDA
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:35.840]  is pushing for into America's food supply?
[1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:41.560]  In related news, 10 out of the 19 states in which Bill Gates owns farmland, along with
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:46.760]  at least another 10, have recently made it legal to dispose of human bodies into the
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:53.920]  municipal water supply, allowing human remains to be added into bio-solid-sourced fertilizer.
[1:02:53.920 --> 1:03:01.120]  It's called alkaline hydrolysis, and is referred to in pop culture as being very, very green.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:06.560]  The leaders have strongly objected to alkaline hydrolysis because they say it is disrespectful
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:10.600]  to the human body, the vessel of a divine soul.
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:13.000]  And it's understandable why they say this.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:19.200]  In alkaline hydrolysis, the human body is liquefied with lye and poured down the sewer to mix
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:22.080]  in with the community's excrement.
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:27.720]  And if that weren't bad enough, this bio-sludge is then collected from municipal water treatment
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:32.840]  plants and used as so-called fertilizer on factory farms.
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:38.360]  The official excuse is that it saves the government money for expensive toxic waste disposal.
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:44.080]  Meanwhile, we are all being sold food that has been grown with a toxic bio-sludge made
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:50.840]  up of human remains and excrement, which is then loaded with new and strange nanotechnology.
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:04:18.400]  Interestingly, the dystopian movie Soylent Green took place in 2022.
[1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:22.120]  Coming for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:29.840]  Soylent Green, Charlton Heston, set in the year 2222 from the early 1970s, I think it
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:36.240]  came out the year I was born, yeah, 1974, all came true.
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.920]  And the whole system is based now on feeding on each other, but they've got to collapse
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.320]  the old system that was working just fine so that we believe that this is the new way
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:47.320]  for us to survive is to basically be cannibals.
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:49.960]  You're here, folks, I'm here, we're in the middle of it, it only gets worse from this
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:52.600]  point on, but there's a way to defeat it.
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:55.760]  We'll talk about it when we come back, stay with us.
[1:04:55.760 --> 1:05:05.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Keep Us On Air will continue to bring you the band
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:09.920]  guests, will continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.

[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:37.520]  So that's just a great thing for kids, I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns,
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:43.520]  I think for kids that'd be great, the Calcium Good for them, the Vitamin D, so that's at
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:48.080]  InfowarsStore.com, and again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.

[1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:57.880]  the emergency supplies, at InfowarsStore.com, your support there keeps us on the air.
[1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:14.880]  We cannot thank you enough.
[1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:22.200]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, or your mind.
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:29.840]  All right, thank you so much for being with us this evening, any show could be our last.
[1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:33.160]  The censorship isn't just on the internet now, it's in satellites, it's in banking,
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:39.720]  it's in software, basically everybody, from OAN to Michael and Del's programs are being
[1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:44.560]  blocked and taken off the air off satellite feeds, and they're moving against us as well.
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.120]  They don't intend to let the giant landslide of conservatives and nationalists that's
[1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.320]  about to happen in 296 days, they plan to try to trigger some type of bizarre civil
[1:06:54.320 --> 1:07:01.520]  war, and they're casting yours truly in hundreds of publications a day sometimes, but usually
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:07.080]  a week, as a ringleader that wants violence, and then they'll take things out of context
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:12.080]  like, we're going to fight and take them on and never give up, and we're going to win,
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:14.880]  which is like at a football game, rah, rah, we're going to fight, we're going to win.
[1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:19.040]  I'm always like, don't be violent, I'm saying have energy, fight hard for your children,
[1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:26.560]  fight hard for freedom, when you play a poker game, fight hard, it's the left saying go
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:31.800]  burn stuff down and do all that, but you see they don't care because they're losing control
[1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:37.440]  and their whole globalist, anti-God satanic project is falling apart, and so all the things
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.960]  they had planned to roll out later, the pedophile story time and the satan time and the outlaw
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:47.840]  parents, USA Today, and oh, pedophilia is good, USA Today, and New York Times, pedophilia
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:55.520]  is good, it's failing, so they're just fire everything, fire all your guns at once and
[1:07:55.520 --> 1:08:01.760]  explode into space, they're called Steppenwolf, but in an evil way, Steppenwolf, we're talking
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:06.480]  about riding out there on those motorcycles, the open planes, freedom, wind in their hair,
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:13.760]  communing with nature, riding that big old steel horse, the left didn't, riding out
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:17.600]  there with their hair blowing, they were in mask and hiding inside, they're not firing
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:21.680]  all their guns at once and exploding into space, no, no, they're saying, we need to have a
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:27.680]  commune system, we need to have everybody where they live in small 200 foot apartments
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:32.240]  and are programmed and your children are given to others because then we have to have a community
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:36.080]  that finally works because communalism doesn't work, it's falling apart because we didn't
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:43.200]  do enough of it, communism didn't work because we never did it right, but now with big tech,
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:49.120]  now you can live the utopia of a 200 square foot apartment lined with TV screens, blinking
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:53.840]  messages that you're constantly programming you, but Mark Zuckerberg will live on a 10,000
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:09:03.080]  acre palatial ranch in Hawaii, oh yes, Rupert Murdoch will live on 100,000 acre ranch, Ted
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:08.560]  Turner will live on a million acres, Larry Page will live on his own giant 20,000 acre
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:13.600]  private island, oh, and he can fly anywhere he wants and he doesn't follow COVID rules
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:20.320]  because he's the elite and you're not because why, they're liberal, they're liberal, they
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:24.080]  have little chicken necks and go like this, like Bill Gates, so it's okay that they're
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:30.320]  evil and taking over because they go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, see how it works?
[1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:33.680]  Because you're used to archetypally thinking of a guy in a uniform, we're taking their
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:37.600]  country over, our troops are landing, give up now, you go screw you, we're not giving
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:42.400]  up, but see with them it's all, oh hi, I'm Bill Gates with a pink sweater, everything's
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:49.280]  okay, oh my gosh, that Alex Jones is a terrorist, he wants to kill everybody, but I want to
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:56.400]  depopulate you and I love death panels, oh, Alex Jones is a terrorist, but they're not
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:07.360]  invincible, the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, has been defrocked, he's no longer royal,
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:13.040]  he had his titles and military titles taken from him and returned to the queen because
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:19.360]  of all the underage sex crap coming out and that's their limited hangout with him because
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:22.600]  you know that royal family's being blackmailed by the deep state, they're all blackmailing
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:28.800]  each other, but let's, let's get into how we're all being inducted into a prison and
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:36.400]  the left's told just comply and you'll get your carrot and in the past, like with a pigeon,
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:39.680]  the light's flashing, they go over and hit the panel on the ground and a little piece
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:44.720]  of grain comes out and they get used to that and they get accustomed to that and they think
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:50.760]  that's how it works, but someday they got to stick their head in a guillotine to get
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:54.880]  the food and this time off with the head and that's what this is training you for, but
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:11:00.720]  let's read this poll, it's a big national poll, Town Hall's reporting on it, poll reveals
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:09.760]  astonishing percentage of Democrats support unparalleled COVID tyranny for the unvaccinated,
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:18.280]  this is a major Rasmussen poll, well maybe shocking isn't correct term given that we're
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:24.480]  dealing with hyperbole authoritarian leftist drunk with power, still when nearly half of
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:29.760]  the members of the ruling political party literally want to see unvaccinated people digitally
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:37.640]  tracked and forced into designated facilities, don't worry they're building them, it's definitely
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:43.840]  cause for concern, oh really you think so, but they're getting all these in place claiming
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:52.200]  it's for COVID before they do the cyber attack, before the supply chain breaks down and then
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:56.840]  you'll have to go to these facilities because there won't be food, that's why each day could
[1:11:56.840 --> 1:12:02.800]  be my last folks, and the sun's setting on America and the world and they're firing
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:08.000]  up the Justice Department and all the rest of them to set me up and just suck me into
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.760]  the black hole and I'll be in a literal prison if they have their way and you'll be in the
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:17.960]  new prison planet and so will they, but they'll be pretending they follow their orders and
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:26.800]  it's going to be alright, it's only for two weeks right, I mean this stuff ain't coming
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:35.600]  folks, this stuff's here, listen to these poll numbers, 58% of voters would oppose a
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:40.200]  proposal for federal or state governments to find Americans who choose not to get vaccinated
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:45.080]  but the Democrats are all proposing that, however 55% of Democrat voters would support
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:51.920]  such a proposal compared to just 19% of Republicans and 25% of unaffiliated voters, and again in
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.640]  the Republic you can have 99% saying kill the albinos, you can't do it under law, but
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:04.760]  under democracy you can, fifth pure democracy, 59% of Democrat voters would favor a government
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:11.120]  policy requiring that citizens remain confined to their homes at all times, that's the thing
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.760]  about all the world by Noam Chomsky, you name it, that's already in place in Australia,
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:22.480]  so it's not coming, it's here, 59% of Democrat voters, demon crat, would favor a government
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:30.560]  policy requiring that citizens remain confined in their homes at all times except for emergencies
[1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:38.040]  if they refuse to get COVID-19 vaccine, which isn't even a vaccine, such a proposal is opposed
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:45.440]  by 61% of likely voters including 79% of Republicans and 71% of unaffiliated voters,
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:51.800]  including the election fraud that the majority wants it, nearly 48%, nearly half of Democrat
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:56.240]  voters think the federal and state government should be able to find or imprison individuals,
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:02.320]  this is the big enchilada, let me just highlight this for you, 48% of Democratic voters think
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.840]  the federal and state government should be able to find or imprison individuals who publicly
[1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:14.480]  question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media, so 48% of Democrats
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:19.400]  want to arrest people that say this isn't working, they want to arrest Alex Jones, they
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:26.320]  want to arrest Dale Bigtree, they want to arrest everybody, certainly half of Democrat
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:31.520]  voters think federal and state governments should be able to find or imprison individuals
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:36.560]  who publicly question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media,
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:44.240]  television, radio, and online digital publications, and Merrick Garland agrees, he says just criticizing
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:50.120]  the government's terrorism, now we've got to round you up, only 27% of all voters, including
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:55.840]  40% of Republicans, 80% of unaffiliated voters, favor criminal punishment for vaccine critics,
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:03.800]  wow, you know I probably should have led with this today, but I don't know, USA Today
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:07.800]  saying pedophilia is good, and that you should take all children from their parents, that's
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.760]  pretty big too, but it's all the same people, and I haven't even got started, it gets worse,
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:17.800]  and then I've got a whole stack of stuff just as bad, arrest everyone that doesn't take
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:21.280]  shots, put them in camps all over the world, the same headline, the same corporate system,
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:25.520]  the same nightmare, just getting you ready to people disappear and go to camps, including
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:29.720]  Djokovic, not for keeping them in the camp for a few weeks, they said you know get out
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:34.440]  of the country, we told you come here, but only to just rub your face in it, Australia's
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:40.720]  closed bitch, and your country will be soon Djokovic, and they said we don't want you
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:44.480]  here because you didn't take the shot, we don't want you to cause an uprising, oh it's
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:49.840]  not them pushing the uprising with martial law, biomedical tyranny, no, no, it's Djokovic
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:16:19.800]  who didn't even run his mouth, stay with us.
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:20.800]  the world.
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:25.040]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.920]  China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:32.680]  the big tech and the central banks and other zone.
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:39.400]  So this is a criminal takeover, and when you look at the new super class, it's the politicians,
[1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:44.040]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of congress
[1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:48.280]  and their staff, and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:54.080]  who are all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:58.280]  through corporate rule, so this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:03.880]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:07.920]  the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:12.400]  do everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:17.640]  taking people away into the night to their facilities, and they're planning in the next
[1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:22.560]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:25.280]  away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:28.920]  This is nothing less than martial law, and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[1:17:28.920 --> 1:17:33.280]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:38.200]  compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:07.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:19.200]  So for the globalist plan to succeed, they've got to take everybody off the air and silence
[1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:23.960]  the general public so they can gaslight you and say, eating bugs is good, getting rid
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:30.640]  of your children's good, pedophilia is good, world government's good.
[1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:35.160]  And you can see the people it's worked on, I was reading a major national rasmussen poll
[1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:39.400]  that similar to numbers out of Europe, and I'm going to get to the other news, but this
[1:20:39.400 --> 1:20:40.400]  is just huge.
[1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:45.920]  Let me go back to where we were.
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:50.840]  All about two-thirds of likely voters would be against governments using digital devices
[1:20:50.840 --> 1:20:56.640]  to track unvaccinated people to ensure they are quarantined or societally distanced from
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:57.640]  others.
[1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:03.280]  47% of Democrats favor a government tracking program for those who won't get the COVID vaccine,
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:07.240]  but I love how those that actually get it via their phone are signed into it and they're
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:09.000]  the ones being tracked.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:17.200]  And 45% of Democrats would favor government requiring citizens to temporarily live in designated
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.840]  facilities or locations that they refuse to get COVID-19 vaccines, and they've got bills
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:24.320]  introduced all over the country to do this.
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:29.280]  Such a policy would be opposed by a strong majority of 70% of the voters with 78% of
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:33.920]  Republicans and 64% of unaffiliated voters saying they would oppose it, but see Democrats
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:39.520]  control the voting machine, so they control the blue cities.
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:40.720]  Here's the big one.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:45.320]  How far are Democrats willing to go in punishing the unvaccinated?
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:49.640]  29% of Democrat voters would support temporarily removing parents.
[1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:52.240]  It's only temporarily to take your kids.
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:58.480]  Customty of their children if parents refuse to take the COVID-19 GMO shot.
[1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:04.160]  That's much more than twice the level of support in the rest of the electorate.
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.600]  Yes, you read that right.
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.520]  Almost a third of Democrats want to take your children if you are unvaccinated.
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:11.000]  Let that sink in now.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:16.320]  Now imagine what the U.S. would be like now if Donald Trump hadn't won the 2016 election
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:22.000]  Democrats controlled the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court's only partially held
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.720]  back forced injections.
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:27.720]  And so as imperfect as Trump is, at least that happened.
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:28.720]  Yes, that's a good thing.
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:31.600]  And that's why the system is so pissed because they'd be in full control just like they are
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:38.040]  in Australia or the U.K. or Germany, which in February they've announced forced inoculations
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:39.040]  door to door.
[1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:41.720]  You don't go to a camp like you do in Australia.
[1:22:41.720 --> 1:22:44.320]  They just come and force you to do it.
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:49.320]  Again, I saw this lady walking out of the store, started talking to her and said, hey,
[1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:50.320]  you're in the Army.
[1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:51.320]  Have you been injected?
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:57.480]  She goes, yeah, it's the worst thing I ever took, brain fog, horrible, blah, blah, blah.
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:22:58.480]  Nobody I talked to.
[1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:00.720]  It's just, it's super bad.
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:03.560]  And it turns off your immune system and they go, oh, don't worry, we've got more shots
[1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:04.560]  for you.
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:05.560]  But let's show the rest of the news.
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:07.120]  You're thinking, well, that's just rass munition.
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:12.840]  Really, Utah's largest newspaper calls for unvaxxed to endure draconian lockdowns enforced
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:14.720]  by the National Guard.
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:18.480]  They want the military to block the roads and lock people in their house and not anybody
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:21.080]  outside their home who doesn't have the vaccine passport.
[1:23:21.080 --> 1:23:24.680]  So they're training you for total martial law ahead of the engineered collapse of the
[1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:29.920]  economy and the great reset COVID is just the training wheel.
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:35.040]  So when they do it for real, you're accustomed to it.
[1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:37.520]  And at that point, we'll just be off the year.
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:40.080]  And I've let the system know because I'm not going to let them set me up and claim I'm
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:43.240]  some rebel leader that's going to run around and fight back because it's going to send
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:48.760]  brainwashed military and police, which they want to have us kill and them kill us.
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:52.040]  I'm just going to stay out of their way, go to the woods.
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:55.640]  And that's just I'll be like, hey, I did my job, folks, bought hard for you, shyonara.
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:57.680]  And they'll probably still, you know, come on and get me.
[1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:00.840]  And that's fine because they're getting themselves, but it's over.
[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:01.840]  Okay.
[1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:02.840]  All right.
[1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:06.320]  This is a total globalist takeover.
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:13.680]  Europe's loud rule breaking out of actually the minority aren't falling out of society.
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:14.680]  Isn't that cute?
[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:16.280]  And it's like, yeah, they're not allowed to go to stores or anything.
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:19.840]  And now that they can't have jobs and soon they're not going to have any money.
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:22.200]  Well, they're not going to be allowed to be homeless.
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:23.200]  Oh, don't worry.
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:25.400]  They're building facilities for them.
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.800]  And then once you're in them, you'll be forced anyways.
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:34.440]  It's not a nightmare book, it's not a science fiction dystopia, it's not a horror film.
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:37.600]  It's the real world and it's liberal.
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:41.040]  So don't be a white supremacist and take your shots.
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:45.480]  My father almost died for his country fighting in Okinawa.
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:49.360]  Today his son can no longer walk the streets of Washington without papers.
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  That's right.
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:54.800]  DC's joined a bunch of other blue cities and saying, you must have your vaccine card.
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:56.280]  Leave your house.
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:59.080]  That's how the martial law works.
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:03.320]  The illegitimate out of control government.
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:09.040]  Fully vaccinated Canadian soccer star Alfonso Davies sideline with microcarditis another
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:10.040]  day.
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:14.800]  Another person with a heart attack or heart swelling after they take the shot.
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:17.720]  Waste of time to keep vaccinated people.
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:22.120]  Ex-head of UK Vaccine Task Force says they don't work.
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:25.080]  And when you start taking more than two shots, it erases your immune system.
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:29.600]  Oh, isn't that interesting?
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:37.040]  But the surgeon general on Big Pharma payroll, Murthy Murthy says the Supreme Court blocking
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:40.560]  Biden's vaccine mandate, a setback for public health.
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:45.760]  He says that natural immunity doesn't exist in the video and that only immunity comes
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:49.360]  from shots, which actually erase it.
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:53.080]  And they just say science, science, science over and over again and set that precedent
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:54.080]  to get into your body.
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:59.280]  Oh, and look, leaked Fauci financials exposed, how he's gotten an extra $10 million from
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:05.120]  Pfizer and others just during the pandemic.
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:07.840]  Now this is a video I want to play right now.
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.680]  This is video for TV viewers of a man swarmed by masked zombies for bullhorning about COVID
[1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:19.680]  in January 6th, and they all just start touching him and pushing him like body snatchers, like
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:26.480]  soon you'll sleep, lay down next to your pod, just go to sleep, sleep, sleep, no, it'll
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:32.200]  be better, join us, soon it'll be over, take it, come with us.
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:37.040]  We've got videos all over in Canada and the U.S., people caught in New York, people caught
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:42.800]  in Toronto, people caught in Montreal, people caught in Germany, in stores, buying food
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:45.040]  and the police slam them down.
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:50.800]  They teach them, we caught you, oh, we're the good people.
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:51.800]  Here it is.
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:52.800]  You don't have to wear a mask outside.
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:53.800]  You don't have to wear a mask outside.
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:54.800]  You don't have to be an asshole.
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:55.800]  I'm going to be assaulted.
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:56.800]  I'm out of here, bud.
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:57.800]  Out of here, bud.
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:26:58.800]  They got coal, it is a hoax.
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:26:59.800]  It's a hoax.
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:00.800]  It's a hoax.
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:01.800]  It's a hoax.
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:13.200]  I'm out of here.
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:20.440]  You are more than welcome if we
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:21.460]  could!
[1:27:21.460 --> 1:27:23.460]  Assaulted by pro-Covid people
[1:27:28.180 --> 1:27:30.180]  You are more than welcome
[1:27:31.460 --> 1:27:33.460]  January 6th was a set up from half the yard
[1:27:34.580 --> 1:27:36.580]  I have all the things for this way
[1:27:36.580 --> 1:27:38.580]  The food chains are this way
[1:27:40.580 --> 1:27:42.580]  We're going the real patriot, we're over here
[1:27:44.500 --> 1:27:47.140]  You guys are supporting COVID by wearing the mask
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:50.420]  So this is California folks
[1:27:51.700 --> 1:27:53.700]  Where if you try to go out in the park
[1:27:54.340 --> 1:27:58.340]  A bunch of weird old white people wearing masks are hitting you over the head with signs
[1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:05.060]  At their quote peace rally and it goes on the full videos on info wars dot com
[1:28:06.820 --> 1:28:13.380]  Because you saw 48 percent of dem of democrats in a poll what you put in a special facility
[1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:19.780]  Oh, and then I have articles where doctors are losing their license and being put in mental institutions or being sent for psychological evaluation
[1:28:20.580 --> 1:28:22.340]  because
[1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:24.340]  They are not
[1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:29.300]  Submitting to this and saying that ivermectin works even though it's the army's own report
[1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:32.260]  On it that ivermectin does work
[1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:36.580]  But that's not something you're supposed to know the rich people all take it. You're just not supposed to know
[1:28:37.140 --> 1:28:39.140]  You're not supposed to have it because this is
[1:28:39.140 --> 1:28:45.140]  The takeover and they know best and they're gonna stop you and cover your camera up and hit you and push you and grab your
[1:28:45.140 --> 1:28:50.500]  Bullhorn, you don't talk. You don't have a word. You're not part of the group. You're not part of our collective
[1:28:51.380 --> 1:28:57.140]  You're not part of the wonderful world. We're building where where there's no families and we take your children because we're the good people
[1:28:58.260 --> 1:29:03.060]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of january 6 2022
[1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:11.140]  And that means there are only seven days left of us being able to offer our best-selling product vitamin mineral fusion at

[1:29:31.460 --> 1:29:37.140]  So we're running this until next thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast
[1:29:37.140 --> 1:29:40.580]  I want to thank you all for shopping with info wars without you
[1:29:40.580 --> 1:29:45.060]  We would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position right now that it's in
[1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:47.540]  Thanks to you supporting info wars
[1:29:47.700 --> 1:29:52.660]  We have now become the number one beacon of truth exposing the great reset and the new world order
[1:29:52.900 --> 1:29:58.020]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the same time at infowarstore.com
[1:29:58.020 --> 1:30:01.860]  Hey info warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program
[1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:06.100]  And you've fed up with everything going on in the world inside you like me
[1:30:06.660 --> 1:30:09.700]  A fire is burning something needs to change and yet
[1:30:10.340 --> 1:30:15.220]  We feel helpless almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us
[1:30:15.540 --> 1:30:17.540]  It's time for us to break free from that system
[1:30:17.860 --> 1:30:22.420]  Reset wars is a game changer. You start to see yourself more as
[1:30:23.060 --> 1:30:27.140]  Part of the solution instead of just as a victim so much of the stuff we look at today
[1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:33.540]  Is low vibration low energy and makes us depressed and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there
[1:30:33.700 --> 1:30:38.900]  When they feel their lie-cheat steel plan to enslave and rob the people there is an awakening
[1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:45.940]  Reset wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock on to the deep-rooted
[1:30:46.420 --> 1:30:52.420]  Psychological tactics that were being used against me and now i'm not scared anymore. I have to say i was blown away
[1:30:52.420 --> 1:30:59.700]  I feel so much better every day listening to it to alex. Thank you very much for putting the course together. You're absolutely right
[1:31:00.260 --> 1:31:02.580]  We are reflections of god
[1:31:02.580 --> 1:31:08.420]  We are emanations of that and we can use that god energy to do really anything we want to do in this life
[1:31:08.740 --> 1:31:12.660]  Romans chapter 12 paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:31:13.220 --> 1:31:16.740]  And that's a process most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious
[1:31:17.380 --> 1:31:19.940]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things
[1:31:19.940 --> 1:31:24.420]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip in this process
[1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:30.500]  We need to have a concerted active effort physically and mentally to reprogram that subconscious mind
[1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:35.860]  That's what this series is about is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our mind
[1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:40.420]  He's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation
[1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:46.820]  And in this new great awakening and i encourage everybody out there if you haven't gone there yet go to reset wars dot com
[1:31:46.820 --> 1:31:50.820]  That's where your journey begins

[1:33:15.620 --> 1:33:17.620]  Everybody knows
[1:33:17.620 --> 1:33:21.220]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded
[1:33:22.100 --> 1:33:26.100]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
[1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:28.100]  Everybody knows
[1:33:29.300 --> 1:33:31.300]  The war is over
[1:33:31.460 --> 1:33:35.060]  Everybody knows the good guy's loss
[1:33:35.940 --> 1:33:39.620]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed
[1:33:40.260 --> 1:33:42.260]  The poor stay poor
[1:33:42.500 --> 1:33:44.500]  The rich get rich
[1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:46.740]  That's how it goes
[1:33:48.100 --> 1:33:51.140]  And now it's getting a lot worse everybody knows
[1:33:51.860 --> 1:33:53.860]  They decided to get rid of the poor people
[1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:58.260]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
[1:33:58.980 --> 1:34:00.980]  Everybody knows
[1:34:01.060 --> 1:34:03.060]  The captain
[1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:08.020]  Everybody already talked about the sun last hour, but I've got something else. I want to play for you here
[1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:10.180]  but first just for uh
[1:34:10.260 --> 1:34:12.820]  Posterior in the record. Here's a few videos
[1:34:13.460 --> 1:34:19.300]  And I saw this in Austin myself today with a new Mustang with the woman trying to put gas in the electric car
[1:34:19.300 --> 1:34:23.060]  She bought and you can then just search engine those it's everywhere
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:28.420]  People with Mustangs people with uh other electric cars people with Teslas
[1:34:28.420 --> 1:34:32.820]  Here's two videos of a woman and a man recently with their Teslas that they've just bought
[1:34:33.940 --> 1:34:39.460]  In both cases it looks like they've got to new plates uh temporary plates and they are trying to put
[1:34:40.660 --> 1:34:42.660]  In the vehicle their gasoline
[1:34:43.300 --> 1:34:45.860]  So they went they bought the car they signed the paperwork
[1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:49.140]  And they're so disconnected from reality and how things work
[1:34:50.100 --> 1:34:51.300]  that
[1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:56.660]  They are trying to again gas up the electric car and they finally just give up
[1:34:58.100 --> 1:34:59.540]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:59.540 --> 1:35:04.260]  And and and there are other again videos that are even worse people putting gasoline and plastic bags and putting it in their car
[1:35:05.220 --> 1:35:07.700]  They just don't understand and it's funny how in all these videos
[1:35:08.900 --> 1:35:10.900]  They're wearing
[1:35:11.620 --> 1:35:13.620]  Their masks
[1:35:13.620 --> 1:35:17.140]  When they're putting gas in plastic bags and in their trunk when they're
[1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.700]  They're wearing their mask
[1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:26.020]  And of course studies show that people that are into Hollywood have the lower IQs people that are into mask have lower IQs
[1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:28.020]  It's an idiot test
[1:35:28.420 --> 1:35:33.860]  It's an absolute idiot test now. It's a paradox because as these people get dumber and dumber
[1:35:35.540 --> 1:35:36.980]  They're gonna vote
[1:35:36.980 --> 1:35:41.940]  They're gonna outnumber us and then the globalists are gonna manipulate them and have them vote to take all of our rights away
[1:35:44.260 --> 1:35:46.340]  And so it's a paradox but we can't just kill them
[1:35:46.340 --> 1:35:50.660]  But the globalists are like, oh, we're gonna kill them and kill you. That's the plan
[1:35:51.780 --> 1:35:54.100]  So here is a little intro from the amazing
[1:35:55.060 --> 1:35:58.820]  early 2000s film shot here in austin with my good friend mike judge
[1:35:59.540 --> 1:36:04.260]  That makes a joke out of this, but it's actually a parallel of what's really actually unfolding and that's idiocracy
[1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:12.100]  As the 21st century began human evolution was at a turning point
[1:36:12.100 --> 1:36:18.260]  Natural selection the process by which the strongest the smartest the fastest
[1:36:19.060 --> 1:36:24.740]  Reproduced in greater numbers than the rest a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man
[1:36:25.060 --> 1:36:27.620]  Now began to favor different traits
[1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:34.500]  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent
[1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:40.500]  But as time went on things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction a dumbing down
[1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:42.500]  How did this happen?
[1:36:43.140 --> 1:36:48.660]  Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence with no natural predators within the herd
[1:36:48.900 --> 1:36:55.860]  It began to simply reward those who reproduced the most and left the intelligent to become an endangered species
[1:36:57.140 --> 1:37:00.580]  Having kids is such an important decision
[1:37:00.580 --> 1:37:09.860]  We're just waiting for the right time. It's not something you want to rush into. Obviously. No way
[1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:15.300]  I got too many damn kids. I thought you was on the pill or something. No, no
[1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.580]  Must be a thing of Britney. Britney!
[1:37:20.820 --> 1:37:22.820]  There's no way we could have a child now
[1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:27.060]  Not with the market the way it is. No. No, that just wouldn't make any sense
[1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:29.060]  Come on over here!
[1:37:29.060 --> 1:37:32.500]  He don't care about you. Yeah, well, there must be something he likes over here
[1:37:33.620 --> 1:37:35.620]  He's not to me, baby
[1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:45.460]  Well, we finally decided to have children and I'm not pointing fingers, but it's not going well
[1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:52.820]  And this is helping I'm just saying that before I have an beetro. Maybe you should be willing to always me, right?
[1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:57.300]  Well, it's not my sperm count. Yeah! Yeah!
[1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:07.300]  Clevon is lucky to be alive
[1:38:07.300 --> 1:38:11.780]  He attempted to jump a jet ski from a lake into a swimming pool and impaled his crotch on an iron gate
[1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:17.140]  But thanks to recent advances in stem cell research and the fine work of doctors krensky and alt shuler
[1:38:17.140 --> 1:38:23.700]  Clevon should regain full reproductive function. Trades off my junk!
[1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:29.220]  Unfortunately, trevor passed away from a heart attack while
[1:38:30.020 --> 1:38:33.220]  masturbating to produce sperm for artificial insemination
[1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:38.340]  But I have some eggs frozen. So just as soon as the right guy comes along
[1:38:43.220 --> 1:38:45.220]  And so it went for generations
[1:38:45.220 --> 1:38:48.020]  Although few if any seem to notice
[1:38:50.580 --> 1:38:56.020]  At the dawn of the 21st century, the army began a top secret experiment meet joe bowers
[1:38:56.180 --> 1:39:00.740]  Our first subject for the human hibernation experiment as you know, this is highly classified
[1:39:00.900 --> 1:39:08.260]  However, if successful, we believe humans can be stored indefinitely. However, the trial run was prone to human error
[1:39:08.420 --> 1:39:11.940]  See in a year and joe slept slightly longer than expected
[1:39:11.940 --> 1:39:18.980]  Half a millennium to be exact from my judge creator office space and beavis and butthead
[1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:27.860]  If you were the smartest person in the world, this was in your mouth. This one goes in your butt
[1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:30.180]  Yeah, this thing
[1:39:30.180 --> 1:39:32.180]  This one this one goes in your mouth
[1:39:33.620 --> 1:39:36.580]  And we're stuck with the dumbest people in history
[1:39:36.580 --> 1:39:44.180]  If you have one bucket that holds two gallons and another bucket that holds five gallons. How many buckets do you have?
[1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:46.420]  Two
[1:39:46.420 --> 1:39:51.620]  What would you do? Excuse me? Um, I'm actually supposed to be getting out of prison
[1:39:52.820 --> 1:39:54.820]  You're in the wrong line
[1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:02.980]  I'm the smartest guy in the world says who like you test you took in prison. You got the highest score in history
[1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:07.460]  You've been smarter than president kamacho. This is the gentleman the president of america
[1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:10.180]  In the year 2505
[1:40:10.500 --> 1:40:16.500]  We got this guy. He's gonna fix everything. So you're smart. The ordinary will be considered
[1:40:17.380 --> 1:40:19.380]  Extraordinary, I thought you here would be bigger
[1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:23.940]  Idiocracy for the smartest guy in the world. You're pretty dumb sometimes
[1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:28.980]  And I've got an interview with my judge out there that took it off youtube
[1:40:28.980 --> 1:40:33.300]  We can probably find it somewhere at his house that he said yeah, he thought it would be like in 200 years
[1:40:33.300 --> 1:40:35.780]  We'd be this dumb, but it's actually here in like 20 years
[1:40:37.540 --> 1:40:39.540]  And that's where we are
[1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:41.780]  and it's getting worse and
[1:40:44.660 --> 1:40:46.660]  I mean at a certain point I'm not even giving up
[1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:50.660]  I just think all of us that can actually think and know what's going on
[1:40:50.900 --> 1:40:55.940]  Have to start cutting ourselves off from everybody else and not enabling them and not being nice to them not being mean
[1:40:55.940 --> 1:40:59.620]  Not being the left that wants to run everybody because the left statistically is the worst of these people
[1:40:59.940 --> 1:41:04.660]  Just just and beat not around them and just separate ourselves and do not tolerate them
[1:41:05.140 --> 1:41:07.140]  Because it's only us that run civilization
[1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:09.860]  That actually allow them to continue on
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:13.620]  The globals are taking all our civilization away to collapse the whole thing
[1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:19.220]  And then penalize those of us that built it. No, I'm not going to sit there and watch claus Schwab and lyard de caprio
[1:41:19.300 --> 1:41:23.300]  And the rest of them, you know live around in their big jumbo jets and bunkers while all these people kill us
[1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:26.980]  So I I don't know what to do. It's just unbelievable
[1:41:27.780 --> 1:41:32.580]  I mean, I saw a woman today trying to gas up her new electric car with gasoline
[1:41:34.660 --> 1:41:36.340]  And
[1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:38.340]  It's only gonna get worse man
[1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:44.980]  And imagine she'll have children probably and then they'll be raised on tv and and and and and
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:48.820]  Door dash and the foods delivered and they don't know how to do anything
[1:41:48.820 --> 1:41:53.860]  And again, I don't know how to do as much as my dad does and and he couldn't do as much as his dad could do
[1:41:54.340 --> 1:41:58.020]  And I literally am an idiot compared when it comes to doing those things
[1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:01.780]  I mean, I know how to skin a buck and cut it up and put it's not the prettiest
[1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:08.100]  And I know how do I had to to mess with electricity and breaker boxes and if I had to I could look under the hood of a car and change the tire
[1:42:09.460 --> 1:42:11.460]  But our grandpas all know how to do it all
[1:42:13.940 --> 1:42:16.660]  That's why we import third world populations from farmer states
[1:42:16.660 --> 1:42:20.100]  Which is actually a good thing if they're not put on the globalist tip right away
[1:42:20.100 --> 1:42:22.740]  but within a generation their kids are ruined too because
[1:42:23.780 --> 1:42:25.300]  They know how to
[1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:29.940]  String electrical or build a house or do something because that's what people do everywhere else because they're
[1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:33.860]  Operative humans humans know how to do cool stuff and humans like to do work
[1:42:34.100 --> 1:42:39.940]  But instead we watch tv and we work in offices and we put gasoline and electric cars
[1:42:41.460 --> 1:42:43.460]  And then we vote democrat
[1:42:43.460 --> 1:42:47.060]  I mean, it's it's it's just a mess
[1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:51.700]  All right, stay with us final segment ahead of sunday live coming up
[1:42:58.420 --> 1:43:02.500]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up
[1:43:03.380 --> 1:43:06.900]  For what the globalists are doing right now. This is their big offensive
[1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:12.580]  This is their takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves
[1:43:12.580 --> 1:43:17.460]  Now their world government their permanent martial law their medical tyranny is out in the open
[1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:20.020]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[1:43:20.260 --> 1:43:26.100]  But they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth
[1:43:26.500 --> 1:43:30.740]  So listen paul reveres when you spread the word about the broadcast when you pray for the broadcast
[1:43:30.900 --> 1:43:35.460]  You're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com you keep us on air
[1:43:35.620 --> 1:43:38.980]  Plus we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock

[1:43:44.900 --> 1:43:47.940]  They are so good for your body and if there's two things you do for your body
[1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:51.780]  It's these two products. They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com
[1:43:52.100 --> 1:43:56.180]  50% off and it keeps us on the air. Only way we fail is if you don't take action
[1:43:58.420 --> 1:44:01.940]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad
[1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:08.260]  Wait till they've got their world ID and then that's exactly what the covet passports are all about
[1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:13.060]  And clout swab and the un and all the other globalist leaders own words
[1:44:13.140 --> 1:44:16.820]  They admit that once they've gotten you with that system then
[1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:21.060]  They're gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do
[1:44:21.620 --> 1:44:27.620]  And publicly they're saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard
[1:44:27.700 --> 1:44:33.940]  And then all the other big companies are currently announcing that they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax you
[1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:37.140]  With a carbon tax for it. This is the holy grail
[1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:42.420]  Of tyranny ladies and gentlemen, this is the takeover and humanity better wake up and say no
[1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:47.860]  Finally folks are starting to wake up. Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson others who leave the charts along with info wars
[1:44:48.020 --> 1:44:51.300]  But it's not enough every individual has to not comply
[1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:57.460]  We have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice. You see they need the fear of god put in them legally and lawfully
[1:44:57.460 --> 1:45:04.340]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas, Mexico the communist?
[1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:11.060]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world. That's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than
[1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:15.380]  Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that you know, the media calls communist
[1:45:15.380 --> 1:45:20.340]  But really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers
[1:45:20.340 --> 1:45:24.900]  Don't let the Mexican government take over so actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what?
[1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:29.780]  14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more
[1:45:29.780 --> 1:45:36.020]  For pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere. It's wake up America patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels
[1:45:36.020 --> 1:45:38.020]  literally
[1:45:38.020 --> 1:45:40.020]  In fact, I'm gonna tell you a little story

[1:47:40.180 --> 1:47:41.780]  Oan shroyer about to take over
[1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:46.420]  I want to just add a little tidbit about this here in the final segment of the sunday edition of the alex jones show
[1:47:48.340 --> 1:47:49.940]  Our own
[1:47:49.940 --> 1:47:51.940]  sam motoya
[1:47:51.940 --> 1:47:54.420]  For being a cameraman at the capital doing nothing wrong
[1:47:54.980 --> 1:48:00.500]  Indicted facing trial years in prison. Oh, it never even went in the capital was there trying to stop people going in
[1:48:00.900 --> 1:48:02.900]  He's been charged facing years in prison
[1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:07.140]  And they admittedly have grand juries and paneled everywhere
[1:48:08.260 --> 1:48:10.260]  trying to
[1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:11.700]  Claim that
[1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:14.020]  michael indell was part of a secret plan
[1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:18.980]  And roger stone and alex jones and all of us in some secret plan
[1:48:18.980 --> 1:48:22.980]  To totally destroy what we wanted to do by attacking the capital
[1:48:23.380 --> 1:48:29.620]  We wanted a 10-day legal lawful investigation by the senate something polosi tried four years before and failed
[1:48:30.260 --> 1:48:35.700]  We did exactly what they were doing. No, we did not want to have a bunch of people ransacked the capital
[1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:39.140]  Hurt of motives
[1:48:39.620 --> 1:48:41.780]  But it's it's just totally insane
[1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:45.220]  People ask me everywhere. Well, what about steward roves?
[1:48:45.220 --> 1:48:48.820]  He never told me anything about wanting to attack the capital
[1:48:49.780 --> 1:48:54.100]  He did talk about well, there's a revolution. It's how do you think it's going to kick off stuff like that on air?
[1:48:54.340 --> 1:48:58.580]  And I was always like, well, I don't want a physical confrontation. This is an info war a spiritual awakening
[1:48:58.580 --> 1:49:03.860]  That's how we really beat this. They're losing the fight for hearts and minds. So they've got to steal elections, but
[1:49:05.220 --> 1:49:09.540]  I don't know the steward roves indictment is true or not because they lied about oan. I don't know if it's true
[1:49:09.540 --> 1:49:16.340]  But I do know that it matches up at least the parts with them going into the capital and some of them
[1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:19.620]  in in
[1:49:19.620 --> 1:49:24.100]  Not beaten police over the head with fire extinguishers and really bad stuff that what you could call a different murder
[1:49:24.340 --> 1:49:26.340]  The folks that did that he just spent a lot of years in prison
[1:49:26.500 --> 1:49:31.060]  But pushing police over and crap like that. That's just that's idiocracy crap
[1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:36.580]  That's really dumb. I opposed them attacking the courthouse in portland. I opposed
[1:49:36.580 --> 1:49:44.100]  You know the islamist is trying to blow up the world trade center. I mean, I'm just I'm against violence period. That's offensive. Okay
[1:49:44.900 --> 1:49:46.500]  and
[1:49:46.500 --> 1:49:52.980]  To know that with a straight face they're in newsweek and CNN and the New York Times saying, oh, well, jones is close
[1:49:54.340 --> 1:50:00.100]  Our justice department sources say, you know, they're on his tail. It's just whatever
[1:50:03.060 --> 1:50:05.060]  That was the most claustrophobic
[1:50:05.060 --> 1:50:07.060]  bad day of my life
[1:50:07.540 --> 1:50:08.820]  and
[1:50:08.820 --> 1:50:12.020]  Sometime I've got to just do a rant about it on here and tell the story of that day
[1:50:13.300 --> 1:50:17.860]  And then and then kind of add video to it and let it be like a 10-minute documentary just to describe
[1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:20.340]  getting up
[1:50:20.340 --> 1:50:24.180]  A little later than I should thinking we had till 9 30 to get there. They're like, no
[1:50:24.180 --> 1:50:26.340]  It's gonna take an hour to get there to the crowd
[1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:30.820]  Even though we're at a hotel, you know a half mile from the ellipse
[1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:33.860]  Because all the roads are shut down and
[1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:38.820]  Having my breakfast there, but I couldn't eat it. I just remember that and drink us some coffee
[1:50:39.380 --> 1:50:42.660]  And then going out and it took 45 minutes or so to get around
[1:50:43.220 --> 1:50:47.940]  The Washington monument and the million people that were there trying to get to the tiny ellipse that held like 30,000
[1:50:48.740 --> 1:50:53.940]  With the fences and the porta potties and the jumbo tron and then they go. Oh, sorry. No matter if you have a VIP ticket
[1:50:55.220 --> 1:50:57.220]  You've got to go around
[1:50:57.220 --> 1:51:01.860]  So it took us another 30 40 minutes to go around these crowds just like an amash pit or in a, you know
[1:51:02.420 --> 1:51:04.660]  Rock-and-roll concert that I'd go to when I was a teenager
[1:51:04.660 --> 1:51:07.780]  We were just crushed up against the stage and just want to get out of there
[1:51:08.340 --> 1:51:13.860]  And so we finally get into the ellipse. It's all the republicans. They're fancy outfits and everything and listening to trump speak
[1:51:15.300 --> 1:51:17.300]  My wife's like, let's just go
[1:51:17.300 --> 1:51:19.300]  Let's just go back to the hotel and eat. I'm hungry
[1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:21.860]  This this sucks went on for like five hours
[1:51:21.940 --> 1:51:25.700]  And I'm watching all the republicans. They're fancy outfits and everybody being so excited to be there
[1:51:25.700 --> 1:51:30.500]  Like it's a debutant ball, which I don't like that kind of stuff. I'm not just into being in the elite, you know group or whatever
[1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:35.300]  And I'm like, you're right, baby. They claim that I'm gonna lead the march. I don't know how I'm gonna lead this march
[1:51:35.780 --> 1:51:39.620]  You see the million people that they didn't get in they're already going down pencil vending avenue over there
[1:51:39.780 --> 1:51:41.780]  So we're right there in the second row. We can see it
[1:51:42.020 --> 1:51:47.300]  You know, here's the white house and here's the stage and here's the avenue people going down. I said can't lead that
[1:51:48.420 --> 1:51:50.420]  And we're like, yeah, let's go screw this
[1:51:50.420 --> 1:51:55.620]  She was my feet are freezing baby. Let's just not do this. I mean, so what I just uh
[1:51:56.740 --> 1:51:58.740]  And I'm like, you're right
[1:51:58.740 --> 1:52:03.780]  And then all of a sudden they go, it's time. Mr. Jones. The secret service is gonna let you out to lead it now
[1:52:04.420 --> 1:52:08.100]  And it's like surreal while trump's speaking. I'm walking right up the front right there
[1:52:08.100 --> 1:52:10.660]  He's there the secret service opens it up this way, sir
[1:52:11.140 --> 1:52:14.980]  And they take me back to okay. There's the crowd for you to lead. I'm like, what?
[1:52:16.180 --> 1:52:20.100]  And I later learned they went to roger stone right around the same time secret service
[1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:22.980]  By the way, he has the photos of their badges in them. He demanded them
[1:52:23.060 --> 1:52:28.580]  He's in a exclusively shown tomorrow people. He just made that up and he's like, uh, you got the secret service here to
[1:52:28.580 --> 1:52:30.580]  Lead me to the capital
[1:52:31.060 --> 1:52:34.660]  He said my wife doesn't feel well and that's a giant crowd and I don't feel safe
[1:52:35.300 --> 1:52:39.460]  Because I didn't feel it had a bad feeling that I thought well, it's just the size of this crowd now weird this is
[1:52:42.180 --> 1:52:46.820]  And using big crowds are kind of scary it's like a NFL football game or whatever and so
[1:52:46.820 --> 1:52:51.060]  Roger had that instinct and then he's like
[1:52:52.820 --> 1:52:54.500]  You know what?
[1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:58.900]  My donor his donor that already flew him out there on a private jet. He said that then he goes
[1:52:58.900 --> 1:53:03.860]  I want to leave this is roger falling his instincts. He goes. I want to leave. He told me this that night
[1:53:05.700 --> 1:53:11.940]  He leaves and goes against on a jet and flies out of there and then they swat team his room hours into what came later
[1:53:11.940 --> 1:53:18.260]  And my wife had the same feeling she's like, I don't like this I
[1:53:18.820 --> 1:53:23.860]  And she's like, I'm sick of Trump party. You know, I'm like, yeah, just all of it like it's hollywood and all the
[1:53:24.820 --> 1:53:29.220]  Kimberly gilfew up there all pretty just and just and juliana looked like a ghoul up there
[1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:34.580]  And I'm not even putting Trump down. He did a lot of good stuff or anything, but I'm just not into the republican pageantry of it
[1:53:35.860 --> 1:53:37.860]  and then
[1:53:37.860 --> 1:53:43.620]  To go down there get there. They're already breaking on the capital to try to stop it and the left all knows that
[1:53:44.900 --> 1:53:46.900]  And I get calls from the wall street journal the new york times
[1:53:46.900 --> 1:53:52.580]  They go mr. Jones, please call us. We can't find the video that you claim is out there if you're trying to stop it
[1:53:53.220 --> 1:53:56.500]  I just sent him a sign of the cross. I took a photo of a cross near my house at a church
[1:53:56.500 --> 1:54:01.380]  I think it's pretty the sunset. I just find that and I just send them that hey vampire. Here's a sign of the cross
[1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.420]  Because the first few times this happened
[1:54:04.420 --> 1:54:09.860]  I would send them the video and they would just say oh jones didn't respond. They just say it doesn't exist
[1:54:10.980 --> 1:54:13.220]  Seeing in sent norm patis while I was in
[1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:18.900]  An office with him a friday and said you want to respond to all the stirred road stuffing of a statement
[1:54:19.140 --> 1:54:24.020]  He said yeah, here's our statement. The very writer then said an hour later. I got no response back
[1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:31.220]  Even though he responded back it was like oh very funny norm patis very cute as we said
[1:54:31.220 --> 1:54:36.980]  Oh, yeah, you just heard about kamala Harris bailing out people that attacked the portland courthouse with hatchets and tried to burn it down
[1:54:37.780 --> 1:54:39.780]  You're asking if we feel responsible
[1:54:39.780 --> 1:54:44.260]  A lot less responsible than kamala Harris and they won't respond they then they lie
[1:54:44.900 --> 1:54:48.500]  And again, I know you know seeing in lies but folks they are liars
[1:54:50.420 --> 1:54:52.420]  They lie about everything
[1:54:52.420 --> 1:55:00.420]  And so I talked to roger today, and he's really upset about the country and everything and and he's he's upset about
[1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:04.500]  He's gonna break a lot of stuff here tomorrow
[1:55:04.980 --> 1:55:07.460]  I'll I'll leave it at that and he is suing CNN
[1:55:08.020 --> 1:55:12.260]  One of the reporters said that he he he ran the the capital attack
[1:55:13.300 --> 1:55:15.300]  So that's it. I gotta sue him
[1:55:15.300 --> 1:55:22.580]  And he went on I said house trump and he just you know, he just said
[1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:26.420]  He just said uh, he's I'm gonna tell you what he'll I'll see if he wants to say it on there
[1:55:26.500 --> 1:55:28.260]  I think he was gonna want to say it
[1:55:28.260 --> 1:55:30.580]  But it doesn't mean the democrats aren't five times ten times worse
[1:55:30.820 --> 1:55:36.020]  It's just that trump is now in la la land and endorsing a lot of really bad republicans that weren't like the good people
[1:55:36.020 --> 1:55:39.300]  He used to endorse and then he's got that social media thing
[1:55:39.780 --> 1:55:44.260]  That's gonna there's already a fiasco and just roger is really upset because he just wants trump to win
[1:55:44.260 --> 1:55:49.860]  He wants trump to be smart and good and and and not be part of the swamp with these people
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:53.220]  And and he did do a lot of good. We got you know, I mean
[1:55:54.180 --> 1:55:58.340]  You're better than nothing. It's just and I'm very very torn because I sacrifice so much to promote trump
[1:56:00.340 --> 1:56:01.540]  And
[1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:05.140]  You know, I'm like tied to him even though
[1:56:06.500 --> 1:56:13.060]  I'm not influential with trump. I don't talk to trump and the democrats know that I've just become the symbol of what they call a deplorable
[1:56:13.060 --> 1:56:15.060]  And so I'm this caricature
[1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:19.780]  That they demonize and they lie about and they attack and then they indict
[1:56:20.580 --> 1:56:22.580]  One of my camera people one of my reporters
[1:56:23.060 --> 1:56:30.580]  For doing absolutely nothing on january 6 when reyeps is they're screaming and helping break through barriers and saying go in and attack the capital
[1:56:30.980 --> 1:56:37.140]  And the justice department says oh and the and the congress committee says oh, that's normal. You're allowed to be on the grounds
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:45.140]  Oh really. Oh and shroyer has been arrested for being on the capital grounds trying to stop it. It's the murder of logic
[1:56:45.780 --> 1:56:47.780]  the murder of truth
[1:56:48.500 --> 1:56:49.700]  and
[1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:55.940]  It's just see the general system go crazy because yeah, there's a method a crazy method of the globalist madness
[1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:57.860]  But they're still insane
[1:56:57.860 --> 1:57:03.780]  And and all of this is just insanity. They already have they're trying to make us crazier than they are so they can feel superior
[1:57:03.780 --> 1:57:13.380]  And I am really really really concerned and I just pray for global awakening and I pray for all of you and I pray that that king david's prayer that he gave after he'd
[1:57:14.900 --> 1:57:17.300]  You know commended that great crime of murder
[1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:22.340]  That god come in and clean out his heart and give him a new fresh heart. I pray for that that prayer right now
[1:57:22.340 --> 1:57:24.340]  And I pray for that for all of you
[1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:28.100]  Because we are a nation going over the edge of cleverness so sad
[1:57:28.660 --> 1:57:31.940]  And I just want peace and justice and it's it's it's so scary to see where we're going
