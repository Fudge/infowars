[00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:06.134]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:07.896]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:09.658]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:11.239]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:21.108]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:48.574]  In the next 10 minutes, Paul Joseph Watson is set to publish a key report at PrisonPlanet.com dealing with President Obama and October or even early November surprise stage terror attacks.
[00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:51.536]  We've learned to read the signs when they're considering staging an event.
[00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:58.499]  They are full court press right now, hyping that terrorists may strike the United States.
[00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:11.626]  And we have Obama and Clinton advisors like Robert Shapiro saying what Obama needs is a giant terror attack to win the midterm elections and to get a second term in 2012.
[00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:16.248]  I mean, they're out in the open talking about this.
[00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:20.329]  The criminals that run our government, that run many other governments, have been caught staging events.
[00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.550]  Hitler did it.
[00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.970]  The czars did it.
[00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.271]  After them, the communist Russians did it.
[00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:29.952]  I mean, it's a favorite tactic used.
[00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:36.354]  And so this detailed report that I consulted with Paul on has got a lot of key bullet points, and that's coming out in the near future.
[00:01:36.354 --> 00:01:39.395]  We'll cover that after we get into the economy coming up.
[00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:50.528]  Well, there I was back in late July, and we wrote multiple articles at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com predicting staged terror attacks.
[00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:57.012]  And if you go listen to the full shows that we did on it, I even, of course, and we're busy pulling those clips up.
[00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:04.279]  Because we don't sit here when I make predictions and just mark them down, something we really ought to do so they're easier to pull.
[00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:19.706]  But listeners are welcome to go to our YouTube channel that has most of the shows posted, or the MP3s, all archived at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the video archive there, and help us pull all of these predictions out for the general public.
[00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:26.969]  But it's not hard to make those predictions when you understand the globalist mindset and game plan.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:46.931]  And when you see all of these Obama advisors out in the open saying, if we don't have an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 event so Obama can look like a strong leader who protects us, we're going to have total political destruction.
[00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:55.256]  But I've pointed out that even staged terror isn't going to work for them anymore because the vast majority of people are very suspect of this.
[00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:57.598]  They don't buy into it anymore.
[00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:06.529]  I said last night that I believe you're going to see more of these packages mailed and bombings.
[00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:20.215]  I'm on record saying Friday and Sunday, on Friday's show and yesterday, less than 24 hours ago, that there's a very good chance we're going to see more events leading right up until tomorrow.
[00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:31.423]  Here is Reuters, Greece intercepts parcel bomb addressed to Sarkozy.
[00:03:31.423 --> 00:03:50.178]  Again, Greece intercepts parcel or package bomb addressed to Sarkozy and Greek police intercept a booby trap parcel addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday after another package exploded at a courier company in Athens, slightly wounding an employee.
[00:03:50.178 --> 00:03:51.179]  The heat is on.
[00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:57.609]  And notice they're claiming a leftist slash communist group did this.
[00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:12.079]  Now, I'm no fan of leftists and communists, but if you go back to Patty Hearst, it was declassified last year that she was FBI and those were staged events to basically menace the public into giving up more of their liberty.
[00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.462]  And Nixon got caught wanting to bomb his own conviction, his own convention.
[00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:22.704]  That's even come out on Frontline on PBS, but they called it off.
[00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:27.027]  And we know about Operation Gladio and the NATO option in Europe.
[00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:34.932]  We have the former Italian president, who was also the former Italian intelligence head, coming out last year talking about the U.S.
[00:04:34.932 --> 00:04:39.015]  government staging terror attacks in Italy to blame leftists.
[00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:43.759]  The Bologna bombing and other events and that's exactly what we've got going on here.
[00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.241]  The evidence is clear.
[00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.564]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming on to talk about this.
[00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:49.566]  Paul Watson coming on to talk about it.
[00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:52.770]  We've got Wayne Madsen coming on to discuss it.
[00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.233]  All the election news, you name it, it's coming up.
[00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:59.137]  Paul Watson joining us via video Skype on the other side of this break.
[00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.439]  Hello from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.001]  The end of October is around the corner and there's no shortage of frightening news these days.
[00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:15.025]  Global financial meltdown, saber rattling with Iran and other nations, worldwide drought and food shortages.
[00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:19.727]  More than 40 million Americans on food stamps and tens of millions unemployed.

[00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:51.231]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:05.263]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:09.186]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:11.468]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.468 --> 00:06:17.292]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:23.517]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:29.942]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:34.105]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.105 --> 00:06:38.409]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.354]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:47.917]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:49.878]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.878 --> 00:06:50.319]  It's here.

[00:06:59.744 --> 00:07:03.927]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:10.332]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.332 --> 00:07:17.718]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:22.602]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:22.602 --> 00:07:24.744]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:31.291]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:33.593]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:33.914]  Call us!

[00:07:58.503 --> 00:08:00.726]  Thank you.
[00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:03.489]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:06.273]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.663 --> 00:08:20.872]  We're going to be breaking down the economy, the huge developments on the eve of Super Tuesday tomorrow, November 2nd, 2010.
[00:08:20.872 --> 00:08:25.837]  Less than 24 hours out right now from this historic midterm elections.
[00:08:25.837 --> 00:08:26.998]  It is November 1st, 2010.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.701]  2010, extremely long in the tooth.
[00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:35.542]  Incredible dirty tricks going on.
[00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:37.563]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:37.563 --> 00:08:40.944]  Phone recordings set off firestorm in Alaska.
[00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:44.485]  Republican Senate candidate Joe Miller of Alaska.
[00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:50.907]  CBS TV accidentally called and thought they'd hung the phone up, but left it on a voicemail.
[00:08:51.747 --> 00:09:05.964]  Kind of like a pocket call when somebody's cell phone accidentally dials you and they talked about how they were going to set him up and destroy him by basically having child molesters at his events, trying to get fights started, anything they can do.
[00:09:05.964 --> 00:09:08.528]  This is the type of dirty tricks that the Democrats
[00:09:09.773 --> 00:09:11.874]  I mean, look, Republicans play dirty tricks as well.
[00:09:11.874 --> 00:09:13.095]  Politics is a dirty business.
[00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:18.559]  But Democrats have sold this image that, oh, Republicans are beating people up everywhere.
[00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:20.621]  Oh, Republicans are like brown shirts.
[00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:22.482]  They're like Nazis.
[00:09:22.482 --> 00:09:29.587]  For every video we find of a Republican beating somebody up at a tea party or a campaign event, there's got to be literally 10, 15, 20.
[00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:39.554]  Of Democrats cutting people's fingers off, beating them up, beating their heads in with two by fours, assaulting people.
[00:09:39.554 --> 00:09:45.159]  Jon Stewart's employees beating up and being arrested.
[00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:48.501]  We are change people for politely asking questions.
[00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:50.683]  I mean, it's just mad dog attacks.
[00:09:50.683 --> 00:09:53.005]  So again, I'm nonpartisan.
[00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:54.606]  I just call it like it is.
[00:09:54.606 --> 00:09:56.827]  The Democrats are the brown shirts here.
[00:09:57.868 --> 00:09:59.910]  And they're getting caught, so that's coming up.
[00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.732]  Great news on Rand Paul, headed for easy victory.
[00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:04.954]  They've got national polls out on that.
[00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:08.297]  He's pulled away in some polls over 15 points.
[00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:10.379]  Most polls are 11 points.
[00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:12.881]  The lowest polls have him with a 9 point lead.
[00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:15.403]  That's 4 points above the margin of error.
[00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:18.125]  This is amazing.
[00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:19.745]  Bill Clinton campaigns for you.
[00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:22.086]  In Florida, you lose.
[00:10:22.086 --> 00:10:24.388]  He campaigns for you in Kentucky, you lose.
[00:10:24.388 --> 00:10:28.669]  He campaigns for you in Pennsylvania, you lose.
[00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:33.612]  Newt Gingrich campaigns for you as a Republican in the primary against Rand Paul, you lose.
[00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.572]  People are sick of these establishment candidates.
[00:10:37.572 --> 00:10:43.336]  This is a major political realignment that is taking place.
[00:10:43.336 --> 00:10:54.263]  Also, coming up, this is out of the Pittsburgh News Channel, ABC News 4, Team 4 debt collectors accused of fake courtrooms, fake judges.
[00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:57.646]  This is exactly what the CPS does.
[00:10:57.646 --> 00:11:05.630]  This is exactly what the Health Department does in Texas, claiming you've got to take the Gardasil shot that's killed so many people and maimed so many others.
[00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.911]  They just lie and say it's the law.
[00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:10.453]  And they send out fake letters ordering you to do it.
[00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:14.314]  Well, now debt collectors are running the same scam.
[00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:17.156]  And that integrates in with the Star Tribune story.
[00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:18.937]  In jail for being in debt.
[00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:25.452]  And it turns out they haven't broken a law, but the courts are so corrupt, they'll still send you to jail.
[00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:26.434]  In some cases...
[00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:32.559]  For less than a hundred dollars that is owed to a private company.
[00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.822]  Here's another report from the ACLU.
[00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:44.111]  In for a penny, the rise of America's new debtor prisons and that integrates in with the IMF tax tribunals coming to American soil.
[00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:45.833]  Openly being announced.
[00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:50.238]  That's a story at InfoWars.com by Kurt Nemo.
[00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:54.412]  And again, we're going to go over the economy.
[00:11:54.412 --> 00:12:00.814]  Speaking of the economy, I'm going to put up the photo that's on the Drudge Report's front page right now for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:12:00.814 --> 00:12:03.996]  Watson's also got it linked up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:03.996 --> 00:12:06.657]  Brother, can you spare a dime?
[00:12:06.657 --> 00:12:09.598]  Man begs to Obama.
[00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:14.020]  Comes up to his motorcade and gets on his knees and begs.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.042]  Remember all the people during the campaign and the day he got elected in November of 2008 rejoicing?
[00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:35.074]  In New York and Florida and Texas and California think, thank you President, I don't have to worry about my house payment, I don't have to worry about my car payment, everything's solved!
[00:12:35.074 --> 00:12:51.159]  Two years later, it'll be two years tomorrow, two years into his election, his inauguration was in January, in January 22nd it'll be two years in office, the Democrats are openly talking about Obama not getting the nomination for the 2012 election.
[00:12:56.032 --> 00:13:00.673]  But if people think the Republicans are going to go in there overnight and fix everything, they've got another thing coming.
[00:13:00.673 --> 00:13:07.155]  It's the sustained anger that is going to change the face of this nation for the good.
[00:13:07.155 --> 00:13:15.537]  And if the Republicans think they're going to go in there and soft-soap all this and whitewash it and sell pap to the public, they've got another thing coming and they know it.
[00:13:15.537 --> 00:13:22.979]  That's why Senator DeMint last week said he may leave the Republican Party if they don't fully deliver on getting rid of Obamacare, cutting taxes.
[00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:27.783]  So that's just some of what's coming up on that front.
[00:13:27.783 --> 00:13:39.468]  We do have Wayne Madsen coming up in the middle of the next hour to talk about all the stage terror, and then Webster Griffin Tarpley also coming on because this is so big, this is so important.
[00:13:39.468 --> 00:13:52.993]  Starting the show just a few minutes ago, I played a clip of late July when Paul Watson and I wrote articles with the headline, Clinton Advisor Tells Obama Without Stage Terror,
[00:13:54.093 --> 00:13:57.138]  His political destiny is over.
[00:13:57.138 --> 00:14:07.616]  And we put those articles out and I said specifically look for more dud attacks like the underwear bombing, like the Times Square,
[00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:15.062]  Because they have to use patsies who are mentally ill to go out and carry out these attacks, but it's ineffective.
[00:14:15.062 --> 00:14:22.307]  But more importantly than being ineffective, when it doesn't kill a bunch of people, then they don't have to have a real investigation.
[00:14:22.307 --> 00:14:25.710]  And Obama can say, see, I protected you.
[00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:33.775]  Well, Friday evening watching the news, Saturday and Sunday, listening to Beyond the Beltway yesterday, driving home after my Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:14:33.775 --> 00:14:38.539]  Central, I heard Democratic operatives on every radio channel.
[00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:45.738]  Saying this shows Obama can protect you.
[00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:48.180]  But it also did something else.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.824]  It didn't just let him grandstand as the savior who can get things done and our big daddy.
[00:14:54.056 --> 00:14:57.877]  It took over the news cycle Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to a great extent.
[00:14:57.877 --> 00:15:02.219]  As the news cycle, Wednesday, Thursday, into Friday morning, was reporting one thing.
[00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:04.479]  Total Republican wave.
[00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:08.340]  Total anti-establishment wave through the Republican Party.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:15.723]  With the system pulling out all the stops going after the real patriot candidates that the Rhino Republicans believe they can't control.
[00:15:15.723 --> 00:15:17.503]  Remember the memos two weeks ago that got leaked?
[00:15:17.503 --> 00:15:21.624]  With the internal Republican Party very scared of the Tea Parties.
[00:15:21.624 --> 00:15:23.005]  They haven't been able to fully take them over.
[00:15:24.727 --> 00:15:42.365]  And so it changed the subject Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and now today with new bombings in Europe, more parcels, bombs going off in Greece, bombs being delivered in France, it changes the subject to terrorism instead of the Republican wave.
[00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:45.428]  Because just like there was a Democratic wave in 08 for Obama,
[00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:58.608]  A lot of people who are on the fence, and national polls show even this weekend that upwards of 12% of voters in Gallup, it's 10 and some other polls, are undecided.
[00:15:58.608 --> 00:16:00.009]  That's that key group.
[00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:09.955]  But when the average kind of sheep-like person who doesn't really know where they stand hears, oh, everything's going Republican, they're going to win the House for sure, maybe even the Senate.
[00:16:10.575 --> 00:16:30.645]  Just by taking control of the news cycle with these dud printer cartridge supposed bombs that changes the subject away from political wave total takeover to oh my gosh Obama's keeping us safe and may actually allow them to keep the Senate.
[00:16:30.645 --> 00:16:36.348]  Now joining us for this segment the next via video Skype is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:16:36.348 --> 00:16:37.669]  He has a detailed report
[00:16:38.982 --> 00:16:45.064]  C.I.A., Stooge, Anwar al-Awlaki, prime suspect behind plane bomb plot.
[00:16:45.064 --> 00:16:46.385]  What did I say on Friday?
[00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:49.906]  He's already knew Awlaki's supposedly in Yemen with this new staged event.
[00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:52.788]  I said, you watch, they're going to blame it on Awlaki.
[00:16:52.788 --> 00:16:54.948]  Last night, Awlaki's behind it.
[00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:57.469]  He's behind the Fort Hood shooting, the government says.
[00:16:57.469 --> 00:16:59.750]  He's behind the underwear bombing.
[00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.531]  He's behind the Times Square bombing.
[00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:02.992]  But of course, Fox News
[00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:16.962]  Leaked to Fox News, Anwar al-Awlaki at the Pentagon in a meeting two months after 9-11 when he's on the news as the number three man in Al-Qaeda under Osama bin Laden, aka Tim Osman.
[00:17:16.962 --> 00:17:21.045]  That's a CIA code name.
[00:17:21.045 --> 00:17:25.268]  And then right on time it's Awlaki again, exactly as we predicted.
[00:17:25.268 --> 00:17:26.909]  And again, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:29.471]  This is incredibly transparent.
[00:17:29.471 --> 00:17:30.252]  All of this is.
[00:17:33.609 --> 00:17:35.090]  Now let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson.
[00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.992]  We're about to go to break, Paul, but get into your report.
[00:17:37.992 --> 00:17:44.015]  CIA Stew Jalocki, prime suspect behind Plain Bomb Plot.
[00:17:44.015 --> 00:17:44.855]  Well, hello, Alex.
[00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.316]  Good to be back.
[00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:53.440]  Yeah, what most people can't grasp at the moment is how this is helping the Obama administration.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.462]  And on that very subject... Hold on one second.
[00:17:56.462 --> 00:17:57.183]  Hold on one second.
[00:17:57.183 --> 00:17:59.484]  We're not sending your audio to the network.
[00:17:59.484 --> 00:18:00.565]  Okay, start over, Paul.
[00:18:00.565 --> 00:18:01.005]  I'm sorry.
[00:18:02.668 --> 00:18:10.331]  Okay, what a lot of people fail to grasp about these events is how it's benefiting the Obama administration.
[00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:18.234]  And literally about 20 minutes ago, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled, Package Bombs Help U.S.
[00:18:18.234 --> 00:18:20.414]  Defense in Cleric Case.
[00:18:20.414 --> 00:18:22.195]  Package Bombs Help U.S.
[00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:23.416]  Defense in Cleric Case.
[00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:43.776]  And it basically says that this latest bombing attempt aids Barack Obama's geopolitical strategy to intensify the drone attacks in Yemen, which of course is justified by the fact that the so-called leader of Al-Qaeda now, Anwar al-Awlaki, is now based in Yemen.
[00:18:44.537 --> 00:18:49.662]  And he's being fingered again as the mastermind behind this latest plot.
[00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:58.091]  But as my article on PrisonPlanet.com today documents, and as we have documented on innumerable occasions in the past,
[00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:02.575]  Al-Awlaki is CIA stooge.
[00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:19.886]  He was meeting with the top brass of the Pentagon months after September 11th, after acting as the spiritual leader for the very hijackers on 9-11 who allegedly slammed Flight 77 into the Pentagon.
[00:19:19.886 --> 00:19:26.110]  So the guy who was their spiritual guru was meeting with Pentagon top brass just months later.
[00:19:27.321 --> 00:19:42.210]  And of course, a lackey was the mastermind behind several other dud bombing attempts, the Christmas Day bomber, who of course was allowed on the plane by the State Department, the Times Square attempt, and of course the Fort Hood shooting.
[00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.631]  Stay there, we gotta break, Paul.
[00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:54.177]  Stay there, when we come back, I'm gonna give you this, the floor in this next segment, a little bit into the next after that, because this is so important, and again,
[00:19:55.728 --> 00:20:00.357]  We predicted this, and now we're explaining why it helps the globalists.
[00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:02.461]  I mean, they're telling you it's helping them.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.022]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:05.063 --> 00:20:09.244]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:09.244 --> 00:20:11.104]  That something is Atwood Rope.

[00:20:35.969 --> 00:20:40.532]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:46.336]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:46.336 --> 00:20:49.978]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:13.596]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:23:13.596 --> 00:23:14.956]  Will they do it?
[00:23:14.956 --> 00:23:17.576]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:23:17.576 --> 00:23:24.038]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:23:24.038 --> 00:23:26.238]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.279]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:23:30.499 --> 00:23:35.380]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:40.281]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:23:40.281 --> 00:23:46.043]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:23:46.043 --> 00:23:54.465]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:07.957]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:24:07.957 --> 00:24:14.946]  I want listeners to really think about how brazen and naked this is.
[00:24:14.946 --> 00:24:17.149]  Four days before the election on Friday,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.821]  There are these package bombs mailed out.
[00:24:21.821 --> 00:24:26.142]  First, the FBI and Scotland Yard in England and the U.S.
[00:24:26.142 --> 00:24:29.862]  come out and say, we tested it, it's not explosive material.
[00:24:29.862 --> 00:24:35.324]  Then Obama says, tentatively, we believe it's not a bomb but is explosive material.
[00:24:35.324 --> 00:24:36.964]  Then they arrest this woman.
[00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:40.165]  Then they have to release her and say it was the wrong identity.
[00:24:40.165 --> 00:24:44.826]  The Yemeni's government comes out and says no packages were mailed from here in the two days before.
[00:24:45.726 --> 00:24:55.513]  Now, we have a bomb that communists out of Greece supposedly tried to mail right at the same time, magically, to Nicolas Sarkozy.
[00:24:55.513 --> 00:25:06.460]  We know the NATO stay-behind networks have admitted it's been declassified with Operation Gladio staged hundreds of bombings in Europe in the last 30 years and blamed it on their political enemies.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.762]  We have the Italian president, former head of intelligence, going public on that.
[00:25:10.783 --> 00:25:11.824]  And it goes on and on.
[00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:17.947]  Then you watch the Sunday news shows or listen to talk radio and it's, this makes Obama look really strong.
[00:25:17.947 --> 00:25:20.969]  He protected us again from an attack.
[00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:22.290]  The Christmas Day was a dud.
[00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.690]  The Times Square was a dud.
[00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:29.313]  And then it's always Anwar al-Awlaki who's hanging out at the Pentagon who's behind it.
[00:25:29.313 --> 00:25:31.555]  And they're saying he's behind the newest thing.
[00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:33.756]  So that's why they're doing it.
[00:25:33.756 --> 00:25:35.057]  And it changes the subject.
[00:25:35.777 --> 00:25:49.629]  During the election, from the election, as the wave of anti-incumbency builds, as the wave of anti-incumbency builds, now this distracts on the eve of the election and may let the Democrats keep the Senate.
[00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:52.512]  It also distracts from all the election fraud news coming out.
[00:25:52.512 --> 00:25:54.093]  Paul Watson from England.
[00:25:54.093 --> 00:25:54.814]  Please continue.
[00:25:56.889 --> 00:26:04.933]  Well exactly, and it also acts as a kind of crushing momentum against the resistance to airport security measures.
[00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:11.897]  Remember, just days previous to this event, we had the announcement that airport security measures were going to get even tougher.
[00:26:12.777 --> 00:26:26.635]  And that came out at the same time that British Airways chairman Martin Broughton slammed US authorities for redundant and ridiculous airport security measures that had no effect whatsoever.
[00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:29.919]  And we also had just the week before dozens
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:42.848]  Actually, up to 200 nations globally resisting Homeland Security's proposal to have body scanners as a mandatory device in airports around the world.
[00:26:42.848 --> 00:26:54.716]  So, three separate issues related to airport security on which the authorities, the US authorities, were on the ropes, and then we have this strange series of events.
[00:26:55.976 --> 00:26:56.517]  That's right.
[00:26:56.517 --> 00:26:59.318]  I mean, just to interrupt you, Italy's pulling the scanners out.
[00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:02.419]  It's all over mainstream news that they do cause cancer.
[00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:10.703]  And they announced, hey, we're now going to pat down, touching your genitals and breast, everyone on top of naked body scanners.
[00:27:10.703 --> 00:27:12.083]  You don't like the scanners?
[00:27:12.083 --> 00:27:13.784]  We're going to go even further.
[00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:27.909]  Right, and of course Dubai International Airport had ripped the scanners out saying they were a violation of dignity and privacy and lo and behold one of these devices is discovered at Dubai.
[00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:41.201]  Needless to say that the Dubai, the United Arab Emirates authorities denied that any explosive device had been discovered there just as the Yemeni authorities said that no UPS plane had left Yemen
[00:27:41.781 --> 00:27:45.942]  In the 48 hours previous to this series of events.
[00:27:45.942 --> 00:27:53.364]  So, there's some massive manipulation going on with this timeline, which is why I wanted to just go through it again.
[00:27:53.364 --> 00:28:04.647]  President Obama, the White House announced through its own press release on Friday, was informed of this so-called unfolding bomb plot on Thursday night in the United States.
[00:28:05.467 --> 00:28:19.032]  Now, the first package was discovered at 3.30am at East Midlands Airport in England, which is about an hour from where I live, at 3.30am on Friday morning.
[00:28:19.032 --> 00:28:22.474]  So, Washington time, that's half ten at night.
[00:28:23.274 --> 00:28:32.300]  So, Obama, basically at the same time as this package has been discovered at East Midlands, is informed of this unfolding bomb threat.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:45.167]  David Cameron, now it turns out, we've just learned, was not informed of this threat whatsoever, even though it had started in the UK, until the next afternoon, which is when we found out about it.
[00:28:45.167 --> 00:28:48.009]  So, Cameron's being kept out of the loop.
[00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:49.150]  Now, what happened was,
[00:28:50.356 --> 00:29:01.257]  The airport officials at East Midlands, when they found that package at 3.30am, inspected it for explosive material and the test came up negative.
[00:29:02.577 --> 00:29:15.924]  And then Obama goes on TV, what was it, three hours later, and says that the evidence indicates this was an explosive package designed to blow the aircraft out of the air.
[00:29:15.924 --> 00:29:19.886]  So after that, the US authorities, and this is all in an article
[00:29:20.586 --> 00:29:26.588]  From the Nottingham Post, investigations continue into East Midlands Airport terror plot.
[00:29:26.588 --> 00:29:36.172]  After Obama says that it was an explosive package, US authorities then direct the East Midlands Airport staff to check the bomb again and lo and behold...
[00:29:36.812 --> 00:29:39.214]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:39.995]  Alex Jones and the
[00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:16.648]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[00:31:00.003 --> 00:31:04.564]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.564 --> 00:31:05.464]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:08.905]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.905 --> 00:31:09.765]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.765 --> 00:31:14.647]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.647 --> 00:31:15.387]  It's true.
[00:31:15.387 --> 00:31:20.268]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.268 --> 00:31:21.088]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.088 --> 00:31:24.669]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:28.370]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.370]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.131]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:35.812]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.812 --> 00:31:36.612]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.612 --> 00:31:40.753]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.753 --> 00:31:45.815]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:10.457]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:27.486]  We're going back to Paul Joseph Watson's reports at PrisonPlanet.com, all these key articles he's been writing, breaking this down.
[00:33:27.486 --> 00:33:33.990]  Local British news is pointing out that the airport tested the supposed explosive device and it was not explosive.
[00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.251]  But Obama said, check it again, it is.
[00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:39.274]  And they said, you're right, Mr. President, it is.
[00:33:40.254 --> 00:33:45.637]  Meanwhile, another bomb reportedly got mailed to Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France.
[00:33:45.637 --> 00:33:48.179]  Another bomb went off in Greece.
[00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:54.323]  All of this conveniently ahead of the election tomorrow in the United States.
[00:33:54.323 --> 00:34:08.492]  We're going to go back to Paul Watson here in a moment, then I'm getting into the election, the dirty tricks, the economy, the police state debt collectors, the latest on these tens of thousands of pages of WikiLeaks documents that were released a week ago or so.
[00:34:09.412 --> 00:34:37.366]  That is all coming up today, but I first just wanted to point out to people that we have a powerful online video slash bookstore slash patriot apparel store with ballpoint pens that have InfoWars.com, flashlights, pocket knives, bumper stickers, citizen rule books, films, books, t-shirts, ball caps, license plate covers, all of it about getting the word out.
[00:34:38.366 --> 00:34:44.031]  And your purchases also make this syndicated radio broadcast possible.
[00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:59.322]  We're carrying other great films like The Secret of Oz, Solutions for a Broken Economy, Fall of the Republic, The Presidency of Barack H. Obama, How the Banks Were Planning to Implode Our Economy and Their Master Plan with the Carbon Taxes, The Mortgage Fraud, all of it covered.
[00:34:59.322 --> 00:35:01.204]  My classic film, Terror Storm.
[00:35:01.804 --> 00:35:09.511]  A history of government-sponsored terrorism going over all the declassified admissions of our own government and other governments staging terror attacks.
[00:35:09.511 --> 00:35:14.515]  It's all available at Infowars.com.
[00:35:14.515 --> 00:35:21.381]  You can also order the new film on DVD, What in the World Are They Spraying?, produced by G. Edward Griffin.
[00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:22.370]  I don't
[00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:45.356]  I'm also, of course, interviewed in it, getting into the police and others being trained to forcibly inoculate you and your family.
[00:35:45.356 --> 00:35:50.100]  This is all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.280]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.901]  You can see all of my films.
[00:36:00.327 --> 00:36:02.969]  Read my book, Paul Watson's book, both out of print.
[00:36:02.969 --> 00:36:07.773]  See the archives of the Daily Radio Slash TV Show, a higher quality podcast.
[00:36:07.773 --> 00:36:18.222]  Every week now, we're putting three or four new, exclusive, never-before-seen interviews up with Lord Monckton and people like Webster Tarpley and Alan Watt.
[00:36:18.222 --> 00:36:20.283]  And coming up, Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson.
[00:36:21.064 --> 00:36:26.105]  Never before seen interviews on video that I conducted.
[00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:29.046]  Dr. Russell Blaylock, that's going up later in the week.
[00:36:29.046 --> 00:36:36.949]  We are just adding more and more content to this armory of information warfare truth that is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:42.710]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, or get a yearly membership and get, what is it, two or three months free.
[00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.231]  All at PrisonPlanet.tv, and I appreciate everyone that are members.
[00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:47.692]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:36:48.912 --> 00:36:50.692]  Why is this so important?
[00:36:50.692 --> 00:37:05.955]  Well, I mean, we've read you the quotes of these Obama advisors over and over again, saying we've got to have some type of event so Obama can pose as a political savior.
[00:37:05.955 --> 00:37:08.735]  I'm going to read some of those quotes again coming up.
[00:37:08.735 --> 00:37:14.256]  And then right ahead of the election, boom, the explosive packages start getting mailed out.
[00:37:14.256 --> 00:37:17.997]  It's Anwar al-Awlaki, the admitted CIA operative, as usual, that they say is behind it.
[00:37:18.917 --> 00:37:22.902]  Uh, in every one of these cases, Fort Hood had warnings and was told to stand down.
[00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:24.503]  They confiscated the cell phone footage.
[00:37:24.503 --> 00:37:27.627]  Uh, he was in contact with Anwar al-Awlaki.
[00:37:27.627 --> 00:37:29.589]  Al-Awlaki's hanging out at the Pentagon.
[00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:31.451]  He's behind the Christmas Day bomber.
[00:37:31.451 --> 00:37:35.336]  Where they didn't just allow him to get on the plane, they helped get Muttalib on the plane.
[00:37:35.996 --> 00:37:36.016]  I
[00:37:51.696 --> 00:38:03.204]  Conditioning everyone to accept total police state and to distract people from the depression and the huge political wave of awakening that's happening right now.
[00:38:03.204 --> 00:38:06.206]  So, Paul Joseph Watson, continue.
[00:38:06.206 --> 00:38:18.534]  When we went to break, you were getting into the fact that even the British government is saying, well, we tested the package, it wasn't explosive, but Obama says it is and waves his magic fairy wand and boom, it's a bomb.
[00:38:18.534 --> 00:38:20.316]  And now, as I predicted yesterday,
[00:38:21.564 --> 00:38:23.665]  We have this situation.
[00:38:23.665 --> 00:38:28.488]  Greece intercepts partial bomb addressed to Sarkozy.
[00:38:28.488 --> 00:38:30.689]  Again, this package bomb, parcel bomb.
[00:38:30.689 --> 00:38:40.314]  Greek police intercept a booby-trapped parcel addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy Monday after another package exploded at a courier company in Athens, slightly wounding an employee.
[00:38:40.314 --> 00:38:45.057]  So the globalists are activating their Operation Gladio NATO option networks.
[00:38:45.737 --> 00:38:50.798]  Police suspect the parcels were linked to Greek leftist guerrilla groups, who have been admittedly part of Gladio.
[00:38:50.798 --> 00:38:58.821]  Greece has been rocked by a wave of gas canister and bomb attacks, usually claimed by leftist groups, since the police killing of a teenager in Athens.
[00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.101]  But notice this is all happening at the same time.
[00:39:01.101 --> 00:39:06.483]  The parcel that exploded in the hands of the female employee was addressed to Mexican Embassy in Athens, police said.
[00:39:06.483 --> 00:39:15.025]  Shortly after the explosion, police arrested two suspects and detonated two more makeshift parcel bombs that carried a third one found at another delivery company.
[00:39:15.425 --> 00:39:17.347]  Are these just copycat bombers?
[00:39:17.347 --> 00:39:18.868]  There are some real bombers out there.
[00:39:18.868 --> 00:39:20.750]  They're very rare, but they do exist.
[00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:32.780]  Or is this part of the overall hysteria as the corporate system tries to distract from the rioting against tyranny in Europe, the political awakening in the West, all the things that are happening?
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.681]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:39:35.902 --> 00:39:44.389]  Well, if it is copycats, then that only helps the authorities, because it's the strategy of tension, like with Gladio.
[00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:50.493]  But the thing that renders this story suspect, in the very least, is not only the fact that the UK
[00:39:51.846 --> 00:39:57.949]  Suspicious package was initially called a dud until Obama said otherwise.
[00:39:57.949 --> 00:40:06.192]  But even the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Newark, New Jersey packages, which were found the next day.
[00:40:06.192 --> 00:40:19.798]  Remember, Obama was informed about this on Thursday night, apparently after receiving a tip-off from this Saudi individual who was an Al-Qaeda member only two weeks before.
[00:40:20.538 --> 00:40:25.063]  Again linked to Anwar al-Awlaki, the CIA lackey.
[00:40:25.063 --> 00:40:35.075]  But then, the next day, these packages at Pittsburgh and Newark, CNN reported that authorities at those airports had given, quote, the all clear.
[00:40:36.693 --> 00:40:47.618]  And so, in three different cases, the authorities have said there's no explosives, Obama says otherwise, and suddenly everybody changes their stories!
[00:40:47.618 --> 00:40:49.678]  I mean, it's amazing!
[00:40:49.678 --> 00:40:57.262]  And of course, this morning we found out that the prime suspect is somebody who dined with top Pentagon brass.
[00:40:57.262 --> 00:41:05.125]  He's the guy who was in contact with this individual who supposedly made the ink toner cartridge bomb.
[00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:14.029]  Uh, who was the same guy who apparently made the underwear bomber device, which of course was complete false flag as we documented, U.S.
[00:41:14.029 --> 00:41:22.633]  State Department, um, helped Abdul Mullah Tab get on the plane, well-dressed Indian man helped him get on the plane.
[00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:30.037]  So you have all these connections running through and then you have the fact that the story was changed right from the very start to hype this
[00:41:30.817 --> 00:41:43.584]  non-event essentially into this massive terror plot which they're now saying involved at least 26 packages which could have caused massive explosions and blown these airliners out the sky.
[00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:55.210]  So, I mean, as I wrote in my article, you know, within days everything screams false flag, everything's suspicious and everything runs through Alawaki.
[00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.833]  And then you had instantly they grabbed this Yemeni female student
[00:42:01.047 --> 00:42:06.311]  Again to, I mean Obama said, we don't have any details but we know it came from Yemen.
[00:42:06.311 --> 00:42:10.075]  Well yeah, that's because they want to intensify the drone attacks.
[00:42:10.075 --> 00:42:16.180]  The very next day the New York Times aggressively pushed further incursions into Yemen.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:22.705]  And only yesterday, I believe, they had to release this female Yemeni student because there was no evidence against her.
[00:42:22.705 --> 00:42:22.865]  I don't
[00:42:39.802 --> 00:42:54.674]  Obama gets to distract everyone from the huge political wave that's happening and change the subject as the Democrats completely implode along with establishment Republicans as the braying Obamanoids that are still out there.
[00:42:54.674 --> 00:42:56.395]  He's lost about half his Democrat support.
[00:42:57.503 --> 00:43:02.344]  Over and over again, like sheep, say, Obama!
[00:43:02.344 --> 00:43:04.445]  Obama!
[00:43:04.445 --> 00:43:06.466]  Obama!
[00:43:06.466 --> 00:43:10.407]  And the Democratic Party activists all over TV and radio say, see?
[00:43:10.407 --> 00:43:15.768]  This shows you that Obama is going to protect us.
[00:43:15.768 --> 00:43:21.650]  Thank God we have this police state, because Barack Hussein Obama, he's keeping us safe, Paul.
[00:43:23.837 --> 00:43:24.478]  Well, exactly.
[00:43:24.478 --> 00:43:36.146]  I mean, it crosses party lines, because as we know, former Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge admitted that the Bush administration would routinely pressure him to raise the terror alert.
[00:43:36.146 --> 00:43:40.870]  We documented dozens of examples where they were faking alerts for their political gain.
[00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:46.034]  And now Obama, you know, the change candidate, is taking a leaf out of Bush's book.
[00:43:47.035 --> 00:43:54.144]  And with the House all but certain to go back to the Republicans, the Senate is kind of hanging in the balance.
[00:43:54.144 --> 00:44:01.393]  And this is the very kind of event that could sway those undecided voters in the Democrats' favour.
[00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:06.393]  I mean, remember the Kerry-Bush election?
[00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:21.542]  On the same day, I believe, the 29th of October 2004, we had the infamous Bin Laden tape where, you know, he came out against Bush and of course it helped Bush at a time when they were even-steven in the polls and Bush won the election.
[00:44:21.542 --> 00:44:26.746]  So it seems almost every October before an election we have Al-Qaeda
[00:44:27.466 --> 00:44:33.971]  Step in to have their influence and it always helps the establishment, the people in positions of authority.
[00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:36.293]  And here's why the system's worried.
[00:44:36.293 --> 00:44:45.541]  In 94, they had Newt Gingrich, the pro-global warming taxer, the pro-global government supporter, the pro-open border CFR minion.
[00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.628]  Lead the Republicans into a rat hole.
[00:44:49.628 --> 00:44:53.371]  This time, many of these Republicans are good people.
[00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:55.752]  They're anti-NAFTA, anti-GATT.
[00:44:55.752 --> 00:44:58.494]  They are anti-open borders.
[00:44:58.494 --> 00:45:00.216]  They are anti-carbon tax.
[00:45:00.216 --> 00:45:02.117]  They are anti-fellow reserve.
[00:45:02.117 --> 00:45:03.858]  And that's got the system really scared.
[00:45:03.858 --> 00:45:09.242]  And many Democrats that won Democratic primaries, they were basically singing the same tune.
[00:45:09.242 --> 00:45:12.145]  So, regardless of what happens with this election,
[00:45:12.805 --> 00:45:17.207]  Or whether they're able to corral and co-opt these new Republicans and Democrats.
[00:45:17.207 --> 00:45:23.509]  The issues are now becoming more and more central to reality.
[00:45:23.509 --> 00:45:28.971]  And we're now discussing things that really matter like the banking cartel and all of this corruption.
[00:45:28.971 --> 00:45:40.495]  But the average person who listens to this show and who is informed about geopolitics, staged terror, provocateur terror, they're looking at this and saying Anwar al-Awlaki runs all the attacks of the last two years.
[00:45:41.175 --> 00:45:41.536]  I don't know.
[00:45:58.058 --> 00:46:00.160]  Give two to one odds for a football team.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.523]  Most people bet for the football team that's a shoe in to win.
[00:46:03.523 --> 00:46:12.612]  And so they know that there was a complete implosion in Democratic confidence and that Republicans were set to take the Senate with another two seats.
[00:46:12.612 --> 00:46:17.337]  And this has put some momentum back into the Democrats to at least hold on to the Senate.
[00:46:17.337 --> 00:46:21.581]  But this whole thing is tailored for Americans who are kind of halfway paying attention.
[00:46:24.209 --> 00:46:32.132]  Because if you're not really paying attention, you just hear about toner bombs and Muslim terrorists and some guy named Lockheed.
[00:46:32.132 --> 00:46:38.314]  And you don't even know that he's at the Pentagon meeting with the brass and running all these attacks, even though it's admitted.
[00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:47.697]  So they're targeting people who are halfway paying attention or aren't really paying attention and just see the newspaper headlines or who are in a restaurant and see Fox News on the screen.
[00:46:48.857 --> 00:46:51.540]  But more and more people aren't halfway listening.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.446]  They're really focused, and they're remembering all of this, and they're seeing this pattern.
[00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.307]  But yet again...
[00:46:58.339 --> 00:47:08.345]  We called it that there would be staged events right before the election, and I called it again last night, not because I'm smart, but because I study this, and I know their M.O.
[00:47:08.345 --> 00:47:17.730]  They follow these shake-and-bake, you know, pre-packaged, it's like buying a box of, you know, pre-made pancake mix.
[00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:22.713]  All you do is add milk, stir it up, and put it in the pan, and we know the ingredients, we know the
[00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:31.839]  Philosophy, the MO, the systems, the signatures that these people follow.
[00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:33.701]  We know the signs.
[00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:36.983]  And so I was able to say, look for more bombings.
[00:47:36.983 --> 00:47:41.247]  And I pointed out back in July when we made all these predictions, it could be bombings in Europe.
[00:47:41.767 --> 00:48:06.486]  It could be bombings here, but that they want duds so there's not a real investigation and so they can say, see, we stopped it, we protected you, and it changes the political discussion away from the economy and the open borders and the wars and the police state to, oh, look at what a great job Barack Hussein Obama did for us.
[00:48:06.486 --> 00:48:10.468]  Paul Watson, I want to read a quote here.
[00:48:11.269 --> 00:48:16.874]  And then I'm going to get your take on this and let you go, and I'm going to come back and get into the election and all the things that are happening on that front.
[00:48:16.874 --> 00:48:17.955]  But here it is.
[00:48:17.955 --> 00:48:19.136]  Top Clinton official.
[00:48:19.136 --> 00:48:22.018]  Only a terror attack can save Obama.
[00:48:22.018 --> 00:48:22.539]  July 14th.
[00:48:22.539 --> 00:48:24.961]  So it wasn't late July we covered this.
[00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:26.162]  It was mid-July.
[00:48:26.162 --> 00:48:29.785]  And people can go up to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, where it's archived.
[00:48:29.785 --> 00:48:32.227]  They can go to that July 14th show when you were on.
[00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:42.414]  And the day after when you were on, I'm going from memory, but you can pull it up, where we laid out everything that was going to happen with total precision.
[00:48:42.414 --> 00:48:46.837]  And I said right ahead of the election, even days before the election.
[00:48:46.837 --> 00:48:49.679]  And here's the quote from the Financial Times of London.
[00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:52.981]  And in your article, you quote all these Republicans saying similar things.
[00:48:54.278 --> 00:49:07.350]  Over and over again, there's now another big news article out today where a Republican is telling Obama, attack Iran, this will help the economy.
[00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.693]  I mean, these guys are very brazen about what they do.
[00:49:10.693 --> 00:49:15.317]  Because they're not just communicating to the public in these newspapers, sometimes they're communicating with each other.
[00:49:15.857 --> 00:49:27.561]  Like four years ago, or three and a half years ago, when Gary Hart, CFR, Hart-Rubin Commission head, who wrote the Homeland Security Plan, sent a letter to Ahmadinejad and said, look, we'll stage terror attacks.
[00:49:27.561 --> 00:49:28.922]  You better do what we say.
[00:49:28.922 --> 00:49:32.763]  Don't just think because the public's against attacking Iran it won't happen.
[00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:35.985]  Remember, we staged the Gulf of Tonkin and other events.
[00:49:35.985 --> 00:49:36.725]  But here's the quote.
[00:49:37.145 --> 00:49:52.648]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, said Shapiro, adding, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and, short of a new 9-11 or Oklahoma City bombing, I can't think of how he can do that.
[00:49:52.648 --> 00:49:54.488]  Here they are telling us why they do it.
[00:49:54.488 --> 00:49:57.589]  But look, Paul, he saved us from the printer bombs.
[00:49:57.589 --> 00:50:00.069]  He did what Robert Shapiro said he should do.
[00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:01.449]  He kept us safe.
[00:50:01.449 --> 00:50:05.590]  And we're all lucky, like a jack-in-the-box came right out of the box right days before the election.
[00:50:08.032 --> 00:50:18.739]  Absolutely, and I mean, remember again, literally, it wasn't even four separate occasions that we said that Obama would seek to exploit a terror attack.
[00:50:18.739 --> 00:50:21.241]  I mean, remember his rhetoric last month.
[00:50:21.241 --> 00:50:22.521]  In fact, it was in September.
[00:50:22.521 --> 00:50:25.663]  Yeah, we wrote articles about that where he said, we may have to absorb an attack.
[00:50:25.663 --> 00:50:27.124]  Absorb a terror attack.
[00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:28.005]  Exactly, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:29.312 --> 00:50:32.754]  Yeah, so literally about five or six different articles.
[00:50:32.754 --> 00:50:34.875]  I wrote about three or four.
[00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:36.536]  Darren wrote one.
[00:50:36.536 --> 00:50:39.858]  Kurt Nimmo probably wrote some more.
[00:50:39.858 --> 00:50:41.339]  And just look how they've benefited.
[00:50:41.339 --> 00:50:43.380]  I mean, Yemen covert role pushed.
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.421]  Foiled bomb plot.
[00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:48.243]  Heightens talk of putting elite US squads in CIA hands.
[00:50:48.243 --> 00:50:52.886]  So the CIA patsy, a locky, has helped the CIA once again.
[00:50:52.886 --> 00:50:53.526]  Yeah, let's do a few.
[00:50:53.826 --> 00:50:58.725]  Let's do a few more and look at the wide spectrum of how this moves their agenda forward on every front.
[00:50:58.725 --> 00:50:59.247]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.075 --> 00:51:05.739]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:05.405]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.405 --> 00:52:06.405]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.405 --> 00:52:08.847]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:08.847 --> 00:52:09.848]  A republic.
[00:52:09.848 --> 00:52:12.510]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:14.772]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:14.772 --> 00:52:16.793]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:16.793 --> 00:52:18.474]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.474 --> 00:52:19.795]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:19.795 --> 00:52:20.416]  Children?
[00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:21.537]  Our education?
[00:52:21.537 --> 00:52:22.377]  Our money?
[00:52:22.377 --> 00:52:26.020]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:31.326]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.326 --> 00:52:32.367]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.367 --> 00:52:33.528]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:34.430]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:35.311]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:37.854]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:41.618]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.718 --> 00:52:46.682]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[00:53:04.038 --> 00:53:07.841]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:53:08.246 --> 00:53:12.990]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:15.071]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:53:15.071 --> 00:53:16.773]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:53:16.773 --> 00:53:21.216]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:53:21.216 --> 00:53:22.297]  Nothing did anything.

[00:53:49.194 --> 00:53:50.715]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:54:06.471 --> 00:54:08.635]  Okay.
[00:54:08.635 --> 00:54:20.774]  In this final segment on this subject, and I'm getting into the economy and the election fraud, and your phone calls, we got Wayne Madsen, Webster Tarpley popping in later towards the end, dealing with the stage terror, we're gonna look at the economy.
[00:54:24.002 --> 00:54:32.147]  9-11 has been used to launch all these wars, to give trillions of dollars to the military-industrial complex, to turn our country into a total police state.
[00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:40.232]  They admit that over 90% of the homeland security apparatus is pointed at gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans.
[00:54:40.232 --> 00:54:41.953]  This is treason.
[00:54:41.953 --> 00:54:49.258]  And so if we don't expose 9-11, if we don't expose Anwar al-Awlaki at the Pentagon two months after he's the number three guy in Al-Qaeda on the news,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.102]  They will continue to stage events to move their agenda forward.
[00:54:55.102 --> 00:55:04.805]  But by exposing this system, we take their tool of false flag terror and this manufactured shadowy boogeyman of terror, and we break it.
[00:55:04.805 --> 00:55:08.786]  And we've damaged it, and that's why the system attacks 9-11 Truth so much.
[00:55:08.786 --> 00:55:15.809]  That's why they hate it when we talk about the Gulf of Tonkin being staged, or Operation Northwoods, or Operation Ajax, or Operation Gladio.
[00:55:16.872 --> 00:55:18.273]  They can't stand it.
[00:55:18.273 --> 00:55:20.955]  And a lot of people in the military and government are good.
[00:55:20.955 --> 00:55:22.015]  They know what's going on.
[00:55:22.015 --> 00:55:25.818]  They're leaking this information.
[00:55:25.818 --> 00:55:28.279]  But this is how they're trying to move their agenda forward.
[00:55:28.279 --> 00:55:34.043]  Worldwide, terrorism is being used for an iron curtain of tyranny to descend upon the planet.
[00:55:35.046 --> 00:55:52.889]  And they want to change the subject away from the political awakening and the total sweep that's happening with the elections to how Obama is saving us, and how the terror is real, and how the naked body scanners are good, and how the enhanced pat-downs where they grab you, grab your private parts now, how that is all a wonderful thing.
[00:55:53.670 --> 00:56:06.560]  And they think you're so stupid, and I'm so stupid, and Paul's so stupid, that we don't see all these Democrats and Republicans talking about how we need to use this disaster for what George Bush's father called for, a new world order.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.662]  That's a Gary Hart quote.
[00:56:08.662 --> 00:56:14.387]  Gary Hart thinks you're so stupid that a year after he wrote that letter and published it in the Huffington Post to Ahmadinejad,
[00:56:15.882 --> 00:56:20.165]  That when we are changed, confronted him at an event and read the quote, he said, I didn't say that.
[00:56:20.165 --> 00:56:20.685]  It's not true.
[00:56:20.685 --> 00:56:21.566]  And they said, here's your quote.
[00:56:21.566 --> 00:56:23.667]  And he said, Oh yeah, now I remember.
[00:56:23.667 --> 00:56:26.969]  Yeah, I did say that.
[00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:28.530]  So they think you're so stupid.
[00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:35.375]  They're out in the open doing this, Paul, I'm worried about more events, but here's the key by us exposing this and getting out ahead of this.
[00:56:36.331 --> 00:56:38.973]  And the British government testing it and saying it wasn't a bomb.
[00:56:38.973 --> 00:56:41.454]  Obama had to come out and say, yes, it is a bomb.
[00:56:41.454 --> 00:56:42.995]  And they were like, okay, so it's a bomb.
[00:56:42.995 --> 00:56:43.695]  It is.
[00:56:43.695 --> 00:56:47.598]  He's diagnosing it from 7,000 miles away, you know, on the East Coast.
[00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:59.233]  It shows that we are frustrating them and stopping them, and they don't want to stage big, hot events that kill a bunch of people, because then there at least has to be some type of investigation.
[00:56:59.233 --> 00:57:00.994]  They're just doing these dud events.
[00:57:00.994 --> 00:57:06.676]  So by getting the word out, just like on September 11th I said they're going to launch a biological attack within a month, it was already going on.
[00:57:06.676 --> 00:57:07.936]  I know how they work.
[00:57:07.936 --> 00:57:09.777]  Paul Watson, two minutes left, final comments.
[00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:27.436]  Well, another interesting thing is that Obama was able to be informed of this plot before Cameron was told about it, before any explosives had even been discovered, because this Jabir al-Faifi
[00:57:27.876 --> 00:57:32.217]  had informed the Saudis who had then passed the information on to the US.
[00:57:32.217 --> 00:57:36.199]  Now, Al-Faifi was in Guantanamo Bay until 2007.
[00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:46.062]  He went back to Saudi Arabia after that and then Saudi Arabia, which of course is completely controlled by the CIA through the ISI,
[00:57:47.202 --> 00:57:55.885]  Al-Faifi was dispatched to Yemen to infiltrate this Al-Qaeda group in Yemen and provocateur and learner of the plot.
[00:57:55.885 --> 00:58:02.667]  So then he comes back to Saudi Arabia, tells the Saudis, who then inform the US authorities and Obama.
[00:58:02.667 --> 00:58:12.470]  So the guy who's involved in this Al-Qaeda group, supposedly behind this attack, is a Saudi double agent working for the Saudi intelligence services.
[00:58:14.943 --> 00:58:30.456]  Paul, it's always the same, and that's what Tarpley and others have documented, that they took in all these innocent people at these camps all over the world, not just X-Ray in Cuba, to find weak-minded people that would act as Patsy handlers.
[00:58:30.456 --> 00:58:30.996]  Great job.
[00:58:30.996 --> 00:58:35.120]  We'll continue to read your reports at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:42.025]  Paul Watson, thank you for joining us to expose the fake terror, false flag, October surprise.

[00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.131]  Got it.
[00:59:48.131 --> 00:59:48.991]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.433 --> 00:59:55.820]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.589]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.287 --> 01:00:10.129]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.129 --> 01:00:11.690]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:12.611]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.611 --> 01:00:17.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.453 --> 01:00:25.897]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.897 --> 01:00:28.238]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:28.238 --> 01:00:32.380]  We've got Wayne Madsen popping in on the October Surprise 2012.
[01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:41.030]  Because you know you're going to see one before the big election coming up in a year and a half, two years from now.
[01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:44.292]  We're going to be discussing the October surprise 2010.
[01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:49.437]  And remember, Obama and Bush and all these people work for the same group.
[01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:55.202]  That's why the policies say the same, the rhetoric is just different.
[01:00:55.202 --> 01:01:00.547]  We're going to be getting into all the different dirty tricks that have been taking place dealing with the election.
[01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:07.264]  We're going to be talking about all the election fraud news that is coming out during this hour.
[01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:11.507]  Tarpley joins us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour when we get back into the terror.
[01:01:11.507 --> 01:01:16.111]  But I want to open the phones up for people specifically on three subjects.
[01:01:16.111 --> 01:01:20.015]  The economy, the election, and all the fraud going on there.
[01:01:21.269 --> 01:01:25.610]  And the stage terror, because I want to specifically keep it focused on those issues.
[01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:29.592]  If you want to talk about any of those wide-ranging topics, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:01:29.592 --> 01:01:29.952]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:30.032]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:30.032 --> 01:01:36.233]  We've also talked about this some in the last few weeks, since new WikiLeaks documents from the Pentagon, 400,000 Army field reports have been released.
[01:01:48.357 --> 01:01:51.198]  Because now folks have had time to call through them.
[01:01:51.198 --> 01:01:53.618]  And it basically just confirms what we previously knew.
[01:01:53.618 --> 01:01:58.920]  That they just would scoop up whole families for not having proper ID all over Iraq.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.600]  Take them to torture facilities.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.581]  Children were raped in front of their parents.
[01:02:02.581 --> 01:02:07.782]  That was in the Army's report three years ago, four years ago.
[01:02:07.782 --> 01:02:09.202]  MSNBC headline.
[01:02:09.202 --> 01:02:11.463]  You can go read the full Army report by General Togumbo.
[01:02:13.226 --> 01:02:14.427]  It's all there.
[01:02:14.427 --> 01:02:17.730]  WikiLeaks row, or fight, over U.S.
[01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.372]  cover-up of torture detainees in Iraq.
[01:02:20.372 --> 01:02:20.673]  The U.S.
[01:02:20.673 --> 01:02:30.422]  government is at the center of a growing row over the cover-up of torture of detainees in Iraq following the leak of almost 400,000 Army field manuals.
[01:02:30.422 --> 01:02:33.845]  But remember, people go to prison for this, but they followed orders to do it.
[01:02:33.845 --> 01:02:37.308]  Why isn't the federal government and the Pentagon that gave the orders getting in trouble?
[01:02:38.919 --> 01:02:44.001]  WikiLeaks releases has exposed the terrifying reality of the Iraq War.
[01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:46.262]  Another report dealing with that.
[01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:51.825]  Robert Fisk, the shaming of America, London Independent.
[01:02:51.825 --> 01:02:54.106]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:58.988]  So that's some of what we're going to talk about briefly with Wayne Madsen as well.
[01:03:00.899 --> 01:03:01.280]  I don't
[01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:32.085]  Wall Street Journal, employees at CBS affiliate Anchorage left an accidental voicemail for an aide to GOP Senate candidate Joe Miller, in which they discussed and laughed about the possibility of reporting on the appearance of sex offenders at a Miller rally.
[01:03:32.085 --> 01:03:40.369]  And they chatted about responding with a Twitter alert to any sort of chaos whatsoever, including the candidate being punched.
[01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:43.838]  And the question is, were they getting ready to stage all this?
[01:03:43.838 --> 01:03:55.785]  We've already caught Democrats all over dressing up like racists, saying racist things in New Mexico, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Washington State, Oregon, California.
[01:03:55.785 --> 01:03:56.546]  This is what they do.
[01:03:58.274 --> 01:04:11.599]  Jerry Beaver, General Manager at KTVA, said in a statement that a call to Miller's spokesman, Randy DeSoto, to discuss the candidate's planned appearance on a newscast wasn't disconnected after the conversation ended.
[01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:19.662]  The call took place during a KTVA staff meeting to plan coverage of that evening's Miller's rally in downtown Anchorage.
[01:04:19.662 --> 01:04:22.243]  Mr. Miller is opposed by fellow Republican
[01:04:23.203 --> 01:04:28.805]  Lisa Murkowski, who is running as a riding candidate after being defeated by Mr. Miller in the August primary.
[01:04:28.805 --> 01:04:30.925]  So they're trying to make sure he loses.
[01:04:30.925 --> 01:04:33.686]  And Democrat Scott Adams, it's a very close race.
[01:04:33.686 --> 01:04:39.668]  We're going to read over some of those quotes coming up and then go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:42.589]  We'll get into the economic news as well.
[01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:47.290]  And don't forget the websites, the backup websites that are also updated.
[01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:50.971]  JonesReport.com, Infowars.net, WhatIsTheEndgame.com.

[01:06:59.718 --> 01:07:04.282]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:07:04.282 --> 01:07:05.182]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.182 --> 01:07:08.605]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.605 --> 01:07:09.466]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.466 --> 01:07:14.369]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.369 --> 01:07:15.110]  It's true.
[01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:19.974]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.974 --> 01:07:20.814]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:24.397]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.397 --> 01:07:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.100]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.841]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:35.522]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.522 --> 01:07:36.322]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.322 --> 01:07:40.463]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.463 --> 01:07:45.525]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:49.686]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.686 --> 01:07:51.487]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:07:56.668 --> 01:07:57.328]  877-327-0365.
[01:07:57.328 --> 01:08:05.953]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.953 --> 01:08:21.160]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.702]  So CBS News is calling up the campaign of
[01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:33.954]  Candidate Joe Miller of Alaska.
[01:08:33.954 --> 01:08:44.921]  And they call up the GOP Senate candidate and then keep the phone going, it didn't disconnect, as they talk about how they're going to set him up.
[01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.422]  Female reporter.
[01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:48.663]  Child molesters.
[01:08:48.663 --> 01:08:49.364]  Male reporter.
[01:08:49.364 --> 01:08:55.388]  Oh yes, Joe Miller's, uh, get a list of people, campaign workers, which one's the molester.
[01:08:56.621 --> 01:09:06.225]  So this is them literally going through hundreds of campaign workers trying to find somebody who was 20 and had a 17-year-old girlfriend.
[01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.007]  I mean, this is the type of stuff they're doing just to throw out.
[01:09:09.007 --> 01:09:11.428]  He's got child molesters in his campaign.
[01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:13.809]  This is dirty tricks.
[01:09:13.809 --> 01:09:15.269]  Female voice.
[01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:20.492]  You know that of all the people that will show up tonight, at least one of them will be a registered sex offender.
[01:09:20.492 --> 01:09:20.912]  Laughter.
[01:09:24.505 --> 01:09:25.286]  Male reporter.
[01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.327]  We need to find that one person.
[01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:29.468]  Female reporter.
[01:09:29.468 --> 01:09:41.776]  The one thing we can do is, we won't know, we won't know, but if there is any sort of chaos whatsoever, we can put out a Twitter-Facebook alert saying that, hey, Joe Miller punched at Rally.
[01:09:41.776 --> 01:09:42.837]  Female reporter.
[01:09:42.837 --> 01:09:44.758]  Kind of like Rand Paul.
[01:09:44.758 --> 01:09:47.340]  I like it.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:47.880]  I like it.
[01:09:49.434 --> 01:09:52.575]  You send a woman running up through a line of security.
[01:09:52.575 --> 01:09:56.697]  She tries to cram in a moving car a sign in Rand Paul's face.
[01:09:56.697 --> 01:09:58.317]  People grab her.
[01:09:58.317 --> 01:09:59.778]  She's smiling as they do it.
[01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:01.398]  She knows she's gotten what she wants.
[01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:03.079]  Somebody puts their foot on her.
[01:10:03.079 --> 01:10:04.679]  Oh, it's the end of the world.
[01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:06.320]  Chris Matthews every night.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.141]  I try to tune in for at least 10 minutes.
[01:10:08.141 --> 01:10:10.581]  All he talks about is brown shirts, Nazis.
[01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:11.762]  They're beating everyone up.
[01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:14.471]  They're racist!
[01:10:14.471 --> 01:10:18.073]  And then meanwhile, Democrats are beating the snot out of people every day!
[01:10:18.073 --> 01:10:22.115]  Without even looking, I probably see 10 new YouTube videos.
[01:10:22.115 --> 01:10:32.982]  I mean, groups of thugs and union people, and I'm not attacking unions, I'm just saying these are union people, beating up conservatives or libertarians.
[01:10:32.982 --> 01:10:38.745]  As if Obama is going to save their jobs or save the economy when he works for the same people that ran George Bush.
[01:10:42.392 --> 01:10:45.436]  So that's just one of the dirty tricks.
[01:10:45.436 --> 01:10:57.609]  And think of how many thousands of dirty tricks are going on for the one where they randomly basically made a pocket call to his campaign and didn't disconnect the phone.
[01:10:57.609 --> 01:10:58.070]  Imagine.
[01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:02.851]  What's really going on on that front?
[01:11:02.851 --> 01:11:07.493]  We'll get more into the election and the huge Republican sweep that's about to happen.
[01:11:07.493 --> 01:11:13.055]  And will conservatives go back to sleep when the Republicans get the House or even the Senate?
[01:11:13.055 --> 01:11:22.178]  I guarantee you if that happens, the system's going to come in and co-opt all these new members of the Congress, and we're going to be right back in the same place we were.
[01:11:22.178 --> 01:11:25.379]  Just like I told Democrats, are you going to hold Obama's feet to the fire on torture?
[01:11:26.735 --> 01:11:28.537]  You gonna hold his feet to the fire on NAFTA and GATT?
[01:11:28.537 --> 01:11:31.199]  You gonna hold his feet to the fire on all these wars?
[01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:32.660]  The answer is no.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:39.166]  For at least a year, you thought that you'd won the ballgame and your guy was in and your mortgage was gonna be paid for.
[01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:40.207]  Thank you, Mr. President!
[01:11:40.207 --> 01:11:42.870]  I don't have to worry about my mortgage or my car anymore!
[01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:47.494]  I want a free house!
[01:11:47.494 --> 01:11:49.395]  Whose house are they gonna take to give you a free house?
[01:11:49.395 --> 01:11:52.999]  There's no such thing as a free lunch.
[01:11:54.192 --> 01:11:55.173]  Thanks Alex.
[01:11:55.173 --> 01:12:04.640]  Hey, everybody's got to start getting the articles they find really near and dear to their heart, ones that, you know, just speaks to them, burn them out.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.200]  I don't think so.
[01:12:40.012 --> 01:12:43.696]  And people are writing websites on money.
[01:12:43.696 --> 01:12:46.339]  People are putting flyers up on telephone poles.
[01:12:46.339 --> 01:12:55.728]  The power of liberty-minded people going out and posting information or sending emails or calling talk radio.
[01:12:55.728 --> 01:12:58.051]  None of us have to save the world by ourselves.
[01:12:58.051 --> 01:13:02.115]  It's all of us doing a little bit every day that will bring this new world order to its knees.
[01:13:02.895 --> 01:13:03.955]  That's why the bathroom works great.
[01:13:03.955 --> 01:13:05.296]  You've got a captive audience.
[01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:08.337]  They're going to sit there and they've got something to read, you know?
[01:13:08.337 --> 01:13:08.857]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.857 --> 01:13:14.160]  It might take one hour, it might just turn somebody the right way, you know?
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.380]  What else is on your mind, Chris?
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:21.503]  What do you think of the staged October surprise with the toner bombs?
[01:13:21.503 --> 01:13:23.944]  It basically had to happen, right?
[01:13:23.944 --> 01:13:27.025]  How many Octobers in a row did this sort of thing happen?
[01:13:27.025 --> 01:13:29.086]  I mean, we should almost start timing that.
[01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:34.076]  Did this sort of attack should happen now, or this is... Well, no, that's what I did.
[01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:34.737]  That's what I did.
[01:13:34.737 --> 01:13:37.559]  And, I mean, it's not hard.
[01:13:37.559 --> 01:13:39.060]  CobraSurprise.com, I guess.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.543]  I guess we're going to start that up today, huh?
[01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:42.724]  Chris, keep it up, buddy.
[01:13:42.724 --> 01:13:43.744]  Good to hear from you.
[01:13:43.744 --> 01:13:44.585]  Fred in New York.
[01:13:44.585 --> 01:13:45.686]  Another caller from New York.
[01:13:45.686 --> 01:13:47.307]  Fred, welcome.
[01:13:47.307 --> 01:13:47.868]  Alex?
[01:13:47.868 --> 01:13:49.829]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:49.829 --> 01:13:52.772]  Let's get to the bottom of stage terror.
[01:13:52.772 --> 01:13:56.675]  I heard this past summer Don Harkins from the Idaho Observer died.
[01:13:56.675 --> 01:13:58.637]  He was probably suicided.
[01:14:00.278 --> 01:14:04.220]  So I went on Idaho Observer, deathbed confessions.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.020]  Did you ever go on it?
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.801]  No, I mean I know the Idaho Observer is a good publication.
[01:14:08.801 --> 01:14:10.922]  I didn't even know one of their people died.
[01:14:10.922 --> 01:14:16.644]  Okay, I couldn't believe it because I read stuff out of there before.
[01:14:16.644 --> 01:14:19.545]  I went on there and I couldn't believe what I saw.
[01:14:19.545 --> 01:14:25.387]  I thought the Russo-Rockefeller interview was the ultimate until I brought this up.
[01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:27.408]  Have your man check it out today, right now.
[01:14:28.021 --> 01:14:29.021]  And get back to you on it.
[01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:30.282]  You're not going to believe it.
[01:14:30.282 --> 01:14:35.044]  Okay, so I search Idaho Observer Deathbed Confession?
[01:14:35.044 --> 01:14:37.385]  Alex?
[01:14:37.385 --> 01:14:38.566]  Yes?
[01:14:38.566 --> 01:14:39.406]  Maybe.
[01:14:39.406 --> 01:14:41.367]  I've never heard you bring this up.
[01:14:41.367 --> 01:14:44.929]  But when you see this, it's going to blow your mind if you don't know about it.
[01:14:44.929 --> 01:14:47.610]  Okay, I'm just asking you the headline.
[01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:49.371]  Idaho Observer Deathbed Confession.
[01:14:49.371 --> 01:14:54.973]  When it comes up, you're going to see a family photograph there from the 1930s.
[01:14:54.973 --> 01:14:56.054]  You'll know he has the right site.
[01:14:56.934 --> 01:15:00.756]  Okay, we'll put that up on screen as soon as they pull it up.
[01:15:00.756 --> 01:15:04.558]  IdahoObserver.com.
[01:15:04.558 --> 01:15:05.259]  Okay, there it is.
[01:15:05.259 --> 01:15:13.323]  Deathbed Confessions Photo Support Claim that George H... I can't read it from across the room.
[01:15:13.323 --> 01:15:14.644]  What's it say?
[01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:21.048]  George H. Scherff was the 41st President of the United States.
[01:15:21.048 --> 01:15:22.749]  Okay, so tell me about this article.
[01:15:22.749 --> 01:15:23.349]  What's it deal with?
[01:15:25.165 --> 01:15:29.907]  George H. Shurf, they say, was the 41st President of the United States.
[01:15:29.907 --> 01:15:34.748]  So they're saying George H. Bush's name is something different?
[01:15:34.748 --> 01:15:36.129]  That's exactly right.
[01:15:36.129 --> 01:15:44.572]  And when you see the photo in there, when he was in his teens, wearing a German Navy uniform, you're going to see the similarities in his face.
[01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:47.660]  It's going to take a minute for you to gather this information.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:50.921]  It specifically gives who each person is in that photo, and when you read it,
[01:16:11.454 --> 01:16:12.955]  You're going to blow your mind.
[01:16:31.969 --> 01:16:32.250]  I don't
[01:16:46.547 --> 01:16:51.929]  Barbara Bush's dad was Aleister Crowley.
[01:16:51.929 --> 01:16:55.750]  Or that some of the Beatles were killed and replaced.
[01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:58.971]  I don't really go there, but I shouldn't comment on it before I've read it.
[01:16:58.971 --> 01:17:01.631]  I'll try to read it during the break.
[01:17:01.631 --> 01:17:03.872]  That's certainly election news, isn't it?
[01:17:03.872 --> 01:17:05.693]  Economy news.
[01:17:05.693 --> 01:17:06.853]  Thank you, Fred.
[01:17:06.853 --> 01:17:07.793]  Brad in Michigan.
[01:17:07.793 --> 01:17:08.673]  Brad, you're on the air.
[01:17:08.673 --> 01:17:10.074]  Go ahead.
[01:17:10.074 --> 01:17:10.734]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:10.734 --> 01:17:12.414]  First of all, I want to say thank you, man.
[01:17:12.414 --> 01:17:13.215]  It's a real honor.
[01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:23.218]  I've watched numerous of your documentaries, and it's really inspired me to think about what we can do to undermine this New World Order.
[01:17:23.218 --> 01:17:30.283]  I'd like to know, Alex, in your opinion, how come we don't have a committee to basically
[01:17:30.968 --> 01:17:32.048]  Why don't we have a space shuttle?
[01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:33.369]  I mean, why don't we have the Hoover Dam?
[01:17:33.369 --> 01:17:38.891]  They take trillions of dollars of our money and then build the system to enslave us around us.
[01:17:38.891 --> 01:17:40.051]  That's why we want to cut taxes.
[01:17:40.051 --> 01:17:42.812]  That's why we want to get back to state government and smaller government.
[01:18:00.598 --> 01:18:08.698]  As the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independent States, I mean, it would be great to have things like that.
[01:18:10.004 --> 01:18:10.484]  I don't know.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:47.588]  If we had one big monolithic group that would be easy to infiltrate or demonize or bring down, the fact that we are just individuals and we aren't cookie cutter and there's so many of us out there, that's what makes us so strong.
[01:18:47.588 --> 01:18:52.991]  But I mean, Brad, can you build this organization?
[01:18:52.991 --> 01:18:54.052]  I mean, I don't think I can.
[01:18:54.052 --> 01:18:58.935]  I think if we were to definitely, you know,
[01:18:59.617 --> 01:19:02.539]  I mean, we have so much police state on us as it is.
[01:19:02.539 --> 01:19:10.143]  You know, we have the government enforcing their law on us, but we have nothing to hold them within their bounds except for we the people.
[01:19:10.143 --> 01:19:14.846]  And, you know, I agree with a lot of the term, you know, we've become lazy Americans.
[01:19:14.846 --> 01:19:21.230]  We've let this go for so long that, you know, they've pretty much gotten away with this for decades.
[01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:25.292]  Well, I mean, Brad, we're taking the counties and states back.
[01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:26.693]  We're getting patriots elected.
[01:19:26.693 --> 01:19:28.474]  This is only the first round.
[01:19:28.474 --> 01:19:32.696]  And we're teaching people about liberty so they can rediscover freedom.
[01:19:32.696 --> 01:19:34.217]  And it's a process.
[01:19:34.217 --> 01:19:37.939]  But look, people sued the mortgage companies and it's ground to a halt.
[01:19:38.519 --> 01:19:42.283]  We talked about Bisphenol A sterilizing people for a decade.
[01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:44.305]  Now it's being banned all over the place.
[01:19:44.305 --> 01:19:46.107]  It just doesn't happen overnight.
[01:19:46.107 --> 01:19:47.008]  But I agree with you.
[01:19:47.008 --> 01:19:51.533]  We need to monitor government and these big corporations and police them.
[01:19:51.533 --> 01:19:58.421]  But the government gets the patriot movement to police ourselves and to fight with each other instead of exposing the globalists.
[01:19:58.421 --> 01:19:59.442]  It's called divide and conquer.
[01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:05.419]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:21:14.763 --> 01:21:17.204]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[01:21:59.306 --> 01:22:00.086]  Gold.
[01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:01.627]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:22:01.627 --> 01:22:07.890]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:12.072]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:12.072 --> 01:22:14.013]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:16.434]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:16.434 --> 01:22:23.238]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[01:22:23.558 --> 01:22:24.459]  We're good to go.
[01:22:52.675 --> 01:22:54.317]  You must read this report.

[01:24:14.432 --> 01:24:18.303]  October surprise that the Obamanoid controllers have launched.
[01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:34.994]  We're going to get into the election dirty tricks, but I wanted to put on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers or radio listeners, we're linking to this up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:24:34.994 --> 01:24:42.256]  Silver climbs to 30-year high, palladium gains to nine-year peak, Bloomberg Businessweek
[01:24:43.274 --> 01:24:56.025]  November 1st, silver for immediate delivery climbed as much as 1.1% today to $25.50 an ounce, or $25.0050, so half a cent, $25.50 an ounce, the highest price since 1980, as the weakening dollar increased the appeal for precious metals as an alternative asset.
[01:25:06.232 --> 01:25:15.256]  Spot Palladium gained as much as 0.9% to $653.38 an ounce, the highest level since 2001.
[01:25:15.256 --> 01:25:20.198]  And many analysts and experts are predicting it's going to go even higher.
[01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:26.781]  And you notice oil's been going up, crude oil as well, because the dollar is starting its slow
[01:25:28.444 --> 01:25:29.265]  Yes, we are.
[01:25:53.163 --> 01:25:53.603]  I don't think so.
[01:26:12.108 --> 01:26:14.810]  To find them anywhere as inexpensive.
[01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:19.493]  And if you can, which I haven't been able to do, they might have one or two for you.
[01:26:19.493 --> 01:26:23.275]  Ted's got them by the thousands, if you so choose.
[01:26:23.275 --> 01:26:25.977]  And I've been saying gold, I believe, is a great way to go.
[01:26:25.977 --> 01:26:26.638]  We've been proven right.
[01:26:26.638 --> 01:26:29.539]  It's up four times what it was just 10 years ago.
[01:26:29.539 --> 01:26:31.080]  But silver's the big sleeper.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.763]  It's the one really undervalued for where it should be for inflation.
[01:26:34.763 --> 01:26:39.526]  Most economists we have on say for inflation, it should be $55 or more an ounce.
[01:26:39.526 --> 01:26:40.687]  I'm not saying it's going there.
[01:26:41.147 --> 01:26:49.092]  But obviously, all the evidence shows it's going up, and it's hit its all-time high since 1980, today of over $25 an ounce.
[01:26:49.092 --> 01:26:51.173]  Ted Anderson, tell us about your take on this.
[01:26:56.334 --> 01:27:05.059]  All right, we've been having some technical issues today connecting to the network, but we will work on that.
[01:27:05.059 --> 01:27:15.624]  I know they've got a lot of really great deals for people up there at Midas Resources, and you can simply call toll-free.
[01:27:15.624 --> 01:27:20.106]  I think last time I checked, I'm not even sure if this is the case, I think he said it was like $11.77 for a silver half dollar.
[01:27:23.348 --> 01:27:25.709]  They're like 13, 14 bucks everywhere else.
[01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:28.130]  Most places you look at full silver dollars.
[01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:29.531]  They don't even have collector value.
[01:27:29.531 --> 01:27:31.592]  They're $29 a piece.
[01:27:31.592 --> 01:27:33.933]  I know Ted's got them for a lot less than that.
[01:27:33.933 --> 01:27:36.835]  He's got that creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:37.935]  What is it?
[01:27:37.935 --> 01:27:41.697]  $31 now for the 1995 book and the silver dollar.
[01:27:41.697 --> 01:27:42.898]  And that includes shipping.
[01:27:42.898 --> 01:27:47.720]  Do we have Ted there now?
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.061]  Okay.
[01:27:49.061 --> 01:27:49.741]  I told him 24 after.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.701]  Bigger than Dallas, but whatever.
[01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:56.564]  A lot of crazy stuff going on up there.
[01:27:56.564 --> 01:27:59.427]  And we have Wayne Madsen on at 1230.
[01:27:59.427 --> 01:28:04.191]  So Ted is running down into the studio right now.
[01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:06.594]  But again, silver climbs the 30-year high.
[01:28:06.594 --> 01:28:10.337]  Palladium gains to 9-year peak.
[01:28:10.337 --> 01:28:12.319]  Silver for immediate delivery climbed as much as 1.1% to $25.5.
[01:28:16.483 --> 01:28:17.383]  An ounce.
[01:28:17.383 --> 01:28:21.124]  Hey, Ted, we're about to go to break, but good to have you here with us.
[01:28:21.124 --> 01:28:24.585]  Tell us, what are you selling silver dollars and silver half dollars for right now?
[01:28:24.585 --> 01:28:26.846]  Well, the silver dollars are just under 30 bucks.
[01:28:26.846 --> 01:28:29.726]  I mean, they're like 20, 29 bucks somewhere there.
[01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:32.687]  I don't have that, but the halves right now are at 11.77.
[01:28:32.687 --> 01:28:36.328]  Silver just hit $25 an ounce or just two cents short of that.
[01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:41.249]  And it's, you know, that is such a psychological thing, Alex.
[01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:43.830]  I mean, we are just going crazy with silver.
[01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:47.991]  Gold, of course, was up today at $1,363.22.
[01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:49.672]  Just the whole thing is really good.
[01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:53.433]  That creature book, I'm really happy that people are ordering that thing.
[01:28:53.433 --> 01:28:59.215]  I mean, to get a silver dollar and that book and everything for $31, I mean, you just can't beat that deal.
[01:28:59.215 --> 01:29:00.015]  It's just so good.
[01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:08.146]  And, uh, you know, I'm afraid that I might have to start putting half-ounce coins in there rather than the silver dollar, just because of the fact that the price of silver is running.
[01:29:08.146 --> 01:29:08.747]  Yeah, well, do the math.
[01:29:08.747 --> 01:29:09.508]  I mean, do the math.
[01:29:09.508 --> 01:29:11.651]  Most silver dollars are selling for, what, $29 a piece right now?
[01:29:11.651 --> 01:29:11.912]  Yeah, $29 to $30.
[01:29:11.912 --> 01:29:12.673]  I've seen them up as high as $32.
[01:29:15.677 --> 01:29:19.238]  Okay, so you're putting that in there and a 1995 book.
[01:29:19.238 --> 01:29:20.978]  The book cost you $11.
[01:29:20.978 --> 01:29:22.739]  So $11 and $25.
[01:29:22.739 --> 01:29:28.900]  You know, we're talking about you got $35 or so in this.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.861]  And so you're losing money on this.
[01:29:30.861 --> 01:29:33.001]  And is that $31 with shipping included, Ted?
[01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:35.002]  Yeah, it's all delivered right to the person.
[01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:35.822]  So it covers everything.
[01:29:35.942 --> 01:29:36.822]  So, I mean, do the math.
[01:29:36.822 --> 01:29:39.064]  I don't know how much money you're losing on this, but it is insane.
[01:29:39.064 --> 01:29:39.384]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:39.384 --> 01:29:45.967]  And you heard Ted, he's about to start putting silver half dollars in there, but still a great deal.
[01:29:45.967 --> 01:29:46.027]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:46.027 --> 01:29:50.329]  Ted, we're going to come right back with you briefly.
[01:29:50.329 --> 01:29:50.969]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.370]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:54.891]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.891 --> 01:29:57.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.931]  Hello from eFoods Direct.

[01:30:47.998 --> 01:30:51.723]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:31:02.308 --> 01:31:04.490]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:05.751]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.751 --> 01:31:09.415]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.415 --> 01:31:11.917]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.917 --> 01:31:16.961]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.782 --> 01:31:24.445]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:30.447]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.447 --> 01:31:34.089]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.609 --> 01:31:38.893]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:44.837]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.837 --> 01:31:48.400]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.381]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.381 --> 01:31:51.502]  It's here.

[01:32:02.059 --> 01:32:06.020]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:14.882]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.882 --> 01:32:19.503]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.503 --> 01:32:30.325]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.965 --> 01:32:40.467]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.467 --> 01:32:45.909]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.909 --> 01:32:53.390]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:56.151]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:08.578 --> 01:33:19.988]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:19.988 --> 01:33:20.189]  Show!
[01:33:21.278 --> 01:33:23.179]  Silver climbs to a 30-year high.
[01:33:23.179 --> 01:33:24.599]  The last time was 1980.
[01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.740]  $25 an ounce.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:32.402]  And they have devalued the currency massively since 1980.
[01:33:32.402 --> 01:33:35.203]  Most analysts, $55 or more an ounce.
[01:33:35.203 --> 01:33:36.943]  Silver is what they believe it should be valued.
[01:33:36.943 --> 01:33:40.044]  Gold, $2,500 an ounce.
[01:33:40.044 --> 01:33:45.426]  Once they go above that, then I'll start saying, hey, I don't know if this is a good investment.
[01:33:45.426 --> 01:33:46.746]  I don't know, you know.
[01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:48.047]  I go off what I personally do.
[01:33:49.264 --> 01:33:49.424]  I think?
[01:34:05.061 --> 01:34:06.162]  I don't know.
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:27.700]  I don't think so.
[01:34:52.248 --> 01:34:53.008]  Yeah, they sure are.
[01:34:53.008 --> 01:34:59.430]  The manipulation is going away, which is good, because the market should be able to run free and not have to be suppressed.
[01:34:59.430 --> 01:35:05.831]  I mean, the only reason why the banks are trying to suppress gold and silver is because they're trying to make their fiat money look better.
[01:35:05.831 --> 01:35:10.752]  And everybody that has anything to do with gold and silver should jump on this lawsuit.
[01:35:10.752 --> 01:35:11.972]  It's a class action suit.
[01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.413]  You might as well sign up.
[01:35:13.413 --> 01:35:15.373]  Hopefully these guys have to pay big time.
[01:35:15.373 --> 01:35:19.174]  I mean, they've been messing with the value of our currency
[01:35:19.594 --> 01:35:20.375]  For so long.
[01:35:34.616 --> 01:35:41.264]  We have the Federal Reserve set to announce in the next few days publicly that they are going to devalue the dollar.
[01:35:41.264 --> 01:35:45.769]  They've already made the announcements tentatively that that's the fix to inflation.
[01:35:45.769 --> 01:35:48.793]  Ted, 30 plus years in gold and silver and commodities.
[01:35:48.793 --> 01:35:52.537]  What's going to happen when the Fed announces a further dollar devaluation?
[01:35:52.717 --> 01:35:55.559]  Well, you and I both know that gold is going to go up on that.
[01:35:55.559 --> 01:36:18.273]  As a matter of fact, Bloomberg right now is reporting that China should buy gold, and this is Sheng Fengguo, I'm not very good at these Chinese names, an official at the China Construction Bank, is advising that China should buy gold specifically for that reason, because they're afraid of this QE2, this Quantitative Easing 2 package that's coming out, and it'll probably be coming out this very week that the Fed is going to announce.
[01:36:18.353 --> 01:36:26.276]  We've got to destroy the world's currencies or devalue them so people will accept the SDR and the new global VAT tax.
[01:36:26.276 --> 01:36:33.859]  Here's the number to call and get silver dollars, silver half dollars, gold francs, gold sovereigns, you name it, 800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:36:33.859 --> 01:36:44.323]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I was you, I wouldn't be left behind in all of this.
[01:36:44.323 --> 01:36:47.324]  Ted is going to have to go up on silver and gold prices very soon.
[01:36:48.124 --> 01:36:51.290]  Ted, again, tell people briefly your best gold and silver deals right now.
[01:36:51.656 --> 01:36:54.798]  Well, the best deal I have right now is the Walking Liberty Half Silver.
[01:36:54.798 --> 01:36:56.460]  It's at $11.77.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:06.547]  I mean, my goodness, the prices are $14 on the average out there in the marketplace, and my wholesale costs are going up, and I'm living on a small quantity that I have left over.
[01:37:06.547 --> 01:37:12.331]  The frank at $2.99, Alex, when you get the full year of the International Forecaster, that's awesome.
[01:37:12.331 --> 01:37:16.935]  I mean, that's like buying gold at the $500 an ounce range.
[01:37:16.935 --> 01:37:18.236]  What do you have silver dollars for?
[01:37:18.616 --> 01:37:22.460]  Silver dollars currently right now they're trading just under 30 bucks a piece.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.742]  I think they're 29 something.
[01:37:23.742 --> 01:37:26.545]  I didn't get that price before I walked into the studio.
[01:37:26.545 --> 01:37:27.586]  But $20 Liberty is $16.49.
[01:37:27.586 --> 01:37:27.986]  $10 Liberty is $8.40.
[01:37:27.986 --> 01:37:30.609]  US Eagles are just a poke over $1,400 an ounce.
[01:37:30.609 --> 01:37:32.451]  You know, everything is just...
[01:37:37.817 --> 01:37:56.151]  All I can say is that if you've been looking at your bank accounts, your annuities, your 401Ks, your retirement plan, all that stuff is going to be affected and it's going to be directly affected by this quantitative easing that this Fed is taking effect and doing.
[01:37:58.132 --> 01:37:59.834]  Alex, I just don't know how I can say it enough.
[01:37:59.834 --> 01:38:02.136]  People really need to move into gold and silver.
[01:38:02.136 --> 01:38:04.317]  It's not like even an option anymore.
[01:38:04.317 --> 01:38:12.184]  If you don't have at least 20% of your assets diversified with physical gold sitting in your possession, you're naked out there.
[01:38:12.184 --> 01:38:12.705]  Absolutely.
[01:38:12.705 --> 01:38:14.626]  It's a very simple equation.
[01:38:14.626 --> 01:38:18.089]  They are accelerating the devaluation of your savings.
[01:38:18.089 --> 01:38:19.070]  It's very simple.
[01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:20.851]  And with gold and silver, what you're able to do is
[01:38:23.213 --> 01:38:32.343]  Buy when the dollar hasn't been completely devalued and then as the currency's further devalued you can always cash it in for whatever point inflation is at at that time 800-686-2237.
[01:38:32.343 --> 01:38:34.685]  Ted, thank you for joining us.
[01:38:34.685 --> 01:38:36.047]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:38:38.422 --> 01:38:51.128]  Okay, we spent most of the first hour on this, and I've got Webster Tarpley in the last 30 minutes of the next hour, another key expert on Anwar al-Awlaki and others, but I wanted to get Wayne Madsen who worked for the NSA.
[01:38:51.128 --> 01:38:53.950]  He's written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[01:38:53.950 --> 01:39:02.714]  He has the WayneMadsenReport.com, and we're talking about October Surprise, these toner cartridge bombs.
[01:39:02.714 --> 01:39:04.735]  First they said they tested them and they weren't bombs.
[01:39:04.735 --> 01:39:06.736]  Now they say they have explosive material.
[01:39:07.296 --> 01:39:10.137]  Now somebody tried to mail a bomb out of Greece to Sarkozy.
[01:39:10.137 --> 01:39:11.357]  Another bomb's gone off.
[01:39:11.357 --> 01:39:19.959]  The normal leftist guerrilla groups that have been proven to be part of Operation Gladio and the NATO Stay Behind networks.
[01:39:19.959 --> 01:39:24.740]  This takes the news cycle off of the election and the establishment candidates being routed.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:32.062]  It allows Obama to pose as the savior and say, see, I protected you again, which is what some of his people like
[01:39:33.462 --> 01:39:36.204]  Robert Shapiro had called for back in July.
[01:39:36.204 --> 01:39:37.565]  This is very transparent.
[01:39:37.565 --> 01:39:40.447]  I want to get Wayne Madsen's breakdown on this.
[01:39:40.447 --> 01:39:41.588]  Wayne, you predicted it.
[01:39:41.588 --> 01:39:42.549]  I predicted it.
[01:39:42.549 --> 01:39:46.572]  It wasn't hard to predict an October surprise, and now it's happened.
[01:39:49.381 --> 01:39:57.687]  Halloween 2004, what's considered to be a very close race between George Bush and John Kerry.
[01:39:57.687 --> 01:40:05.094]  On Halloween we have this Osama Bin Laden videotape broadcast all over the world.
[01:40:05.094 --> 01:40:14.862]  I happened to be visiting the United Nations headquarters in New York and people just looked at that and said, it's obviously the Bush people trying to influence the election.
[01:40:15.562 --> 01:40:21.147]  Because Obama himself gets to pose as our savior, but the military
[01:40:45.262 --> 01:40:56.105]  Industrial complex, they get to continue the naked body scanners, the domestic police state, the trillions on wars, the expanded operations in Yemen, Pakistan.
[01:40:56.105 --> 01:40:59.906]  They're all over the media saying, see, we need to keep these wars going.
[01:40:59.906 --> 01:41:01.947]  See, we need more checkpoints.
[01:41:01.947 --> 01:41:05.048]  See, see, we're protecting you from the terrorists.
[01:41:05.048 --> 01:41:12.710]  So this October surprise on so many fronts helps all the different arms of this corporate system.
[01:41:13.487 --> 01:41:20.151]  Oh no, and if you drill down to how this, the latest thing was carried out, we have this guy Javier Alfaiste.
[01:41:20.151 --> 01:41:26.415]  He was a detainee of the United States in Guantanamo, originally picked up in Afghanistan.
[01:41:26.415 --> 01:41:31.418]  He was released by the US to the Saudis who put him through a quote-unquote
[01:41:32.198 --> 01:41:37.560]  Rehabilitation program under the control of the Kingdom.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.440]  He's released.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:43.221]  He runs off and rejoins Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
[01:41:43.221 --> 01:41:47.362]  This new McDonald-like franchise of Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:47.362 --> 01:41:49.883]  They've got franchises all over the world.
[01:41:49.883 --> 01:41:52.504]  I don't know who has more McDonald's or Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:53.224 --> 01:42:00.593]  Al-Safi is now the source for the tip-off from the Saudis to the UAE and the United States.
[01:42:00.593 --> 01:42:06.459]  Oddly enough, David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, wasn't even informed about this latest thing for 16 hours.
[01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:08.802]  We're good to go.
[01:42:25.044 --> 01:42:27.987]  Security controls are ridiculous.
[01:42:27.987 --> 01:42:29.989]  They're too intrusive.
[01:42:29.989 --> 01:42:32.892]  And now there's a call for greater control.
[01:42:32.892 --> 01:42:39.459]  I'll point out how safety was flown in a private jet in October.
[01:42:42.085 --> 01:42:45.367]  From Yemen, Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, to Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:45.367 --> 01:42:48.390]  The Yemenis are saying Al-Faithi is a Saudi double agent.
[01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:53.374]  So here we have all this information originating from a Saudi double agent.
[01:42:53.374 --> 01:43:00.900]  And considering that Saudi intelligence works in lockstep with the Mossad and the CIA, I think we can see right through this.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:02.941]  This is another false flag.
[01:43:02.941 --> 01:43:08.386]  And one that looks like it was from the Austin Powers School of Intelligence comedy.
[01:43:11.308 --> 01:43:14.730]  Well, Wayne Madsen, it's so transparent.
[01:43:14.730 --> 01:43:23.113]  Obviously, this is targeted at Americans who aren't really paying attention and just hear this background noise of some guy with a turban and a beard, he wants to get me.
[01:43:23.113 --> 01:43:38.140]  But now the media is saying Anwar al-Awlaki, who admittedly was meeting two months after 9-11 at the Pentagon with top brass, including the Secretary of the Army, he's behind Fort Hood, he's behind the underwear bombing on Christmas Day, he's behind the Times Square bombing.
[01:43:41.781 --> 01:43:50.954]  Specifically, clearly Alaki is one of their operatives, a Patsy minder, but it's so transparent.
[01:43:50.954 --> 01:43:54.879]  I mean, why can't the government come up with better staged terror attacks?
[01:43:54.879 --> 01:43:56.942]  Why are these so Laurel and Hardy?
[01:43:57.903 --> 01:44:06.912]  Oh, I think they know that they can run this by the Fox News and the CNNs without any questions being asked.
[01:44:06.912 --> 01:44:14.159]  I think it's also amazing that one of the package bombs was addressed to a Chicago synagogue
[01:44:15.032 --> 01:44:18.173]  It's called Congregation Immanuel.
[01:44:18.173 --> 01:44:19.534]  I kid you not.
[01:44:19.534 --> 01:44:26.957]  And that's a congregation that caters to Chicago's gay and lesbian Jewish community.
[01:44:26.957 --> 01:44:29.098]  Gee, who's running for mayor there?
[01:44:29.098 --> 01:44:30.219]  They're not even this good.
[01:44:30.219 --> 01:44:34.021]  I mean, either that or they're just, like, in your face about this.
[01:44:34.021 --> 01:44:43.605]  Now, the UPS office in Sana'a, in Yemen, that is supposed to have been where one of these letter bombs, these package bombs were shipped, it's UPS.
[01:44:44.145 --> 01:44:51.889]  I mean, yeah, they're not that good, but they know they can run this job by the American people because of the media.
[01:44:51.889 --> 01:44:56.232]  Media's not going to see through this nonsense.
[01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:10.353]  But Alaki is at the Pentagon hanging out.
[01:45:10.353 --> 01:45:11.653]  We know he's being controlled.
[01:45:11.653 --> 01:45:13.454]  We know he's being protected.
[01:45:13.454 --> 01:45:23.160]  This Rashood Aswad came out in British news, was MI6 protected, allowed to travel wherever he wanted to, admittedly running the 7-7 patsies.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.781]  I mean, it never ends.
[01:45:24.781 --> 01:45:32.546]  And more and more, I think it's a message to those of us that can think, that do do research, that yes, we're staging the terror attacks.
[01:45:32.546 --> 01:45:33.947]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:45:33.947 --> 01:45:35.528]  Look at all the sheep buying into it.
[01:45:35.908 --> 01:45:46.273]  But every time the ruling Anglo-American establishment stages a pre-election stunt like this, it always aids multiple fronts.
[01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:52.595]  The military industrial complex, incumbents, the backlash against the naked body scanners.
[01:45:52.595 --> 01:46:00.439]  Wayne, talk about some of the other camps that stand to gain from this event.
[01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:08.654]  There's been a proposal from the CIA to have the CIA put in charge of U.S.
[01:46:08.654 --> 01:46:11.715]  Special Operations units operating in Yemen.
[01:46:11.715 --> 01:46:14.457]  Right now they're under the control of the Pentagon.
[01:46:14.457 --> 01:46:18.019]  This obviously is going to open the door for that.
[01:46:18.019 --> 01:46:26.084]  We're going to have kind of a replay of the secret war in Laos under the Johnson and Nixon administrations.
[01:46:26.084 --> 01:46:27.825]  We'll have the secret war in Yemen.
[01:46:29.366 --> 01:46:32.335]  And of course, that'll be manufacturing terror attacks.
[01:46:32.335 --> 01:46:36.548]  They've got to be in Yemen to stage the attacks and say that they're a real Muslim terrorist.
[01:46:36.989 --> 01:46:37.809]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:37.809 --> 01:46:52.895]  And let's not forget that Yemen is now involved in a three-part civil war with the Shia al-Zaidi sect in the north fighting the central government, and the South Yemenis, who are absolutely secular in nature.
[01:46:52.895 --> 01:46:59.477]  This is the former Democratic Republic of Yemen, which is a socialist country.
[01:46:59.477 --> 01:47:02.218]  They are anything but friends of al-Qaeda.
[01:47:02.218 --> 01:47:04.799]  They're actually anti-Islamic.
[01:47:04.799 --> 01:47:06.160]  They're totally secular.
[01:47:09.081 --> 01:47:13.964]  Whoever the globalists want to take over, Iraq, you name it, they say they're Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:13.964 --> 01:47:19.548]  They've been saying Iran runs Al-Qaeda when the Shiites in Al-Qaeda, Saudi based, are arch enemies.
[01:47:19.548 --> 01:47:24.371]  I mean, it's just for anybody who has any geopolitical knowledge, this is a complete joke.
[01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:26.992]  Al-Qaeda is like a little set piece.
[01:47:26.992 --> 01:47:29.734]  They move around the global board wherever they want to invade.
[01:47:30.478 --> 01:47:31.278]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:31.878]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:40.540]  I mean, it's quite clear that Al-Qaeda is something that exists to serve all purposes for the intelligence community.
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:44.141]  They could one-size-fits-all.
[01:47:44.141 --> 01:47:47.302]  It's like a new product from Ronco.
[01:47:47.302 --> 01:47:51.563]  One-size-fits-all terrorist group.
[01:47:51.563 --> 01:47:54.544]  All these characters look like they come out of central casting.
[01:47:55.504 --> 01:47:59.707]  You know, they're all ready for their close-ups with Mr. DeMille.
[01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:06.873]  And here we have Al-Baki, and we have bomb-maker Al-Asiri, the mastermind bomb-maker.
[01:48:06.873 --> 01:48:09.474]  Well, we've seen the bomb-makers before.
[01:48:09.474 --> 01:48:14.798]  They were used successfully in all kinds of attacks by Palestinian groups.
[01:48:14.798 --> 01:48:20.042]  We had several master bomb-makers supposedly sitting in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.
[01:48:20.566 --> 01:48:22.528]  This is an old script.
[01:48:22.528 --> 01:48:28.555]  It's an old script and it's getting more ridiculous with the idea that the UPS office in Yemen is on Al Qaeda Street.
[01:48:36.423 --> 01:48:50.352]  If it wasn't so serious to see life being crittered away, you know, passengers undergoing more intrusive body searches where they actually reach up and grab your crotch.
[01:48:52.193 --> 01:48:54.514]  ABC News says it's what we do for the homeland.
[01:48:54.514 --> 01:48:58.975]  They will actually grab the genitals with the inside of their hands and squeeze the breast.
[01:48:58.975 --> 01:48:59.815]  That was Friday.
[01:48:59.815 --> 01:49:05.877]  Now today, the Wall Street Journal reports that everyone will have their genitals grabbed.
[01:49:05.877 --> 01:49:08.117]  So it's like, oh, you don't like naked body scanners?
[01:49:08.117 --> 01:49:11.158]  We're going to do that to you and we're going to grab you between the legs.
[01:49:11.158 --> 01:49:12.259]  Nobody's grabbing.
[01:49:12.259 --> 01:49:14.559]  I mean, no.
[01:49:14.559 --> 01:49:20.601]  I mean, it's just they want to break our will and they're inducting us into this police state cult.
[01:49:21.559 --> 01:49:27.146]  Well, I guess the next thing we'll have is Bob O'Neill and Bob O'Neill volunteering for PA.
[01:49:35.532 --> 01:49:37.313]  Partly because of what I said.
[01:49:37.313 --> 01:49:46.395]  I said probably we'll have Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama volunteering for TSA screening duty at O'Hare Airport soon.
[01:49:46.395 --> 01:49:48.516]  With the genital grabbing operation.
[01:49:48.516 --> 01:49:54.078]  Well you know it's not a joke that so many TSA workers get caught raping children, raping women.
[01:49:54.078 --> 01:49:57.739]  Every wannabe sex offender in the country you can now go
[01:49:58.439 --> 01:49:59.060]  Publicly?
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.223]  And hey, you like how somebody's wife looks?
[01:50:01.223 --> 01:50:02.845]  You know, she's yours.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:09.375]  But now they say everyone will have... I mean, I was watching children last week in California, in San Jose, Wayne.
[01:50:09.375 --> 01:50:12.800]  Small children, three-year-olds, being run through naked body scanners.
[01:50:13.716 --> 01:50:24.180]  Oh, now we know that they can store and forward those images, so I guess this is made to order for the North American Man-Boy Love Association.
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:27.521]  Yeah, Barney Frank, it's all going to his inbox.
[01:50:27.521 --> 01:50:29.382]  I can imagine.
[01:50:29.382 --> 01:50:34.444]  Not only him, but probably about 35% of the current members of the House and Senate.
[01:50:35.485 --> 01:50:43.050]  But yeah, I think it's getting to the point where these terror alerts are so fake!
[01:50:43.050 --> 01:50:46.233]  These incidents are so fake, you just gotta stand back and you laugh.
[01:50:46.604 --> 01:50:47.264]  Wayne, stay there.
[01:50:47.264 --> 01:50:56.367]  I want to do two segments with you on the other side and get into some other issues and how you think this fake terror alert is playing with the public.
[01:50:56.367 --> 01:50:58.968]  Remember, Governor Ridge admitted they issued fake terror alerts in 04.
[01:50:58.968 --> 01:51:00.849]  That's not Wayne Madsen's opinion.
[01:51:00.849 --> 01:51:03.649]  Are you concerned about dropping or losing your cell phone?
[01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:06.410]  Are you tired of dealing with cell phone clips or holsters?
[01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:08.291]  Then this message is for you.

[01:53:00.168 --> 01:53:01.470]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:07.077]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.077 --> 01:53:12.084]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.084 --> 01:53:17.130]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:17.651 --> 01:53:22.875]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:22.875 --> 01:53:25.176]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[01:53:47.771 --> 01:53:50.734]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:50.734 --> 01:53:56.838]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:56.838 --> 01:53:59.240]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:11.739 --> 01:54:18.242]  Wayne, in the last month in D.C., where you live, and also in New York, it's come out with mainstream headlines.
[01:54:18.242 --> 01:54:19.743]  Fake terrorists.
[01:54:19.743 --> 01:54:23.945]  The FBI goes out, finds mentally ill people, and creates the groups.
[01:54:23.945 --> 01:54:24.946]  They're not infiltrating.
[01:54:25.546 --> 01:54:30.208]  So they're trying to go with patsies because when they purely stage attacks, they get caught.
[01:54:30.208 --> 01:54:36.010]  But looking at these cartridge bombs, you can tell the government or one of their private contractors packaged these up.
[01:54:36.010 --> 01:54:44.032]  Haaretz, Jerusalem Post has admitted many times, quote, Israel created fake Al-Qaeda groups and staged attacks ahead of elections.
[01:54:44.032 --> 01:54:51.375]  Governments do this, but how effective is this going to be for them as even the mainstream media starts to pick up on how this is staged?
[01:54:52.250 --> 01:55:10.284]  Well, I would also note that the head of Yemenia Airways said no DHL or UP packages left Yemen on any outbound flight during the 48-hour period that these packages were said to have been mailed.
[01:55:10.284 --> 01:55:16.669]  So, obviously, they wound up in Dubai and London from some other source other than Yemen.
[01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:20.732]  They were not sent, according to the Yemeni Airlines official,
[01:55:21.412 --> 01:55:24.353]  Okay, we lost Wayne Madsen.
[01:55:24.353 --> 01:55:26.973]  We're going to get him back on.
[01:55:26.973 --> 01:55:30.534]  That's right, they arrested her and said, we have the Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:42.096 --> 01:55:47.297]  Harlett, who's done this, and then it comes out and they admit, okay, it's the wrong lady, wrong identity.
[01:55:47.297 --> 01:55:48.697]  I mean, just on every front.
[01:55:48.697 --> 01:55:55.819]  And don't forget, Obama, hours after the FBI and others said that these weren't bombs, he came out and said, yes, they are.
[01:55:55.819 --> 01:55:57.840]  And they called the British and said, test it again.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.380]  And they said, yes, sir, Mr. President.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:04.001]  Our Prime Minister hasn't even been told about this, but we'll follow your orders.
[01:56:04.001 --> 01:56:05.581]  We'll test the package again.
[01:56:05.581 --> 01:56:06.922]  Oh my goodness.
[01:56:06.922 --> 01:56:07.422]  It's a bomb.
[01:56:09.275 --> 01:56:10.295]  It's an explosive.
[01:56:10.295 --> 01:56:11.836]  It's pure evil.
[01:56:11.836 --> 01:56:17.737]  Aren't we lucky that Obama, though, is here to keep us safe from the terrorist?
[01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:24.499]  What did Robert Shapiro and many others say back in July of this year?
[01:56:24.499 --> 01:56:29.060]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership.
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:37.122]  He has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:56:37.122 --> 01:56:38.762]  I can't think of how he could do just that.
[01:56:40.011 --> 01:56:49.997]  That's right, we have to learn how strong he is, how good he is, how the system is going to keep us safe.
[01:56:49.997 --> 01:56:57.702]  And all over the Sunday news shows, all over the syndicated radio this weekend, and today, Obama really came through.
[01:56:57.702 --> 01:57:00.884]  Thank goodness we've got all this anti-terror security.
[01:57:01.843 --> 01:57:09.906]  Because the government was able to keep us safe from 20 plus bombs that were going to blow all these jetliners out of the air.
[01:57:09.906 --> 01:57:12.247]  You see, you need the naked body scanners.
[01:57:12.247 --> 01:57:15.068]  You need to have the TSA squeezing your genitals.
[01:57:15.068 --> 01:57:17.448]  You need to do all of this.
[01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:20.590]  You need to accept the police state.
[01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:23.791]  But Homeland Security is admittedly set up for the American people.
[01:57:23.791 --> 01:57:29.753]  You just have a few guys dance around in turbans who are all admittedly CIA connected and are hanging out at the Pentagon.
[01:57:30.626 --> 01:57:33.547]  And the system's just, oh, doesn't matter.
[01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:34.828]  That's just the way it is.
[01:57:34.828 --> 01:57:36.848]  We're doing this to keep you safe.
[01:57:36.848 --> 01:57:42.550]  They can only get away with this because large portions of the public are not paying attention.
[01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:47.632]  Oh, they know about the Rangers losing in game four in Dallas.
[01:57:47.632 --> 01:57:51.574]  Oh, they know about the latest Britney Spears record.
[01:57:51.574 --> 01:57:59.557]  They know about the latest fashion or the latest Starbucks coffee drink that everybody's gonna have.
[01:58:00.137 --> 01:58:10.143]  But they don't know the fundamentals of liberty and freedom or how these intelligence agencies operate and these private intelligence agencies.
[01:58:10.143 --> 01:58:12.224]  What did Mohammed Karzai say last week?
[01:58:12.224 --> 01:58:15.586]  He said that Blackwater is staging terror attacks in Iraq.
[01:58:15.586 --> 01:58:18.707]  That Blackwater is staging terror attacks, excuse me, in Afghanistan.
[01:58:18.707 --> 01:58:23.070]  The Iraqis have been saying they've been staging terror attacks in Iraq and then it comes out in federal court
[01:58:24.414 --> 01:58:27.917]  That they're running around shooting innocent people in their cars.
[01:58:27.917 --> 01:58:31.441]  That they're reportedly using cocaine and steroids and completely out of their mind.
[01:58:31.441 --> 01:58:33.623]  This is the amazing level of corruption.
[01:58:33.623 --> 01:58:35.645]  Looks like Wayne Madsen's phone died.
[01:58:35.645 --> 01:58:39.809]  I'm gonna shift gears now into a bunch of other economic and election news and your phone calls.
[01:58:39.809 --> 01:58:46.896]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.896 --> 01:58:47.817]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.989 --> 01:58:56.013]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.013 --> 01:58:59.256]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.256 --> 01:59:04.040]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:10.446]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.446 --> 01:59:12.688]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.208 --> 01:59:14.709]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:15.969]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.969 --> 01:59:18.230]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.116 --> 01:59:34.257]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.257 --> 01:59:39.380]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:53.768]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.768 --> 01:59:56.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:58.931]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.646 --> 02:00:06.967]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.967 --> 02:00:08.727]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.727 --> 02:00:10.488]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.488 --> 02:00:12.068]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.068 --> 02:00:13.609]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:17.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.811 --> 02:00:23.753]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.753 --> 02:00:28.995]  Well, unless there's massive election fraud in Nevada, bye-bye Harry Reid.
[02:00:28.995 --> 02:00:32.236]  The radical Sharon Engel going to the U.S.
[02:00:32.236 --> 02:00:33.596]  Senate.
[02:00:33.596 --> 02:00:34.537]  All the polls shoved.
[02:00:35.771 --> 02:00:39.713]  Unless there's massive election fraud in Kentucky.
[02:00:39.713 --> 02:00:43.035]  Bye bye Jack Conway, you won't be getting into office.
[02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:45.977]  Rand Paul, 15 points ahead in many polls.
[02:00:45.977 --> 02:00:48.758]  The kiss of death, Bill Clinton showing up to campaign.
[02:00:48.758 --> 02:00:55.522]  Let me get through the callers that have been holding, Marty, John, Jesse, James, James and others.
[02:00:55.522 --> 02:00:57.863]  Then I want to get into the election news.
[02:00:57.863 --> 02:01:00.245]  I want to get into some really scary debtor prison news.
[02:01:02.327 --> 02:01:06.109]  And more ahead of Tarbley joining us in T-minus 33 minutes from now.
[02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:07.830]  Right now, let's go to Marty in Ohio.
[02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:08.670]  Marty, thanks for holding.
[02:01:08.670 --> 02:01:09.650]  Good to hear from you.
[02:01:09.650 --> 02:01:10.691]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:01:10.691 --> 02:01:12.932]  Worldwide transmission.
[02:01:12.932 --> 02:01:17.414]  You're dead on about the sports and the pop culture taking over.
[02:01:17.414 --> 02:01:21.116]  Just in a week, trying to get people to hear some real issues.
[02:01:21.116 --> 02:01:22.716]  You can hear everything but the truth.
[02:01:22.716 --> 02:01:30.480]  So, I just wanted to compliment you for the way that you throw together certain parallels or analogies throughout time.
[02:01:32.019 --> 02:01:36.463]  I'm going to go ahead and make a simple flip book or something simple.
[02:01:36.463 --> 02:01:39.104]  You know how they have those books for dummies?
[02:01:39.104 --> 02:01:42.127]  It'd be great to have a book, Globalist Dirty Tricks.
[02:01:42.127 --> 02:01:52.934]  Yeah, similar to that, but it's basically just the parallels of different examples of provocateurs and staged events over time, like you said, over the last 2,000 years.
[02:01:52.934 --> 02:01:55.236]  It'd be good to put it in a simple fashion where people could
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.463]  You know, get it for free, hand it out, and just see it.
[02:01:58.463 --> 02:02:02.747]  You know, maybe it could have been a Halloween giveaway, but we'll wait for that.
[02:02:02.747 --> 02:02:04.229]  Well, really well said.
[02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:06.011]  Marty, anything else?
[02:02:06.011 --> 02:02:07.853]  Um, that should be about it.
[02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:13.819]  One thing I was going to say is that I don't know if you have or do, but multiple guests on at once
[02:02:14.686 --> 02:02:19.149]  I actually wanted to do more of that.
[02:02:19.149 --> 02:02:23.332]  I wanted to get Tarpley and Madsen on at the same time today, but we couldn't do it.
[02:02:23.332 --> 02:02:25.333]  And we are going to be doing more roundtables.
[02:02:25.333 --> 02:02:26.313]  I've done those in the past.
[02:02:26.313 --> 02:02:29.035]  We're going to move into roundtables here in the near future.
[02:02:29.035 --> 02:02:31.357]  Maybe a Gerald Salente on with a Max Keiser.
[02:02:32.117 --> 02:02:35.639]  Or maybe a Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on with a Ron Paul.
[02:02:35.639 --> 02:02:40.742]  Or maybe a Jesse Ventura on, you know, with somebody else who's interesting.
[02:02:40.742 --> 02:02:41.763]  A David Icke.
[02:02:41.763 --> 02:02:44.064]  I appreciate your call, Marty.
[02:02:44.064 --> 02:02:45.085]  Good points.
[02:02:45.085 --> 02:02:45.845]  Good idea.
[02:02:45.845 --> 02:02:48.867]  Yes, roundtables, roundtables, roundtables, roundtables.
[02:02:48.867 --> 02:02:52.029]  I want to go in that direction.
[02:02:52.029 --> 02:02:57.553]  Let's go ahead and I'll tell you, all they do is puns back there.
[02:02:57.553 --> 02:02:59.694]  Philbert just popped in my ear and said, square tables.
[02:03:01.832 --> 02:03:03.793]  Spongebob sitting at the square table.
[02:03:03.793 --> 02:03:05.753]  John in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:03:05.753 --> 02:03:07.654]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[02:03:07.654 --> 02:03:09.235]  Good!
[02:03:09.235 --> 02:03:10.095]  Glad to hear from you.
[02:03:10.095 --> 02:03:13.096]  I want to, first off, thank you for my awakening.
[02:03:13.096 --> 02:03:15.197]  And I just wanted a quick point out.
[02:03:15.197 --> 02:03:19.418]  I was driving home from work last night and I've been listening to all these radio shows.
[02:03:19.418 --> 02:03:20.298]  I deliver pizzas.
[02:03:20.298 --> 02:03:23.659]  And they were talking about Obama saving us?
[02:03:23.659 --> 02:03:25.320]  Oh no, they were talking about how
[02:03:26.475 --> 02:03:33.597]  Uh, all these materials that have been found on the planes were basically used in the Times Square bombings and the underwear bombings.
[02:03:33.597 --> 02:03:43.181]  Well, then later on the Billy Cunningham Show, uh, an ex-military demolitions guy called in and, uh, he was talking about how, he's like, Billy, this isn't adding up.
[02:03:43.181 --> 02:03:46.742]  He's like, PETN is the stuff that we commonly use.
[02:03:46.742 --> 02:03:49.323]  He's like, okay, to use as fertilizer and other stuff.
[02:03:49.323 --> 02:03:49.803]  This is not...
[02:03:50.779 --> 02:03:51.860]  This is not Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.943]  But Al-Qaeda is admittedly government.
[02:03:54.943 --> 02:03:57.346]  They've been caught hundreds of times.
[02:03:57.346 --> 02:03:58.467]  Oh yeah, I know that.
[02:03:58.467 --> 02:04:04.052]  I'm just saying it might be worth trying to find those transcripts because I know Billy Cunningham's a pretty popular radio show.
[02:04:04.052 --> 02:04:07.576]  No, no, I understand that this chemical is a U.S.
[02:04:07.576 --> 02:04:07.856]  weapon.
[02:04:11.095 --> 02:04:12.396]  I just thought I'd bring that to your attention.
[02:04:12.396 --> 02:04:16.678]  I thought it was awkward that, you know, they even, they kind of blew that guy off, too.
[02:04:16.678 --> 02:04:17.979]  They were like, really well.
[02:04:17.979 --> 02:04:22.802]  Oh, no, we're all supposed to perseverate and get all hyperventilating.
[02:04:22.802 --> 02:04:24.143]  The terrorists, it's so scary.
[02:04:24.143 --> 02:04:26.324]  Naked bodies scam my whole family.
[02:04:26.324 --> 02:04:28.366]  Grab my wife's private parts.
[02:04:28.366 --> 02:04:30.947]  Keep me safe, Al Qaeda!
[02:04:30.947 --> 02:04:34.229]  Meanwhile, the southern border is completely wide open.
[02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.710]  Yeah.
[02:04:34.710 --> 02:04:35.890]  Good point, John.
[02:04:35.890 --> 02:04:36.631]  Anything else?
[02:04:37.918 --> 02:04:41.259]  No, I just wanted to say thank you again and keep up the good fight, man.
[02:04:41.259 --> 02:04:41.720]  Thank you.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:45.521]  Folks, I'm so scared of Al Qaeda right now, I can barely keep doing this show.
[02:04:45.521 --> 02:04:49.123]  I mean, is there one underneath the table?
[02:04:49.123 --> 02:04:51.343]  I mean, no WMDs here.
[02:04:51.343 --> 02:04:52.164]  Nope, none there.
[02:04:52.164 --> 02:04:54.725]  Alright, I shouldn't joke around about it.
[02:04:54.725 --> 02:04:56.425]  Hey, looks like the Aquaboot is going to the U.S.
[02:04:56.425 --> 02:04:56.646]  Senate.
[02:04:56.646 --> 02:04:59.707]  I'm going to drink some water to the Aquaboot, Rand Paul.
[02:05:00.745 --> 02:05:05.308]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:05:05.308 --> 02:05:06.208]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.208 --> 02:05:09.630]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.630 --> 02:05:10.490]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.490 --> 02:05:15.393]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.393 --> 02:05:16.134]  It's true.
[02:05:16.134 --> 02:05:20.996]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.996 --> 02:05:21.837]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.837 --> 02:05:25.419]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.419 --> 02:05:29.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:30.122]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.122 --> 02:05:32.885]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.885 --> 02:05:36.569]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.569 --> 02:05:37.349]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.349 --> 02:05:41.494]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.494 --> 02:05:46.259]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:05:58.363 --> 02:06:04.705]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:06:04.705 --> 02:06:11.127]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:06:11.127 --> 02:06:15.008]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[02:06:15.208 --> 02:06:18.490]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[02:06:18.490 --> 02:06:23.373]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:36.281 --> 02:06:43.064]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:43.064 --> 02:06:46.946]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:07:53.847 --> 02:07:56.808]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[02:07:56.808 --> 02:08:01.911]  Check them out today.
[02:08:01.911 --> 02:08:04.672]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.672 --> 02:08:07.494]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.521 --> 02:08:20.705]  I may have spoken too soon even though almost all the major polls show a five to ten point lead for Sharon Engel in Nevada.
[02:08:20.705 --> 02:08:27.467]  I was just watching Fox News during a little three minute break and I'm afraid there's been some voting problems.
[02:08:27.467 --> 02:08:32.990]  Been reported for two weeks where you can only vote for Harry Reid.
[02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:39.913]  I'm afraid that they're now saying that the election results are going to be delayed in Nevada until December.
[02:08:41.705 --> 02:08:43.445]  Oh, isn't that terrible?
[02:08:43.445 --> 02:08:50.987]  It says Reid and Engel fight could spill into December.
[02:08:50.987 --> 02:08:55.788]  This is out of the LasVegasSun.com.
[02:08:55.788 --> 02:09:01.570]  Republican Sharon Engel has urged Tea Party crowds to give Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
[02:09:02.887 --> 02:09:05.470]  A November to remember by booting him out of office.
[02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:12.758]  But a divided electorate and voter fraud allegations could delay the outcome of the nation's most closely watched race until December.
[02:09:12.758 --> 02:09:18.164]  In the most populous county where the majority of votes are cast, that's where they've been having all the special problems.
[02:09:19.568 --> 02:09:24.751]  Polls and early voting suggest the race is in a dead heat.
[02:09:24.751 --> 02:09:26.212]  And this paper's pro-Democrat.
[02:09:26.212 --> 02:09:27.373]  That's not really true.
[02:09:27.373 --> 02:09:31.356]  And each side is preparing for a dragged-out battle.
[02:09:31.356 --> 02:09:38.601]  Republican lawyers have also laid the foundation for a fierce legal fight claiming voter fraud and intimidation in the final days of the race.
[02:09:39.417 --> 02:09:43.579]  Secretary of State Ross Miller said he was confident Nevada is hosting a fair election.
[02:09:43.579 --> 02:09:45.821]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:09:45.821 --> 02:09:54.165]  But the lead is so great for the Aqua Buddha, Rand Paul, that they're going to have trouble stealing it there.
[02:09:54.165 --> 02:09:58.888]  New polls are out showing that he's got, depending on the poll, a 9 to 15 point lead.
[02:10:04.864 --> 02:10:11.726]  His margin of victory in several of the polls is 55 to 40.
[02:10:11.726 --> 02:10:14.967]  Very, very exciting to see that happening.
[02:10:14.967 --> 02:10:31.651]  And again, the globalists are intelligent, they're smart, but they're also very arrogant and super hyper humorous filled, overconfident with bravado or machismo or chutzpah, arrogance, whatever you want to call it.
[02:10:31.651 --> 02:10:32.351]  And Bill Clinton,
[02:10:34.173 --> 02:10:38.996]  Every race he's gone to has been neck and neck.
[02:10:38.996 --> 02:10:51.003]  The governor's race in Florida, the Kentucky race, other races, and suddenly when he shows up, I know I've been talking about this a lot since last week, it's just amazing, when he shows up and campaigns for you,
[02:10:52.165 --> 02:10:55.447]  The person you're running against on average gets about 10 points just instantly.
[02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:57.528]  People are like, Bill Clinton the crook is here?
[02:10:57.528 --> 02:10:59.309]  Okay, that's it.
[02:10:59.309 --> 02:11:01.090]  So why is Bill Clinton doing this?
[02:11:01.090 --> 02:11:06.053]  Because he really thinks he can get up there and bamboozle people.
[02:11:06.053 --> 02:11:10.056]  He's a con man that doesn't know the con has been exposed.
[02:11:12.250 --> 02:11:22.037]  Okay, let's go back to some of your phone calls before I get into this really scary debtor prison news that's coming out and some of the scams that are being run to intimidate people.
[02:11:22.037 --> 02:11:24.759]  James in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:11:24.759 --> 02:11:25.680]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:26.541]  Good.
[02:11:26.541 --> 02:11:28.342]  Thank you for having me on the air, sir.
[02:11:28.342 --> 02:11:33.846]  I am just upset at how they can get away with touching people's genitals and getting away with it.
[02:11:33.846 --> 02:11:37.089]  When my girlfriend goes to work and her boss touches her genitals,
[02:11:37.853 --> 02:11:45.757]  Well James, I appreciate your call and this is a really good point you've made and I've intended to make a special video about it.
[02:11:45.757 --> 02:11:47.698]  This is psychological warfare.
[02:12:04.795 --> 02:12:12.201]  How can they give the troops DU munitions that they know are going to debilitate them and kill them down the road?
[02:12:12.201 --> 02:12:17.666]  How could they spray Agent Orange on the troops knowing it was going to kill them and debilitate them?
[02:12:17.666 --> 02:12:24.492]  How can the government give children in Guatemala shots saying they're vaccines filled with live syphilis?
[02:12:26.072 --> 02:12:37.974]  How could the UN, this year and last year, be caught in Asia, Africa, and Latin America giving children live, weaponized polio vaccines that maims and kills them?
[02:12:37.974 --> 02:12:40.134]  They just do it!
[02:12:40.134 --> 02:12:45.415]  The government's admittedly radiated 4,000 plus foster children in atomic experiments.
[02:12:45.415 --> 02:12:47.036]  Nobody got in trouble.
[02:12:47.036 --> 02:12:51.456]  The government sterilized 44% of Native American women on reservations in the 1970s.
[02:12:51.456 --> 02:12:52.557]  Declassified?
[02:12:52.557 --> 02:12:53.617]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:12:53.617 --> 02:12:54.397]  Who ran the program?
[02:12:55.202 --> 02:12:57.143]  George Herbert Walker Bush for Nixon.
[02:12:57.143 --> 02:12:59.984]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:12:59.984 --> 02:13:07.986]  They have set the precedent to have Marines get up on television and admit they're growing the opium and giving the Afghans the fertilizer.
[02:13:07.986 --> 02:13:11.688]  The CIA tells the Washington Post, yeah, we're releasing fake bin Laden videos.
[02:13:11.688 --> 02:13:12.428]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:13:13.803 --> 02:13:19.207]  They have the TSA radiating themselves and radiating those around them.
[02:13:19.207 --> 02:13:27.613]  But even if you're a frequent flyer, you're not getting as much radiation as the backscatter leaking out of those systems, the people sitting right next to them.
[02:13:27.613 --> 02:13:35.198]  You see the TSA guys leaning into the scanner, showing people what to do, and then standing right there as they're being scanned.
[02:13:36.866 --> 02:13:45.728]  Admitted cancer, New York Times, Reuters, LA Times, Top Scientist, 20 to 50 times the radiation, depending on the machine.
[02:13:45.728 --> 02:13:47.969]  One unit is 20 times what they said, the other 50.
[02:13:47.969 --> 02:13:53.790]  Now they have 500 mobile vans driving around, as reported by Forbes and Bloomberg.
[02:13:53.790 --> 02:14:01.612]  With no shielding, you've got people driving vans for homeland security, violating the Fourth Amendment, but that's a secondary issue, compared to
[02:14:02.472 --> 02:14:04.553]  No radiology rules.
[02:14:04.553 --> 02:14:06.493]  Oh, there are federal laws, they're just ignored.
[02:14:06.493 --> 02:14:14.675]  You got guys and women sitting there running these that are at least 10 times the power of a high-powered chest x-ray.
[02:14:14.675 --> 02:14:18.076]  They have all these new MRIs that are deadly, giving people cancer.
[02:14:18.076 --> 02:14:21.137]  They're so powerful it makes their hair fall out.
[02:14:21.137 --> 02:14:25.479]  What, that was in, what, NBC News just a month ago?
[02:14:25.479 --> 02:14:30.340]  In fact, search the term MRIs causing people's hair to fall out, MRIs causing cancer.
[02:14:33.496 --> 02:14:35.537]  The globalists just don't care.
[02:14:35.537 --> 02:14:36.357]  They're wild.
[02:14:36.357 --> 02:14:40.279]  They're setting the precedent to do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[02:14:40.279 --> 02:14:41.940]  Child porn laws, according to U.S.
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:46.002]  law, are violated by these naked body scanners, and they are saving the images.
[02:14:46.002 --> 02:14:47.322]  The same thing in the U.K.
[02:14:47.322 --> 02:14:50.564]  You can type in, body scanners violate child porn laws.
[02:14:50.564 --> 02:14:52.185]  You'll get stuff in the U.S.
[02:14:52.185 --> 02:14:55.046]  and England and Europe where they admit it violates the law.
[02:14:55.046 --> 02:14:55.826]  There's no waiver.
[02:14:55.826 --> 02:14:56.507]  There's no nothing.
[02:14:56.507 --> 02:14:57.967]  They just break the law.
[02:14:57.967 --> 02:15:01.589]  They're setting the precedent that they follow one set of rules, we follow another.
[02:15:02.827 --> 02:15:22.581]  There's one place where lawyers sued and they backed off, and that is the county that Denver is located in, and what, four months ago, because of lawsuits, they suspended anyone under 18 being naked body scanned, but they then do the molestation pat-down.
[02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:30.447]  Because they were sued, they pointed out, state law, federal law, this is child porn, it's illegal to take naked images of children, and they stopped under 18.
[02:15:33.789 --> 02:15:37.172]  And it has nothing to do with keeping you safe from terrorists.
[02:15:37.172 --> 02:15:42.637]  If the globalists can get away with this.
[02:15:42.637 --> 02:15:47.902]  Because just last week they announced we're going to do enhanced pat-downs now on people that refuse the body scanner.
[02:15:47.902 --> 02:15:49.384]  This week they said, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:49.384 --> 02:15:53.268]  We're going to pat down everyone now.
[02:15:53.268 --> 02:15:58.653]  See, it's first take your shoes off, take your belt off, answer questions, you can't have water, you can't
[02:16:01.138 --> 02:16:02.319]  There's the New York Times.
[02:16:02.319 --> 02:16:06.641]  After stroke scans, patients face serious health risk.
[02:16:06.641 --> 02:16:07.482]  New York Times.
[02:16:07.482 --> 02:16:14.126]  So much radiation, their hair falls out sometimes when they get up out of the MRI.
[02:16:14.126 --> 02:16:16.968]  I mean, that's radiation power!
[02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:20.670]  I mean, we're talking brain tumors the size of cantaloupes here.
[02:16:24.878 --> 02:16:26.599]  They just don't care.
[02:16:26.599 --> 02:16:28.699]  They just come out with MRIs.
[02:16:28.699 --> 02:16:31.840]  So powerful, they dwarf the stuff they had 10 years ago.
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:33.841]  They give the troops DU.
[02:16:33.841 --> 02:16:36.422]  They have feds driving around radiating themselves.
[02:16:36.422 --> 02:16:44.685]  I mean, it's one thing to be assaulted by something 10 times the power of a chest X-ray, violating your Fourth Amendment, right out of 1984, looking through your walls.
[02:16:44.685 --> 02:16:54.148]  And to have the media and the government admit it, and then point out there's no radiological laws being enforced, and the stupid technicians in there are killing themselves.
[02:16:56.325 --> 02:17:00.107]  When these people come down with cancers in a few years, there'll be class action suits.
[02:17:00.107 --> 02:17:01.168]  The government doesn't care.
[02:17:01.168 --> 02:17:05.810]  They'll just ratchet up the debt on the American people and pay off the suits and keep the radiation going.
[02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:08.091]  It's like Gardasil shots four years ago.
[02:17:08.091 --> 02:17:15.755]  In the trials, they had huge numbers of people that took the papillomavirus shot and it killed them.
[02:17:15.755 --> 02:17:19.017]  And then Perry comes out, the governor, and says, you must take it.
[02:17:19.017 --> 02:17:19.998]  And that was a hoax.
[02:17:24.741 --> 02:17:28.544]  They're setting the precedent where they can just do crazy stuff.
[02:17:28.544 --> 02:17:32.806]  People thought I was joking when I showed you the executive order that anybody could check out in the late 1990s.
[02:17:32.806 --> 02:17:37.309]  It's in my first film made 13 years ago, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:41.392]  I hold up the executive order at the DMV where they were coming in with a national ID card.
[02:17:41.392 --> 02:17:42.773]  They didn't start that two years ago.
[02:17:42.773 --> 02:17:45.155]  We already had standardization back in the late 90s.
[02:17:45.155 --> 02:17:51.839]  And it's on federal law books under executive order that they can take urine or blood at the DMVs.
[02:17:51.839 --> 02:17:54.621]  Why do you think they've got federal grants to take blood at checkpoints?
[02:17:55.141 --> 02:17:55.801]  Who's up next here?
[02:17:55.801 --> 02:18:00.382]  James in Arizona got about a minute and a half.
[02:18:00.382 --> 02:18:02.303]  Brother, what's on your mind?
[02:18:24.127 --> 02:18:25.168]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[02:18:25.168 --> 02:18:25.469]  Good.
[02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:26.891]  First time call for me.
[02:18:26.891 --> 02:18:31.436]  I just basically wanted to tell you, I'm sure you've heard of the Call of Duty game before, right?
[02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:34.660]  That big Call of Duty game, Call of Duty 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and all those games?
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:34.881]  Yes.
[02:18:37.133 --> 02:18:41.974]  Call of Duty Black Ops comes out on 11-9-2010.
[02:18:41.974 --> 02:18:43.155]  Reverse the numbers.
[02:18:43.155 --> 02:18:50.517]  They're telling us, the video game culture is already telling us and glorifying that Black Ops is... They have video games now.
[02:18:50.517 --> 02:18:51.197]  Which one is it, Matt?
[02:18:51.197 --> 02:18:55.599]  We have a story on where you stage terror attacks and blame it on people?
[02:18:55.599 --> 02:18:57.059]  Yeah, that was the last Call of Duty.
[02:18:57.059 --> 02:18:57.719]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:57.719 --> 02:18:58.499]  Call of Duty.
[02:18:58.499 --> 02:19:03.401]  This Call of Duty is coming out on 11-9-2010 and the game is called Call of Duty Black Ops.
[02:19:04.036 --> 02:19:09.699]  So they're actually saying 9-11 is an inside job by the fact that it's coming out on 11-9 2010.
[02:19:09.699 --> 02:19:11.139]  Check it out.
[02:19:11.139 --> 02:19:17.803]  Listen, you play the game and you go in airports and shoot people and blame it on somebody else.
[02:19:17.803 --> 02:19:21.585]  Right, but the game always comes out on Veterans Day, 11-11.
[02:19:21.585 --> 02:19:24.286]  Every year, Call of Duty comes out on 11-11.
[02:19:24.286 --> 02:19:28.068]  This year, they pushed it back two days.
[02:19:28.068 --> 02:19:28.548]  Amazing.
[02:19:29.673 --> 02:19:30.314]  Just letting you know.
[02:19:30.314 --> 02:19:30.974]  I thought I'd call you.
[02:19:30.974 --> 02:19:31.995]  First time caller.
[02:19:31.995 --> 02:19:32.836]  I love the work you're doing.
[02:19:32.836 --> 02:19:33.876]  I used to be a needle con.
[02:19:33.876 --> 02:19:35.097]  You woke me up.
[02:19:35.097 --> 02:19:36.559]  I used to be a big Bush supporter.
[02:19:36.559 --> 02:19:38.100]  I'm an Iraq war veteran.
[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:44.185]  And now I know all about the New World Order and I realize the damage that's been done and I really appreciate waking me up and waking up my family.
[02:19:44.185 --> 02:19:45.686]  What about the other vets around you?
[02:19:45.686 --> 02:19:47.567]  Are they starting to wake up, James?
[02:19:47.567 --> 02:19:49.109]  You're damn right they are.
[02:19:49.109 --> 02:19:54.513]  And that's why Homeland Security, that's why Homeland Security says you're the number one threat.
[02:19:54.513 --> 02:19:57.675]  You're trained, you're armed, you're smart, and you know the truth.
[02:19:57.675 --> 02:19:58.236]  God bless you.
[02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:06.436]  What if a natural or man-made disaster forced you to flee your house at a moment's notice?
[02:20:06.436 --> 02:20:08.098]  Are you prepared to grab and go?
[02:20:08.098 --> 02:20:14.362]  You will be with MyEvacPak, the ultimate survival kit for emergency evacuations, and we mean ultimate.
[02:20:14.362 --> 02:20:21.848]  MyEvacPak is an easy-to-carry backpack with 44 essential food servings and dozens of indispensable get-out-of-town supplies.
[02:20:21.848 --> 02:20:25.511]  MyEvacPak comes in two sizes, a backpack or a rolling duffel bag.
[02:20:25.771 --> 02:20:35.097]  Both are packed with great tasting, nutritionally dense, long shelf life food, plus all kinds of tools and supplies to help you and your family survive just about any kind of survival situation.

[02:20:39.881 --> 02:20:44.784]  Spelled M-Y-E-V-A-C-P-A-C-K dot com.
[02:20:44.784 --> 02:20:45.945]  MyEvacPack.com
[02:20:46.485 --> 02:20:47.125]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:47.125 --> 02:20:47.405]  That's 1-877-327-0365.
[02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:50.527]  Get my EVAC Pack today, because you can't predict when or where an emergency will strike.
[02:21:00.799 --> 02:21:05.763]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:05.763 --> 02:21:06.763]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.763 --> 02:21:09.205]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:09.205 --> 02:21:10.226]  A republic.
[02:21:10.226 --> 02:21:12.868]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:12.868 --> 02:21:15.130]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:17.151]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:17.151 --> 02:21:18.852]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:18.852 --> 02:21:20.153]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:20.153 --> 02:21:20.774]  Children?
[02:21:20.774 --> 02:21:21.895]  Our education?
[02:21:21.895 --> 02:21:22.735]  Our money?
[02:21:22.735 --> 02:21:26.378]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:26.738 --> 02:21:30.423]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:30.423 --> 02:21:31.705]  You are being warned.
[02:21:31.705 --> 02:21:32.726]  We have the facts.
[02:21:32.726 --> 02:21:33.888]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:33.888 --> 02:21:34.789]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:34.789 --> 02:21:35.690]  We have common law.
[02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:38.214]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:38.214 --> 02:21:41.158]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:21:41.158 --> 02:21:41.979]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:42.079 --> 02:21:47.044]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:47.044 --> 02:21:48.546]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:48.546 --> 02:21:49.627]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:49.627 --> 02:21:56.514]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:02.681]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.681 --> 02:22:03.121]  November 1st, 2010.
[02:22:03.121 --> 02:22:03.962]  Gold opened this morning at $1359.50.
[02:22:03.962 --> 02:22:07.386]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1394.85, $697.43 for a half ounce, or $348.71 for a quarter ounce.
[02:22:07.386 --> 02:22:07.866]  That's $1349.85, $697.43, or $348.71.
[02:22:20.197 --> 02:22:24.022]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[02:22:24.022 --> 02:22:25.184]  debt crises.
[02:22:25.184 --> 02:22:27.347]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[02:22:27.347 --> 02:22:29.770]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[02:22:29.770 --> 02:22:34.797]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[02:22:35.117 --> 02:22:36.118]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:36.118 --> 02:22:42.061]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:22:42.061 --> 02:22:48.224]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[02:22:48.224 --> 02:22:48.904]  Call today at 800-686-2237.

[02:22:51.405 --> 02:22:51.606]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:02.108 --> 02:23:03.869]  What is a wind generator?
[02:23:03.869 --> 02:23:06.271]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[02:23:06.271 --> 02:23:09.633]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[02:23:09.633 --> 02:23:11.574]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?
[02:23:12.298 --> 02:23:16.200]  For answers to questions about wind power, visit windbluepower.com.
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:19.222]  Did you know the wind could provide your family with emergency power?

[02:23:53.525 --> 02:23:53.885]  That's 800-976-0026.
[02:24:10.452 --> 02:24:14.956]  Alright, we'll jam in more of your great calls interspersed with Tarpley coming up.
[02:24:14.956 --> 02:24:26.025]  I want to get his take on the elections, on the October surprise, and the ongoing October surprises with bombings going on in Greece and other places in Europe right now.
[02:24:26.025 --> 02:24:38.135]  I meant to spend more time on this because it's such a key area, not just of debtor prisons and what the IMF and World Bank are setting up, not just here in the US but all over the planet,
[02:24:39.281 --> 02:24:43.602]  But how this is all done, color of law.
[02:24:43.602 --> 02:24:48.244]  And I saw this seven, eight years ago in Austin.
[02:24:48.244 --> 02:24:55.166]  They set up in portable buildings, quote, court hearings with real judges, but there weren't summons, there weren't real tickets.
[02:24:55.166 --> 02:25:03.008]  They would call the kids in with their parents and threaten them to sign, defer to judification, basically going on probation for being late to class one time.
[02:25:03.008 --> 02:25:07.109]  And then the next time they were late to class, then they would go on probation and actually go to jail.
[02:25:08.704 --> 02:25:10.186]  And we've got a news report here.
[02:25:10.186 --> 02:25:24.981]  We won't play the whole thing, but it's linked up on Infowars.com out of Pittsburgh, ABC Channel 4, WTAE, Erie PA, headline, debt collectors accused of fake courtroom, fake judge.
[02:25:24.981 --> 02:25:29.786]  Attorney General sues Unicredit in Erie and
[02:25:31.752 --> 02:25:38.435]  It's just like Army and Navy recruiters and Marine Corps recruiters have been taped in Denver, Colorado, Houston, Texas, other places.
[02:25:38.435 --> 02:25:42.776]  You know, the parents will tape it, calling up the 16-year-old going, it is the law.
[02:25:42.776 --> 02:25:47.018]  You will be arrested if you don't sign paperwork now to join the military.
[02:25:47.018 --> 02:25:48.898]  You told me you were going to do it.
[02:25:48.898 --> 02:25:49.739]  It's the law.
[02:25:49.739 --> 02:25:50.779]  You'll be arrested.
[02:25:50.779 --> 02:25:52.020]  What happened to those recruiters?
[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:52.800]  They got promoted.
[02:25:54.778 --> 02:25:55.599]  It's the same thing.
[02:25:55.599 --> 02:25:57.361]  It is the law.
[02:25:57.361 --> 02:26:01.626]  You will come right now down here to this court.
[02:26:01.626 --> 02:26:03.288]  This is your ticket and your summons.
[02:26:03.288 --> 02:26:05.330]  You owe us $500.
[02:26:05.330 --> 02:26:07.913]  Credit card companies, you name it.
[02:26:07.913 --> 02:26:12.158]  And I saw a story a few months ago out of the Star Tribune, in jail for being in debt.
[02:26:14.687 --> 02:26:17.589]  You've committed no crime, but an officer is knocking on your door.
[02:26:17.589 --> 02:26:21.652]  More Minnesotans are surprised to find themselves being locked up.
[02:26:21.652 --> 02:26:23.634]  And it talks about debts in here of less than $100.
[02:26:23.634 --> 02:26:38.525]  And what happens is, the judge, extrajudicially, with no authority, orders you to pay a private sum, and then they get you for contempt if you don't.
[02:26:38.525 --> 02:26:40.166]  Or in other cases, they just arrest you.
[02:26:41.246 --> 02:26:52.850]  As the sheriff deputy dumped the contents of Joy Humeyer's purse into the sealed bag, she begged to know why she'd just been arrested while driving home from Richfield after an Easter visit with her elderly mother.
[02:26:52.850 --> 02:26:55.471]  No one had an answer.
[02:26:55.471 --> 02:27:01.713]  She spent a sleepless night in the Anacoa County holding cell, her hands tucked under her armpits for warmth.
[02:27:02.438 --> 02:27:06.261]  Then handcuffed in a squad car, she was taken to downtown Minneapolis for booking.
[02:27:06.261 --> 02:27:13.868]  Finally, after the 16 hours in limbo, jail officials fingerprinted her and explained her offense, missing a court hearing over an unpaid debt.
[02:27:13.868 --> 02:27:17.771]  They have no right to do this to me, she said, the 57-year-old.
[02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:20.013]  Not for a stupid credit card.
[02:27:20.013 --> 02:27:20.133]  Now,
[02:27:21.229 --> 02:27:27.853]  Now they're just going to completely fake courts and fake letters in the mail, kind of like the fake census forms.
[02:27:27.853 --> 02:27:32.376]  Oh, the government's sending it, but it says what type of toilet, how much money you got in the bank.
[02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:34.138]  They can't answer those questions.
[02:27:34.138 --> 02:27:35.078]  They can't ask those.
[02:27:35.078 --> 02:27:37.380]  That's a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:42.383]  They can only ask how many people live here for congressional apportionment for your state.
[02:27:42.383 --> 02:27:45.145]  Here's the intro to this newscast, in case you're doubting me.
[02:27:45.145 --> 02:27:47.346]  Fake courts, fake judges.
[02:27:47.346 --> 02:27:48.747]  This is the new world order.
[02:27:48.747 --> 02:27:50.769]  It's all using people's ignorance.
[02:27:51.449 --> 02:27:54.990]  But once you're not ignorant, once you have the truth, it will set you free.
[02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.891]  Here it is.
[02:27:55.891 --> 02:27:59.072]  Right now at 5.30, debt collectors really getting dirty.
[02:27:59.072 --> 02:27:59.432]  That's right.
[02:27:59.432 --> 02:28:03.193]  We are talking about fake deputies, handing out fake subpoenas, and that's not all.
[02:28:03.193 --> 02:28:03.873]  Yeah, listen to this.
[02:28:03.873 --> 02:28:07.435]  They're even setting up fake courts with fake judges.
[02:28:07.435 --> 02:28:08.415]  It is wild.
[02:28:08.415 --> 02:28:11.076]  Team 4 investigator Jim Parsons with what he has uncovered.
[02:28:11.738 --> 02:28:17.265]  The sign out in front of this building in Erie tells visitors they're at the Unicredit Debt Resolution Center.
[02:28:17.265 --> 02:28:26.377]  But once they got inside, according to a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General's office, they were fooled into believing that they were in a real courtroom with a real judge dressed in black.
[02:28:26.377 --> 02:28:28.901]  But the suit says the whole thing was nothing but a fake.
[02:28:30.638 --> 02:28:38.062]  Unicredit America is accused of deceiving, misleading, and coercing hundreds of consumers into paying off their debts.
[02:28:38.062 --> 02:28:43.064]  Inside the building is a pair of locked oak doors with brass handles resembling a courtroom entry.
[02:28:43.064 --> 02:28:44.004]  Alright, let's stop there.
[02:28:44.004 --> 02:28:45.765]  Let's stop there.
[02:28:45.765 --> 02:28:53.129]  Again, we've got this article and video up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but this is what the World Trade Organization is.
[02:28:53.129 --> 02:28:59.792]  Set up in 95, completely private, our Congress signed almost all of its trade authority over to them.
[02:29:00.663 --> 02:29:08.106]  They're announcing a new world government run by the big mega six banks with their new digital currency that all of our currencies will be based in.
[02:29:08.106 --> 02:29:10.407]  We will pay them taxes.
[02:29:10.407 --> 02:29:26.335]  And in an article by Kurt Nemo, IMF tax tribunals coming to America, they're already in Spain, Greece, Portugal, and other areas, the IMF is calling for new authorities to privately come take your money, to come take tax money to pay it to them.
[02:29:27.807 --> 02:29:30.048]  They're calling for debtor prisons.
[02:29:30.048 --> 02:29:32.929]  They're calling for setting up extensive spy networks.
[02:29:32.929 --> 02:29:40.411]  And they're basically saying our government signed agreements with the World Trade Organization with them to allow them to come here and do this.
[02:29:40.411 --> 02:29:42.611]  What do you think the mercenaries are all about?
[02:29:42.611 --> 02:29:45.092]  What do you think this whole police state's about?
[02:29:45.092 --> 02:29:46.372]  It's not for Al Qaeda.
[02:29:46.372 --> 02:29:48.213]  It's to rob you blind.
[02:29:48.213 --> 02:29:49.713]  It's to complete the fraud.

[02:31:13.002 --> 02:31:14.463]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[02:31:38.646 --> 02:31:39.867]  Others don't.
[02:31:39.867 --> 02:31:42.008]  We turn jeans inside out.

[02:31:58.394 --> 02:31:59.195]  Others don't.
[02:32:00.421 --> 02:32:04.964]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.964 --> 02:32:05.865]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.865 --> 02:32:09.308]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.308 --> 02:32:10.168]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.168 --> 02:32:15.052]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.052 --> 02:32:15.792]  It's true.
[02:32:15.792 --> 02:32:20.676]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.676 --> 02:32:21.497]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.497 --> 02:32:25.079]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.079 --> 02:32:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.982 --> 02:32:29.783]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.783 --> 02:32:32.545]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.545 --> 02:32:36.229]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.229 --> 02:32:37.010]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.010 --> 02:32:41.153]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.153 --> 02:32:45.918]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.198 --> 02:32:50.379]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:33:20.472 --> 02:33:21.953]  We are back live.
[02:33:21.953 --> 02:33:25.875]  Got about 27 minutes left in global transmission today.
[02:33:25.875 --> 02:33:37.162]  We're going to Webster Griffin Tarpley here in just a moment on the latest staged October Surprise event and what that means for the establishment and the fact that it's come out that it's basically staged.
[02:33:37.822 --> 02:33:38.403]  I don't know.
[02:34:02.688 --> 02:34:04.868]  I have seen the DVD.
[02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:07.349]  It is off-the-charts powerful.
[02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:12.650]  I know a lot about farming, a lot about ranching, a lot about farming in the city.
[02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:16.290]  You know, not as much as an old-time farmer, but more than most.
[02:34:16.290 --> 02:34:18.891]  And I know what's high quality.
[02:34:18.891 --> 02:34:26.572]  And this is a simple DVD on rabbits, chickens, the best crops to grow in your backyard, or small farms.
[02:34:26.572 --> 02:34:28.112]  It's so much information for $24.95.
[02:34:28.112 --> 02:34:28.532]  Very well produced.

[02:34:46.661 --> 02:34:52.784]  Everything you need to know for composting, to water collection, from canning to butchering.
[02:34:52.784 --> 02:35:01.588]  The folks at Food Production Systems have put together an amazing DVD resource that allows you to build a food production machine out of a small space in an urban environment.
[02:35:02.228 --> 02:35:08.051]  Or if you've got some farmland, it's a lot of tricks that even farmers and people I know weren't aware of.
[02:35:08.051 --> 02:35:09.652]  Amazing DVD.
[02:35:09.652 --> 02:35:12.794]  Backyardfoodproduction.com.

[02:35:21.218 --> 02:35:21.758]  Great DVD.
[02:35:23.114 --> 02:35:30.700]  In fact, it's so good, I called him last week and I said, we want you as a sponsor since you contacted us, but we also want to carry this.
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:34.283]  So we're also going to be carrying it on the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:34.283 --> 02:35:35.264]  It's not there yet.

[02:35:37.523 --> 02:35:37.623]  It's

[02:36:09.193 --> 02:36:10.995]  You heard Mike Adams just rave about it.
[02:36:11.736 --> 02:36:11.936]  No, it's
[02:36:29.454 --> 02:36:39.800]  When you visit all the other sponsors that are on InfoWars.com and our local AM and FM affiliate local sponsors, be sure and support those folks with all the great stations that are picking up the show.

[02:36:43.222 --> 02:36:47.745]  The best stuff I see, I pick it up and we carry it at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:47.745 --> 02:36:49.426]  And a lot of you have noticed,
[02:36:54.989 --> 02:36:57.510]  And we're getting a lot of new members as people are responding.
[02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:59.530]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:59.530 --> 02:37:03.451]  We're adding new exclusive interviews that we fly around the country and get.
[02:37:03.451 --> 02:37:08.852]  We've got a new Willie Nelson interview, Jesse Ventura never before seen, Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[02:37:08.852 --> 02:37:11.993]  The list just goes on and on and on.
[02:37:11.993 --> 02:37:14.634]  There's a new report out by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:37:14.634 --> 02:37:19.195]  Did Obama order British authorities to find non-existent ink bomb?
[02:37:20.436 --> 02:37:22.059]  Uh, and local news is reporting that.
[02:37:22.059 --> 02:37:28.870]  The police tested it, said it's not a bomb, and Obama went and gave a speech and said it was, and called them, and they said, okay, yes it is.
[02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:29.351]  I mean, we've...
[02:37:30.376 --> 02:37:33.198]  Webster Tarpley is a doctor of history.
[02:37:33.198 --> 02:37:41.525]  He also is an economist, wrote the definitive works on Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, and another research book on the subject.
[02:37:41.525 --> 02:37:44.828]  He wrote the Unauthorized Biography of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:37:44.828 --> 02:37:49.311]  So much of what he's covered now is even on BBC News, The Nazi Connection, and the rest of it.
[02:37:49.311 --> 02:37:53.235]  And Webster really is no stranger to this radio broadcast.
[02:37:54.417 --> 02:38:22.245]  But Webster, the fact that it's so transparent October Surprise, the fact that it's admitted that Anwar al-Awlaki works for the CIA and is at the Pentagon when he's, you know, the most wanted, the fact that the underwear bombing that the government got him on the plane, and even the State Department admits it, the fact that he ran Major Hassan, the fact that in the last month I've had you on several times to talk about an October Surprise, to talk about Anwar al-Awlaki, and now they're saying he's behind the dreaded cartridge bomb.
[02:38:23.045 --> 02:38:26.928]  Uh, and obviously the neocons, they get to expand their wars, go into Yemen.
[02:38:26.928 --> 02:38:38.357]  It's not just the puppet Obama that gets power out of this, but why is Robert Shapiro, and now Republicans are in the news telling, in the Wall Street Journal and other places, telling Obama, attack Iran, it'll help the economy.
[02:38:38.357 --> 02:38:39.057]  I mean...
[02:38:39.858 --> 02:38:45.642]  They're so transparent, it's like psychopaths or criminals who want to be caught or love to brag.
[02:38:45.642 --> 02:38:50.165]  Put on your historian hat, your economist hat, the psychology you've studied.
[02:38:50.165 --> 02:38:53.187]  You're one of the most brilliant people we interview, and I really mean that.
[02:38:53.187 --> 02:38:55.129]  I don't just give out accolades.
[02:38:55.129 --> 02:38:58.251]  But it seems like the elite is beginning to go crazy.
[02:38:58.251 --> 02:39:06.356]  Bill Clinton is so unpopular, every state he goes to to campaign for Democrats, the competition gets an almost ten-point lead immediately.
[02:39:07.737 --> 02:39:09.479]  You always talk about them being inept.
[02:39:09.479 --> 02:39:11.782]  I mean, they do control, manipulate things.
[02:39:11.782 --> 02:39:14.885]  And through their largesse in power, they're able to get it done.
[02:39:14.885 --> 02:39:18.769]  But I do more and more agree with you that they are a bunch of buffoons.
[02:39:18.769 --> 02:39:21.212]  I mean, they've got the power, but they're a bunch of lunatics.
[02:39:21.212 --> 02:39:25.357]  I mean, don't they know the whole world is seeing through this latest October surprise?
[02:39:26.186 --> 02:39:48.013]  Well, you certainly have a crisis of the Anglo-American ruling class, right, of the gaggle of financiers and bankers in Wall Street and the City of London who consider themselves the masters of human destiny, and very often, not always, but at least quite often, get their way, although maybe increasingly more recently they haven't been getting their way.
[02:39:48.013 --> 02:39:50.894]  They may not know what to do next.
[02:39:50.894 --> 02:39:52.515]  They may not know what gambit
[02:39:53.075 --> 02:39:56.396]  They want to put in, do they want to try to push the currency war further?
[02:39:56.396 --> 02:39:59.197]  Do they want to go for false flag terrorism?
[02:39:59.197 --> 02:40:06.019]  Do they want to make it an international war or more of a domestic police state?
[02:40:06.019 --> 02:40:08.300]  I think this is all up in the air.
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:15.543]  October Surprise, I guess, would no longer mean something that's focused on the election, because I don't think that's the focal point.
[02:40:15.543 --> 02:40:16.623]  It's got to do with something
[02:40:17.103 --> 02:40:18.044]  Bigger.
[02:40:18.044 --> 02:40:21.066]  What I would say is there's a pattern of things going on, right?
[02:40:21.066 --> 02:40:26.769]  Here in Washington, in the last couple of days, we've had a number of incidents of shootings, right?
[02:40:26.769 --> 02:40:35.115]  A couple of bullets fired into the Pentagon, a couple of bullets fired at different locations here in the metropolitan area around Washington.
[02:40:35.115 --> 02:40:37.797]  So you're not exactly at the D.C.
[02:40:37.797 --> 02:40:39.818]  sniper level of October of 2002, but you're
[02:40:43.917 --> 02:40:46.640]  Quite possibly getting there, so there's that.
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:49.283]  And then we had another one of these cases, right?
[02:40:49.283 --> 02:41:02.339]  Another mental deficient, a mental incompetent, who had been approached by an FBI agent, fast-talking agent provocateur, who convinced him that the thing to do was to begin to case
[02:41:02.979 --> 02:41:07.003]  The Arlington, Virginia Courthouse subway station, right?
[02:41:07.003 --> 02:41:10.966]  Arlington Courthouse Metro Stop and three other stations.
[02:41:10.966 --> 02:41:14.750]  And that guy has now been rounded up just in the last couple of days.
[02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:20.595]  And of course it turns out that he never had any ability or wherewithal to do any of these things.
[02:41:20.595 --> 02:41:21.856]  He was never in touch with
[02:41:22.496 --> 02:41:23.677]  Any real entity.
[02:41:23.677 --> 02:41:26.700]  He was in touch, really, with the FBI, right?
[02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:31.624]  And then, of course, we get Al-Laki, the CIA lackey, into the picture as needed.
[02:41:31.624 --> 02:41:50.359]  So, if you put together the bullets in the Washington area, the scare around the supposed bombing of a couple of, well, actually four, subway stops that were allegedly being studied, and then we have this drama of the air-expressed packages from
[02:41:51.306 --> 02:42:04.742]  From Yemen, it would seem to point towards something else happening, and I'm not exactly certain what that is, but if you go back and look at, for example, take a look at my book, George Bush, The Unauthorized Biography.
[02:42:04.742 --> 02:42:08.927]  A couple of days before the Hinkley-Reagan show,
[02:42:11.598 --> 02:42:12.298]  We're good to go.
[02:42:33.627 --> 02:42:38.590]  We seem to be getting the sorts of incidents that may be harbingers of something.
[02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:41.211]  And what that is, is hard to say.
[02:42:41.211 --> 02:42:51.236]  It may be an attempt to force Obama to overcome his normal policy of appeasement, but appeasement meaning
[02:42:51.916 --> 02:42:55.678]  It's time to get other countries fighting among themselves because the U.S.
[02:42:55.678 --> 02:42:59.300]  is too weak and too exhausted and too over-stretched to do it.
[02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:06.424]  That is, you know, get Colombia fighting Venezuela or get Saudi Arabia fighting Iran or something like this.
[02:43:08.482 --> 02:43:13.667]  But Obama, there may be an attempt to push him now in the direction demanded by the neocon.
[02:43:13.667 --> 02:43:15.669]  This is all highly speculative, though.
[02:43:15.669 --> 02:43:17.571]  I really wouldn't know where to begin with this.
[02:43:17.571 --> 02:43:21.174]  Concerning Yemen, I think this ought to be quite clear.
[02:43:21.174 --> 02:43:22.175]  The U.S.
[02:43:22.175 --> 02:43:26.079]  modus operandi is if you want to attack a country, you've got to plant
[02:43:26.759 --> 02:43:27.699]  Al-Qaeda in it.
[02:43:27.699 --> 02:43:30.100]  There's got to be something there that calls itself Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:31.980]  Best example, Iraq.
[02:43:31.980 --> 02:43:33.761]  There was no Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:33.761 --> 02:43:34.741]  The U.S.
[02:43:34.741 --> 02:43:44.464]  went to this Ansar enclave, an anti-Saddam Hussein enclave, and found this guy Zarqawi and made him into the head of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[02:43:44.464 --> 02:43:49.285]  And just at the point when the BBC was saying, maybe there is no bin Laden, maybe this is all a myth.
[02:43:49.845 --> 02:43:56.190]  Out comes al-Qa'i saying, I love bin Laden, I pledge eternal loyalty to bin Laden, and so forth.
[02:43:56.190 --> 02:43:59.012]  And then you can conduct your operations in Iraq.
[02:43:59.012 --> 02:44:00.453]  You can have a large war.
[02:44:00.453 --> 02:44:01.854]  Similarly, in the Maghreb, right?
[02:44:01.854 --> 02:44:04.676]  Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia.
[02:44:04.676 --> 02:44:05.136]  The U.S.
[02:44:05.136 --> 02:44:08.518]  wants to pay attention to Algeria, right?
[02:44:08.518 --> 02:44:09.459]  Put pressure on them.
[02:44:09.459 --> 02:44:11.981]  They're a major oil producer, so they take
[02:44:12.501 --> 02:44:27.275]  People left over from the G.I.A., the Group Islamique Armée, who had been doing terror activities in the 90s, you recycle them and create a new organization now calling itself Al-Qaeda of the Maghreb.
[02:44:27.275 --> 02:44:30.358]  And then finally for Yemen, you look at the map, right?
[02:44:30.358 --> 02:44:35.062]  Yemen, it's down at the bottom of Saudi Arabia, and that port, Aden,
[02:44:36.025 --> 02:44:37.626]  Is right there.
[02:44:37.626 --> 02:44:42.929]  If you had a naval base in Aden, you'd be in a good position to control the exit from the Red Sea.
[02:44:42.929 --> 02:44:48.712]  In other words, all the traffic from the Suez Canal that's going into the Indian Ocean has to go right by Yemen.
[02:44:48.712 --> 02:44:54.655]  Plus, all the oil tankers that are going from Sudan, which is a country that's targeted, right?
[02:44:54.655 --> 02:44:55.015]  The U.S.
[02:44:55.015 --> 02:44:59.358]  would like to split Sudan into two parts and have a civil war.
[02:44:59.358 --> 02:45:03.240]  The oil goes from Sudan to China, and it has to go right by
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:06.002]  By Aden, by Yemen.
[02:45:06.002 --> 02:45:08.404]  Now in Yemen you have the following situation.
[02:45:08.404 --> 02:45:11.887]  The government of Yemen is supported by Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:11.887 --> 02:45:16.251]  There are rebels in the northern part of the country who are supported by Iran.
[02:45:16.251 --> 02:45:20.995]  So it's a beautiful opportunity to play Saudi Arabia against Iran.
[02:45:20.995 --> 02:45:25.179]  But in order to be a player you've got to have a chess piece on the board.
[02:45:25.179 --> 02:45:26.240]  So what did they do?
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:27.861]  This was amazing how they did it.
[02:45:27.861 --> 02:45:30.844]  They freed a couple of inmates from Guantanamo.
[02:45:31.653 --> 02:45:41.600]  And freed them into Yemen, with obviously very clear idea that they would then immediately declare themselves Al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula.
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:42.541]  And so it was.
[02:45:42.541 --> 02:45:45.623]  And now there's the Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
[02:45:45.623 --> 02:45:52.308]  And then, before too long, al-Laki, the CIA lackey, comes along, this discredited, notorious
[02:45:52.928 --> 02:45:57.851]  Double agent, agent provocateur, who has been involved in just about everything, right?
[02:45:57.851 --> 02:46:05.556]  From 9-11 on down, through Hassan, and Ford Hood, and Mutalab, and everybody else.
[02:46:05.556 --> 02:46:07.757]  If you have a terrorist and you want to sheep-dip him,
[02:46:08.537 --> 02:46:22.028]  If you have a dupe, right, you have some patsy that you want to validate as somebody who's in touch with al-Qaeda, you just have them exchange a few emails with al-Lakhi, the CIA lackey, and lo and behold, you have another tentacle of al-Qaeda.
[02:46:22.028 --> 02:46:25.170]  Now, as you say, this game is getting very old.
[02:46:25.170 --> 02:46:28.633]  It's a very transparent, discredited game.
[02:46:28.633 --> 02:46:32.256]  I guess one of the big problems is there's no large political force.
[02:46:32.256 --> 02:46:34.418]  There's nobody, in terms of a political
[02:46:35.957 --> 02:46:39.838]  There's nobody in Congress who's willing to say the obvious things, right?
[02:46:39.838 --> 02:46:46.960]  That this stuff is manufactured, that it's fake, that it's hokum, and that it's tremendously dangerous for the future of the United States.
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.241]  Because you don't want to get involved in these lunatic foreign wars.
[02:46:50.241 --> 02:46:56.062]  And a war with Iraq would be a tragedy beyond the belief, I think, of most people today.
[02:46:56.062 --> 02:46:58.363]  So that may be where we are.
[02:46:58.363 --> 02:47:02.464]  I don't have any certainties, but it's an ominous pattern that I detect.
[02:47:03.544 --> 02:47:09.746]  Well, let's expand on that because yesterday on the Sunday broadcast from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:47:09.746 --> 02:47:14.047]  I said my gut showed that these were trial balloons.
[02:47:14.047 --> 02:47:21.389]  Test, and I said this Friday as well, to see if the public will buy into a bigger staged event.
[02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:23.489]  Will it boost support for the war?
[02:47:23.489 --> 02:47:26.790]  Will it boost support for the puppet Obama?
[02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:29.311]  Or will it boost support for neocons?
[02:47:29.311 --> 02:47:30.331]  That it's a gauging.
[02:47:30.771 --> 02:47:35.594]  Plus, they're using such moronic patsies that they can't ever properly carry it out.
[02:47:35.594 --> 02:47:42.198]  And if it is not a casualty-causing event, then you can sweep it under the rug.
[02:47:42.198 --> 02:47:47.022]  It can just be basically a throwaway to distract people from what's happening politically.
[02:47:47.862 --> 02:48:08.093]  But then we have the classic communist brigades, leftist brigades, that are admittedly, according to the declassified documents, the Italian former president and BBC and Reuters and the former head of intelligence saying, yes, the Bologna bombing of 1980 was staged by the NATO Western networks to be blamed.
[02:48:09.133 --> 02:48:09.493]  All right.
[02:48:28.026 --> 02:48:34.191]  So we have that going on, being mailed to the Mexican Embassy, blowing a lady's hands off, basically.
[02:48:34.191 --> 02:48:46.842]  I mean, suddenly we see all this activity going on, and overall I also see it as a distraction for the Christian Science Monitor and others announcing the world government's here, the SDRs are here.
[02:48:46.842 --> 02:48:49.304]  There's a lot of other movements going on right now, Webster.
[02:48:50.273 --> 02:48:50.773]  It's possible.
[02:48:50.773 --> 02:49:01.481]  There's also the idea that you will have now an increased role for the Republican Party in the House of Representatives and maybe elsewhere in the government.
[02:49:01.481 --> 02:49:15.372]  And if you recall, when you have changes in government, there's often an attempt to reassert the validity of the fake, phony global war on terror paradigm so that you force any
[02:49:17.825 --> 02:49:25.253]  Political element that might not be as enthusiastic or as hysterical as you want them to be, you force them to do that.
[02:49:25.253 --> 02:49:36.385]  In other words, if you have, you know, you're going to have Speaker John Boehner, so he's got to toe the line and you've got to remind him, right, that this is the world you're going to be in and you better vote those appropriations.
[02:49:36.425 --> 02:49:42.486]  The Pentagon doesn't really have the Russians anymore, so it's these foggy, shadowy guys with turbans on their head.
[02:49:42.486 --> 02:49:55.489]  We have to now re-indoctrinate the public and the new Congress of the national religion of beating our breasts and hyperventilating in fear of the vicious, horrible Ilockees who live in caves when they're not at the Pentagon.
[02:49:55.489 --> 02:49:55.749]  Right.
[02:49:55.749 --> 02:49:57.070]  Be very afraid.
[02:49:57.070 --> 02:49:59.410]  I guess that's the bottom line.
[02:49:59.410 --> 02:50:03.611]  And if you're a newly elected Republican, then you better remind yourself that
[02:50:04.324 --> 02:50:08.647]  The foreign policy establishment has this huge neocon element.
[02:50:08.647 --> 02:50:17.693]  It's either going to be Brzezinski and his group, or the neocons and their group, and between them, they're bellicose in different ways.
[02:50:17.693 --> 02:50:21.956]  The neocons, they may see that this is part of their comeback, right?
[02:50:21.956 --> 02:50:28.220]  It may be beginning to set the stage for General Petraeus to come in as the man on horseback.
[02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:30.962]  Oh, to save us from the al-Qaeda bombs?
[02:50:30.962 --> 02:50:31.662]  Something like this.
[02:50:33.343 --> 02:50:35.885]  Hold on just a minute, Webster, we gotta go to break.
[02:50:35.885 --> 02:50:37.246]  Oh, Petraeus, save me!
[02:50:37.246 --> 02:50:43.129]  The printer cartridge is killing me!
[02:50:43.129 --> 02:50:46.171]  It's got my arm!
[02:50:46.171 --> 02:50:48.032]  Help me!
[02:50:48.032 --> 02:50:49.933]  Petraeus, take my rights!
[02:50:50.934 --> 02:50:52.494]  Fondle my wife at the airport.
[02:50:52.494 --> 02:50:53.635]  Naked body scan me.
[02:50:53.635 --> 02:50:54.555]  Do whatever you have to.
[02:50:54.555 --> 02:50:55.395]  It's a... Ah!
[02:50:55.395 --> 02:50:55.835]  Hold on!
[02:50:55.835 --> 02:50:56.616]  We'll have to come back!
[02:50:56.616 --> 02:50:57.336]  I'm being attacked!
[02:50:57.336 --> 02:50:57.896]  Ah!
[02:50:57.896 --> 02:50:59.957]  A car with a printer cartridge!
[02:50:59.957 --> 02:51:00.097]  Ah!
[02:51:00.097 --> 02:51:00.837]  Help me!
[02:51:00.837 --> 02:51:01.417]  Oh, Lord!
[02:51:01.417 --> 02:51:05.498]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.498 --> 02:51:09.999]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:09.999 --> 02:51:15.901]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.141 --> 02:51:18.562]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.562 --> 02:51:24.665]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.665 --> 02:51:28.086]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.086 --> 02:51:29.947]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:29.947 --> 02:51:31.948]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.148 --> 02:51:37.832]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.

[02:51:50.179 --> 02:51:50.900]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:51.740]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguaranteed.com.
[02:52:00.828 --> 02:52:03.209]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.209 --> 02:52:05.410]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.410 --> 02:52:08.732]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.732 --> 02:52:13.835]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.835 --> 02:52:18.037]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.357 --> 02:52:20.698]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.698 --> 02:52:23.580]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.580 --> 02:52:26.502]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.502 --> 02:52:34.106]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:39.804]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.804 --> 02:52:42.685]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.685 --> 02:52:46.368]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.368 --> 02:52:47.448]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.448 --> 02:52:48.789]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:48.789 --> 02:52:50.270]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:29.454 --> 02:53:38.780]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:39.581]  This capitalism?
[02:53:39.581 --> 02:53:45.845]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:53:45.845 --> 02:53:46.726]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:53:46.726 --> 02:53:49.988]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:53:49.988 --> 02:53:50.768]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:53:50.768 --> 02:53:52.189]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:53:52.189 --> 02:53:52.509]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:52.509 --> 02:53:52.790]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:54:01.715 --> 02:54:07.639]  Alright, I was able to fight off the printer cartridge toner.
[02:54:20.976 --> 02:54:23.858]  But, you know, getting serious.
[02:54:23.858 --> 02:54:33.964]  Webster, I mean, do you agree with me specifically, though, that I see clearly they're beta testing the old terror narrative to see if we'll bite on it again, like a fisherman.
[02:54:33.964 --> 02:54:36.445]  Let's see if they're biting on green worms or purple worms.
[02:54:36.445 --> 02:54:41.648]  Or let me try to use, you know, a top bait on these bass.
[02:54:41.648 --> 02:54:48.272]  It seems like it's a fly fisherman testing out new flies to see if we'll bite on this thing.
[02:54:48.272 --> 02:54:50.574]  And I would say people are not biting on it.
[02:54:51.454 --> 02:55:04.644]  I would say there's certainly an attempt to refresh and refurbish this worn-out, idiotic, fantastic paradigm of Al-Qaeda and bin Laden and everything that goes with this, right?
[02:55:04.644 --> 02:55:06.565]  The so-called global war on terrorism.
[02:55:06.565 --> 02:55:08.747]  I think the other thing we ought to put on the table, though, is this
[02:55:09.287 --> 02:55:10.548]  We're good to go.
[02:55:24.418 --> 02:55:25.038]  We're good to go.
[02:55:47.286 --> 02:56:04.666]  I think this indicates that if you read those Ulster Man letters, right, that there's an atmosphere of bunker mentality, Nixonian paranoia on the part of Obama, Obama perhaps close to a nervous breakdown, Obama behaving erratically.
[02:56:04.926 --> 02:56:07.627]  Well, the Democrats are now openly in the national news.
[02:56:07.627 --> 02:56:10.028]  Half of Democrats want Obama to not even run in 2020.
[02:56:10.028 --> 02:56:12.089]  Precisely, and we have these cases.
[02:56:12.089 --> 02:56:19.813]  The guy running for governor of Rhode Island, the Democrat, his name escapes me, when he said to Obama, take your endorsement and shove it.
[02:56:19.813 --> 02:56:27.857]  We have DeFazio in Oregon, I think a person of some character, saying Pelosi has to go dump Pelosi.
[02:56:27.857 --> 02:56:30.779]  Well, dump Pelosi, dump Obama.
[02:56:30.779 --> 02:56:33.420]  As Ulster Man points out, you've got leading Democrats
[02:56:34.267 --> 02:56:41.331]  Risking their careers by rebuking and repudiating and attacking Obama pretty much all the time now.
[02:56:41.331 --> 02:56:43.692]  So he's sinking faster than the Titanic?
[02:56:43.692 --> 02:56:47.554]  He is, and then there's this intriguing question of the 25th Amendment, right?
[02:56:47.554 --> 02:56:49.575]  Is Obama non-compostmentist?
[02:56:50.195 --> 02:56:55.376]  Could you find a majority in the cabinet to vote that, with Biden also joining in?
[02:56:55.376 --> 02:57:12.479]  Probably not yet, certainly not yet, but depending on the dimensions of Obama's defeat at the polls and the repudiation of Democratic Party one-party rule, which I think is a good idea to bring the one-party phase to an end, I think that's likely to happen.
[02:57:12.479 --> 02:57:15.360]  Maybe not by much, I would also hope, but at least to end it.
[02:57:17.054 --> 02:57:23.158]  This may be the gambit of these incidents that we've been listing now.
[02:57:23.158 --> 02:57:31.363]  It may be a gambit of a faction that feels that an atmosphere of international tension would help Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:31.363 --> 02:57:32.864]  Well, exactly, but here's another problem.
[02:57:32.864 --> 02:57:33.664]  We're almost out of time.
[02:57:34.705 --> 02:57:39.952]  The globalists could flush Barry Sitaro, aka Barack Obama, down the memory hole.
[02:57:39.952 --> 02:57:47.262]  They could commit an assassination against him, and that's the only way to then give sympathy to the Democrats.
[02:57:47.262 --> 02:57:50.146]  And I think Obama should be looking at the people around him right now.
[02:57:50.839 --> 02:57:51.819]  He certainly should.
[02:57:51.819 --> 02:57:53.320]  He should be concerned about his security.
[02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:58.062]  But remember, he's also blackmailable on the Larry Sinclair dossier.
[02:57:58.062 --> 02:58:02.724]  He's blackmailable on the birth certificate and Kenya dossier.
[02:58:02.724 --> 02:58:06.486]  His poster man says he's blackmailable on the Resco Blagojevich.
[02:58:06.986 --> 02:58:11.149]  Chicago bipartisan combine, plus other things that we don't know, right?
[02:58:11.149 --> 02:58:17.995]  There's a special CIA department now under a leading Iran-contra figure who's looking into all the scandals around Obama.
[02:58:17.995 --> 02:58:28.403]  Obama is blackmailed six ways to Sunday already, and I think the debate is between some people say, keep him in power, we can blackmail him for another two years and get everything we want, and others who say, no, dump him now.
[02:58:28.643 --> 02:58:33.369]  Yeah, because it's causing a total revolution, and they want to put some new puppets in.
[02:58:33.369 --> 02:58:35.131]  Webster, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:35.131 --> 02:58:35.711]  God bless you.
[02:58:35.711 --> 02:58:36.252]  Tarpley.net.
[02:58:36.252 --> 02:58:36.733]  Good luck, Alex.
[02:58:36.733 --> 02:58:37.273]  See you soon.
[02:58:37.273 --> 02:58:37.554]  You bet.
[02:58:37.554 --> 02:58:39.336]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:39.336 --> 02:58:39.816]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:39.816 --> 02:58:41.018]  We're going to have to put your shirts down.
