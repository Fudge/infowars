[00:00.000 --> 00:09.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.840 --> 00:10.840]  You want answers?
[00:10.840 --> 00:12.960]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.960 --> 00:25.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.840 --> 00:30.400]  Another important broadcast lined up for you today, it is Wednesday, the second day of
[00:30.400 --> 00:39.480]  February 2011, the last 30 minutes of the third hour, Attorney Kurt Haskell, who witnessed
[00:39.480 --> 00:44.520]  the underwear bomber on Christmas Day two Christmases ago, being shepherded onto the
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.920]  plane without his proper IDs and passport.
[00:48.920 --> 00:54.720]  Will be joining us, he's made even more powerful statements, basically coming all the way out
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.640]  and saying that the government gave Mutalib the fake bomb.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.000]  And of course, it was later confirmed what Mr. Haskell and his wife and others witnessed.
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.440]  The government had tried to deny it that Mr. Mutalib had been protected and gotten onto
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.600]  the aircraft, and there had been a bomb scare after they got off of the aircraft, and it
[01:17.600 --> 01:24.040]  turned out that, yes, a unnamed U.S. intelligence agency had ordered the undersecretary of the
[01:24.040 --> 01:31.760]  State Department, Mr. Kennedy, to help Mr. Mutalib get on the aircraft that was carried
[01:31.760 --> 01:36.360]  by the Detroit Free Press and also the Associated Press.
[01:36.360 --> 01:44.600]  So on record, that was a staged event, and Mutalib, of course, looked like he was disheveled
[01:44.600 --> 01:49.840]  and drugged according to witnesses, so Kurt Haskell joining us in the last 30 minutes
[01:49.840 --> 01:54.920]  today, and it's a perfect time to get into it because if there was any doubt about the
[01:54.920 --> 02:00.960]  fact that WikiLeaks is selectively releasing internal government documents, they're basically
[02:00.960 --> 02:07.760]  just an echo chamber of public propaganda, it is now crystal clear, we're seeing a retread
[02:07.760 --> 02:17.280]  of the eight, nine-year-old neocon propaganda that Al C.I.Ada, Al Qaeda, has nukes, dirty
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.360]  bombs, sophisticated biological weapons, the list goes on and on.
[02:22.360 --> 02:27.960]  We were told Al Qaeda also launched the anthrax attack when it turned out it was a U.S. government
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.760]  weaponized strain and did not come from Al Qaeda but from Al C.I.Ada, and of course,
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.720]  that event was used to scare the population, especially the Congress, into going along
[02:39.720 --> 02:46.240]  with the Patriot Act on October 27th, 2001, just a month or so, a month and a half after
[02:46.240 --> 02:51.760]  the tragic 9-11 attacks, but here's the latest WikiLeaks data dump, probably the most important
[02:51.760 --> 02:57.840]  yet, we're going to decipher and go through all of this, WikiLeaks, FBI hunts, the 9-1-1
[02:57.840 --> 03:05.240]  gang that got away, oh, and U.S. intelligence agencies knew about these groups but didn't
[03:05.240 --> 03:09.720]  tell the FBI, well, they did more than that, it's on record that they ordered the FBI
[03:09.720 --> 03:22.840]  in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, California to stand down, the FBI
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.600]  in every one of those states filed reports saying these men are planning to hijack jet
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.200]  aircraft and fly them into buildings, and then they were ordered to stand down and those
[03:33.200 --> 03:38.240]  that criticized it were demoted, those that ordered them to stand down were promoted,
[03:38.240 --> 03:43.520]  and this all came out in Newsweek and everywhere else, just a piece here, a piece there, so
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.520]  we're going to go back over exactly what this means because, oh, look, WikiLeaks is releasing
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.880]  documents bolstering the official story, but when you actually look at what these documents
[03:52.880 --> 03:59.480]  show, it shows the stand down, continuing WikiLeaks, tension in the Middle East and
[03:59.480 --> 04:05.680]  Asia has direct potential to lead to nuclear war, well, that's been the public propaganda,
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.840]  but now it's been given validity because it's secret documents, continuing WikiLeaks, al-Qaeda
[04:10.840 --> 04:18.120]  is planning a dirty bomb, which we know has been discredited, but now it's been retreaded,
[04:18.120 --> 04:24.520]  also we have Paul Joseph Watson's article at infowars.com, WikiLeaks bombshell points
[04:24.520 --> 04:31.000]  to 9-1-1 stand down, we're going to be going over that, we're going to get into some of
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.720]  these other extremely, extremely important reports, Kurt Nemo has one out, latest round
[04:36.720 --> 04:44.960]  of WikiLeaks docs, hype-manufactured terror, but you're forced to then support WikiLeaks
[04:44.960 --> 04:48.960]  because the system is using it as a pretext to destroy our free speech and the internet
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.480]  as we know it, and bring in the kill switch, but at the same time it's their propaganda
[04:53.480 --> 05:00.400]  arms, similar to what's happening in Egypt, we'll break it down on the other side.
[05:00.400 --> 05:05.040]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.360 --> 05:13.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.760]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[05:18.760 --> 05:20.720]  grid technology is coming.
[05:20.720 --> 05:25.040]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.040]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:29.040 --> 05:32.520]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.520 --> 05:36.240]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:40.920 --> 05:44.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[05:44.760 --> 05:46.160]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:46.160 --> 05:52.080]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:52.080 --> 05:56.480]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call
[05:56.480 --> 06:00.120]  1-877-327-0365.
[06:00.120 --> 06:04.000]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.240]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[06:08.240 --> 06:12.640]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[06:12.640 --> 06:21.480]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family, not worried about them moving
[06:21.480 --> 06:28.480]  south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[06:28.480 --> 06:34.240]  I'm looking for America.
[06:34.240 --> 06:39.080]  Wear American and be proud, go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[06:39.080 --> 06:48.480]  Land on a free and my home of the brave, seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone,
[06:48.480 --> 06:51.480]  long gone.
[06:51.480 --> 06:55.480]  But I know in my heart it's still the same.
[06:55.480 --> 07:00.080]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[07:00.080 --> 07:03.760]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[07:03.760 --> 07:05.960]  It ended on June of 2009.
[07:05.960 --> 07:09.480]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.280]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[07:13.280 --> 07:15.360]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[07:15.360 --> 07:17.600]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[07:17.600 --> 07:20.600]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[07:20.600 --> 07:24.560]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[07:24.560 --> 07:27.080]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[07:27.080 --> 07:29.480]  They both make fabulous investments.
[07:29.480 --> 07:33.840]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[07:33.840 --> 07:34.840]  resource.
[07:34.840 --> 07:39.160]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[07:39.160 --> 07:40.160]  or metals.
[07:40.160 --> 07:44.760]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[07:44.760 --> 07:45.760]  term.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.040]  To freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it, visit eFoodsDirect.com
[07:50.040 --> 07:54.360]  on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[07:54.360 --> 08:24.320]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[08:24.440 --> 08:29.400]  Okay.
[08:29.400 --> 08:32.760]  There have been big developments on the WikiLeaks front.
[08:32.760 --> 08:43.040]  WikiLeaks being used to put out retreaded Pentagon lies about WMDs in the hands of terrorists.
[08:43.040 --> 08:46.920]  Similar to what the Office of Special Plans put out because they couldn't get the main
[08:46.920 --> 08:51.920]  CIA to lie, so they created a special office in the Pentagon that then put out lies about
[08:51.920 --> 08:59.520]  nuclear weapons and high-tech chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.
[08:59.520 --> 09:08.280]  These latest leaks and WikiLeaks admits they've put out less than 2% of what they've got.
[09:08.280 --> 09:16.440]  It's basically internal echo chamber propaganda that is given out to even mid-level Pentagon
[09:16.440 --> 09:18.320]  brass and the State Department.
[09:18.320 --> 09:26.560]  It is the internal cult Kool-Aid that the military industrial complex issues, and Paul
[09:26.560 --> 09:32.520]  Joseph Watson and Kurt Nemo have both done detailed reports on this, and I saw some of
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.360]  the comments and the articles, and people said, well, Watson's got an article out saying
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.160]  this is a bombshell from WikiLeaks because it shows 9-11 stand-down.
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.840]  And then Kurt Nemo's got an article over here saying that this is basically verifying
[09:46.840 --> 09:50.520]  and confirming that WikiLeaks is putting out government disinformation.
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.160]  Well, both Kurt is right and both Watson are right.
[09:54.160 --> 09:59.840]  This is very sophisticated, and Watson's hitting it from one angle, and Kurt's hitting it
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.320]  from another, and I'll try to basically bring those two perspectives in.
[10:04.320 --> 10:06.440]  I agree with both perspectives.
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.720]  On stories this big, this complex, there's different facets of all of it, and what we
[10:11.720 --> 10:16.920]  attempt to do here is cover all the little pieces and then give you the larger picture,
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.960]  or at least have discussions about the larger lay of the geopolitical land so that you can
[10:21.960 --> 10:25.160]  make your own decisions from that.
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.520]  But I want to talk about the history of WikiLeaks and who's involved with it, and the fact
[10:29.520 --> 10:34.320]  that it does have George Soros' right-hand man funding it.
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.200]  Julian Assange has attacked 9-11 Truth and said he doesn't like it, and now what he's
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.520]  released selectively on the surface bolsters the official story.
[10:44.520 --> 10:51.000]  But then hidden in plain view, it admits what was big news at the time that the FBI in at
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.760]  least seven states, from California to Minnesota, from Florida to New York, Texas, Oklahoma,
[10:58.760 --> 11:07.080]  in Phoenix, in Minneapolis, St. Paul, in Oklahoma City, in Miami, in Pensacola, everywhere.
[11:07.080 --> 11:09.480]  The hijackers were trained at U.S. bases.
[11:09.480 --> 11:11.920]  The hijackers had U.S. passports.
[11:11.920 --> 11:17.560]  The hijackers, according to the Toronto Star and Mr. Springman, the head of the visa section
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.960]  of the Saudi Arabian main visa office for the State Department, we've had him on.
[11:22.960 --> 11:24.080]  He talked to his colleagues.
[11:24.080 --> 11:29.560]  They confirmed that you'd have the hijackers going to Malaysia for summits and going to
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.720]  Saudi Arabia for summits and then trying to fly back into the U.S. and they'd be flagged
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.840]  as terrorists and they wouldn't give them visas and then they'd get a phone call from
[11:38.840 --> 11:45.400]  the State Department and saying the CIA has told us to give them their visas into the
[11:45.400 --> 11:47.800]  U.S. They're not really terrorists.
[11:47.800 --> 11:49.080]  They're working for us.
[11:49.080 --> 11:54.400]  Well, it's the same thing with the underwear bomber a year and a half ago, two Christmases
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.520]  ago, I guess not quite a year and a half ago, Christmas 2009.
[11:58.520 --> 12:07.160]  I mean, we had the eyewitnesses, the Haskells, both lawyers, they're married and they see
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.840]  a sharp dressed man arguing with the people at the gate saying, get Mutalib on, Mutalib
[12:11.840 --> 12:16.600]  is disheveled, looks like he's drugged, they get him on the plane, there's a handler on
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.520]  the plane videotaping the entire flight, constantly videotaping Mutalib.
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.680]  There's this pop in the plane and some smoke, they land the aircraft, they say they find
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.560]  other bombs, Haskell witnesses all of this, he comes out, the FBI says he's wrong, then
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.720]  other witnesses that were on the aircraft say yes, this all happened and then two months
[12:36.720 --> 12:45.400]  after that, what in February of 2010, a year ago now, it comes out that the undersecretary
[12:45.400 --> 12:53.880]  of the State Department, Mr. Kennedy, says yes, don't blame me for this, yes, yes we
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.640]  did get him the visa, yes we did help get him on the aircraft, we were asked to do it
[12:58.640 --> 13:02.400]  by an unnamed US intelligence agency.
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.840]  I mean, this is all on record, where is the congressional investigation, it's the same
[13:07.840 --> 13:15.200]  thing on 9-11, you've got government agencies funding these people, FBI credit cards, living
[13:15.200 --> 13:21.640]  in houses of FBI informants, being protected, you've got actor James Woods and this later
[13:21.640 --> 13:25.920]  it came out that the FBI was aware of this, with Mohammed Atta and the other supposed
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.640]  hijackers doing drills, just like the State Department and the CIA and the ATF and now
[13:31.640 --> 13:36.240]  Homeland Security does and the air marshals, they try to smuggle bombs on.
[13:36.240 --> 13:40.840]  What happened a few months ago with that German flight that had the bomb on it, turned out
[13:40.840 --> 13:45.280]  it was a drill, but they ran with a story bomb found and two days later, back of the
[13:45.280 --> 13:47.760]  paper, oh it was a drill.
[13:47.760 --> 13:53.200]  And so this is how private intelligence agencies, government intelligence agencies within the
[13:53.200 --> 13:58.680]  rest of government, so the rest of government is an aware stage events in many cases.
[13:58.680 --> 14:05.680]  We know the government of England was running drills and this is admitted, BBC, ITN, we've
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.080]  played the clips here, Peter Powers, former head of PR for Scotland Yard with visor consultancy
[14:12.080 --> 14:18.560]  is hired to run a drill that day of the exact trains and exact bus bombed at the exact same
[14:18.560 --> 14:20.320]  time and place.
[14:20.320 --> 14:22.160]  That is impossible.
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.400]  And he got out in the open and said, oh it's quite curious, we're running the drill of
[14:26.400 --> 14:31.640]  the exact place and exact time, it's quite amazing, quite unbelievable.
[14:31.640 --> 14:39.320]  It's the same MO over and over and over again and they get these young students and they
[14:39.320 --> 14:44.160]  tell them, here's backpacks, do the drill and some of them figured it out and ran so
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.040]  they were machine gunned at the Canary Wharf, that came out in the news, the police were
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.800]  hunting them down and killing them, they killed other witnesses, execution style like the
[14:55.800 --> 15:02.280]  Brazilian man who witnesses said the police came up, this is days after, sat on him in
[15:02.280 --> 15:09.000]  front of everybody, held him down and then shot him 17 times in the head, executed him
[15:09.000 --> 15:17.160]  and you've got Colonel Steven Butler at the defense language school in Monterey, California
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.640]  coming out and saying the government was behind this attack in a letter to the editor.
[15:21.640 --> 15:26.400]  I call up his home, back in the day then I was doing a lot of my own producing and I
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.040]  said please come on, some woman in the background was saying no, don't go on that show, we're
[15:30.040 --> 15:34.440]  being threatened and he said I'm sorry I can't talk, then they threatened to court-martial
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.080]  him if he didn't shut up and what did he say?
[15:38.080 --> 15:43.200]  The government was behind it and he said that the hijackers were trained at military bases
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.520]  and he had seen them.
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.840]  It goes on and on, I've got Newsweek reported hijackers trained at U.S. military bases and
[15:52.840 --> 15:56.960]  this is all information I covered in road to tyranny and previous films, perhaps we
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.440]  should bring all that information back and show it to people and then ask you the listeners,
[16:01.440 --> 16:07.040]  these are facts, the government's getting metalob on the plane, the underwear bomber
[16:07.040 --> 16:12.440]  and we're all a locky who's admittedly secretly dining at the Pentagon, source Fox News, Associated
[16:12.440 --> 16:19.040]  Press, it's not denied, good people inside the Pentagon last year leaked this information,
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.280]  the Pentagon did not deny the authenticity of the leaks, I'm not going to go through
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.600]  hundreds of these points and what would it say, two months after 9-11, the number three
[16:28.600 --> 16:35.240]  guy in Al Qaeda, he's arguably number one today under Usama bin Laden in Al-Siyeda,
[16:35.240 --> 16:43.680]  was at the Pentagon having meetings with the secretary of the army and the top brass.
[16:43.680 --> 16:49.920]  Now that's admitted fact and it's the same in every case, the head of the 7-7 bombings,
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.360]  a SWAT, this even came out on Fox News, this even came out in the London Telegraph, he
[16:55.360 --> 17:01.080]  was admittedly MI6 running the operation and was protected and allowed to leave the country
[17:01.080 --> 17:08.040]  and even come back in when it was on the news that he was the mastermind, this goes on and
[17:08.040 --> 17:20.720]  on and on and on and who is, and more all a locky, the CIA locky, who is he?
[17:20.720 --> 17:29.200]  He's the guy who the government, the media tells us, ran the Fort Hood shooter, ran the
[17:29.200 --> 17:34.480]  underwear bomber, ran the shoe bomber, ran the Times Square bomber.
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.600]  For two years, he was reportedly in daily contact with the army psychiatrist who shot
[17:40.600 --> 17:44.760]  up Fort Hood, Major Hassan.
[17:44.760 --> 17:49.080]  And when the Congress said we want to see those emails, the CIA declared national security,
[17:49.080 --> 17:52.720]  how did they declare national security over the legislative branch of government?
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.960]  That's the real government of anything is in this out of control bureaucracy.
[17:57.960 --> 18:03.920]  And they said national security, but yes, he was under the control of Anwar on the Locky.
[18:03.920 --> 18:13.680]  I mean this is all on record and now WikiLeaks comes out and says, oh my gosh, new evidence
[18:13.680 --> 18:20.800]  of the support teams and the casing teams for the hijackers and it turns out the CIA
[18:20.800 --> 18:26.040]  and other agencies knew and people in the hotel rooms had broken in to their rooms and
[18:26.040 --> 18:28.080]  look at their maps and their plans.
[18:28.080 --> 18:34.640]  Well yeah, that's what the FBI, from California to Florida, from New York to Michigan, from
[18:34.640 --> 18:39.120]  Oklahoma to, you name it, they were putting memos in.
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.480]  They're planning to hijack jets, probably flying them into the World Trade Center.
[18:43.480 --> 18:46.480]  Let us bust them, let us stop them.
[18:46.480 --> 18:49.240]  These flight schools are all suspicious.
[18:49.240 --> 18:52.400]  You will not do anything about them.
[18:52.400 --> 18:55.000]  You will do nothing.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.680]  And then you've even got Acre James Woods watching them do a drill of taking over the
[19:00.680 --> 19:04.480]  plane in front of him saying it was like they were practicing for hijacking two weeks before
[19:04.480 --> 19:06.040]  9-11.
[19:06.040 --> 19:08.640]  He tries to warn people and is told to shut up.
[19:08.640 --> 19:16.320]  And the list goes on and on and on and that's just one area of who are these hijackers.
[19:16.320 --> 19:20.240]  Then you get into NORAD stand downs, then you get into the US troops massed in and around
[19:20.240 --> 19:21.240]  Afghanistan.
[19:21.240 --> 19:27.200]  Bush signs a launch order to attack Afghanistan the day before 9-11.
[19:27.200 --> 19:30.040]  It goes on and on.
[19:30.040 --> 19:35.520]  And now WikiLeaks comes out and tries to bolster that story, but within it you see the real
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.800]  story of how the FBI now claims they're running around the Middle East, now trying to capture
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.120]  these men because they know their names.
[19:44.120 --> 19:46.560]  But it turns out the government knew about this day one.
[19:46.560 --> 19:51.520]  Of course, they ordered these people not to be tracked down.
[19:51.520 --> 19:55.160]  Just like they can't get to some of bin Laden.
[19:55.160 --> 19:58.480]  And then you look at the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and what's happening now and who
[19:58.480 --> 20:00.440]  are they working for, the CIA?
[20:00.440 --> 20:05.920]  Hello, at ofthefield.com we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[20:05.920 --> 20:10.840]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on ofthefield.com.
[20:10.840 --> 20:15.600]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[20:15.600 --> 20:20.080]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf which left me wondering if I even needed
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.080]  another book.
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.160]  Boy was I wrong.
[20:22.160 --> 20:25.320]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[20:25.320 --> 20:29.240]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[20:29.240 --> 20:32.360]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[20:32.360 --> 20:33.360]  Wow.
[20:33.360 --> 20:34.360]  I watched the DVD last night.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.760]  I was all struck.
[20:35.760 --> 20:37.440]  What wonderful work you have done.
[20:37.440 --> 20:40.120]  This information can bless many people.
[20:40.120 --> 20:41.120]  Thank you again.
[20:41.120 --> 20:42.120]  Thanks again.
[20:42.120 --> 20:45.120]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[20:45.120 --> 20:46.120]  Thank you, folks.
[20:46.120 --> 20:49.160]  Thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[20:49.160 --> 20:52.600]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[20:52.600 --> 20:59.040]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in
[20:59.040 --> 21:01.040]  the secret.
[21:01.040 --> 21:02.040]  Gold isn't for you.
[21:02.040 --> 21:06.000]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.280]  metal investing firms.
[21:07.280 --> 21:08.280]  I get it.
[21:08.280 --> 21:11.960]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that
[21:11.960 --> 21:16.400]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security
[21:16.400 --> 21:17.760]  would be there for you.
[21:17.760 --> 21:19.000]  That's not what's happening.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.840]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[21:23.840 --> 21:27.440]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.920]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[21:30.920 --> 21:35.240]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[21:35.240 --> 21:41.160]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[21:41.160 --> 21:44.520]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[21:44.520 --> 21:45.520]  You should, too.
[21:45.520 --> 21:46.520]  Find out what they know.
[21:46.520 --> 21:55.880]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[21:55.880 --> 22:01.680]  That's 800-686-2237.
[22:01.680 --> 22:05.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[22:05.440 --> 22:08.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.920]  We're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[22:12.920 --> 22:13.920]  at home.
[22:13.920 --> 22:18.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.640]  calling the shots.
[22:19.640 --> 22:24.920]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[22:24.920 --> 22:30.400]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[22:30.400 --> 22:35.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[22:35.040 --> 22:39.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[22:39.400 --> 22:41.560]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[22:41.560 --> 22:46.960]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[22:46.960 --> 22:48.800]  a fall of the republic.
[22:48.800 --> 22:53.720]  Yet you're copy a fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[22:53.720 --> 22:59.480]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[22:59.480 --> 23:04.320]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide amazing results, and here's more proof of
[23:04.320 --> 23:08.480]  the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial
[23:08.480 --> 23:09.480]  flow.
[23:09.480 --> 23:10.480]  My name is Crystal.
[23:10.480 --> 23:13.240]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[23:13.240 --> 23:17.320]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[23:17.320 --> 23:21.560]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[23:21.560 --> 23:22.560]  What did Crystal do?
[23:22.560 --> 23:26.320]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[23:26.320 --> 23:31.200]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula, and could even feel the goodness
[23:31.200 --> 23:32.920]  of the formula starting to work.
[23:32.920 --> 23:36.720]  One clear arteries are happy arteries after using heart and body extract.

[24:09.240 --> 24:13.240]  Here's what I want to do.
[24:13.240 --> 24:19.160]  I want to throw the phone number out, wide open phones on any subject you want to discuss,
[24:19.160 --> 24:25.680]  but obviously, the big focus for my shelf today is the situation in Egypt.
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.800]  We're going to be going over the latest developments there, and WikiLeaks, the 9-11 data dump they've
[24:32.800 --> 24:37.640]  put out, re-energizing the fear mongering about Al Qaeda having dirty bombs, with terrorists
[24:37.640 --> 24:41.720]  having nukes, high-tech chemical and biological weapons.
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.280]  We do have Kurt Haskell, the attorney who's been completely vindicated, and everything
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.400]  he said has been proven to be 100% true, joining us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.400]  today.
[24:51.400 --> 25:01.000]  But the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.040]  air today, in fact, coming up in the next segment.
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.240]  But getting into the WikiLeaks situation, here are the fear mongering headlines, just
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.240]  some of them.
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.000]  The WikiLeaks FBI hunts the 9-11 gang, the 9-11 gang that got away.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.960]  The FBI has launched a manhunt for a previously unknown team of men suspected to be part of
[25:22.960 --> 25:24.280]  the 9-11 hijackers.
[25:24.280 --> 25:31.080]  The telegraph can disclose, and that's the latest WikiLeaks documents that have been
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.760]  released going back to 2001, and then reissued to another government report last year.
[25:36.760 --> 25:38.920]  But they were not previously unknown.
[25:38.920 --> 25:43.480]  When you read the article and you read the new WikiLeaks documents, it states that the
[25:43.480 --> 25:45.560]  CIA knew all about this.
[25:45.560 --> 25:50.840]  Well, we know they knew, and that the government ordered the FBI to stand down.
[25:50.840 --> 25:51.840]  The FBI agents went public.
[25:51.840 --> 25:59.040]  It was on the cover of Newsweek and Time Magazine, and Kathleen Rowley and Sybil Edmonds, the
[25:59.040 --> 26:04.680]  FBI translator, who was listening on the day of 9-11, and she had a federal gag order put
[26:04.680 --> 26:09.280]  on her, but she broke that about a year and a half ago and said, the government's running
[26:09.280 --> 26:13.880]  narcotics, there's private contractors involved, they're running white slaves, that means sex
[26:13.880 --> 26:19.560]  slavery, and they were commanding Al Qaeda on the day of 9-11.
[26:19.560 --> 26:26.200]  That's what she said in court, in court, and we have the clear image from all the other
[26:26.200 --> 26:28.400]  reports that this is confirmed.
[26:28.400 --> 26:31.640]  So they have this article going, oh boy, this shows how real 9-11 was.
[26:31.640 --> 26:37.440]  This shows they were these other hijackers that were supporting them and casing things,
[26:37.440 --> 26:42.640]  and in doing all this, and the government now suddenly is, this has been released through
[26:42.640 --> 26:49.600]  WikiLeaks, that this was previously unknown, but it's previously unknown to the FBI.
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.320]  The rest of the intelligence agencies knew exactly what was going on, and that just fits
[26:54.320 --> 26:58.840]  in the larger history of that ongoing cover-up.
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.800]  One report here, WikiLeaks, tensions in the Middle East and Asia has direct potential
[27:02.800 --> 27:04.360]  to lead to nuclear war.
[27:04.360 --> 27:05.360]  See?
[27:05.360 --> 27:08.240]  We've got to continue to be in the Middle East, we've got to continue all these wars.
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.840]  Oh, isn't it terrible now that all this is happening?
[27:11.840 --> 27:13.560]  Oh, things are unstable.
[27:13.560 --> 27:20.000]  And then Obama comes out yesterday when we weren't sure whether Hazy Mubarak was going
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.080]  to give the speech, saying that he would step down in September and that his son would
[27:24.080 --> 27:29.680]  not try to be the new dictator, the new Western-installed dictator.
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.400]  And Obama comes out and says, it's time for you to step down.
[27:34.400 --> 27:39.120]  Fully showing the policy of the people that run this government is to betray their henchmen,
[27:39.120 --> 27:43.320]  who's a terrible guy, but now who do they have waiting in the wings?
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.040]  The Muslim Brotherhood admittedly MI6-controlled radical Muslims saying they want to overthrow
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.880]  Saudi Arabia, they want to overthrow Yemen, they want to overthrow and set up an Islamic
[27:53.880 --> 28:02.040]  state in Cairo, they're in the capital of Egypt, that they want to overthrow the globalist
[28:02.040 --> 28:04.880]  ally Jordan.
[28:04.880 --> 28:07.200]  They want radicals in there.
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.160]  They want, if they don't have the Soviet Union, it's going to be a Muslim threat.
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.520]  And then they get to have the trillion-dollar defense budgets, they get to set up a domestic
[28:17.520 --> 28:20.200]  police state, they've been fighting the radical Muslims.
[28:20.200 --> 28:25.560]  In these countries, globalist-installed can then churn out armies of real terrorists,
[28:25.560 --> 28:28.120]  that is, people that fight the West.
[28:28.120 --> 28:31.520]  And you can have the clash of civilizations.
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.160]  And they always, the globalists always set things up where morally it makes you want
[28:35.160 --> 28:36.160]  to support it.
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.320]  Oh, WikiLeaks, they're trying to shut down the free press and leakers.
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.400]  There'll be no freedom of the press if we don't stand with Assange.
[28:43.400 --> 28:47.560]  So you're forced to say, don't arrest Assange, don't, you know, don't do this because they're
[28:47.560 --> 28:49.680]  pushing for an internet kill switch.
[28:49.680 --> 28:55.320]  But then it turns out Assange is being fed this data, supported by George Soros's henchmen,
[28:55.320 --> 29:01.040]  and is continually putting out things that bolster the official globalist line.
[29:01.040 --> 29:06.040]  So you've got to support WikiLeaks in that he shouldn't go to jail, and it's good to
[29:06.040 --> 29:11.160]  have transparency, but it's a selected transparency where they're only releasing internal propaganda
[29:11.160 --> 29:14.840]  reports now to the general public to push their official line.
[29:14.840 --> 29:19.360]  But those are so flimsy that even within them, the government's spinning, and of, oh, look
[29:19.360 --> 29:22.720]  how bad the Al Qaeda threat is, see it's real, but then right there it admits the government
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.200]  knew and was protecting them.
[29:26.200 --> 29:31.120]  So when you look at this, Paul Watson's hitting it from the angle of WikiLeaks bombshell points
[29:31.120 --> 29:36.320]  to 9-1-1 stand down, and Kurt hits it from the other accurate angle of latest round of
[29:36.320 --> 29:39.720]  WikiLeaks docs, hypes, manufactured terror.
[29:39.720 --> 29:45.000]  Now we'll get into the latest what's happening with Egypt, and then your phone calls, and
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.800]  then the economy, and kids getting kicked out of school for spitballs, and everything
[29:49.800 --> 29:50.960]  else.
[29:50.960 --> 29:54.640]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.640 --> 30:00.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.440 --> 30:05.960]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[30:05.960 --> 30:08.680]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[30:08.680 --> 30:11.240]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[30:11.240 --> 30:15.040]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of
[30:15.040 --> 30:16.640]  your health and your own family.
[30:16.640 --> 30:19.640]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[30:19.640 --> 30:22.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[30:22.000 --> 30:26.200]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[30:26.200 --> 30:28.200]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[30:28.200 --> 30:31.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.640]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[30:35.640 --> 30:38.840]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[30:38.840 --> 30:40.320]  I can't stress this enough.

[31:59.800 --> 32:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[32:04.440 --> 32:08.800]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:08.800 --> 32:13.120]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:13.120 --> 32:14.440]  allows you to have.
[32:14.440 --> 32:15.440]  It's true.
[32:15.440 --> 32:20.140]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.140 --> 32:24.480]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:24.480 --> 32:28.480]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.480 --> 32:31.960]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[32:31.960 --> 32:35.680]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:35.680 --> 32:40.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:40.400 --> 32:44.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[32:44.200 --> 32:45.600]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[32:45.600 --> 32:49.840]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[32:49.840 --> 32:51.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:51.440 --> 33:02.440]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:02.440 --> 33:08.440]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[33:08.440 --> 33:11.440]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[33:11.440 --> 33:18.440]  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[33:18.440 --> 33:21.440]  All right, I want to get into the Egypt situation.
[33:21.440 --> 33:26.440]  Also, the record cold and snow, blanketing much of the northeast.
[33:26.440 --> 33:32.440]  Rolling blackouts, ordered by government around the country, turned out with California and Enron,
[33:32.440 --> 33:35.440]  they would internally cut off power routinely.
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.440]  And they said that created the perception that there wasn't enough power and that people would then accept higher prices.
[33:40.440 --> 33:47.440]  I don't know if that's the case here, but just amazing to see much of Austin without power with rolling blackouts where I live.
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.440]  Because it froze last night and there are a few patches of ice on bridges.
[33:52.440 --> 34:00.440]  Just incredible to see how paralyzed we become and how addicted to this infrastructure and how dependent on it we are.
[34:00.440 --> 34:09.440]  Also, obviously, Anderson Cooper attacked by supposed Hosni Mubarak supporters.
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  We're going to be going over all of that.
[34:11.440 --> 34:19.440]  But I was on Mankow Muller's syndicated radio show this morning as I am every Wednesday for about 30 minutes every Wednesday.
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.440]  And he said, come on, Alex.
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.440]  And he had his brother on the show and he had a woman whose fiance died on 9-11.
[34:26.440 --> 34:28.440]  And he said, come on, Alex, you're a truther.
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.440]  How despicable.
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.440]  I like a lot of what you do and say, but this is just terrible.
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.440]  How can you say George W. Bush basically had a plunger in the basement of the White House and did this?
[34:39.440 --> 34:41.440]  And that's not what we're saying.
[34:41.440 --> 34:48.440]  We're saying the people that run our government admit they staged the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam.
[34:48.440 --> 34:56.440]  The people that run our government have declassified that they staged hundreds and hundreds of bombings under Operation Gladio alone in Europe to blame on their political enemies.
[34:56.440 --> 34:58.440]  And he said, oh, I don't change the subject.
[34:58.440 --> 34:59.440]  Let's talk about 9-11.
[34:59.440 --> 35:00.440]  And I said, wait a minute.
[35:00.440 --> 35:14.440]  If a bank robber who's been in jail for 10 years is released and he's got a certain physical appearance, white hair, white beard, 65 years of age and drives a red pickup truck,
[35:14.440 --> 35:23.440]  and a week after he gets out of prison in the area where he's been released, a bank gets robbed by a 65-year-old guy driving a red pickup truck with a gray beard and gray hair.
[35:23.440 --> 35:28.440]  It doesn't mean he did it, but that's the first person the cops are going to visit.
[35:28.440 --> 35:31.440]  That's the first person the FBI is going to go visit.
[35:31.440 --> 35:39.440]  I mean, if we have a government that admittedly has staged terror attacks or funded terrorists and allowed them to attack, they have different variants of it.
[35:39.440 --> 35:49.440]  Over and over again, how do you not then look at that and see how they've used 9-11 to take our liberties, to take our freedoms, to set up a police state, to lie about WMDs?
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.440]  That's a false flag.
[35:51.440 --> 35:53.440]  Iraq could nuke us in 45 minutes.
[35:53.440 --> 35:54.440]  England's in danger.
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.440]  He's got nukes.
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.440]  And it turns out they lied about that.
[35:57.440 --> 35:58.440]  They weren't mistaken.
[35:58.440 --> 36:00.440]  They lied about that.
[36:00.440 --> 36:04.440]  And then you look at who is Saddam Hussein, a guy trained by the CIA in 58.
[36:04.440 --> 36:07.440]  A guy put into power in 1979.
[36:07.440 --> 36:09.440]  A guy told to attack Iran.
[36:09.440 --> 36:11.440]  A guy told to go ahead and attack Kuwait.
[36:11.440 --> 36:14.440]  And then now what are they installed there?
[36:14.440 --> 36:19.440]  A more oppressive system in Iraq, more death, more bondage.
[36:19.440 --> 36:27.440]  The globalists have a public strategy of deindustrializing any country they can or stopping a nation from becoming industrialized.
[36:27.440 --> 36:29.440]  And that's been happening in Egypt.
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.440]  And so they want to get rid of Haji Mubarak, their old dictator, just like they wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein.
[36:34.440 --> 36:36.440]  And who do they put in?
[36:36.440 --> 36:48.440]  They're admittedly saying there's going to be a coalition government with the Muslim Brotherhood and this Elberide character who's admittedly a top UN official with the head of the atomic energy.
[36:48.440 --> 36:51.440]  The head of the atomic energy agency formerly, a top globalist.
[36:51.440 --> 36:56.440]  And who's been sometimes buddy buddy with Iran.
[36:56.440 --> 37:02.440]  And you've got the Muslim Brotherhood in press releases saying we will overthrow Saudi Arabia.
[37:02.440 --> 37:04.440]  We will overthrow Jordan.
[37:04.440 --> 37:08.440]  We will overthrow Egypt and we will put in an Islamic regime.
[37:08.440 --> 37:16.440]  And then I see Republicans on the air going, oh my gosh, the Muslim Brotherhood, Obama must be a Muslim.
[37:16.440 --> 37:18.440]  He's trying to get us.
[37:18.440 --> 37:20.440]  Well, you Republicans should be happy.
[37:20.440 --> 37:28.440]  This is the big New Brzezinski under Carter and then the George W. Bush, Herbert Walker Bush, who was really running things under Reagan.
[37:28.440 --> 37:30.440]  This has been the continued policy.
[37:30.440 --> 37:42.440]  They don't want modern buildings and factories and power, electrical power and wealthy populations that can support a growing population in the Middle East.
[37:42.440 --> 37:44.440]  They don't want secular governments in there.
[37:44.440 --> 37:53.440]  They want a bunch of people running around, you know, with big beards, with their wives chained up and all of that oppression.
[37:53.440 --> 37:56.440]  They're bringing the radical Muslims into the U.S.
[37:56.440 --> 38:05.440]  They're bringing them into Europe and they're empowering them to bully the mainline cultured people who happen to be Muslim.
[38:05.440 --> 38:13.440]  It's a way to demonize Muslims and it's a way to scare Westerners into giving up their liberties in the name of fighting the Muslim threat.
[38:13.440 --> 38:19.440]  Harkening back to the Crusades when the Muslims would invade and the Christians would invade back and forth fighting with each other.
[38:19.440 --> 38:27.440]  While the globalists sit above the United States, sit above Europe, sit above the Middle East and are playing us off against each other.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.440]  Here's an analogy.
[38:29.440 --> 38:41.440]  One of the old James Bond movies, I forget the name of it, but the head of, you know, the evil sinister chaos or specter group, I forget the name,
[38:41.440 --> 38:51.440]  is meeting on his yacht with some of his assassins and he's working with private terror groups, private contractor groups,
[38:51.440 --> 38:55.440]  who want to cause economic crises so they can profit from it.
[38:55.440 --> 39:03.440]  Of course, those books were all written by a former OSS high level spy master slash MI6 spy master, Mr. Fleming.
[39:03.440 --> 39:10.440]  So he was really throwing in your face how things really work and this shadowy, you know, guy, you never see his face.
[39:10.440 --> 39:12.440]  He's petting the cat.
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.440]  He's the bankster and he says, let me explain how things work here.
[39:16.440 --> 39:18.440]  You have your enemies fight each other.
[39:18.440 --> 39:27.440]  Look at the Chinese fighting fish and he puts three fish in a little tank and he says, watch the smart one.
[39:27.440 --> 39:33.440]  And the smart one goes over and doesn't get in the fight and he lets the other two beat each other up.
[39:33.440 --> 39:40.440]  One of them kills the other fish and after it's exhausted, the smart fish comes over and kills him.
[39:40.440 --> 39:50.440]  See, we are trained to think in terms of America, Egypt, Israel, England, China, Russia, uh-uh.
[39:50.440 --> 39:57.440]  There's globalists setting up a standardized open world government and they wrote policy papers on this 80 years ago.
[39:57.440 --> 40:03.440]  They had the 10 FEMA regions in 1937 in the New York Times.
[40:03.440 --> 40:05.440]  Bernadine Smith mailed me the actual copy.
[40:05.440 --> 40:06.440]  I've shown it on TV years ago.
[40:06.440 --> 40:10.440]  I wish I could find it in the huge warehouse of papers and videos we've got.
[40:10.440 --> 40:12.440]  If somebody else has a copy, please send it again.
[40:12.440 --> 40:14.440]  I'll show it or somebody scan it online.
[40:14.440 --> 40:16.440]  It's the cover of the New York Times.
[40:16.440 --> 40:30.440]  They folded out 1937, was it 36, and there are the 10 regions of America under the global government and they talk about the 10 global regions under one currency
[40:30.440 --> 40:36.440]  and how the Rockefellers have this great plan for the League of Nations to build this.
[40:36.440 --> 40:44.440]  And it's not called FEMA regions, but it's the exact 10 regions today that are under FEMA and the exact 10 global regions.
[40:44.440 --> 40:47.440]  They got a map of the U.S. and then under it a map of the world.
[40:47.440 --> 40:54.440]  10 regions per country, 10 regions worldwide controlled by the banks who control the issuance of currency and credit.
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.440]  So of course I knew everything that was going to happen.
[40:57.440 --> 40:58.440]  It's not hard.
[40:58.440 --> 41:08.440]  They told us it'd be like if the police busted some bank robbers again and they found their plans for their next heist.
[41:08.440 --> 41:13.440]  Or let's say the cops find bank robbers hideout, but they haven't caught the bank robbers.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.440]  That's a better parable.
[41:14.440 --> 41:19.440]  And they go in and they find written up plans of what banks they're going to rob next.
[41:19.440 --> 41:21.440]  What would smart cops do?
[41:21.440 --> 41:29.440]  They would leave those plans there, not let the bank robbers know they found the hideout and be waiting on a stakeout at the next place that they were going to rob.
[41:29.440 --> 41:32.440]  Well, I have their entire blueprint.
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.440]  You have their entire blueprint.
[41:34.440 --> 41:42.440]  I mean, in the 70s through the 80s, 90s, CFR, congressional hearings, UN reports, we cover them all the time.
[41:42.440 --> 41:44.440]  Openly saying world government.
[41:44.440 --> 41:51.440]  By the 70s, they said we'll have carbon taxes on all human activity to shut down any industry that we don't control.
[41:51.440 --> 41:57.440]  Then once people are so poor, I will say, okay, become sterilized and we'll still give you your welfare card.
[41:57.440 --> 42:03.440]  Then we'll put things in their water and their vaccines to kill them slowly so that they don't all notice it once.
[42:03.440 --> 42:06.440]  I mean, we have it all.
[42:06.440 --> 42:14.440]  We have their entire blueprints for what they're doing and that's what's frustrating about this.
[42:14.440 --> 42:32.440]  A group openly declares war on free humanity and war on Alex Jones and my family and war on free speech and private property and the right to self-defense and on my sovereignty of my country that has codified the best laws and systems our world has ever seen.
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.440]  I'm going to defend nationalism. I'm going to defend our republic.
[42:36.440 --> 42:40.440]  Whatever the globalists are for, I'm against.
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.440]  Now, that could just be an easy equation of we know they're bad and so whatever they're for we're against.
[42:45.440 --> 42:54.440]  But I intellectually have studied every program, every policy they push and it's bad for 99.9% of us.
[42:54.440 --> 42:57.440]  And that's what people need to figure out who are on the fence out there.
[42:57.440 --> 43:02.440]  It's time for you to do the research. It's time for you to get involved. It's time for you to find out who the globalists really are.
[43:02.440 --> 43:06.440]  A good place to begin is whatistheingame.com or ingamethemovie.com.
[43:06.440 --> 43:14.440]  It has a full online document bibliography for every minute of the film and the film is linked and posted for free right there on the site.
[43:14.440 --> 43:17.440]  A $100,000 film I made, it's free.
[43:17.440 --> 43:22.440]  You can buy the DVD if you wanted the highest quality with expanded extras and also support us at infowars.com.
[43:22.440 --> 43:27.440]  That's a good place for a new listener to start.
[43:27.440 --> 43:33.440]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement and it's a two and a half hour film with nothing but globalists openly announcing world government,
[43:33.440 --> 43:40.440]  their videos of them saying it, their own documents, the regions, the master plan, how the EU was really set up in 57.
[43:40.440 --> 43:44.440]  The public wasn't told until 2000. They even brag about that now.
[43:44.440 --> 43:54.440]  We've already merged the North American Union with what they call the Atlantic Union with Europe and Bush at the Rose Gardens saying it.
[43:54.440 --> 44:02.440]  Look, I'm not the brain surgeon here. I'm not the rocket scientist. I'm not the quantum mechanics physicist.
[44:02.440 --> 44:10.440]  I know how to study empires. I know how to study history and I've studied it and it's right there telling us what they're doing and all I'm doing is relaying it to you.
[44:10.440 --> 44:19.440]  Alright, I said I'd take your phone calls and then I'll get into the whole Egypt situation and the WikiLeaks situation and all of it.
[44:19.440 --> 44:27.440]  But Paul Joseph Watson's article is so vital for folks to read.
[44:27.440 --> 44:30.440]  It's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[44:30.440 --> 44:38.440]  WikiLeaks bombshell points to 9-11 stand down and of course they hide this in plain view and people are like, well, then aren't you saying WikiLeaks is good?
[44:38.440 --> 44:49.440]  No, they put this out to try to bolster the myth of all these al-Qaeda people creeping around, but hidden in plain view is the admitted order to not give the FBI this information on 9-11.
[44:49.440 --> 45:00.440]  Then there's the other article, latest round of WikiLeaks docs, Hype Manufactured Terror by Kurt Nemo, both essential looking at it from different angles.
[45:00.440 --> 45:11.440]  Meanwhile, the neocons are exploiting fear of the Muslim Brotherhood to push war. Meanwhile, this is continuing the globalist policy that transcends Republican and Democratic parties.
[45:11.440 --> 45:19.440]  Don't you understand, it's now been declassified that our government put Mao Zedong into power in 49. That's even on the History Channel.
[45:19.440 --> 45:30.440]  It's been declassified that in 1917, the U.S. and British government sent over 30,000 people from Brooklyn, New York with weapons with a trainload of gold.
[45:30.440 --> 45:39.440]  They shipped it over there, then put it on a train, brought it in to put the Bolsheviks in power, and then Ford and General Motors and all of them built the weapons systems for the Russians.
[45:39.440 --> 45:45.440]  They built the weapons systems for the Nazis because they're bankers. They go to Hitler and say, we'll finance your war machine.
[45:45.440 --> 45:52.440]  They go to Stalin, we'll finance your war machine. And then, oh, there's the Soviet and the Nazi threat, their allies taking over Poland.
[45:52.440 --> 46:02.440]  We better build up a big army here, and the bankers then bankroll that. And then the bankers play those parts off against each other, just like they're destroying Egypt right now.
[46:02.440 --> 46:08.440]  The stability. A dictatorship, oppressive, low standard of living.
[46:08.440 --> 46:19.440]  But now they're going to get rid of somebody who was modernizing some of the systems and bring in the Muslim Brotherhood run by a U.N. lackey as they openly chant, death to Israel.
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.440]  We're going to overthrow Saudi Arabia. We're going to overthrow Jordan.
[46:24.440 --> 46:37.440]  That's the destabilization campaign, getting the chessboard ready for the next move into a World War III scenario, as we've been saying in the last week, and what now is in the news today.
[46:37.440 --> 46:52.440]  WikiLeaks. Tension in the Middle East and Asia has direct potential to lead the nuclear war. Tension in the Middle East and Asia has given rise to the escalating atomic arms and missile race, which has direct political and potential to lead a nuclear war,
[46:52.440 --> 47:06.440]  lead a nuclear war, lead diplomatic documents disclosed. Again, tension in the Middle East and Asia has given rise to a escalating atomic arms and missile race, which has the direct potential to lead a nuclear war, lead diplomatic documents disclosed.
[47:06.440 --> 47:21.440]  Well, one of the rail corporations two years ago said they wanted a major World War, not just something like Iraq or Afghanistan. This is just the prelude to that, but a massive war.
[47:21.440 --> 47:26.840]  But short of a nuclear war, that's why the grand chess board centers in around the Middle
[47:26.840 --> 47:31.440]  East and Central Asia, as Kissinger and Brzezinski have said, because those are places that don't
[47:31.440 --> 47:37.840]  yet have nukes, but where they can still have proxy wars, and it's globalist waging war
[47:37.840 --> 47:43.120]  against free humanity and against sovereign states, and it's meant to further bankrupt
[47:43.120 --> 47:44.120]  societies.
[47:44.120 --> 47:47.800]  And while we're busy giving up our liberties because we're in a war and giving up our tax
[47:47.800 --> 47:52.160]  money because we're in a war, the bankers can move ahead with their new global currency
[47:52.160 --> 47:54.160]  and they can get their agenda through.
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.120]  And a lot of times I use movie analogies.
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.040]  Ten minutes ago I used a James Bond movie analogy of the Chinese fighting fish where
[48:02.040 --> 48:06.840]  there's three fish in the tank, one fish, the smart fish waits while the other two kill
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.080]  each other, or one kills the other and but now is wounded and weakened and the other
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.200]  comes in and takes him out.
[48:13.200 --> 48:14.200]  Here's another one.
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.680]  I'm going to break and come back with your calls for at least 30, 45 minutes and I'll
[48:17.680 --> 48:22.200]  get into the details of the news here, but this is all just basic understanding of the
[48:22.200 --> 48:24.760]  general strategy.
[48:24.760 --> 48:31.320]  Now it's cheesy, it's goofy, but it's one of the most popular movies out there and so
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.520]  most people listening understand it.
[48:33.520 --> 48:41.160]  But I remember five years ago or whatever it was when Revenge of the Sith, episode three
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.280]  Star Wars came out, seeing major editorials in the New York Times, you name it, saying
[48:46.280 --> 48:48.920]  we don't understand the plot.
[48:48.920 --> 48:53.440]  Now this is a movie made for 10 year olds, but adults couldn't understand it.
[48:53.440 --> 49:01.280]  They said who is Palpatine working with, the separatist, the trade federation, Count Dooku,
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.920]  the republic, you know, it doesn't make sense, it made perfect sense.
[49:05.920 --> 49:07.560]  That's how things really work.
[49:07.560 --> 49:12.440]  George Lucas came out and said at the time at the Con Film Festival and said this is
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.760]  how the world really works and he said this is what really happened on 9-11, but didn't
[49:17.760 --> 49:18.760]  elaborate.
[49:18.760 --> 49:22.280]  Now, what do you learn at the end of episode three?
[49:22.280 --> 49:28.960]  You've got a senator who hires a criminal group to attack his own planet when the imperial
[49:28.960 --> 49:34.480]  senate doesn't respond fast enough or wasn't an empire yet when the republic doesn't respond,
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.320]  he politically comes in and demands more power for the government to go destroy the trade
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.120]  federation or kick him off in a boob, then he gets more power.
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.880]  Then by the second episode he uses more crises he's staging, terror groups he's funding
[49:48.880 --> 49:56.240]  to become elected chancellor, then he launches attacks on the capital planet with terror groups
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.960]  he's funded secretly, working for decades to get them to declare him emperor, then he
[50:01.960 --> 50:08.240]  says that the Jedi are traitors, they always Hitler wiped out his SA as soon as he got
[50:08.240 --> 50:12.280]  into power, Stalin did the same thing, they always wipe out those that take him to power
[50:12.280 --> 50:18.560]  or they wipe out the original police force and he declares himself the emperor and enslavement
[50:18.560 --> 50:20.520]  accelerates.
[50:20.520 --> 50:26.840]  But adults watch that and they go, I can't understand this, the emperor is funding people
[50:26.840 --> 50:33.240]  to attack him, this doesn't make sense, because the emperor at the end you learn was attacking
[50:33.240 --> 50:38.320]  the republic with the outside enemies to get the republic to build a command and control
[50:38.320 --> 50:43.520]  system in to get rid of the freedom and the checks and balances so he could take over.
[50:43.520 --> 50:46.320]  Why did Hitler fire bomb the Reichstag?
[50:46.320 --> 50:51.920]  Right after he got elected, oh see I need to take over, we've been attacked.
[50:51.920 --> 50:55.840]  See I mean this is done over and over again, so they are destabilizing the Middle East
[50:55.840 --> 51:00.840]  to create the crisis to offer their World War 3 solution.
[51:00.840 --> 51:04.840]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[51:04.840 --> 51:07.760]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[51:07.760 --> 51:11.800]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[51:11.800 --> 51:12.800]  or gold?
[51:12.800 --> 51:16.160]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[51:16.160 --> 51:18.320]  possible that could even happen again.
[51:18.320 --> 51:22.480]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[51:22.480 --> 51:28.560]  seeds, they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[51:28.560 --> 51:33.080]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[51:33.080 --> 51:38.480]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[51:38.480 --> 51:44.200]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[51:44.200 --> 51:55.840]  call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[51:55.840 --> 51:57.560]  are the ultimate barter item.
[51:57.560 --> 52:00.560]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.760]  They help to create a new world order, we are part of a new world order, a new world

[52:18.080 --> 52:20.560]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.560 --> 52:25.680]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[52:25.680 --> 52:26.680]  world.
[52:26.680 --> 52:31.560]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.560 --> 52:34.080]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.080 --> 52:38.520]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[52:38.520 --> 52:39.520]  financial system.
[52:39.520 --> 52:44.040]  The global governance with the establishment of the G20, so it's going to be an inner ruling

[54:01.640 --> 54:08.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.640]  a war on for your mind.
[54:11.640 --> 54:15.760]  I'm going to go ahead and play this Super Bowl Motorola commercial and then we're going
[54:15.760 --> 54:18.920]  to come back in the next hour and start going to your calls it's so important but finishing
[54:18.920 --> 54:26.480]  up with the revenge of the Sith Episode 3 Star Wars allegory or parable to what's happening
[54:26.480 --> 54:35.160]  today you've got these coalitions that have been funded covertly by Emperor Palpatine
[54:35.160 --> 54:40.640]  he's not Emperor yet the head of the Senate to attack the Republic so the Republic erects
[54:40.640 --> 54:46.080]  a big police state military grid to counter it but then he uses that very grid to then
[54:46.080 --> 54:56.080]  enslave the Republic and then wipe out the other people that the banksters had had had
[54:56.080 --> 55:02.080]  funded and put into place and that's actually how Emperor Palpatine does it back when he's
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.760]  a senator he goes to the banking guild I mean George Lucas knows all this stuff he goes
[55:07.760 --> 55:14.280]  to the banking guild in Episode 1 a decade before and he gets them to finance his robot
[55:14.280 --> 55:19.960]  army to start wreaking havoc but he's doing it covertly through the occult the occult
[55:19.960 --> 55:27.280]  means secret he does it through his private intelligence agencies and again adults could
[55:27.280 --> 55:33.240]  not understand it even though it was a child's movie it was child level and they couldn't
[55:33.240 --> 55:36.440]  even understand it and that's what's happening with the destabilization of the Middle East
[55:36.440 --> 55:39.840]  that's what's happening with the globalist financing all of America's enemies building
[55:39.840 --> 55:45.880]  China up because they then play all these different groups off against each other because the
[55:45.880 --> 55:50.040]  answer to the tyranny of China were sold as tyranny here the answer to the corruption
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.120]  and tyranny of the Middle East is tyranny here that's how they sell it now shifting
[55:55.120 --> 55:59.280]  years briefly this is really shocking I'm gonna have Kurt post it the next 10 15 minutes

[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:07.920]  to talk to you i just wanted to touch on the egyptian situation i wanted to get your opinion
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.560]  and something i found that if you are didn't read about it yet the american thinker website
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.400]  it's uh... have you ever heard of that i think i have seen that yes it's conservative
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.600]  leading anybody could go on and just write their own articles of college professors
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.720]  are on their all types of people but what was interesting is yesterday someone posted
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:35.280]  in all first person uh... account of an egyptian student on the ground in cairo and um... we're
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.520]  still not sure if this was fake or not but then it came out about that uh... they gave
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.160]  the name of the person who posted it in uh... the account of the student in cairo it's a
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:51.600]  lot different than uh... with the mainstream media is telling us uh... mohammed al-bardi
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.880]  according to this and in his writing he's saying that he's an insult to the egyptians
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.400]  and uh... right here his quote is outside of western media hype al-bardi is a nothing
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.760]  a man that has spent less than thirty days in the past year in egypt and hardly any time
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.840]  in the past twenty years is a nobody it is a no and it's confirmed that al-bardi isn't
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.880]  uh... popular calling him a transitional figure over the dictatorship he's the globalist
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:25.880]  stooge and and and the real group the cis meeting with is the muslim brotherhood
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.920]  my grandpa watches cnn a lot there are reporting that only twenty percent of the population
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.480]  is embracing them so i mean if i'm not mistaken here it looks like um... the western agenda
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.640]  may not prevail in egypt it's still up in there what's going to happen there
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.440]  yeah but mubarak after obama told him to step down yesterday
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.960]  uh... you know he's saying he'll leave in september and i'm no fan of mubarak and the
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.680]  torture camps and the rest of it
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.240]  the issue is why are the globalists doing this and trying to put the muslim brotherhood
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.000]  in and that's because they want to destabilize
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.600]  uh... the middle east uh... good points appreciate the call eric
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.760]  wilson in florida you're on the air

[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.080]  in the united states
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.520]  the shining gem
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.440]  globalist one of you
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.680]  well you know the rest
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.920]  but i just got one quick question
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.600]  how how impossible is it
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.200]  for a place like egypt
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.760]  going to a revolution and come out with a united states constitution
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.360]  but egyptian
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.320]  one but with the exact same principles
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.240]  yeah you know that our government is saying oh we don't really want a
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.000]  democracy over there
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.080]  or or or republican forbid
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.440]  but you know at least something transitional a government that shares
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.200]  power that means a weaker government that'll be even more pliant
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.920]  uh... to the globalist and
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.240]  that's what's happening i mean it's now admitted
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.800]  that not even our government but these big banking cartels that the kind of
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.400]  uh... davos consensus
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.920]  once
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.480]  uh... to to get housing the barricada there and we know why they want the
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.600]  strategy of tension
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.840]  they're openly running the muslim brotherhood
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.840]  that's gonna now try to overthrow saudi arabia and all these other countries
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.400]  but not to bring liberty
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.880]  to bring even more hardcore islamic type republics
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.000]  into place
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  so then the new world order can have a better enemy to fight
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.040]  very unfortunate so
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.760]  basically if you think that they'll never be another america here in the
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.560]  world
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.480]  but the exact like
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.560]  one two ten amendments and everything well that's up to us but that's why the
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.600]  globalist want to destroy the name of america and put our name on all the
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.560]  crimes they're committing and use our tax money to fund this evil so that that
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.360]  idea of america's discredited so it won't be used as
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.400]  a challenge to their nineteen eighty four system they don't want the answer
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.760]  to nineteen eighty four

[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:48.240]  breaking down the ramifications of that plus the incredible cold hitting the

[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:59.320]  cold here in texas and al gore's back in the news saying this is global warming
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.880]  if it's cold it's global warming if it's hot it's global warming if it's mild
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.520]  it's global warming and of course the answer is pay him carbon taxes and of
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.600]  course don't make china or india or anybody else make any carbon cuts only
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.640]  the evil westerners got to make sure they cut those carbon outputs down as
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.520]  much as possible you've got to get government permission to have a
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.000]  fireplace or an outdoor space heater europe's banning those they tell you what
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.880]  type of toilets type of houses what type of air conditioners what type of
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.920]  appliances just total control with the president being set but i want to go
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.560]  back to your calls but i want to just restate this year we don't have a
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:46.520]  government it's been taken over by outside interest and these mega combines
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:53.960]  made up of major banks and the fortune 100 in every case desire tyranny they'll
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:00.160]  put communist in socialist fascist strongman authoritarian dictators that's
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.200]  what they've done all over the world over and over again the CIA and latin
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.640]  america over and over again sometimes multiple times per nation will put in
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:16.000]  right-wing or left-wing tyrannies as long as they oppress the people and
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.720]  basically hand the resources over to the new world order it's a giant game of
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:25.240]  world domination by the global corporations and so if they desire
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.560]  tyranny in every other country of course they want tyranny here and then we look
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.720]  at what is being manifest what is being lovingly built what is being rolled out
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.320]  according to every measurement it is classical oppression classical hardcore
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:45.000]  despotism tyranny slavery feudalism serfdom whatever name you want to slap
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.200]  on it it is what it is arose by any other name is still arose to quote
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:57.280]  shakespeare yet again so i was even blindsided by this look i get blindsided
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.800]  by things i remember back on 888 getting up at 630 in the morning and going
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:12.600]  online and seeing CNN headline russia attacks areas of georgia and we went
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.520]  with those articles on info wars dot com and present planet dot com but by the
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:22.760]  time i got into the office a few hours later and by the time i got on air i said
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.520]  we don't know what's happening this is very strange the reports out of europe
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:34.360]  and russia and the region are that the puppet of nato in georgia has attacked
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.240]  south ossetia and abkhazia and it took four days for cnn and fox to retract and
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.160]  say actually georgia did launch a sneak attack and went in and killed the russian
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:50.160]  peacekeepers and shelled people's apartment complexes and homes and just
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.920]  went door to door murdering people throwing hangar nades into into people's
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:02.880]  houses so i mean i have trouble dealing with these level of lies i get fooled by
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:08.160]  it sometimes because who could believe that they would go with the hoax that
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.600]  big and say that russia had a tag is that's am i saying russia's good or
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.160]  isn't corrupt no it's corrupt what did christ talk about wickedness in high
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.080]  places what is history show 98 percent of the time you have corruption you have
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.400]  tyrannies in place liberty is that shining rare jewel that thomas jefferson
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:34.000]  talked about and then they were bringing in nato troops and u.s. forces were
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.520]  landing and u.s. advisers were killed and the russians rolled in mobile medium
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.280]  range nuke trucks with nukes on the back and the head of the joint chiefs of
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.160]  staff went of the russians went on television this was all over foreign
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.040]  news and finally came out here and said we've moved nuclear weapons in and if
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.720]  you don't back off we're going to fire them we're preparing with for war with
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:05.400]  nato i mean that's how crazy these globalist are that gambit of of doing
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.400]  that and then people say well it's patriotic to say russia attacked alex and
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.360]  you need to be patriotic patriotic to the banking syndicate that controls nato
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.920]  in our country that would try to start world war three with the russians or
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.520]  was testing to see what the russians would do i mean image the world is a
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.960]  giant powder keg with 50 000 plus nuclear weapons in 11 countries hands most
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.240]  of it russia in the u.s. an image dick cheney who who it's now been
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.920]  declassified called for that and ran that operation running around with a
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:44.360]  giant flaming torch with with with with with red embers falling off all over a
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:51.520]  firework factory floor with black powder piled up all around his feet these
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.120]  people are destabilizing the world in their lust for total control they're
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.720]  dangerous their authoritarians they want tyranny and now they're doing
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.040]  something just as crazy openly and again i got blindsided by russia a
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:12.280]  situation on 888 the media saying they'd done it when they didn't a hundred
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.680]  percent that wasn't true and last week early last week i'm like oh there's no
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.600]  way our government would be throwing out their favorite dictator in the in the
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.040]  region this guy's got most the torture camps there he does whatever he's told
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:30.280]  but i began to look at it and said well clearly they knew that there was going
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.120]  to be a revolution they knew the people were angry they're tracking their
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.960]  twitter and they're googling and they know that there's major unrest over
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.680]  their brewing and so they trigger it to bring in their guy and even if that
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.120]  doesn't succeed it destabilizes everything and now
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:50.520]  the supposed government is on record the cia meeting with the muslim
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.480]  brotherhood a year ago and then again six months ago and then again a month
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.600]  ago openly getting ready for this and headlines
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:03.800]  us government you know uh funding and controlling opposition
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.200]  and then if you didn't need more evidence brzezinski comes out and says it
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.880]  kissinger comes out and says it and if you don't and if you need more evidence
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.720]  of what they're doing and how dangerous they are
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.840]  then obama comes out yesterday when it wasn't clear what mubarak was going to
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:24.680]  do it said yeah he needs to step down everybody's like yay democracy
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.760]  obama wants him to be free no he doesn't
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:34.200]  all they tell us all days about radical muslims and how dangerous they are
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:40.040]  and and and a group they control is now openly trying to overthrow other
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:44.360]  countries in the region this is a destabilization tactic and it shows
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.640]  how incredibly dangerous the new world order is
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:55.720]  it shows how risky they are and we've got to stop fighting with each
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:59.400]  other over nations we've got to realize there's a global corporate state
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.360]  and the answer to it is an awakening to their system
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.800]  because the road they're dragging us down is not a good
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.160]  place to go all right let's go to your calls
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.400]  um jason in georgia the new leo and others go ahead jason

[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:31.400]  look they set you up they led you down that river
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:35.880]  to a setup and they can try to hide the truth
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.040]  they it's not working the truth's getting out
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.240]  and uh these ballheaded wimps like melzer and that jag
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.120]  advocate general i mean and that woman she
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.560]  i want a bootlicker they come out of that jail
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.720]  kissing the police's ass i can't believe this well i understand you're angry but
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.520]  let's all try to watch our language because you can get out of control
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.800]  uh melzer's back on tomorrow so i definitely tune in for that because i've
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.960]  now had a chance to see the show and i said i'd do this on monday tuesday
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.280]  but i tend to not cover news i'm in as much as other talk show host would if
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  there's other more important things going on i tend to not get into
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:22.680]  uh uh you know kind of corollary uh or or even capillary
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.360]  issues but i tell you what i'll do at eight after next hour
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.520]  i'm going to play about five minutes of the show and i'm going to analyze it
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.000]  here and um yes they talk about what a great
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.360]  club it is and how they'd love to be members and
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.120]  you know it's almost like a fawning worshipfulness of it and
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.560]  then he also has me describing the ritual then he cuts it off and says and
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.320]  that's it that's all that happened no i said a lot more
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.720]  and that's not all uh that happened uh and then they don't
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.480]  basically describe that i escaped uh they just talk about how they got
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:03.160]  arrested uh and um but i'll say it's about as
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.120]  hardcore as you could imagine to get on history channel
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:12.120]  there was a discovery channel piece that a major
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.520]  uh director put together that i was in three and a half years ago
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.960]  and it was the biggest budget for a five-part series in the history of
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:26.040]  discovery channel 3.4 million they made the whole series and
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:31.320]  the um what joe bellinger's his name or belger he's been on as a guest
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.520]  he made brother's keeper he made some kind of monster
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.240]  i mean he's as big as it gets in documentary filmmaking except for somebody
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:41.240]  like michael more and uh they made the whole piece
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.760]  and then discovery channel just said we're shelving it we're not going to air
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.080]  it you know you didn't make alex jones look
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.920]  bad enough and he said he was given final cut
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.560]  and he had never seen uh anything like this in his career
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.240]  happen and so yeah that's what goes on but
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.800]  what do i do do i not take the field when nightline wants to come down here
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.680]  or msnbc do i not because even in them trying to take what i do and spinning it
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.480]  we're able to then illustrate it and and expose what they're doing but
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:19.400]  um one thing uh melzer did do that he kept his word on as he said
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.600]  you know don't worry you look pretty good in the piece and i think overall
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.480]  they didn't butcher what i had to say too much and they made me look credible
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.800]  because i was credible in the way i spoke but it was really kind of 50 50
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.440]  where they would show both sides but but kind of watered down what i had to say
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.800]  but then at the end melzer says that he doesn't particularly like the secrecy at
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.720]  the grove and and and every expert they talk to does say that
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.320]  basically it's bad what's going on there but overall it is a white wash and
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.160]  you're absolutely right uh and uh i will play a few minutes of that and
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:53.000]  analyze it uh the secret society bohemian grove special
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.680]  that aired last thursday night on the history channel and melzer is
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.760]  joining us uh tomorrow on the transmission

[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.160]  from a femo region five here in the uh
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.400]  wizard covered the state of illinois but it's global warming alex it's
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.760]  windshields uh in the negatives and uh you know it's our co2 at our greenhouse
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.640]  gas causing all this corruption uh catastrophe going on outside
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.360]  well remember and we have a clip of scent the late senator bird
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:18.440]  saying um eight years ago that we wouldn't have any more snow
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.880]  uh than they had this for sure with their global warming forecast
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.240]  uh and that we were basically all in deep trouble
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.160]  but then meanwhile al gore put a press release out on
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:36.520]  his al gore website al gore dot com uh saying that uh the snow is caused by
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.160]  climate change and global warming and uh saying that all of our carbon is
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.240]  causing it to build up in the atmosphere we've always had
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.920]  different weather the only thing that's constant about weather is change
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.960]  and everyone knows that and we've had real
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.720]  forecasters on who a year ago predicted the blizzards were now seeing
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.000]  because of sun activity the biggest driver is the sun
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.360]  they don't understand all of it but they know when the sun does certain things
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.280]  certain things happen here but the un said a year and a half ago
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.360]  uh that they can officially tell you that the sun has no effect on climate it's
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.800]  all humans it's our fault and the un is going to
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.920]  tax us and take our liberties and take our power plants
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:21.560]  and raise our energy prices and inspect our homes because they are the saviors
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.800]  of the earth aren't we lucky we have them
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.560]  yeah thank god for them uh quickly alex uh that last caller
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.520]  have a bunch of intel so i'm going to go quick that last caller talked about
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.360]  bohemian growth that episode on uh the history channel
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.640]  i thought it was a joke i'm a broadcasting major and brad melzer talking
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.920]  about by law they couldn't show your bohemian grow video
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.760]  i mean that's a crock because uh you are you know
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.440]  investigating these people who are violating the logan act but either way
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.680]  anyone who's a grateful dead fan bob weir has been a member of the grow
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.440]  according to a daily mail article they talk about praising
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.960]  a woman who is in a who's a bond girl from the 1980s she's a like a big figure
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.400]  there anyways um alex with this blizzard i know you're going to talk about it
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:10.280]  later in your show um i think personally over the last four
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.200]  days we've been chemtrail pretty hard and i'm sure it's been going up going on
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:18.200]  all throughout the uh states that were affected by this blizzard
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.120]  i think that uh we're having some weather modification going on in terms of
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.560]  intensifying this well there's no thinking about it
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:29.400]  uh the big wild card here is that governments and private corporations the
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.280]  department of energy the british government the australian the
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.880]  german government they all admit now they're doing geoengineering and what
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.640]  the old timers 15 years ago who got samples of chemtrails
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.720]  said their barium salts aluminum dioxide and uh and other things
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.000]  and then guess what the white house science are says oh we've been doing
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.480]  tests in the last 15 years but now we're looking at going
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.680]  you know full tilt with geoengineering to save the earth from global warming
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:00.520]  and bill gates is invested in it and this is all real
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.600]  and so even if it's not intentional weather modification has ripple effects
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.960]  but we can't say that blizzards are caused by it because we've always had
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.240]  blizzards but but but clearly when the government admits and the
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.560]  secretary of defense back in 97 cohen gave a press conference army
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.120]  times said we have weather weapons others have
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.480]  weather weapons the chinese uh brag they can control the
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.080]  weather the russians do but the media out of one side of its
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.120]  mouth makes fun of you if you talk about weather control and manipulation
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:31.400]  and weather weapons but out of the other side of the mouth
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.000]  tells you how great it is and we have a big video speaking of that i appreciate
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.680]  your call julio it's going up today now
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.920]  six years ago when this stuff got declassified in 2005
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.000]  and i noticed that had been declassified that they declassified up into the 80s
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.760]  the weather weapons weather modification program of the navy
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:55.000]  and the army and air force they declassified part of it and in there
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.640]  was ben livingston the director of the program
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.640]  so we did a little google search found out where ben livingston worked
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.000]  where he lives in the panhandle of texas that he runs a weather modification
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.600]  company as their head meteorologist one of the biggest a private one
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.520]  i call him up get him on the air fly him to austin interviewing
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:16.040]  and back then our cameras our technology wasn't as good now we've taken the old
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.920]  interview with all the other stuff you never saw put
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.760]  together an hour long special presentation a lot of it new

[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.040]  stanford research institute and the army war college
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.480]  the no the the naval weapons laboratory excuse me
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.320]  certify certify that they could create hurricanes
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.080]  kill hurricanes strengthen them weaken them
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:54.920]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:00.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.800]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.560]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.160]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.240]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:29.160]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.680]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.800]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.920]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.680]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:45.560]  powered generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.120]  ships will pass in the night and speak each other and passing
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:08.280]  only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:11.720]  so on the ocean of life we pass and speak
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:17.160]  one another only a look and a voice the darkness again
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.760]  and a silence
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.600]  and i care about humanity i know that my life is short i know that through
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.240]  humanity i will live on through my progeny
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.720]  and through my progeny that will commune with your progeny

[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.000]  trying to keep people in the dark about knowledge
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.960]  so that they can be manipulated and controlled
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:51.320]  i want to empower society and the works of the new world order the fruits of
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.840]  the globalist are pure evil they are so
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:00.440]  incredibly destructive at every level
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.520]  and that's why it's so important that all of us realize
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:08.680]  that our lives are like a pebble thrown into a pond
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:14.760]  and they send out ripples throughout time and space in history and that when
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.200]  you just speak up for the truth when you stand up for what's right
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.480]  when you help a little old lady across the street when you don't fight with
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.880]  your wife when you don't fight with your neighbors
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.960]  over petty issues but get involved and fight for liberty and freedom
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.400]  we can change the world together i'm going to go back to george
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:36.440]  nathan rob john scott uh and others then i want to get into minority report
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:41.560]  companies push for ubiquitous iris scanning and what this
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.920]  system really means first i want to after we take calls get into the
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.240]  situation and the latest developments unfolding obviously in egypt but
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.320]  folks know basically the course of where that's going global destabilization
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:57.800]  and the strategy of tension towards a clash of civilizations
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.760]  but before i go any further here you heard me talking about the ben
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.760]  livingston video and every december in january we always
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.680]  offer the five months free at prison planet dot tv i don't think we've ever
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.400]  gone into february still offering the special
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.920]  quite frankly i wanted to get the ben livingston special report on weather
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.880]  weapons out last week and it had some encoding upload problems and
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.760]  sometimes videos go up no problems sometimes they have a bug
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:28.200]  or a gremlin in there and there's endless problems it finally got uploaded
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.560]  yesterday watson's doing an article about it today
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.080]  and i wanted to have that last video out as a special
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.880]  uh while we were asking folks to sign up and you pay for six point seven months
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.600]  and you get five point three months free and we do that every
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.040]  january uh every december and january now
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.160]  obviously we're into february we're going to end this in the next few days but
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.160]  i wanted to have that special coincide and end
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.960]  with this special weather weapons uh production that we've done we've got a
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.760]  lot of other special productions that are beginning i'll be going up the next

[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:36.200]  that's going to be like a two hour special going up on prison planet dot tv
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.400]  it's having a big effect and waking a lot of people up and every subject under

[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.280]  hear from you but also get to the news george in connecticut you're on the
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.120]  year welcome good to speak to with you alexa
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:12.760]  julio spoke stole a little by thunder i was going to ask about the
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.280]  cam trails but what i'm really trying to ask is how do you find out where
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.560]  they're flying out of i'm on the new york uh connecticut border and i see
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.760]  these these clowns constantly chris coursing the skies
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.040]  and it's got to be out of one of the things here and there's a type of
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.080]  information if we could find out for all the regions so that we can call these
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.800]  people up and put them on notice that we're aware of what's okay well let's
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.920]  explain what's happening anything a government does
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.760]  they compartmentalize so most people who are involved in it don't even know so
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.880]  there's a lot of layers there are thousands uh if you type in geo
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.880]  engineering weather modification if you type in uh
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.040]  out you know aerosol uh atmosphere campaign
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.640]  literally your department of energy every other major government
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.680]  major universities private corporations so there's not
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:04.600]  one program going on so a a lot of its publicly admitted but it's all broken
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.800]  up and compartmentalized like a jigsaw puzzle that hadn't been put together
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.440]  yet okay b because so much of the programs are
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.200]  secret it's admitted the programs are going on but they but the details are
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.200]  secret we don't know exactly what they're doing that's why
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:26.120]  it shouldn't be secret uh under us code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1520 a
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.040]  paragraph b that the government for research purposes
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:35.000]  this is a un treaty as well can test chemicals biologicals radiologicals or
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.240]  anything else they want on domestic populations governments just aren't
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.480]  allowed to do it to each other that's us code title 50 chapter 32 subsection
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.400]  1520 a paragraph b if you want to pull that up
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.440]  so it says you're not allowed to do testing unless it's part of research so
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.520]  that's why holdren two years ago when he first got in the science are
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.880]  there's so much heat on this he went ahead and came out and said
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.800]  yeah there is weather modification geo engineering going on
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.720]  if this was a dead planet it'd be called terraforming that's bearing a planet to
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.720]  life but this is the opposite or something different it's it's not really
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.520]  the opposite it's manipulation of the current
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:19.640]  climate system on a planetary scale and so because they're doing research
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.840]  you know they can quote keep it secret it shouldn't be secret
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.120]  there should be congressional hearings this information should be brought out
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.240]  because we don't know if they're manipulating the weather and causing
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.760]  this currently we just know they have weather manipulation programs going on
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.440]  so is it inadvertent or is this just a regular weather cycle
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.680]  i mean they've trained the ignorant mass that oh my gosh it wasn't that cold
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.800]  last winter and now it's real cold this winter it's the end of the world
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.760]  there's always cycles and so uh george i don't know because we don't know
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.600]  we just know that these these things are going on but because they're secret we
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.720]  don't know exactly what's going on what about the u n uh urenberg trials and
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.920]  things like this i mean the rules like that because they're this chemical is
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:06.040]  is bringing down our immune systems we know that from various uh reports and
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.280]  things like that well there is a 19 in fact guys i want to
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.080]  make sure my memory is correct there's a 1977
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.120]  u n weather modification treaty just type in u n weather modification treaty it's
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:22.360]  77 or 78 i'm pretty sure it's 77 you can read it
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:26.920]  legislation's been introduced by kasinich uh going back a decade ago
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.640]  or nine years ago to bar weather modification so so government all knows
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.480]  this is going on it's just again quasi-secret but uh great
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.640]  points george um look there are clearly
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.680]  weather modification aircraft out there that's admitted
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:46.120]  but people point at regular aircraft and say well it's leaving a condensation
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.360]  trail too low uh it's it's staying there for hours clearly it's not
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.200]  ice crystals and then they get tested groups have gone up flown up and
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.440]  captured it and it's barium salts limit oxide and and other variants of that
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:01.800]  and that's exactly what they now admit is being done in these tests but then
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.080]  we have found so many patents i've been working for two years or more on a
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.600]  chemtrail film we have found so many patents
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:13.720]  it's all there in plain view where they mix it with the jet fuel the kerosene
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.680]  and so the companies the airlines don't even know
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  it's designed to disperse these weather modifying nuclei
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:27.160]  that forms clouds through the jet engines it's a perfect dispersal mechanism
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:31.080]  so yes there are aircraft with nozzles that are specifically designed with
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.440]  other forms of weather modification but they're also doing it through
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:39.320]  the jet fuel through the jet fuel that's why you'll see a commercial jet right
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.760]  by another commercial jet in the same strata of the atmosphere
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.920]  one isn't leaving a trail the other is or one leaves a trail that dissipates in
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.760]  seconds or minutes that is a condensation ice crystal trail
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.000]  off the wingtips and another one doesn't you know me
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.560]  one puts one out that stays there for hours and i heard a talk show on
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.240]  jenesis sunday driving into work listening to it on 90.1
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:08.200]  and i you know the hosts are nice guys i tried to call in
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:11.640]  they gave me about 30 seconds of them and then went to break and they were like
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.320]  oh alex you know you know maybe this is going on maybe not no no it's all
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:18.280]  admitted it it's all admitted and then another
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.080]  caller called in because you know always talk about spider goats and
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.240]  stole my thunder that wasn't trying to get to next
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.920]  it's almost like a psychic connection or something with that caller and said well
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.800]  people talk about spider goats 10 years ago and get laughed at just because
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:32.520]  people weren't aware of it but it's admitted
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.360]  they have you know part spider part goat creatures that create body armor
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:40.600]  i talked about that yesterday so i mean it's not my fault that i'm informed so
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.120]  i'm the weirdo because i'm because i do research
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  and so it's like people think just because they don't know about something
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:52.280]  that then it doesn't exist and if if you're walking around in the field at
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.960]  night and there's a hundred foot pit in it and you're going to fall in and break
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:00.360]  your legs bare minimum just because you don't know the pit
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.480]  you know is there does that mean the pit isn't there
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.240]  i mean if a tree falls in the forest but you didn't see it fall over
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.040]  does it mean it didn't fall over you're walking through the forest you see a
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.000]  tree that fell over you didn't see it fall over but you can see where it
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.440]  cracked and broke and fell over i mean you can look at it and say the tree fell
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.320]  over let's see they didn't see the tree fall
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.520]  they're not going to look at the tree falling and so there's going to say
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.520]  hey doesn't exist uh nathan in ohio you're on the
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:31.800]  air just like hey hey i just like to start out
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.760]  by thanking you and it goes back to the kim
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:37.320]  trails uh that everybody's been seeing i'm in
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.400]  date in ohio close to right pad airport space
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.560]  can you hear me out this camera i'm sorry and uh
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.960]  the kin trails were amazing they were there six at least 600 lines up in the
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:53.000]  sky but last night when the power went out
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.640]  and datan right before i heard thunder and i was walking out the back door
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:00.120]  because the lights had flickered but come back on
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:04.200]  and then i seen the brightest white flash up in this
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:07.480]  it lit up everything almost blinded me for a second
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:11.320]  and my neighbors come out they're like what was that nathan you know because
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.080]  i inform them on what's going on so they come to me with their questions
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.000]  and i i didn't have an answer but today they they try telling us
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.080]  in kettering ohio a power line had busted over a main
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.320]  and that's the whole guy and i just i thought that was kind of
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:34.920]  and i'm 20 miles away from that town well interesting uh nathan you know
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.360]  there are all sorts of different types of lightning
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.360]  one time when my dad was a kid on the farm there was a tornado
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.960]  uh down the road and ball lightning formed
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:49.640]  and came into their house a big giant blue ball
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:53.560]  floated around for about 30 seconds went through the living room
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:57.800]  and then up the chimney on the stove because they like to follow metal
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:02.920]  and went went you know hit the stove went into the stove and then went out
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:09.720]  uh through the uh stove chimney and so you know there's a lot of natural
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:12.920]  crazy things going on but i i can't really comment on it because i didn't see
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.880]  what you saw but i appreciate your call uh again because of all of this being
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:22.520]  secret we don't know what's going on but i know this
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:26.760]  16 years ago before this weather modification program started
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.120]  most the time in texas there were beautiful pristine
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:35.240]  deep blue skies ultra gorgeous just not a cloud in the sky
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.080]  for months out of the year off and on totally beautiful
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:48.600]  i never never never never never never never never never
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:55.080]  never i mean it is incredible see a clear sky anymore
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:59.400]  and every once in a while i'll get up at six in the morning
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.720]  go outside drinking coffee the sun comes up and it's a sky and then here come the
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.840]  jets and within two hours it's just solid
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.800]  trails and then they form into cloud banks
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:14.840]  now what does john p holdren say what does the white house say they say that
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:18.280]  we have a deteriorating atmosphere it's not global warming or even climate
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.000]  change now it's a it's a deteriorating atmosphere
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.680]  that's one of their talking points why would the globalist have a giant
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:30.040]  now global it's going on all over the world now it's been phased in they've
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:33.080]  tested it here in europe why would they have this huge
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.640]  program that's got to cost hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:41.720]  to work with the mass distributors of jet fuel
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.400]  to have them covertly mix the chemicals in
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.920]  so that then it disperses nuclei that then form
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:56.840]  uh haze uh or clouds well holdren says that the atmosphere is
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:01.560]  deteriorating but it's classified well i've seen the film trinity
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.840]  the trinity project with william shatner and uh this is all declassified that
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.200]  was public when they did it back in the 50s and 60s
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:13.400]  hundreds of times in fact there's film footage in it that the uh
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:18.200]  that the army shot out in uh a new mexico and also they shot video in
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:22.520]  um nevada and other places where it shows these missiles
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:28.040]  at night lined up scores of them firing them into the upper atmosphere
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:31.880]  and you see giant white nuclear explosions
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:37.400]  up in the upper atmosphere and they said we're just seeing what it would do
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:41.240]  it's kind of like oh let's on 888 two and a half years ago let's attack the
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:45.960]  russians and see what they do and they said on the special
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.480]  that the pentagon thought that it might have ignited
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:52.200]  they thought one of the things that could have happened was that the
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.880]  atmosphere would be ignited they thought the same thing might happen in
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.400]  fact the majority of scientists in the manhattan project when they tested the
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:05.160]  a bomb a few months before they dropped it uh on
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:09.480]  harashima and nagasaki and by the way people that say they couldn't carry out
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.640]  9 11 and keep it secret they were testing a bombs out in the desert
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.480]  and keeping it secret from people what was that big explosion we don't know
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:21.480]  then they go and drop it on the japanese and the world's told about it
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:24.520]  tens of thousands more than that i see hundreds of thousands were involved in
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:28.200]  the manhattan project they kept that secret but but that's not the issue i'm
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.160]  getting at here but everything's interconnected
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:37.480]  listen to me the globalist did hundreds and hundreds of high altitude
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:41.720]  test where they would shoot high powered high megaton
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:46.360]  high yield nuclear weapons into different areas of the atmosphere
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.720]  and during the manhattan project when they were testing them at at at sea level
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:56.680]  dropping them from a tower the majority of their scientists believed
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.040]  that there was a good chance it was going to ignite the oxygen in the
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:06.280]  atmosphere and burn the atmosphere of the earth off
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.120]  i mean this is all on mainline record if you want to go look it up
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:14.600]  and they still did it and you get enough of these experiments with the
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.000]  hadron collider and the nukes and all of it
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.480]  who knows what they did who knows if they blew big holes in the atmosphere
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:25.800]  and our atmosphere is spilling out to space marz lost its atmosphere
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:30.200]  it's got water all over it nice caps clearly once had water flowing over it
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.840]  lost its atmosphere because it's smaller doesn't have as big of a
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:38.360]  gravitational pull to hold in oxygen and other gases
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.400]  i mean who knows maybe they are trying to repair the atmosphere
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.240]  the point is they're not telling us and they're the ones
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:51.560]  who in one night i forget the number but it's dozens of nukes going off in
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:55.480]  the atmosphere seeing if they could cause a magnetic
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:59.960]  emp wave and it did blow out transistors all over the
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:03.080]  planet hi this is alex jones did you know that the
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.440]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.720]  vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.840]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:16.120]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.440]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.200]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.960]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:29.640]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.920]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.360]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.800]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at

[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:44.520]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.600]  to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.240]  what does it say about the scientific technocratic elite
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:18.440]  that they openly admit that many of the experiments they've done could
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:23.000]  destroy life on this planet or damage it greatly and they just do it
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.960]  and they write books talking about why they've done it
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:30.440]  it's it's beyond nihilism and it's the ultimate power trip for these people to
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.480]  know how the world works to know how to manipulate their fellow
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:37.720]  mankind and to hoard all this technology to themselves
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.400]  and that's why i get mad at folks that only care about the super bowl coming up
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:44.600]  that's why i get mad at people that aren't even concerned about dollar
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.680]  devaluation and what that means to all of our lives and our economy
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:55.960]  i mean there's so many serious hardcore incredibly dangerous things going on
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.520]  and we need to have a bigger debate about this we need to get control of our
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:03.480]  governments we need to get rid of all this secrecy and find out what these
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:06.760]  lunatics are up to because what we know they're doing is so
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.840]  criminal so crazy so bad what else don't we know
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.880]  is what i'm trying to get out here so it's genetic engineering who knows what
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:19.800]  that's going to do to the planet that's a real environmental threat admittedly
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.640]  but they're got everybody obsessed about carbon dioxide it's it's it's crazy
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.560]  let's go ahead and go to rob in west virginia rob you're on the air
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:37.480]  hey alex hey uh i've got uh i work with someone from the

[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.880]  that's that an organization that's working in stealth with the obama
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.520]  administration known as right haven as soon websites in order to shut down
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.120]  political opposition yeah that's been uh that's been
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.960]  covered uh widely and uh and i and i appreciate your call sir i really do

[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.840]  organization went up for folks with the claimer copyright infringements i know
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:13.800]  they've uh those those cases are being battled and i
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.360]  appreciate your call uh let's go ahead and take another call here
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:22.280]  let's talk to john in michigan john you're on the air
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.840]  hey alex how you doing good hey i want to point out that you've been proven
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.880]  right again uh in case this goes under the radar
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.080]  there was some time ago you made a comment and it was in the context of a
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:37.320]  news article that highlighted the use of prison labor in the event of a
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:42.200]  martial law type scenario and uh pretty much your comment was that when the
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.240]  hammer actually comes down one of the first things that happened
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:49.160]  is that the prisons will be empty to fuel violence and chaos
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.240]  yeah that was done in uh that was done in egypt again they have a playbook they
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:57.160]  use uh what reporter you specifically talking about
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:02.440]  uh i'll just be reported yesterday and uh they reported yesterday in a video
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.800]  titled thousands escaped egypt prisons that
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.000]  extremely well armed looters took on the prison
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.200]  and busted it open and freed all the prisoners
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.800]  yeah well the reports confirmed uh that was uh four days ago
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.000]  in al-jazeera and a bunch of other uh publications
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.360]  out of egypt was that they would catch these people and they'd be police
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:25.880]  officers or military uh and that they're doing this as part of a
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:29.400]  destabilization campaign uh and so certainly some of that's
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:34.280]  going on it's just not clear who they're working for because a lot of the army
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:38.120]  and the security forces have been trained in the west
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.880]  uh in fact the top generals just so happened last week to already be in
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:46.520]  dc uh and at the pentagon the top egyptian
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.520]  brass and so yes i i did see those reports we did cover that
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:55.880]  i think back on monday that that is indeed going on
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:59.480]  yep that's all i got all right thank you so much very interesting points on
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:03.400]  that front yeah look um we're going to find out
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:06.120]  more about what's happening in egypt as it unfolds but
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:10.120]  it's now not denied and even i am blown away by it
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:13.080]  that the people running things are so ruthless
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:19.000]  that they would undermine their own dictator and then try to put in the
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.440]  muslim brotherhood to stir up trouble i mean it just shows
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:26.120]  in every case the muslim extremists are financed controlled protected
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:30.440]  who did they use to overthrow areas of syria muslims
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:33.960]  who do they use to attack the russians the muslims and then who do they use to
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:36.600]  take our liberties here at home the muslims
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:42.520]  who do they protect and get on aircraft the muslims
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:49.960]  thank you for listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:54.920]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it

[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.760]  work might not agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:06.440]  government employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse

[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:52.920]  curt haskell one of the survivors of the christmas day bombing with clear evidence of government
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:58.200]  involvement in those attacks key information integrated in with all the new wiki leaks
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:02.600]  regurgitated propaganda about al-qaeda that is coming up right now let's go to robert in
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:11.160]  oklahoma robert you're on the air hello alex yes sir how you doing good first time caller
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:16.360]  longtime listener well good to have you on board thank you sir good talk to you hey i like to make
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:24.440]  two points about global warming if i may number one they keep considering about the sun not being
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:30.600]  a major role it is without that there is no weather because it keeps the surface of the earth
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:36.920]  which causes formations of high and low pressure all of the flints that's occurring all over the
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:42.600]  world and plus it aids in the movement of the jet string well they know that it's the main driver
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:48.600]  and that that shows their contempt for the public that they tell you the sun has no effect on climate
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:55.080]  exactly but it does i don't understand why they keep saying that it doesn't it's like saying gasoline
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:04.040]  93 octane has nothing to do with your car running number two is that i keep hearing all these global
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:09.640]  warmers complaining about carbon dioxide going up into the atmosphere by man when they forget one
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:15.720]  time how many active volcanoes belt out so much tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere they
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:21.160]  know humans don't even lift it by one half of a percent on record they know volcanoes one big
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.880]  volcano puts out more than all humans have in the last hundred years they know all that
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.920]  it's their excuse to seize control of all the infrastructure and to tell you what you can do
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:36.760]  on your own property it they're making carbon dioxide a toxic waste while telling you fluoride
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:42.360]  a toxic waste is good for you it's a power grab excuse and people keep thinking they're environmentalist
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:48.120]  wackos and that they're ignorant or stupid they're not stupid they know exactly what they're doing
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:56.520]  great points robert bond in illinois you're on the air hi alex how are you i'm good okay um
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:03.160]  thank you very much for having dr wade field on uh as a parent of a child that well actually
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:08.680]  not considered a child anymore he's an adult an adult who has autism um
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.400]  there are so many questions out there and no answers uh but here's one for you
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:21.560]  and it's a major point that's never been brought up why do you think there are so many autistic
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:30.120]  children and mainly boys well because uh the uh mercury and other additives and studies even with
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:36.360]  male monkeys have shown that it has a bigger effect on males okay can i bring something up
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:44.120]  sure okay uh when my son was finally put into a specialized school for kids who are autistic it was
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:52.200]  put in it was a school within a school okay it was mainly in a college and uh you can say
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:04:00.360]  that the government was actually running all of this um they had a program uh for the kids it was
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:07.960]  some kind of ceremony and me being a parent that uh no one ever listened to me when i kept
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:13.640]  saying he was autistic and they didn't believe me and then to find out that he was i overheard
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:22.840]  something that raised a red flag and that was oh don't they make the perfect little soldier
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:26.280]  and it wasn't the first time that i heard that
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.080]  so you're saying they basically with those that are not as damaged as much as others that it
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:41.800]  basically makes an automaton or somebody that can carry out good good jobs or just tell them what to
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.920]  do and they'll do it oh i i hear you i mean there's no doubt they're doing all of this to reduce
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:56.120]  IQs and damage people and they're slowly phasing in all of these man-made diseases anthropogenic
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:02.280]  diseases uh and it's it's eugenics bottom line thanks for the call diamond gusset is proud to

[02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:02.520]  again go to gusset dot com forward slash america today this is alex jones with five good reasons
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:07.720]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:12.680]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:17.960]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:23.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:28.520]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:33.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:38.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:42.840]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.560]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:53.640]  at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:59.240]  own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:05.160]  three six five you've heard alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:09.880]  system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:14.120]  function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:19.560]  anywhere in or on the body my name is mario safaldi and i'm the developer of the silver
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:24.600]  lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.960]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:37.480]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:43.320]  lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:50.360]  minute video tour of the silver lung system at www dot silver lungs dot com to learn more about how
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:55.720]  the silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:59.560]  that's www dot silver lungs dot com
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:08.920]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:16.120]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network all right in the next 20 minutes or so i'm going to break
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:24.440]  down rad melzers decoded episode last thursday the premiere of the secret societies episode
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:28.440]  and it's 45 minutes long it's an hour long program but we're going to just play a few
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:34.280]  minutes of it here and analyze it and break it down i'll be stopping the video throughout it but
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.560]  we've got melzer coming on tomorrow and i'll ask him some pointed questions then when he comes back
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:45.320]  on with us obviously if i'm too mean to him he won't come on the show and be grilled he's a nice
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:50.120]  enough fellow on the surface i don't buy his interview last week where he said oh he was doing
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:55.800]  masonic signs for usa today and didn't know they were and his wife said oh don't you know that and
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.120]  oh he's in with george herbert walker bush and he's part of the inner circle but he didn't know
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:06.520]  but he didn't know what that means and ha ha ha but look what do you expect them to put on national
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:13.480]  tv it caused a huge response to people going online to find out about my infiltration and to see
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:19.560]  the real video of the ritual that the old men take very seriously and the biggest thing melzer did
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:25.240]  was keep saying it was illegal what alex jones did so that's a way to assassinate my character
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:34.040]  when i did that 11 years ago almost 11 years ago uh july of 2000 so 10 and a half years ago
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:40.840]  when i did that they didn't charge me they didn't press charges they didn't come after me because
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:46.360]  i looked at the law and i was ready to go to court and defend myself you got presidents vice president
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:52.840]  cia directors in their bragging and annals they've released to uh several uh berkeley and other
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:57.720]  universities in california in the last 50 years where they created the manhattan project they
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:01.960]  created the star wars project they launched it they you know conceived it decided to get funding
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:08.520]  for it that they set policy there it violates the logan act it's federal law and that's why they
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:15.160]  can't prosecute people that try to sneak into bill deberg because the the press has a right to know
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:21.640]  what's going on they got a right to go in there and get drunk uh and and and i'd be i guess it's
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:26.600]  illegal to bring in the gay porn stars that the new york post and others and vanity fair report
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:32.520]  they bring in to have sex with uh but the point is the public has a right to know what's going on
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.600]  and i went in for five hours i hid out i was told on july 15th the ritual would be done one of many
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:44.280]  i caught it on tape got it out to the world okay and they said they were going to use it but then
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.200]  their lawyers last minute said they couldn't and then melts her repeats over and over again
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:52.840]  what alex did was illegal what alex did was illegal and now claims there's some new law
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:58.120]  in california about hidden video well that's in someone's private place this has government
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:04.200]  involved setting policy and it should be public and that law didn't exist 10 and a half years ago
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:09.640]  okay so it's not retroactive and i had arguments with him about that then he goes on and lets me
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:13.320]  talk a little bit about the ritual and says and that's it that's all that happens in the ritual
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:18.760]  no i explained they they took it deadly serious when it was going on it wasn't just theatrical
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.840]  and of course theater comes from ancient religions they did it on a stage you go to a
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:27.000]  baptist church it's theater you know they're up there on a stage and and it's all done in that
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:33.320]  style and you're watching and so there's so many points to this but then there's the groveling
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:38.760]  you know how great the grove is and it's a great club now it's pretty much 50 50 they show both sides
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:43.720]  which i guess is journalistic in their view but there you other character assassination things in
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:53.320]  there that maybe make it 60 40 on the side of the grove and they do talk to four different experts
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:57.400]  i'm one of them and they all agree what's wrong is that they're setting policy and secret and
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:01.400]  melzer at the end says he thinks what's going on there is wrong at a certain level so there's
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:06.360]  some redeeming qualities to it and the fact is i think overall it's positive that it's on tv why
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:12.200]  is it on tv now though because of the internet alternative media we're forcing mainline dinosaur
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:17.880]  old media to cover things if they're going to stay relevant so we're forcing them to have to even do
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:23.160]  these white washes they'd rather not in the last 10 and a half years cover it and they haven't so it
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:29.160]  shows that times are a change in let's go ahead and play a few minutes of the program towards the
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:33.080]  middle the whole thing is online at the history channel for free if you want to go watch it we
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.080]  also linked to it at info wars dot com but here's part of it we'll be stopping it throughout when i
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:44.680]  make comments so my knowledge only one man has ever snuck into the grove during their july event
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:50.760]  in the year 2000 alex jones actually managed to covertly record the cremation of care ceremony
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.920]  and while i want to hear how he interprets what he saw there but i'm really hoping is he'll tell
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:13:03.240]  buddy mac and scott how he got inside other members of the press have gotten in but they've always
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:11.800]  been arrested and had their film confiscated and in july of 2000 i snuck in and shot some hidden video
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:19.800]  the only video to ever get out of the grove how did you manage to sneak in i basically came to the
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:26.680]  main gate and crawled down through the swamp and then went up and got into the main parking area
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:33.000]  where they have these big open backed trucks that come in and take the members in and i basically
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  just climbed on to the truck with some other members had a conversation with them and then they
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.840]  stopped us at an internal checkpoint and some security people climbed on asking us what group
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:49.400]  we were with and i knew enough about some of the club's names inside to tell them i was part of the
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:54.760]  hillbillies which is the texas delegation uh the bushes and their friends and your accent worked
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:14:01.160]  and yeah i gotta say you kind of look apart so alex jones actually sneaks into bohemian
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:07.240]  grove with a video camera and he shoots the footage of what he saw legally we're not allowed to show
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.480]  it to you because he broke the law and obtained it but i've seen it and it is pretty compelling
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:20.280]  pause wow judge jury and executioner brad melzer is now we don't even need courts in
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:26.760]  this country or juries he just i broke the law i'm a criminal just absolutely really nobody
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:33.320]  charged me nobody sued me knock on wood nobody came after me why because i'm not stupid i went
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:38.280]  and looked at the law i went and looked at the law and i studied it and i believed it was about
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:44.920]  80 20 80 percent on my side i believed i could defend myself to a jury of peers and the grove
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:52.680]  isn't stupid this is where the elite are meeting they know that as well so let's continue did you
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:56.280]  ever think you were going to get found out alex while you were in there oh the whole time and i
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:01.720]  basically just sat behind a building on the grass for the next two and a half hours or so and then
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:07.800]  as it got dark i then went out to witness the cremation of care ritual i'm wondering why you
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:12.520]  wanted to get in there in the first place well i had begun to research sculling bones sculling
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:19.560]  bones at Yale bohemian groves where they all get together people love blaming things on sculling
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:24.360]  bones the rumors run rampant about the legendary secret yell fraternity let's stop there they've
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.480]  been accused this they've been accused of stealing geronimo's bones no in federal court cases it's
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:35.320]  admitted they have it but the court's rule they can keep it they went and grave robbed um it's
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:41.880]  admitted and then i have the annals of the bohemian grove i have been sent one of them by a widow
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:45.720]  and were able to purchase two more of them they come out every 10 years they're only given to
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:50.040]  members and i've been able to get a hold of them they sell in some cases for thousands of dollars
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:58.440]  apiece and so i know what they say about it and the nomenclature uh the uh the words they use
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:04.200]  the president who was the first person who was a president to go there uh he was a founder of
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:10.680]  sculling bones his father was a founder all of them were involved and the big political group
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:17.720]  that went and took it over around 1900 been around since 1872 was all sculling bones and
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:23.240]  helmut schmitt in his book talks about it basically being a sculling bones uh version and uh back in
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:28.280]  the 1880s as one of the other fraternities snuck into sculling bones and there on the wall was a
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:35.560]  plaque from the bavarian illuminati saying you are our second chapter in the new world one chapter
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:41.000]  in germany one chapter in new heaven connecticut so i mean just incredible to see everybody likes
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.720]  to blame things on sculling bones like like i'm blaming things and then gives no proof of how
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:51.480]  i'm wrongly blaming it then he says now when you're interpreting a ritual as an outsider you don't
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:58.440]  know how to interpret it i went to mainline uh professors of religion i went to christian professors
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.600]  i did research we know what they're doing there we understand it's not like we're idiots on the
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:10.360]  outside and don't know we have their annals let's continue the bones of geronimo poncho via and even
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:17.080]  our eighth president martin van buren but none of that has ever been proven the club taps members
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:22.040]  of the yell junior class to join its ranks and past members have included william f buckley john
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:28.520]  carry both presidents bush and of course the late president william howard taft and it was william
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:34.040]  howard taft uh the president who came here to the behemian grove uh who of course was the uh uh
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:40.120]  high-level sculling bones member who first began to talk about a world government a league of nations
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:46.360]  which was then picked up a few years later by woodrow wilson and so uh this whole system
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:52.360]  is their plan for a world government and it is based on a germanic death cult and you've got all
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:56.920]  these world leaders and all these powerful people together before they have the ritual beneath these
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.040]  giant redwoods in this huge hall of the mountain king is what it's like uh it's scary you're talking
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.960]  about a new world order you're talking about a conspiracy about these people getting together
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:10.360]  and talking about stuff it's gonna basically bring us all down and we're still here i know the
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.440]  direction these guys are taking back up a few seconds oh there's this big world government
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:19.400]  this big conspiracy but we're all still here implying i'm making all this up we're losing
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:23.880]  our liberties we're in illegal wars they're getting rid of the bill of rights and constitution
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:27.640]  they're putting fluoride in the water they got telescreens up telling a spy on our neighbors
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.240]  the government's openly calling for internet kill switches and the fairness doctrine to
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:36.680]  end talk radio as we know it no we're going into the world government they've been building the empire
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:40.760]  and profiting from it it's like somebody saying i can't believe something could last for generations
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:46.520]  really that's what true power does is try to transcend their own deaths and pass it on i mean
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:51.640]  how do you have thousand-year-old universities in europe people who founded it have been dead
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.760]  for hundreds and hundreds of years because it's an institution that people get power in
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:03.080]  and then they pass that power on and grow the power of that institution so just amazing let's
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:07.640]  continue is what it's like it's scary you're talking about a new world order you're talking
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:11.720]  about a conspiracy about these people getting together and talking about stuff it's going to
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:16.120]  basically bring us all down and we're still here i know the direction these guys are taking us in
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:22.040]  is undemocratic you've got all these ci directors attorney generals vice presidents presidents
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:29.480]  you have the former german chancellor helmut schmitt he says we have our own druidic groves
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:35.160]  in germany but my favorite place to go and he calls it druidic is northern california groves
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:41.080]  have held a sacred place in the lore of druids for centuries this mysterious order of Celtic
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:46.920]  priests have performed both human and animal sacrifice in their groves in ancient and we're
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:53.160]  going to break but they don't even deny that okay see and they're doing a mock human sacrifice this
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:20:01.320]  is a mixture of germanic death cult stuff a jewish mysticism a whole bunch of other

[02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:14.840]  historically similar orders roman's greek scandinavians also all consider groves to be sacred
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:22.920]  spaces what happened once the ceremony began it was so creepy i had snuck in i'd seen the 40 foot
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:31.080]  stone owl i'd seen the black altar in front of it during the day then as it got dark to watch over
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:39.080]  a thousand prominent people marched down the little pond in front of this idol and then to see the
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:46.200]  ritual unfold from there i was thinking one thing get the footage and get out of here some of the
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:51.560]  wealthiest and most influential men in the country are meeting to discuss some of the biggest ideas
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:57.640]  not just in america but worldwide are they making handshake agreements come on i don't think us
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:02.520]  presidents are meeting in secret to plot against us oh no but i do believe that there are people
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:07.400]  out there who would benefit from hanging out socially with a president so the question is
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:18.680]  how far would those people go we're in california investigating the bohemian club in the year 2000
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:24.040]  alex jones actually managed to covertly record the cremation of care ceremony anyone could have
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:28.760]  busted him any second it reminded me that scene from evasion of the body snatchers where the non
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:33.080]  body snatchers are trying to blend in with everyone else when he gets to the spot where they do the
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:38.120]  cremation of care ceremony though it suddenly gets real dark it's a scene that looks like a
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:42.360]  crowded amusement park at night you know when everyone's standing around shoulder to shoulder
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.160]  waiting for the fireworks to start as the ceremony begins people are dressed in what
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:52.520]  look like long robes like a monk would wear they're carrying flaming torches they start walking on
[02:25:52.520 --> 02:26:01.000]  and off some sort of stage set in front of this giant owl what are we seeing here i mean it looks
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:07.240]  like a cross or something that's a person it's a herald and he's saying for behold here is bohemia
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:14.200]  shrine and holy are the pillars of this house this is their temple these redwoods and while all this
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:21.640]  is going on a black carriage comes out an old-fashioned hearst led by horses and there is a body in
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:27.800]  effigy there the owl is saying there's only one goddess that can help us only one true deity
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:32.600]  and they bring fire and then the owl starts speaking to them saying you've got to burn dull
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:39.880]  care and it's an effigy of a child-sized human figure so then care says no you're not and a
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:45.160]  thunderbolt is thrown down and what looks like a comet shoots through the air and at the stage
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:51.000]  alex says it was an elaborate pyrotechnics show and that was it that was the cremation of care
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.120]  ceremony and i can tell you it looks no better no cooler than what they have in a fraternity but
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:02.200]  just with really good pyrotechnics so this is part of the pyrotechnics and yes and then the owl
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.880]  starts speaking and said listen you gotta give me that effigy you gotta burn it right now and i'll
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:14.520]  take care of all your problems a word of caution here and this may be the most important thing i
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:20.600]  say in this entire episode oh it is very dangerous to try to interpret something from the outside
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:25.560]  it's as if someone unfamiliar with christianity stepped into a catholic church and heard a priest
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:31.240]  in the middle of holy communion say the words this is the body of christ this is the blood of christ
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:35.960]  without knowing the context the ritual can seem strange or unusual even a little frightening
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:42.040]  the same goes for the cremation of care or any other unfamiliar ceremony without context we
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:47.160]  cannot possibly know what is going through the mind of bohemian growth and that's enough again
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.760]  that's just a few minutes of you can watch the whole thing at history channel dot com with the
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:55.320]  coded site and they're obviously going to be rearing it uh unless they do like to do with
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:00.360]  ventura and pull the show like to do with the police state on another network on true tv
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:06.760]  but oh uh that's it the ritual is over that that's all that's all that happens no that's
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:12.040]  not all that happens and i went over all of that and i went over them bringing it in and
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:16.760]  begging for its life and how they believe they put all their cares onto it like some type of voodoo
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:23.000]  doll uh and then there's the implication oh this is the most important thing it's very dangerous
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  for outsiders to try to interpret this we know what's going on they've got stuff from falstin
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.960]  there they've got stuff from babelon they've got a uh uh you know the biggest ingredient
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:43.320]  in this witch's brew is druidic death cult uh germanic type stuff but also there's uh
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:49.240]  jewish mysticism type stuff because all this all this is very similar to each other i mean
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:54.680]  the occult's very similar across the board the aztecs were doing sacrifices the druids were doing
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:59.400]  it uh you know there's cases in the bible of human sacrifice going on and give not your
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:05.400]  children to the fires of molek they throw their children in uh you know uh before the bull uh
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.800]  the deity of the bull people say well why are you calling this molek then if it's an owl they in
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:16.360]  their literature call it molek see occultists mix and match all this stuff and they address it
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:24.680]  as a male they address it as a female they first address it as a goddess then they address it as
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:29.800]  a male deity that's that pantheistic occultism and yes we've done the research i made the film

[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:56.920]  on the heels of wiki leaks putting out government documents and saying oh my gosh the fbi is now
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:03.320]  searching for hijack supporters who were casing things but in the document the media is focusing
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:08.760]  on the scary you know al qaeda people who haven't been caught now the fbi has been dispatched
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:14.760]  to the middle east to try to find them but in the document it admits that they were known
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:21.560]  by intelligence and that the fbi was told to stand down and that's paul joseph uh watson's
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:27.720]  article uh dealing with this at prisonplanet.com wiki leaks bombshell points to 9 11 stand down
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:34.120]  now what do we have going on with uh anwar al laki the number three guy at al qaeda two
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:38.440]  months after 9 11 secretly meeting in fact let's put up that fox news article secretly
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:43.320]  meeting at the pentagon while he's on the news is one of the top al qaeda people now they admit he
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:48.200]  was behind the fort hood shooter he was behind the christmas day bomber he was supposedly behind
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:53.160]  the underwear bomber uh the christmas day bomber he was supposedly behind the shoe bomber uh the
[02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:58.920]  time square bomber but he's protected and then i interview springman of the saudi arabian uh
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:04.200]  embassy for the u.s when they were ordered back before 9 11 to let mohammed atta and others back
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:09.000]  in and when others in the uh visa office complained they were told don't worry they're not really
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.280]  terrorist this is part of drills their government agents and you got the newsweek headline hijackers
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.120]  trained at u.s military bases and lieutenant colonel steven butler the head of the defense
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:25.000]  language school saying they were trained at his school the list goes on and on and on but with
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.600]  mutalib the underwear bomber he's looks to shovel kind of looks drugged he gets led on the plane
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.840]  there's they get him on the plane without all the proper documents hurt haskell and his wife
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:40.120]  who are both lawyers watch this then they see all the chicanery on the plane he comes out and talks
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:45.880]  about it the fbi says that can't be true and then months later after christmas in february the state
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:51.880]  department uh deputy head kennedy says yes an unnamed u.s agency asked us to let him get on
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:57.080]  the plane and not stop him and to basically give him the visa now hurt haskell has now said more
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:01.560]  but there's the fox news headline exclusive al-qaeda leader dined at the pentagon just months after
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:08.440]  911 i want to play this short fox news clip from a few weeks ago uh outside uh dealing with the
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:14.360]  underwear bomber uh and his trial and uh mr haskell he and his wife survived it and everything
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:19.960]  they've said has now been totally proven here it is today's scare comes as the man known as the
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:24.440]  underwear bomber appears in federal court in detroit umar furuk abdul matalam is accused of
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:29.320]  trying to blow up the plane over detroit on christmas day 2009 fox news emi lang has more
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:35.640]  from outside federal court where a trial date has now been said amy yes a trial date has been said
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:39.960]  but it was actually more interesting to hear from a couple of the passengers who showed up here at
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:46.120]  court today who have a very interesting theory about what really happened the u.s government
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:50.920]  escorted him through security without a passport and we believe gave him an intentionally defective
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:56.520]  bomb it's a startling allegation from two local attorneys who were on board the 2009 christmas
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:01.160]  day flight to detroit when umar furuk abdul matalam tried to blow up a bomb hidden in his
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:06.520]  underwear kurt and lori haskell think the u.s government was behind the whole thing it was
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:12.520]  intentional and it went this far to further the warrant error to get body scanners in the airports
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:18.440]  to increase the tsa's budget to renew the patriot act and whatever other reasons you want to list
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:22.840]  the haskell say in amsterdam before boarding the flight to detroit they witnessed abdul
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:27.800]  matalam arguing with a ticket agent at the gate because he didn't have a passport when a man in
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:33.720]  a tan suit with an american accent intervened the ticket agent did not want to allow mutalab on the
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:38.440]  flight and this man was very insistent of it and then she referred them to a manager down the hallway
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.000]  they next saw abdul matalam on board the plane when they saw fire and people screaming abdul
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.040]  matalam has insisted on representing himself in this case the trial dates now been set for
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:54.120]  october fourth and could include up to 400 witnesses it's a very like said very serious case
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:58.200]  with a lot of potential a lot of evidence that has to be reviewed and a lot of witnesses which
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:03.240]  must be interviewed in order to properly prepare the case that's abdul matalam stand by attorney
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:08.520]  anthony chambers although the judge has urged abdul matalam to have chambers represent him
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:13.720]  so far he's refused i think that this is a case that we can help him with greatly it's a very
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:20.200]  defensible case and he just heard this stand by attorney saying he thinks it's a very defensible
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.920]  case of course with abdul matalam representing himself it would be interesting to see just how
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:29.400]  well he can defend himself they do say that he's been having all right you can watch the rest of
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:35.080]  it up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but but the issue here is kurt haskell isn't
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:41.800]  saying this he witnessed it the government tried to deny it and now has admitted it and is his standby
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:47.160]  lawyer going to bring this up is mutalib clearly out of his mind going to bring this up we saw the
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:51.800]  government cook the bomb train the driver and order a stand down in 93 with the first world
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:58.440]  trade center attack it's the same story over and over and over again a month ago in germany a plane
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:02.680]  came in with this opposite bomb turned out that was a drill but they reported it after
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:08.200]  kurt haskell joins us who's been completely vindicated in spades everything he talked about
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:13.080]  kurt we appreciate you and your wife's courage thanks for joining us thanks for having me back
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:18.280]  on elix recap basically for those that don't know that it tells the story exactly what happened and
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:25.400]  now what's unfolded since then sure well the main part of what people want to hear me talk about
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:33.000]  is what i saw before boarding which was a man in a tan suit who appeared to be indian escorting
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:40.360]  mutalab to the ticket desk indicating that mutalab needed to get on the plane but he
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:47.480]  didn't have a passport the ticket agent refused and then the man in the tan suit said he's from
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.720]  sudan we do this all the time they got into a bit of an argument and then she referred the
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:57.560]  man in the tan suit and mutalab down a hallway to talk to the security manager and then of course
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:05.960]  he winds up on her plane detonating a defective bomb but we didn't know it at the time two hours
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:13.400]  later so you know that's what most most people want to hear from me uh as to my pre-boarding
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:18.680]  account it shows you know that not everything was on the up and up before boarding and now we have
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:25.960]  since then we have more fbi plots where they've admitted giving the portland christmas tree
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:31.640]  bomber and the uh really field bomber just two off the top of my head intentionally defective bombs
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:39.000]  and now we have standby attorney chambers indicating that in fact this was a defective bomb
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:45.160]  you know with all the other evidence i could go on and on and on about all the other evidence but
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:50.360]  i think if you just take those three pieces of evidence right there and add two plus two plus
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:57.160]  two you have the u.s government letting mutalab on the plane with an intentionally defective bomb
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:03.960]  and then we have the fbi visiting your office uh a month or so before the state department
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:09.560]  admitted that what you'd said was basically true unnamed u.s agency to be technical i guess helped
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:14.520]  him get the visa and then helped him get on without the passport to be technical and you
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:18.920]  witnessed this and then the media tried to say in the government oh no haskell and his wife
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:24.600]  they didn't see this then once it lands they pull you off claim they find other bombs clearly other
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.960]  men that were somehow attached to uh the underwear bomber all that gets covered up you're told you
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:36.440]  didn't see that then other witnesses come out on cnn and confirm what you saw but all that gets swept
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:41.640]  out of the rug and this happens and when and within minutes cherd off who didn't tell the public
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:46.280]  he was making money from it is on tv saying don't worry we'll we'll put scanners in now
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:50.360]  that they'd already ordered a year before claiming they went in because of this when they'd already
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:56.200]  ordered them and this full tsa hands down the pants you know giant international story this
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:01.560]  is how they're selling us this and they go out and find mentally ill low-grade morons you and others
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:05.960]  described him as being kind of disheveled some saying he almost looked drugged uh i've seen
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:12.120]  videos of him he looks like he's all probably out of 75 iq probably retarded uh and the whole
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:17.080]  thing is just a giant setup and now he's going to represent himself and you're a lawyer i mean
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:23.000]  this whole thing looks extremely shady is there any way for you to force your way into the trial
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:29.080]  as a witness but i guess mutala would have to call you or the prosecution and say hey let's get
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.520]  into real questions let's talk about who was behind him let's talk about the government
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:38.120]  getting him on the plane and that there's not a chance that the prosecution is going to call
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:45.400]  me as a witness now i have been in discussions with uh stand by attorney chambers and is he
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:51.080]  has anything to say that i'll be one of the main witnesses for the defense but as you stated mutala
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:56.520]  was currently representing himself so who knows how the trial will play out it it's a total
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:43:01.400]  crapshoot if someone's representing themselves at a trial well you know i've interviewed multiple
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:06.760]  prisoners and lawyers who sued and got the documents and got sworn affidavits from larry
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:12.200]  nickles that mcvay was told your family is going to be taken out you are special forces
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:17.400]  we had you do this you'll be taken care of if you just go along with it and i wonder if they're
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:23.160]  telling the underwear bomber uh the same thing now because you know i mean i mean the fact that
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:28.040]  he doesn't even really speak good english does he and and and now magically uh he's going to
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:34.280]  represent himself i mean i mean this is just incredible i mean the only way they can keep
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:40.440]  this from coming out in the trial is to keep you and others from speaking yeah you're probably right
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:45.480]  he did have uh an interpreter at the hearing i was at last week his english seemed to be
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:50.920]  fairly fairly good but he did uh talk to his interpreter on two or three occasions so his
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:56.440]  english isn't is he curt is he saying anything thank god you've been there hopefully you can come
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:01.000]  back on as this unfolds i mean i mean you're the expert on this i mean i mean take us where we need
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:07.240]  to go i'm just asking questions that seem rational here but i mean i mean if i was the underwear bomber
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:12.760]  and i'd been led on the plane by people unprotected he should be saying i was set up yes i did it but
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:18.040]  the government helped me i mean is he saying anything like that no not at all as a matter of
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:23.720]  fact most of the the hearing i was at about 25 minutes of it the hearing went on maybe 40 minutes
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:31.160]  was mutilab and judge edmunds uh basically arguing back and forth whether whether uh he was going to
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:37.560]  represent himself or not judge edmunds insisting that he should have an attorney and mutilab saying
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:43.960]  no no no i'm representing myself and this just went on back and forth for about 25 minutes
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:48.200]  it was the strangest thing it seemed like everybody watching this in the courtroom just
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:54.520]  wanted to stand up and say let chambers be your attorney instead of your standby you know everyone
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:59.400]  was on edge of their seat waiting for mutilab to say that and he never did and eventually judge
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:08.200]  adams i'm sorry judge edmunds gave up on this argument but your your point is basically a point
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:12.600]  that i was thinking of too there's only really three explanations why he's representing himself
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:17.960]  he's being threatened with something he's being promised something or he has such
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:25.240]  a distrust for the united states system itself due to being duped in this plot that he does not
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:30.840]  trust an attorney being appointed uh from the court so i don't know which of the three but i don't
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:35.480]  see uh that there can be any other possibilities other than one of the three and i don't know
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:39.960]  which it is well in the last year as you mentioned there have been eight cases that we've chronicled
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:45.560]  here that i know of of where they go out and find people who are described as morons normally out
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:49.400]  of the prisons are recruited directly by the government contacted by the government a whole
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:56.680]  cloth and directed to carry out jihad with dud bombs uh and clearly here we know that's what
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:02.920]  happened the evidence as you said is incontrovertible and uh boy this is really going to hurt the uh
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:09.640]  insiders agenda for the police state if it's able to come out uh what really happened i agree the
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:15.000]  question is is it going to come out i really have a hard time believing that it's going to come out i
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:19.960]  until the hearing last week i was adamant that there would be a plea deal and that's
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:24.600]  in this case a no trial and now i'm convinced there will not be a plea deal that this will go to a
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:32.840]  trial um based on what i saw at the last hearing so my question then is how does this not come out
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:38.200]  and probably the most logical answers that moots a lot represent represents themselves and
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:43.160]  that's such a bad uh bad job of putting on his case that the real evidence doesn't come out
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:48.680]  probably the most likely scenario i'm sure there would be some others but um you know that's
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:54.200]  probably the most likely scenario what's going to happen i know that in some types of court cases
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:58.680]  you can have an amicus brief or or someone from the outside who claims they have some type of
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:05.240]  standing you're one of the survivors the victims of this government moron plot a patsy plot i mean
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:13.080]  is there some legal maneuver for you to insert yourself in there he uh i don't think there is
[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:19.000]  alex uh nothing that i know about him if there are any legal geniuses listening to this that
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:25.960]  thinks maybe there is let me know contact me i don't think there is um uh you know i don't
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:33.320]  think judge edmunds would let me be anywhere near moots lab as far as representing him and uh
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:39.880]  uh interestingly on that point there was a discussion during the hearing too that the standby
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:45.240]  attorney chambers is having a hard time getting a hold of moots lab and the prison where is that
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:50.840]  mylon prison indicating on the record that his voicemails are not being given to moots lab his
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:56.680]  faxes are being thrown away and he's not getting cooperation and setting up appointments with
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:02.040]  moots lab from mylon prison to the extent that judge edmunds said she would make a call to the
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:08.360]  prison to discuss it with them and the standby attorney chambers even saying that he believes
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:15.560]  mylon prison got a call from someone higher up i think those are his exact words which led to
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:21.640]  this lack of cooperation um if if you give me one other second there's one other thing about the
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:27.400]  hearing i want to talk about there is another discussion quite lengthy whether standby attorney
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:34.840]  chambers would be given the evidence that moots labs originally uh hired and fired attorneys
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:40.440]  have provided by the prosecution because he's only a standby attorney and the government's
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:47.560]  position was that he should not be given this evidence because it could be subpoenaed or uh
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:51.800]  made available to third parties in a possible civil suit against the government which i
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:55.640]  thought was kind of interesting that they're concerned about that well that's bombshell
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:01.160]  they're trying to cover up they don't want anybody to ever hear or who has a brain to be
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:07.560]  able to talk to uh mutala right the point being that chambers is not his actual attorney so
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:12.360]  therefore there's no attorney client privilege so everything that moots lab tells chambers
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:17.640]  other parties such as myself an impossible civil civil suit could obtain i thought that was pretty
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.240]  interesting there was about 10 minutes of the hearing so that's an admission that they're
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:28.280]  concerned about evidence uh that shows that the government is civilly liable well that that's one
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:34.440]  way you interpret it definitely they did seem to be concerned concerned about that uh we're going
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:37.560]  to break a moment but continue fleshing that point out i mean because you're a lawyer you
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:44.120]  understand this better than some sure uh sure uh do i have time right now before the break yes
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:49.160]  you do okay turning client with a turning client privilege anything your client tells you cannot
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:55.720]  be repeated to another person unless the client gives you okay uh chambers does only stand by
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:00.280]  attorney therefore he does not have the turning client privilege with moots lab at this point so
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:07.000]  all the evidence that the prosecution had to turn over to the defense initially when moots lab had a
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.760]  legitimate attorney the prosecution's now argument shouldn't be given to chambers because that could
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:17.320]  be turned over to other parties because it's not subject to the turning client privilege
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:23.240]  such as myself if i were to sue the united states government i could obtain every conversation and
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:28.440]  every document moots lab would have given to chambers and the united states government's
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:33.160]  attorneys at the hearing last week seemed to be pretty concerned about this do you think that
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:37.080]  clears it up alex i don't i don't know if i can be more clear than that now that is stunning
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:41.160]  information so they're clearly trying to hide something i want to come back from break and
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:45.240]  strategize with you curd about where we go from here obviously this is very dangerous for you and
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:50.200]  your wife very dangerous for the standby attorney because we know this guy was there patsy and this
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:55.640]  was a set up and that's been confirmed and uh you're absolutely right curt haskell blows whistle

[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:29.240]  addressing the american people as a jury about what happened uh how it's been used to destroy
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.680]  liberties in this country and where we're going what would you say to the american people right now
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:40.840]  in encapsulating all of this and why it's so important are you saying what would my closing
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:44.760]  argument be if i was the attorney is that your question well i mean just just everything that's
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:50.840]  happened i mean what do you what do you want to impart to us well i guess what i would say is
[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:59.400]  that the warrant error is a fraud uh and it's being used in a manner to take away your rights for
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:07.320]  whatever reason i don't exactly know why but it's pretty clear that it is and that the united
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:12.120]  states government has not been forthcoming with you in some of these plots they are staging
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:18.680]  these plots and uh just keep an open mind and actually give it some thought instead of giving
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:26.040]  deference to the united states government's story uh this sort of thing will only get worse
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:32.440]  unless the stop is put to it right away and that the the people become informed and actually see
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:37.800]  what the united states government is doing to them as a means to take away their rights such as putting
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:42.920]  body scanners in the airports to take away your fourth manner amendment rights to unreasonable
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:48.200]  search and seizures that that's just one example but you have to put a stop to it you know you have
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:54.760]  to think critically and look at at these plots weigh the evidence for both sides and and think to
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:56:00.440]  yourself what seems logical and not let a factor in that your united states government is one side
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:08.040]  of the plot you have to just think logically and think does their story make sense uh and does the
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:13.880]  other side make sense and with every plot you should just think it out and see which side seems
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:19.080]  to be more credible instead of just initially dismissing the one side because they're against
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:24.520]  us government for whatever reason but that's what i would say something along those lines well well
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:30.920]  curt i mean you are a survivor of this and you have standing on every level uh civilly with the
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:38.200]  government the airlines all of it and the key here is that everything you said turned out to be true
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:44.200]  the government did help him get on the plane did protect him it fits the mo of their past dud uh
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:51.400]  patsy operations and uh the fbi came and basically tried to get you to change your story at your office
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:56.200]  before all this came out and now they're trying to keep this guy from the press and lawyers
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:01.160]  i mean you look at it on every front they're acting very very guilty and we've got to get the
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:07.000]  truth out about this yeah just to clarify the point in the fbi they didn't actually get me
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:11.960]  to try and change my story i just want to be clear in that there was more like they weren't
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:18.280]  interested in my story but then a few days later i get a call from a passenger who claims to be
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:23.160]  concerned that when the truth comes out i would look stupid because he thinks my story is not
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:28.840]  cracked and he went on and on and on i shouldn't be talking to the press about this uh because he
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:34.360]  apparently uh knows what i saw even though he admitted he didn't see it himself so it was done
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:41.720]  more uh under under the undercover well curt the reason i make that statement is they came and
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:46.360]  ignored you and then put out statements in the media contradicting what you were saying and
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:52.520]  then it basically came out that you were correct yes actually what they did on more than one occasion
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:58.440]  the they said they reviewed 200 hours of cc tv video footage from skippal airport and showed
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:04.280]  nothing and then about three weeks later they came out to the press and said uh we're attempting to
[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:09.240]  identify the the person i witnessed that said they saw helping him onto the plane so totally
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:14.440]  contradicting their first story showing that the first story was a lie and the the second man
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:19.080]  taken into custody which we haven't even gotten into today the man in orange but their story and him
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:23.720]  changed five times and it's all documented in the press well we're coming back in one minute uh
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:28.920]  let's get into the other man on the other side and we're so blessed to have somebody like yourself
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:34.520]  who's intelligent informed and who's going to the trial hopefully we can have you come back on
[02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:45.880]  as this trial unfolds such an important case for all of us we'll be right back stay with us
[02:58:52.440 --> 02:58:58.040]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:03.240]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[02:59:03.240 --> 02:59:09.000]  underneath the americans at home and have turned the members influence on our president in congress
[02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:15.160]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:20.680]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:26.200]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government

[03:00:57.400 --> 03:01:03.800]  don't accept any advertising and it was formed to let other people that have been disenfranchised
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:09.720]  with the media discussed topics about government corruption so something your listeners might
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:15.240]  also be interested in and of course the underwear bomber story i've been documenting documenting
[03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:23.560]  on my wife's blog all along since christmas day 2009 at haskellfamily.blogspot.com if you want to
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:29.640]  read my blog post going back to the start and seeing how everything has come out bit by bit
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:34.200]  and how my attitude towards this has changed that would be a good way to do it well that was my next
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:37.800]  point you've gotten a lot more hardcore now coming right out and saying clearly you know they gave
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:42.280]  them the dud bomb that fits the mo and that's what all the facts show but briefly getting into this
[03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:48.440]  other gentleman on the plane well you know there's there was a man that filmed the whole incident
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:53.000]  from before it started until after it ended and he has kind of just gone into the woodwork no one
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:58.760]  wants to talk to him by the way alex i have his phone number address an email address if you want
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:04.200]  to try and talk to him i haven't had any luck i've contacted him a couple of times and all i get
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:09.160]  back is a response from his attorney but i know he has and if you want to contact him let me know
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:13.640]  and i'll provide his info to you yes when you go to break or stay there i'm going to get the
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:17.720]  name and number now and we'll start calling him tell us briefly i've got about a minute or two left
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:25.080]  what you saw what i saw in what in what regard i mean with his second gentleman okay now i didn't
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:30.120]  see the cameraman because my view of him was blocked by the bathroom but what other passengers have
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:35.880]  said is before the attempted bombing happened he whipped out a camcorder and started filming he
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:40.760]  filmed all the way through it until after it ended in mind you this is the middle of the
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:46.280]  terrorist attack as our plane is burning it's bombed and blow up but it started a fire and
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:51.160]  everyone in the plane uh thought our plane was going down and we're going to die so it's highly
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:56.840]  suspicious that someone would whip out a camcorder film it all the way through not put it down and
[03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:01.240]  not only that but he pulled it out before the incident started so it's highly suspicious
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:06.680]  especially if you look at it in the context of all this other evidence that we have uh you know
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:11.640]  just sure this would point towards a government handler who wants to have the video to scare
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:19.720]  folks even more on the news and to also help them in the court case well it's highly suspicious
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:24.680]  again i don't know what person in the right mind when you think you're going to die whips out a
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:31.240]  camcorder it's just incomprehensible well some people might do that but if he's videotaping
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:36.360]  beforehand maybe there's a reason for it maybe you know he's a wonderful guy but the whole thing is
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:42.200]  very very suspicious Kurt and it's clear we're going to talk to you again about this very very
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:48.360]  soon as the trial of the underwear bomber unfolds we really want to thank you for all you've done
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:53.160]  and folks should check out the blog talk radio show make sure all show check out the haskell family
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:58.600]  blog and just again we're going to put you on hold as this segment ends and get the name and number
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:05.480]  of the supposed video person i'm sorry go ahead no that's fine um yeah i think you know if any
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:10.600]  your listeners are skeptical as to my story at all just i would just encourage you to look at all
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:17.000]  the evidence there's a damning amount of evidence that shows that my position is actually correct
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:23.320]  so don't just look at one piece or two there's at least 30 different bits of evidence which i gave
[03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:28.680]  to amy lang as evidence that that she requested amy lang being the fox two reporter of the clip
[03:04:28.680 --> 03:04:33.560]  that you aired earlier so there's a great deal of evidence supporting my position on this the
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:40.040]  government story is nonsensical contradictory and just a flat out lie well kurt you've done an
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:44.440]  incredible job i don't even know why you're being defensive a little bit i mean you you're a hero
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:49.480]  you've been totally proven right and uh so what of this info people try to lie about you
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:53.640]  folks should go to the website see the facts for themselves you and your wife and other witnesses
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:05:16.680]  are spot on and we salute you for defending the liberties of this republic stay with us
