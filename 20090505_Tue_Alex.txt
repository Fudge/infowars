[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:41.280]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.280 --> 00:52.960]  hello ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us it is the fifth day of May 2009 on
[00:52.960 --> 01:01.360]  this Tuesday edition and we are going to be live here for the next four hours tell you about some
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.640]  of the guests coming up in the show in the next segment we're also going to have wide open phones
[01:06.640 --> 01:14.640]  today you know many days now when I come in here and have my stack of news and information I want
[01:14.640 --> 01:22.800]  to cover it just amazes me how serious how over the top how clearly tyrannical all of it is I mean
[01:22.800 --> 01:35.760]  the despotism is running wild across the face of our planet in a big way in a huge way and so coming
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.640]  up later in the shower this news is too important to just come right into the show and start covering
[01:40.640 --> 01:49.360]  and I must build up to it because I need to somehow note that this is big important information
[01:49.360 --> 01:55.680]  that this is something special that this is shocking that this is of great import because
[01:55.680 --> 02:04.880]  if I just mix it in with the rest of the news it will just only serve to condition all of us
[02:04.880 --> 02:13.040]  including myself to become acclimated acclimatized that is comfortable with our position of slavery
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.160]  this is how tyranny generally works sometimes it comes quickly but the elites throughout history
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.920]  have found it's better for it to be a creeping sort of death we have Mike Rivera what really happened
[02:23.920 --> 02:32.400]  joining us coming up in an hour and then we have a Harvard economist who's saying decriminalized drugs
[02:32.400 --> 02:40.320]  Jim Jeffrey Myron will be popping in briefly coming up later in the show today we're gonna have
[02:40.320 --> 02:48.960]  Ernest Hancock we are change Arizona talking about some of the things that they are doing there
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.960]  and including preparing to hand out 10,000 Obama deception DVDs they've burned when
[02:54.960 --> 03:05.840]  Obama comes to the local university there in Phoenix so that is coming up today but most
[03:05.840 --> 03:11.360]  of those are kind of mini gas that will pop in 15-20 minutes we will have open phones while
[03:11.360 --> 03:19.920]  those guests are on today now the big news today is not the fact that our fan-based
[03:19.920 --> 03:25.440]  YouTube site that was getting over a million views a week as of late it was turning into just a
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.520]  mega juggernaut every video he posted he posted more than a dozen a day we usually do about three
[03:31.520 --> 03:37.760]  hours a day live at prisonplanet.tv there are 10 minute videos to the math we're talking about
[03:38.720 --> 03:44.320]  18 videos I guess on average each one getting about 10,000 views in a few days some of them
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.080]  getting a million views some of them getting a half million views 200,000 views I mean you know
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.320]  some of them hit the zeitgeist as they say and there's hundreds of other big channels
[03:52.320 --> 03:56.720]  promoting our videos and clipping clips of my films into their films I mean we're huge we
[03:56.720 --> 04:01.920]  dominate we're numeral you know there's no doubt about that in the world of political information
[04:01.920 --> 04:09.600]  on video websites not just YouTube and Google but everywhere domination and I've been noticing
[04:09.600 --> 04:17.280]  in the last few months a clear hunting down of patriot libertarian conservative anti-new
[04:17.280 --> 04:25.120]  world order grassroots liberal sites I mean you know mainstream news was showing the marines
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.240]  throwing the puppy off the cliff and YouTube will still ban it to this day they do not allow
[04:30.240 --> 04:36.000]  to show in the troops killing Iraqi kids you know they don't let me and because the White House
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.400]  admits and then Lieberman admits that's not allowed so they ban anything that didn't
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.720]  establishment now at YouTube I mean Google is the whore of the internet to the new world order
[04:46.720 --> 04:53.360]  and because they have the nerve to claim do no evil don't be evil when they are a CIA NSA
[04:53.360 --> 04:58.480]  admitted command base to take over the entire internet and their hypocritical criminals
[04:58.480 --> 05:04.560]  we'll break that down we'll get back a lot more you are a rebel admit it you refuse to read the
[05:04.560 --> 05:09.680]  directions when assembling a new item you won't ask for directions when you're lost once in a while

[05:30.880 --> 05:36.640]  an entire country and led the creation of a new one now alex jones is working to save that very

[06:07.440 --> 06:12.320]  to give them a stake in creating the kind of uh world order that i think all of us would like to
[06:12.320 --> 06:17.920]  say the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best

[08:02.640 --> 08:28.160]  and political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network there is no doubt that the mainstream
[08:28.160 --> 08:35.600]  media the european union the united states canada the western world has declared war on all forms
[08:35.600 --> 08:42.000]  of liberty and freedom all forms of independence and honor private property free speech is all
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.440]  under savage attack you know uh... tens and tens and tens of millions of views at the alex jones
[08:49.440 --> 08:56.240]  channel on youtube and what makes me angry at youtube is that the hypocritical creatures
[08:56.240 --> 09:03.200]  suspended the account fan-based account that was just getting bigger and bigger every week was in
[09:03.200 --> 09:14.400]  the top videos routinely number one on youtube and that's just one outpost for us on youtube which
[09:14.400 --> 09:21.120]  is one outpost of hundreds in the digital war one of hundreds of big outpost there are millions
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.920]  and billions total small outpost but a key fight in the info war against the globalist a key
[09:25.920 --> 09:33.920]  place we're able to reach out to new people and wake up just untold amounts of folks unlock their
[09:33.920 --> 09:41.680]  minds but what upsets me is that i'm sure you've heard about this you can just put into a search
[09:41.680 --> 09:47.040]  engine and pull it up if you haven't uh... that google is digitizing all the major
[09:47.040 --> 09:56.400]  major literary works of all time including the bible harry potter sung sues art of war whether
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.600]  it has a copyright or not google is allowed to do it because they were set up by m it in the
[10:01.600 --> 10:07.120]  central intelligence agency and the office out on their development firm out of the nasa complex
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.560]  and we've had mr steele and other cia high-level agents on and technology to document who the
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.680]  people are at the cia just like a t&t and all these big outfits are government runner controlled
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.680]  ibm walmart it's all infrastructure it's all intertied together this is the military industrial
[10:23.680 --> 10:32.080]  complex and it is a government operation to dominate the internet they are digitizing all
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.640]  the printed works in the world claiming they can do it claiming they own it but then i show a
[10:38.640 --> 10:44.640]  pittsburgh poska's zed article that's what got the alex jones channel taken down folks the washington
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.560]  journal uh... on c span for twenty five years in the papers show in new york news every day i mean
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.880]  i went to took rtf and it it's basic you can show any news article you want you can show clippings i
[10:56.880 --> 11:01.760]  could sit here and show news articles for four hours every day in simulcast at prism planet dot tv
[11:03.680 --> 11:07.680]  in fact a lot of newspapers send out their papers to all the different media outlets radio stations
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.800]  you name it wanting them to be covered you know the issue here is is that they said oh no you can't
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.760]  and the pittsburgh poska's that complained and said he can't show our news article which was even
[11:17.760 --> 11:24.160]  crazier because it was about myself being attacked and libeled by them and defamed by them so i could
[11:24.160 --> 11:30.320]  really show it but that's why the alex jones channel was completely blown away now i got all
[11:30.320 --> 11:37.920]  this important genetically engineered h1n1 flu news i've got police state news i've got incredible
[11:37.920 --> 11:45.840]  economy news but it is about the attack on free speech today but again what's happening to me is
[11:45.840 --> 11:50.320]  a microcosm i'm going to break all this down after i cover other news at the bottom of the hour
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.240]  but i do want you to call everybody you know i do want to point out this live transmission on the
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.280]  amon fm dial global shortwave the internet satellite soon to be on xm three hours a day
[12:01.280 --> 12:04.560]  will give you the show times it may be live or maybe retransmitted we're not sure yet
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.960]  but we will be on it's a done deal sign deal affiliate deal you know where they get half the
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.240]  ads we get half the ads that's what deals are done basic a month a month deal has been inked with
[12:17.440 --> 12:23.840]  xm and sirius to start uh june 6 so the show is really becoming so mainstream it's seen as
[12:23.840 --> 12:28.480]  extremely radical but more and more big amon fm's are picking us up
[12:31.520 --> 12:37.440]  because what we've talked about has all come true we have incredible credibility
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.680]  so we're making huge inroads we are exploding the establishment is though is now paying major
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.560]  attention to us we're getting death threats we're getting threats we're getting all sorts of dirty
[12:50.560 --> 12:56.480]  tricks that i won't even elaborate on here and i just smile inwardly because i know that means
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.640]  my mission to damage the new world order with truth to go after them to defeat them
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.840]  to rout them to stand up against them i mean i'm committed to this fight there's no getting out
[13:07.840 --> 13:12.240]  of it now i'm glad i committed if i had it all over to do again i would do it and even more
[13:13.120 --> 13:18.000]  i would have just worked harder when i was young i only put about eight hours in this when i was
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.960]  22 23 24 by the time i was 25 it went to about 10 12 hours by the time i was about 28
[13:24.960 --> 13:31.840]  it went to 16 hours now many days it's 18 hours it completely has consumed me this mission to
[13:31.840 --> 13:37.200]  defeat the globalist to bring them to justice to warn the people to raise the alarm and we're
[13:37.200 --> 13:41.600]  doing it we're doing it effectively and i am honored and blessed and humble
[13:41.600 --> 13:51.360]  now the big issue here is youtube has a long history of banning anything that criticized the
[13:51.360 --> 13:56.720]  military that showed them killing dogs killing sheep killing animals torturing dogs sitting
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.080]  off the side of the road machine gunning whole families for fun and laughing about it and youtube
[14:02.080 --> 14:07.760]  would take these down even when it was on national news google and youtube would take these down and
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.560]  the white house admits and the senator admits and leverman admits they just email them what they
[14:12.560 --> 14:18.560]  don't like the southern primary law center adl are quote partners they have employees paid for
[14:18.560 --> 14:24.160]  with federal grants inside youtube now for a year banning anything and everything and they go through
[14:24.160 --> 14:29.280]  youtube and google on on record this is all mainstream news you can search engine and pulling it up
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.360]  it's been covered at nauseam they're proud of it the mainstream media says it's good
[14:35.360 --> 14:42.880]  banning anything and everything they want so the southern primary law center and the adl are
[14:42.880 --> 14:49.360]  literally the commissariat that's the political police in america you don't know what commissariat
[14:49.360 --> 14:56.080]  is search engine that and give me the definition of commissariat commissariat yeah that's the
[14:56.080 --> 15:03.760]  soviet political police and they had the uh nkvd that then of the commissariat pointed you out

[15:34.880 --> 15:40.160]  there is no doubt the globalists had met it now what they're doing that now they're trying to
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.200]  eat a big elephant here but they're eating this one big piece at a time they've already eaten
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.920]  about half the elephant and they're down into our energy right now like a bunch of vampire bats on

[39:29.600 --> 39:33.920]  he said no it's a christmas shirt you can't have that in the mall take it off and the guy said i
[39:33.920 --> 39:39.280]  don't have a shirt on i'd be neck i'd be shirtless and the guy said take it off they said i'll
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.080]  just leave and they said no we're going to go ahead and arrest you for that with your shirt
[39:44.080 --> 39:52.480]  with christmas tree on the front of it this is america ladies and gentlemen this is happening
[39:52.480 --> 40:02.080]  here now they don't care if there aren't laws against free speech they still arrest you in
[40:02.080 --> 40:10.880]  the united states now by the way queue up michael savage talking about uh obama is going to stage
[40:10.880 --> 40:16.160]  terror attacks and also alan keys has now come out and said that and again i disagree with
[40:16.160 --> 40:24.480]  a lot of what savage has said but i will fight to the death for his right to say it i remember
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.160]  a few years ago though he said if you disagree with the war that's aiding terrorist so you need
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.120]  to be arrested there's no free speech under the enemy sedition act you need to be put in a prison
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.080]  camp and you shouldn't have to pay for you so it should be forced labor when he said that i pointed
[40:40.080 --> 40:46.240]  out that that is a call to criminal activity and that is illegal what he did i mean if i call for
[40:46.240 --> 40:54.320]  arresting say black people or jews or mexicans because of their political views or their race or
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.480]  whatever that that that is a call to criminal activity and if you know if he had government power
[41:00.480 --> 41:05.840]  that would be high treason and that would be indigable it's not really indigable because
[41:05.840 --> 41:11.040]  under the first amendment i believe in a broad interpretation i believe he narrowly has a right
[41:11.040 --> 41:16.000]  to do that he has a right to say they should have a dictatorship and i should be put in a camp
[41:16.000 --> 41:24.720]  it's despicable but savage has completely turned a new leaf and is now talking about government
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.840]  sponsored terror the builder bird group you name it now he's talked about how england's dying and
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.480]  england is dying they have a 1.3 birth rate that's averaging in the hordes of foreigners that have
[41:36.480 --> 41:42.240]  taken it over and of course tony blair claimed he was fighting a legal alien to turn out he signed
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.640]  a secret deal with the eu to bring in unlimited amounts and they instantly legalize them when
[41:46.640 --> 41:54.320]  they show up totally illegal the member of the parliament who exposed that got two members

[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:23.280]  for just saying rural communities to serve the same rights as muslims and homosexuals
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.840]  and they said oh that was disparaging the homosexuals the word homosexual is hateful
[1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:33.040]  when it's just a scientific name like heterosexual homosexual and had him arrested
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:39.920]  they want a chilling effect they want you to sit down and shut up and they're about to make it a
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:44.800]  law in england they've already tried to make it a law in several european countries to arrest you
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:49.680]  and spend years in prison if you say man-made climate change isn't real and it's a hoax
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:56.320]  they mean business these are parasites the banks are taking over what did alexander
[1:01:56.320 --> 1:02:00.080]  schultz and it's a say about the commas ours in the commissariat
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.160]  a communist party official assigned a military unit to teach party principles and policies
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:11.360]  and to ensure party loyalty one that attempts to control public opinion or its expression that
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:20.720]  is what the home secretary mrs smith is a monster i mean these people what's next if we put up with
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:29.920]  this and read you from alexander schultz and eason and oh how we burned in the camps later
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:36.960]  thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:42.320]  to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he was to return alive and had to say goodbye to his
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:48.960]  family or if during periods of mass arrest as for example in leningrad when they arrested a quarter
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:55.760]  of the entire population of the city people had not simply sat there in their layers pailing with
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:03:01.920]  terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase but it understood
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:08.640]  that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall and ambush of half a

[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:34.480]  in the background with my youtube channel the alex jones channel getting over a million views a week
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:39.680]  and and and exponentially growing they could see the growth curve and so they killed it they shut
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:43.840]  it down for saying that the pittsburgh post kazen i really do have a legal action against them
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:48.240]  but i don't have the time to deal with it i mean washington journal c span

[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:07.280]  they don't care pittsburgh post kazen i showed an article that was a hit piece against me
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:12.880]  but the it was even about me so total fair use uh you know saying he was a supporter of mine when
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:19.360]  it turned out he actually attacked me and hated me again it falls the same federal report lumping
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:25.120]  michael savage in with white supremacist when he's jewish this is what they do this is how they're
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:31.120]  trying to shut down free speech and they said no you're not allowed to show articles anymore
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:36.320]  but we're going to show it right now talk show host band from uk for political opinions this is

[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:06.720]  right slandered but you know she'll claim she's with the crown and exempt from lawsuits this is
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:12.800]  psychological terrorists a terrorism this is blacklisting you know this makes mccarthy look like a
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:19.920]  saint but again the left loves blacklist they love attacking free speech because it's not the left
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:26.400]  it's new world order it's total control just like youtube's banning anti-war videos they're banning
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:32.080]  my videos everywhere and they're knocking out channels that show documents where
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:40.080]  their bear pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out hiv in the factor eight shots they ban it
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:46.800]  doesn't matter if it's true and admit it youtube is dying you notice they've moved in hundreds
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:52.400]  of old tv shows and new tv shows their front page they only promote the sub channels they like
[1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:57.680]  they're hiding all the user videos they admit they're taking the you out of youtube now now
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:04.560]  understand how unbelievable it is that the alex jones channel was suspended and they said to us
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:10.160]  they said unless you can have the pittsburgh poskazette retract its copyright claim so i'd have
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:16.400]  to sue them unless you can have the pittsburgh poskazette who claims they had an article with
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:23.280]  the picture of the shooter from his myspace they took poposky's picture you know they're claiming
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:31.040]  i can't show an article that was attacking me and then they go and have our site shut down
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:39.280]  for not just showing the news article but it's an article about me and so if we can't have we've
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:47.520]  been told they have to withdraw their copyright claim 2000 plus videos over 30 million views
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:53.120]  it was becoming a million a week the site had gone mega viral i did the math if it continued to
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:58.960]  grow like this it was going to be about four million views a week by the end of the year just
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:06.880]  with one channel you know we do all these other things they had to shut it down now this is what's
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:11.440]  insane about google and imagine in a court of law if you sued google and went in and said they
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:18.720]  suspended my account claiming i violated things but they have a program to in fact search this
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.960]  and put it on screen for folks headline google digitizing all books and they say there is no
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:30.880]  copyright we own it all basically we're going to post every book ever printed and new books on the
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:38.960]  internet and charge for ads they're saying they own the book i wrote the book you wrote a book

[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:44.400]  to canada and see the right wing says good ban that liberals free speech and then the left wing
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:51.600]  says good ban that right winger savages speech you know when you uh when you always have an
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:58.000]  eye for an eye you end up everybody's blind and the kingdom of the blind the one eyed man is king
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:03.680]  you know there's two parables for you one of mahogany said it's true again that's how they
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:08.480]  play the left right oh we'll take the left's rights oh goody oh we'll take the right's rights
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:13.760]  you see and it's all controlled ladies and gentlemen they're destroying free speech everywhere
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:22.320]  this is happening this is going on they're saying i don't have a right to prove to you to prove what
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:27.360]  i'm saying i don't have a right to show you the mainstream news when they say it see they're
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:30.800]  scared of that they're scared of me being able to that's what i do hey look at this look at that
[1:17:30.800 --> 1:17:35.760]  i'm not making up this here's the bill to ban the guns through a treaty obama said he wasn't against
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:40.960]  guns and folks since we've gone up against obama the death threats the attacks the dirty tricks
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:44.640]  the comp just all sorts of craps going on but that's good it means we're having an effect
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:50.000]  or i apologize to mike revero we're making him whole but i wanted to get that information out
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.160]  and we'll hold him over the next hour of need be but the point here is uh there he is on the webcam
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:59.680]  mike they are really moving at free speech and with free speech being attacked this boldly
[1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:05.440]  it always follows with serious hardcore oppression and i don't think the yuppies and people realize
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:12.400]  they're the real target of shutting me and others down mike revero yeah absolutely i agree with that
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:17.680]  when you see a government clearly moving against freedom of expression and basically taking the
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:22.800]  point of view that anybody that doesn't agree 100 with the government's point of view is now an
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:28.640]  extremist and we've had other members of the u.s. government saying that anybody who engages in
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:34.320]  this kind of dissent ought to lose their citizenship rights and then you have the excuse that torture
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:40.880]  is okay on non-citizens you can see the link up being uh... created to try and sell the idea
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:46.880]  that it's not only okay for the u.s. government to be torturing captured al-qaeda or uh iraqi taxi
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.240]  drivers but certain members within the united states itself are now open to being targeted
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:56.720]  that's what the military commission's access it says we strip a u.s. citizen other citizenship
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:01.200]  the president or any of his designates then your secretly can be tortured tried and executed
[1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:06.640]  that's in there and it's a very very much what the nazis used to do in fact uh... you know i think
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:11.040]  one of the biggest psychic shocks americans are having to deal with is we're waking up and realizing
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:17.360]  that the torture scandal isn't just now it's been going on all along and we are this century's version
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:23.280]  of the nazis or during the last century it was germany italy in japan this century it's the united
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:29.280]  states israel britain and australia that are the bad guys and and people are having a hard time
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:35.120]  adjusting to that well i mean all governments are corrupt and wicked and on average in history but
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:41.200]  clearly the anglo-american establishment is openly saying you say global warming in real
[1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:46.400]  we're gonna arrest you you have any free speech we're gonna arrest you uh... in banning travel
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.120]  this ties in the key point i didn't make it in isn't international i d cards and control and
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:55.280]  tracking when i went to canada they held me and said we're sending you back or we may put you in

[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:23.760]  not allowed here you know to come into the country if you criticize what's happening in palestine
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:27.360]  you're not allowed here and then on the other side of the coin they're saying if you criticize open
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:33.040]  borders you're not allowed in canada or england or europe this is what the commas are did in russia
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:37.920]  this is what the nazis did in germany you don't agree with the party you aren't allowed to travel
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:42.240]  aren't allowed to have a job and they admit that's what the national ID cards for that's what the no
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:47.040]  fly list with over a million one hundred thousand people that's right one point one million and growing
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:50.720]  they admit that's going to be a no-work list if you're not in good favor with the government on
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:55.440]  your taxes they're announcing it from australia to the us you won't be able to have a job and
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:59.520]  they'll prosecute your employers but then give waivers to the illegal aliens because like there's
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:05.760]  a waiver for them to get stimulus money the 787 million but citizens have to show id i mean
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:12.640]  micro vero they are going into mega high gear and i see nowhere worse than england i mean it is
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:19.440]  literally becoming 1984 they had the head of mi five as you know quit last month saying we're
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:24.080]  turning into 1984 this is a police state it turns out the government spies on parliament the real
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:29.200]  government there are resting members of parliament that leak out info about corruption and and swat
[1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:34.320]  teaming them i mean there's just too many things for me to report mike there's too much happening
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:41.120]  too fast right now they are hitting us at every angle well you're absolutely correct we're seeing
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:46.400]  exactly the same thing about jane harman in congress nobody's going to investigate or nobody's going
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:50.160]  to fire her nobody's going to impeach her but they're trying to go after the people who leaked the
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:55.920]  story of her obstruction of justice in an espionage case they're trying to make those people the
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:26:01.680]  criminal as far as moving very fast yes they are and they're moving so fast they're becoming very
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:07.040]  obvious to people i think there is an element of panic going on the reason they're moving fast
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:12.400]  is they realize their window of opportunity may be closing on creating this new global empire
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:17.520]  because as the economy continues to deteriorate more and more people realize that globalism
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:23.920]  is the cause of the economic downturn and they're not going to accept globalism as a fix for it
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:29.520]  anytime soon and certainly the egregious attacks on freedom of speech are getting completely completely
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:36.160]  out of control i got a document earlier today uh posted up at my website it is the new lexicon
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:41.200]  for extremism in the united states it's an official you listen that yeah and it's alternative media
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:46.960]  it says anybody tell them that that that that has a different view in news is basically a terrorist
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:53.680]  go ahead yeah basically anybody not 100% in goose step with the government is an extremist and
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:58.480]  everything is in there i fit into probably about 12 of the groups in there you probably fit into a
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:03.040]  bunch of them there it is almost impossible to not be considered an extremist going through
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:07.360]  this list of definitions that they have in there and what this is this is the device
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:12.480]  to criminalize the entire population to then justify anything the government cares to do to
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:16.880]  them we can arrest you because you're an extremist we can do this because you're an extremist we can
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:20.960]  shut down your computers we can break into your home we can do all of this stuff because you're
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:24.320]  an extremist and you're not doing what we the government say you should be doing for your own
[1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:30.480]  good and they try in these documents they'll have extremists right next to cop killers they'll go
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:36.320]  every page to condition the cops this guy killed a cop and then i'll next say ron paul people are
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:44.640]  returning vets it's guilt by association and again they're so bold in what they're doing
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:51.040]  i mean think i mean i'm speechless a microvera of what really happened dot com can you comment
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:57.360]  on the home secretary in england saying we're publicly shaming you and if you don't comply
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:02.800]  that's a quote with what our view is you will be arrested in england and you will be banned from
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:08.640]  coming into our country i mean this is flat folks this is the gauntlet being thrown down
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:14.720]  where they say you're not allowed to have free speech yeah it's absolute totalitarianism and for
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:18.880]  years we've had this whole political correctness doctrine in the united states which had sort of
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:23.200]  the implied idea that you're allowed to have freedom of speech only so long as you don't say
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:27.520]  anything we don't agree with which of course is not what the founding fathers intended and
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:32.160]  we're seeing it here in the united states free speech is now only allowed in free speech zones
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:35.760]  we're not allowed to express our opinion out in public where anybody might see it
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:39.040]  your debt you're right they're trying to find some way they can shut down the blogs in the
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:44.560]  alternative media and they are moving very very rapidly but again there's this old little piece
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:48.560]  of wisdom floating around the net that the fastest way to bring down a dictator is to force them to
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:53.520]  act like one where everybody can see it and we're kind of getting into that and i think right now i
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.320]  mean just going around my everyday life talking to people at the supermarket and the post office
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:03.280]  and everything when you talk to them they all know what's going on and they're all getting angry
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:08.800]  think about what dirtbags they are all over the world but now in the west saying you don't have
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:16.640]  free speech i mean they're coming right out with it it's just folks this is tyranny this is corruption
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:23.200]  this is despots this is the death of liberty and in all ways of companies having your pension funds
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:28.800]  taken having your nation bankrupted and it's because they know that if we get politically active and
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:33.920]  take the nation back we're going to arrest all these bankers they might they're going for broke
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:42.480]  aren't they i mean i'm gonna talk about when we come back yes 1-800-2599231 calls coming up 1-800-2599231
[1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:48.560]  our youtube channel a million views a week and growing totally shut down completely blown away
[1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:58.160]  no first amendment we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:05.760]  hi this is peter cronchknob with mitis resources as you know government spending is at an all-time
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:10.320]  high and inflation is on the rise what are you doing right now to protect yourself financially
[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:14.560]  as the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention
[1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:19.440]  more people will lose their jobs and worse their life savings having your hard-earned money in banks

[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:08.800]  bit but isn't this the response we should be having to just outrageous you know statements about you
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:13.520]  deny global warming you can't come to england you criticize open borders you can't come to england
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:18.400]  you criticize the immigrants and welfare you're arrested in england now i mean that really happening
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:23.760]  folks they arrest people now the same thing's happening in canada they're trying to set it up
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:28.560]  here they're announcing a new in the new york times an end of the free web internet to end of net
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:36.880]  neutrality youtube is just banning not just me it's open season as they purge people uh clearly i mean
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:41.840]  accounts everywhere i knew and and directors i love they're all being banned i mean and and
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:46.640]  folks don't even know this attack is going on it is just intensifying what do we do about this
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:51.760]  mike revero well first of all your response is absolutely appropriate and one of the things i
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:56.880]  keep trying to tell my audience is we have been taught and trained over the we've been conditioned
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:03.120]  over the last several decades to view any strong emotions as negative we're not supposed to hate
[1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:08.240]  we're not supposed to be in rage we're supposed to have anger management we're supposed to be calm
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.880]  we know there's trace amounts of tranquilizers in the water but there comes a time when hate is
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:18.320]  an appropriate reaction if you're dealing with people engaged in hateful acts and you're allowed
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:23.680]  to get angry you have to give yourself permission to be enraged by what you see happening before
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:28.480]  you and like i said we're all dealing with this horrible psychic shock of waking up to realize
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:32.640]  that our government is not only torturing innocent people to death just over the last few years
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:38.080]  it's been going on for decades and we used to hear these little stories and we'd sort of dismiss
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:43.120]  them and say oh it's probably an isolated incident it isn't torture has been a part of the policy
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:48.080]  of the united states government going back sent all the way to world war two i want to ask you
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:52.880]  how do you have to deal with that yeah in fact it's part two have you seen i'm sure you've seen it
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:58.480]  gonzalus came out as obama now protects them for the torture and says he's going to continue it
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:02.480]  but it's the rough interrogation torture people with bugs waterboarding all of this
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:07.440]  now gonzalus comes out and says we're gonna have to torture again this arrogant piece of
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:14.240]  filth is now this mingala is now defending it saying it's good he's thumbing his nose at everybody
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:20.720]  yeah absolutely and yet every expert tells you torture does not get you reliable information
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:26.240]  if torture actually worked to get intelligence then women in the middle ages really work turning
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:31.040]  themselves into black cats and flying over the village on their broomsticks if torture really
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:37.680]  does work then john mccain told the north vietnamese everything they wanted to know all these phony
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:43.280]  uh false alarm terror attacks we'd have over the last five years all resulted from bad information
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:48.800]  acquired through torture what torture does produce is terror on the part of the government the
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:53.520]  government is trying to terrorize the rest of the world and the american people that it's able
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:59.200]  and willing to do this kind of thing and of course to force confessions which is what the spanish
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:03.840]  inquisition used to use torture for it's what the nazis use torture for we are going back to the
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.720]  dark ages courtesy of the united states government this is dark ages mentality these people are
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:14.240]  talking about an interesting study came out this last week the more christian people are the more
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:20.000]  likely they are to agree with and support the use of torture and that is on one level very surprising
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:25.600]  and on the other perhaps not quite so because fanatical people can do fanatical things but this
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:31.200]  is that's the new establishment christianity that says kill all the brown people because they're not
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:37.840]  christians let god sort them out but now they kind of use the christian step forward under bush
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:43.920]  fake christian now it's the liberal communist step forward but meanwhile it's that dialectic of
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:49.520]  left right that the establishment uses to move forward two different wings on the same bird
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:56.640]  well you're absolutely right about this left right republican democrat it's a false dichotomy
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:40:00.560]  to create the illusion there's still some kind of choice but this last election kind of pretty
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:06.320]  much established that there really was no choice whatsoever and i think that was my next question
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:12.640]  for you i'm really starting to see a lot of the obama noids wake up and realize wait a minute
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:17.120]  he's protecting them on torture wait a minute he's and and and oh i haven't asked you your take on
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  the the flu hype i mean wasn't that clearly a smoke screen for christ we're going under for
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:28.880]  obama's protecting bush on torture and for them saying we're going to forcibly inoculate you
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:33.680]  and have marshal law in the future and lock down us cities but the border is going to stay open
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.560]  well definitely was a media distraction and certainly the pharmaceutical companies were
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:42.320]  very happy that it came along because they've made a huge amount of money just like they did back in
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:47.920]  1976 but yes this was a media distraction the media was just so happy to have something that they
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:54.160]  could report on that wasn't the economy wasn't jane harman wasn't a pack wasn't any of the things
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:59.440]  that the government is trying to keep us from paying attention to and the fact that the pandemic
[1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:03.840]  has turned out to be a big bit of nothing i think is going to blow back on the corporate media and
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:08.320]  the government because once more the american people are seeing the government decried wolf
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:13.680]  the corporate media that was reporting on a bogus story while real story is important to all of us
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:20.400]  were being trivialized and marginalized you know obama keeps denying that he's anti gun when he
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:25.600]  called for bans in illinois and his attorney general supported a total ban in the dc gun bad
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:30.560]  he said nationwide no civilian ownership of firearms that's a quote now he's supporting a
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:34.800]  treaty that when i first read it and gunners of america first read it we just said it bans reloading
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:39.920]  as terrorism as explosives manufacturer says it's terrorism bans changing a barrel or manipulating
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:45.280]  you know modifying your gun but even lou dobbs and cnn analyzed it and they were right i hadn't
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:50.640]  noticed it basically allows them to ban guns outright the manufacturer importation and export
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:56.160]  and so in the words of a us senator and lou dobbs it says it bans the second amendment i mean they
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:02.400]  are actually trying to pass a treaty to ban the second amendment what is going to happen when the
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:09.040]  public finds out about that well i'm hoping the public will be very angry in fact i i'm a little
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:12.960]  surprised we haven't seen more anger in the population yet we've seen all these other
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:16.720]  countries like iceland where the governments have already been brought down by a very angry
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:21.840]  populace and i start wondering what does it take to get the american people angry and are we really
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:26.480]  being drugged by something in our drinking water but to get back to this treaty unfortunately the
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:32.320]  way the constitution is written treaty obligations supersede all other laws in the united states
[1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:39.360]  so if in point of fact they can get this treaty signed and ratified by the necessary number of
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:44.240]  states then it does become law and the second amendment is null and void but you can go through
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:48.960]  the government to reverse the treaty or as the declaration of independence says completely abolish
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:53.360]  the criminal fat belly government well i think we're kind of on that latter option right now
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.320]  i think last september when they passed all of these bailouts despite overwhelming public
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:02.960]  opposition it is obvious the government isn't listening to us anymore taxes are going to go
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:07.200]  up to cover this hundred thousand dollars per taxpayer debt burden that's been added from
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:12.960]  the bailouts we have taxation without representation and the school i went to i was taught that's a
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:19.680]  valid reason for kicking out the government i keep stuttering and stumbling because it's so
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:23.920]  incredible even to me i've known they were setting this up and building it and they admitted it was
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:28.320]  a global tyranny but to see them saying we're going to ban your free speech we're not going to
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:32.720]  give you jobs if you criticize the government you'll have to have an id card to have jobs
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:37.200]  we're tracking everything you do alternative media or terrorist gun owners or terrorist
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:44.080]  veterans or terrorist i mean it is a completely rogue bankrupt government openly run by offshore
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:50.880]  banks i've got scores of articles about chicago and illinois police stealing people's cars dc police
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:55.760]  tow people's cars legally parked and then keep them and take them to police chop shops that's
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:00.720]  mainstream news dalis police are still planning drugs on people and taking their cars mainstream
[1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:09.680]  news uh the just banks are stealing everything i mean the corruption is just it is just unbelievable
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:15.360]  mike it is and it's going to continue and it's going to get worse until the people stand up and
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:21.520]  say no more we have to have the right to say no to all of this stuff there is no freedom without
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:27.360]  the freedom to say no and the time to say no to all of this corruption is right now and because if
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:32.720]  if we don't stand up and oppose them now when we've got a reasonable chance of victory we're
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:37.360]  soon going to be in a situation where that possibility of victory is being eroded away
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:42.400]  exactly smaller and smaller because the government will work to perpetuate its power and mike that's
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:47.760]  how this interim effect works as you know if we allow youtube to keep banning marines throwing
[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:52.160]  puppies off cliffs and then liberal groups conservative groups ban michael savage start
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:45:00.480]  banning me then it bans everybody you see if we buckle under i mean they said the uh the home
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:04.640]  secretary in england and all are also saying in canada we're banning criticizing the e u we're
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:09.680]  banning criticizing global warming we're banning criticizing open borders we want this to be a
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:14.240]  chilling effect they're saying to teach you you're going to be penalized if you do this
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.080]  that is that that demands rebellion in the info war because i keep saying nine
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.480]  90 percent as the military says of war is info war 90 percent of it is speaking out
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.360]  as thomas everson kept saying educate the whole the people about liberty and tyranny will fade
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:37.200]  people keep asking what the solution is its rally it's saying no it speak out it's rebuke
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:42.000]  this government and you know you keep talking about drugs in the water look i see stuff like
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:48.240]  this every week and i didn't even cover this last week that's how conditioned i am and again they
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:53.760]  just keep i have in this nbc seeing and saying they want to put drugs in the water to make americans
[1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:57.200]  not uh i'm depressed they're doing that because they know it's coming out they're already doing
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:01.440]  it and i can prove it in a moment uh they have the japanese government british government coming
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:06.160]  out saying we want to put prozac and lithium in the water saying we want to put statin drugs
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:11.600]  for uh even for children in the water everyone needs to go on statin drugs for cholesterol and
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:16.160]  that's shown to be a fraud look at this lithium in the water and it goes on to have the japanese
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:22.480]  government bbc saying they should put lithium in the water that's a hardcore anti psychotic
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:27.840]  literally turns you into a zombie mentally and then i have this article more americans taking
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:33.680]  drugs for mental illness roiders and uh there was 50 percent more people on drugs last year
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:39.840]  than a few years than than the 2000 uh from 2006 to 1996 the studies a few years late they always
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:46.720]  take time and they had over a hundred million prescriptions in 2008 for prozac alone go ahead
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:52.480]  sir well basically uh when you get back to this issue about all these laws that are coming out
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:56.800]  where the government is saying we will punish you for speaking out we will punish you for refusing
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.360]  to believe in global warming we will punish you for refusing to believe in the holocaust
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:08.560]  this is terrorism our governments are committing terrorism against their own people now i see
[1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:13.680]  that as an act of a complete desperation but the reality is that the united states is becoming
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.240]  more and more like the soviet union while the former soviet union is becoming more and more
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:24.640]  like the united states of america used to be and uh it's amazing how this transition is going on
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:31.040]  but you're absolutely right we are headed in this direction of a total surveillance police state
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:35.680]  they're watching us all the time they're allowed to go into our computers without telling us without
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:41.440]  a warrant it's almost comical to see jane harmon standing up there screaming about what was a warranted
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:47.280]  legal wiretap on her conversation and rail about that when she was one of bush's strongest supporters
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:52.480]  for warrantless spying and surveillance on ordinary citizens oh yeah they're going to burn the fbi
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:57.840]  agents just like all the fbi agents that tried to stop 9-11 got burned or fired and the very ones
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:02.400]  that helped it happen and blocked investigations when flight schools are going this guy didn't
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:08.080]  want to know how to land or take off he wants to fly into buildings they gave them record cash bonuses
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:16.960]  they absolutely did and the same thing with uh with the the fbi agents for the apax spy case
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:23.120]  they're going to now be fired and now that the apax spies have been let go man i mean
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:29.280]  i mean i tell you mike i really am getting freaked out i mean there is nowhere to run
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:33.120]  either i mean i'll be honest if there was some new world in some new country some island i could
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:37.680]  go to with my family i'd still you know do a website or something and try to fight for my old
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:44.800]  homeland but you know i get get out of here there's nowhere to go man this is a new world order and uh
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:49.600]  i just can't believe the public is starting to get an idea but i don't think they realize
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:53.840]  mike you know they tune into us they think all these guys are exaggerating i can't explain
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:59.120]  how bad it is all the data we've got let's take a call uh well let me finish up on the drugs in
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  the water i mean i'm going to make a film about this is going to be part of a new film i'm making
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:08.800]  in the future that they've done the studies this is even in the mainstream news in the associated
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:15.040]  press where water supplies and reservoirs that are not tied to toilet to tap you know you know
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:19.840]  that that are not sewage reclaim water dump sites where they have the sewage treatment plant then it
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:25.360]  dumps into a reservoir uh as a lot of you know these reservoirs that have high levels of prozac and
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:31.040]  you know cocaine and nicotine and caffeine i mean it's all in there because sewage is going in
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:34.320]  there efforts been treated but the chemicals are still there uh for listeners that don't understand
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.760]  that they're finding in rivers and streams and small town reservoirs that are not connected
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:47.760]  and are not downstream from runoff uh of a fluent that it's from sewage and they're finding super
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:53.520]  high levels of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and i've seen the different lab studies where it's
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:59.840]  it's kind of like a generic mass binder of serotonin reuptake inhibitor uh uh fluorine
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:05.840]  slash fluoride molecule and it's clearly man-made they are dosing us and they know it's coming out
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:10.640]  so they're saying every week on the news i'm catching and i don't see a lot of news we might
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:15.520]  put drugs in the water hell they're probably about to announce drugs in the water i mean we're
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:22.640]  i mean what's coming next mike it's it's definitely out there and you know anybody
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:28.160]  who complains about it they're going to try and uh ridicules the way they ridiculed anybody who was
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:34.160]  concerned about fluoride being in the water and uh you know you see all these tv shows and movies
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:38.960]  about anybody who talked about fluoride in the water even in dr strangelove stanley cubrick's
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:44.320]  wonderful film about nuclear war the guy who goes nuts he's talking about fluoride and the purity
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:49.680]  of our precious bodily fluids and they that's what they're going to do to anybody who complains
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:54.480]  about drugs in the water now and meanwhile it's the government pushing to make us take vaccines
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:58.720]  and saying they're getting ready for forced inoculations with the next pandemic they want our

[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:11.840]  we were hacked for five days straight last week they went over our cdn's
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:16.080]  correctly to the ports and they attacked the facilities themselves and we would block them
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:24.000]  the entire it facilities we're being banned all over the internet we're being attacked by
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  co until pro everywhere a lot of them are government agents or stooges who are kind of a snowball
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:35.920]  effect the parrot effect the pop a gano effect copying the operatives to get them to a lot of
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:40.080]  other people attack me because i'm in pole position in the fight against the new world order that
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:45.840]  it's really not an enviable enviable position i mean this you know if you were here you'd know
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:50.320]  and a lot of you wouldn't be so jealous and upset out there and making crap up about me but you know
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:54.480]  it's kind of like uh the guy says the movie network when he comes in he says if you put
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:59.920]  howard bill on television i'll sue you all go to all the papers and he's like great we need all the
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:05.760]  publicity we can get i mean that's kind of my position here but at the same time i'm not doing
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:11.120]  this for ego so it's not fun and i'm way deep into this now and there's no turning back i want to
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:15.680]  take a few calls from mike revero another great patriot who you know just continues to fight the
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:20.160]  new world order get the word out uh and a lot of times i get news wrong as i read this this morning
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:26.320]  and then i forgot to i just blurted out that half that there was a doubling of people uh
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:32.640]  and it's actually they said a 73 percent increase in adults using prescription drugs
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:38.880]  and a 50 percent of children are using drugs to treat mental illness so well whatever however
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:44.000]  that comes out so that's from roiders so there's the actual number i have a tendency to blurt
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:49.360]  things out uh let's go ahead and talk to brian in montreal canada you're on the air with mike
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:54.480]  revero go ahead hi elix i just wanted to let you know that ever since you mentioned v for vendetta
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:58.400]  the other day for the last four days they're doing it on purpose over montreal to make the
[1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:05.040]  chemtrails and v formation okay i that i'm not the center of the universe not even the center of
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:10.800]  my own household so that's certainly ridiculous but uh and there's a canadian doctor up here who
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:15.520]  said that uh they're going to take this new swine flu uh strain since it's so weak
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:20.320]  and put it in the vaccinations this fall for all of canadians yes i saw you didn't get it this time
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:25.600]  you'll get it yes i saw that in fact uh thank you so much yes they're gonna try to make people
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:29.840]  with fear and try to make all the school kids take the new swine flu stuff that they've now
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:35.600]  said isn't swine flu because it isn't it's it's engineered uh next uh fall but to add on that
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:42.640]  and get mike reveros comment i forgot to cover this uh big top british scientist and i think i
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:48.400]  printed it but i don't see it here in the stack it's up on info wars and prison planet uh virologist
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:54.560]  says virus came from lab just google that mike you know you always see flu viruses come out of the
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:58.800]  east they come out of a different hemisphere they always have a genetic pedigree this thing had no
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:03.760]  pedigree it just came out of nowhere with four different types of genetics and all the virologists
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:10.640]  we talked to said guaranteed uh it's uh engineered in the lab you know that's like looking at a
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:14.560]  brand new chevy tahoe and saying you know did it grow on a tree you know it was obviously
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:21.600]  made in the factory uh your take on that well we've located several articles from the cdc's
[1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:25.760]  own website over the last several years where they had been playing with exactly these kind
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:30.000]  of recombinants and we even found one article where they put together one of these hybrids
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.360]  and were disappointed that it turned out it was not as infectious as they thought it might be
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:39.760]  and a lot of people are very concerned because we know scientists went out and they dug up
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:47.600]  the bodies of victims of the 1918 spanish flu and recovered that genome rebuilt it recreated it
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:52.960]  and started splicing it into all of these other things and when we first heard about this new
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:59.280]  flu pandemic we were being told that the avian flu component of it was almost identical to the
[1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:05.200]  1918 flu pandemic and so we get we're getting all this conflicting information where originally
[1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:09.600]  the media was saying this was this new franken virus made up of all these other components
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:14.720]  completely new nobody had immunity to it now we're finally hearing from people it's it's it's
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:20.160]  mild it's not even as serious as regular flu so there's a lot of very bad information going on
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:26.960]  out there but we know the cdc has been playing with exactly this kind of assembled virus in their
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:32.800]  labs oh yeah absolutely assembled no doubt in fact there it is professor the synonym of h1n1
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.160]  virus accidentally released from lab well we told you that eight nine days ago microvaro stay there

[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:15.920]  it's a kind of a question on i know you're a father and have young children i appreciate
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:19.440]  everything you're doing in the info war putting yourself and your family on the line
[2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:23.840]  because you realize without liberty there's nothing there's no future for any of us and i have a 10
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:28.080]  year old son and a five year old daughter and it's it's kind of hard to walk that fine line i want
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:32.240]  them to be uh critical thinkers independent thinkers but i'm not going to sit there and break down
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:38.000]  you know the whole anglo white anglo establishment to him what do you suggest uh what measures i take
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.160]  to get them to ask important questions but i don't want them to spend their whole childhood
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:46.960]  trying to break down the new world order i would leave them the roman the greek english
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:54.640]  french uh medieval fairy tales because fairy tales will teach them that just because somebody
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:02:02.160]  looks like a nice man he's really a wolf and you can only trust your family and family comes first and
[2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:06.080]  i would never fight with your wife in front of them and i would teach them early on that
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:11.040]  the world is against them generally and then nobody's going to look out for them but their
[2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:16.720]  family and themselves and i would teach them to not care about madison avenue and teach them about
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:21.280]  sales and how the system tries to make them feel inadequate and i would teach them that it's not cool
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:27.040]  to get into trouble it's cool to live well as the french say i appreciate your call micro vero give
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:35.920]  us your take on that um i have to admit i was momentarily distracted there and i i i oh yes i'm
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:40.800]  sorry yeah about the chill raising the children i think more than anything else just raise them with
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:47.600]  an idea that big people can lie to them especially from the government tv because i think if kids
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:53.120]  are taught to be skeptical of what the tv and radio is telling them then they don't have to
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:58.240]  spend their entire lives deconstructing the new world order uh they just need to be skeptical and
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:03.280]  i know in the age that i was raised in we basically grew up with this idea that whatever the tv
[2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:08.720]  newscasters told us was the honest truth and we could rely on them we could we could count on them
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:15.840]  that was the way the world was we now know that over our entire lives the corporate media tv
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:20.880]  newspaper radio was hiding from us the fact that the u.s government tortures prisoners and they've
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:26.960]  been doing it all along that cover-up alone should thoroughly discredit the corporate media in the
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:32.320]  eyes on i was on a neocon website front page magazine and i click we'll play this later
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.680]  weeks ago researching and i clicked on one of their events in california and they had this
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:42.720]  marine corps colonel on there saying i don't like waterboarding i don't like waterboarding
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:47.680]  i like electricity they all laugh and i've had the special forces commanders on
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:52.640]  it was it's standard training for army special forces how to hit hook electrodes to people's
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:58.160]  genitals they have little field crackers we have the manuals i mean this didn't just start last week
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.240]  we had a caller into our show the other day who was an ex marine he's now living in europe
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:10.000]  he's an expat and he's a vietnam veteran and he said they were taught how to do these kind of
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.960]  interrogations and they were taught to take three north vietnamese prisoners up in a helicopter
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:19.040]  throw one out and they knew that the other two would start talking before the first guy even
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:24.880]  hit the ground and they were taught to do this this was policy this wasn't bad apples it wasn't
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:30.560]  rogue soldiers it wasn't people getting overexcited this was trained and passed down the chain of
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:36.400]  command to do these things and then you expand on that mike then when our troops get captured the
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:40.640]  same stuff gets done to them this is not what you want to turn your army into because then they come
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:47.360]  back to america they become cops and judges and lawyers and local cia crack dealers and they start
[2:04:47.360 --> 2:04:54.000]  ruling then you got to have a war with them and then the city's burned micro vero always great

[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:12.320]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:19.120]  that's right the democratic leader of the senate came out last week and said our government has
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:26.080]  been completely captured by offshore foreign banks the federal reserve testifies before
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:29.760]  congress they're above the law no agency of government no court no branch of government
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:34.480]  can even look into what they do we are a captured nation as soon as we realize that we can turn
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:40.080]  it around how did the british corrupt and bring down china they brought in opium corrupted the
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:44.800]  port cities and officials moved in inland within 50 years they hand the nation fully controlled
[2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:50.160]  through corrupt systems and it's the same thing you have the big major narcotics traffickers
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:56.880]  selling the drugs through the local apothecaries and uh drug stores other companies broke the
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:09:02.800]  cocaine opium heroin monopoly so the big drug dealers got together and we've done the history
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:06.640]  of this in the past we're just going to be focusing on some other areas today and they got
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:10.880]  together and said let's make drugs illegal then we can launder the money use the police to go after
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:14.960]  our competition and then arrest the minorities and people we don't like and put them in prison
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:21.440]  prisons we own prisons we control and so uh just like the crack cocaine was another
[2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:25.840]  expression of that in the 80s as the cia solicitor general admitted shelling crack in the black
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:31.920]  communities are further implode those societies very racist system now we know with alcohol
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:37.680]  prohibition it roughly tripled the amount of alcoholism uh crime exploded corrupted the police
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:42.720]  and now all over the country police departments are caught stealing houses homes cars without
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:47.120]  even drugs being found their asset forward to seizure the rest of the world is doing it as well
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:53.360]  mexico is collapsing because of their phony drug war as the government cartels fight with the other
[2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:57.920]  cowboy cartels they're now attacking our second amendment the name of all this but i thought we
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:03.680]  would uh so if we don't decriminalize drugs it's over this is one of their greatest foot in the
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:08.160]  door to bring in militarized police and tyranny and they've done a great job now they're wheeling the
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:15.360]  drug war system mechanism around the artillery to be brought to bear on the american people
[2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:22.560]  now everybody's a terrorist liberals conservatives gun owners veterans i mean we've got more reports
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:26.480]  saying alternative media are terrorists today mainstream news we broke a few weeks ago and
[2:10:26.480 --> 2:10:32.160]  now mainstream news uh on the drug report in places so i wanted to go to uh a very interesting
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:38.240]  researcher we appreciate his time uh jeffrey myron he's written a book called drug war crimes the
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:43.360]  consequences of prohibition says we could save 77 million dollars a year by decriminalizing drugs
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:47.600]  yeah but the big banks launder 400 billion a year in drug money so they don't want that to happen
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:56.640]  they get to leverage that too and uh he is a professor at uh harvard and uh department of
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:01.840]  economics at harvard university and a very long bio you can just google his name professor jeffrey
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:06.080]  myron and we appreciate him coming on the show to the bottom of the hour then i'll have open
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:11.200]  phones and take your calls about youtube suspending our channel england and counted openly announcing
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:15.680]  an indifference speech will be arrested basically if you criticize global warming and a lot more
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:20.640]  uh let's go ahead and go to the professor professor thanks for coming on with us thanks for having me
[2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:25.920]  up uh so tell us what you found on the economic side with the data of what the phony drug war
[2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:29.760]  does and what would happen if we did like some other nations have done and started backing off
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:36.480]  these draconian laws well i mean the the laws are a key source of a lot of the violence that
[2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:41.280]  we're observing for example in mexico right now because when you criminalize something you drive
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:45.280]  it underground when you drive underground people resolve their disputes with with guns instead of
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:51.760]  using lawyers advertising and so on boy that's right six thousand and five hundred people dead
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:57.120]  last year they're online to kill ten thousand this year that they're an open collapse and they're
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:04.960]  blaming not enough drug laws for what's happening right i mean the the laws just make things worse
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.360]  for one of the examples we might see in the near future is all the violence in mexico has given
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:14.400]  people excuse to say well the problem is the guns the guns are coming from the u.s so therefore we
[2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:19.360]  need more gun laws but you have more gun laws you tend to drive that market underground and you just
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:24.560]  generate violence in the illegal gun industry as people resolve disputes there with violence rather
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:29.920]  than uh standard nine violent mechanisms so exactly the the more laws the more likely you are to see
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:34.400]  the violent dispute resolution okay well i mean break down because you're an economist and a
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:39.760]  prestigious one break down the numbers of what we're dealing with here and just another case
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:45.360]  for uh for decriminalizing well the numbers i should emphasize that to me are only one's
[2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:50.960]  part of the story but if the u.s were to legalize drugs we would probably save 40 to 45 billion
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:57.280]  dollars per year by not hiring police and prosecutors and prisons and so on we'd also
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:02.960]  raise something like 30 to 35 billion per year in tax revenue by imposing standard taxation
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:07.920]  of similar to alcohol and tobacco on legalized drugs now i say that's only one part of the
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:13.120]  story because i think what's at least as important are all the other effects of legalizing which is
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:17.760]  allowing people to make their own decisions and choose to do what they want to do as long as they're
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:22.560]  not harming other people that's exactly what we do with alcohol we keep it legal and we only punish
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:27.280]  activities involving alcohol that are harmful to innocent third parties such as and and professor
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:32.240]  i'm sure you've seen the statistics where prescription drugs are killing 300 000 a year
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:35.920]  alcohol is killing a couple hundred thousand cocaine and heroin and all these things as
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:40.800]  bad as they are kill a fraction of that and you and usually that's because they're dirty
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:46.000]  and have been cut by bad things because they're not regulated uh exactly the quality control
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.320]  in an underground market is likely to be a lot worse than a legal market in underground markets
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:54.640]  you're going to have accidental poisonings and accidental overdoses uh because people don't
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:58.400]  know what they're getting in a legal market some people do stupid things would say with alcohol
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:04.320]  but it's rare that someone is confused about the fact that you know the the spirit like whisk your
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:08.320]  scotch is serious they know what they're getting and they know if they want to have a mild dose
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:12.720]  they drink beer wine so you don't get all these unintended effects that you do in an underground
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:17.360]  market and people don't know if it's 10% cocaine or 90% cocaine well professor you wrote the book
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:25.040]  drugs war crimes drug war crimes and i mean this always corrupts police look at mexico look at
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:29.280]  the united states i mean i come across four or five articles a day and don't even cover
[2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:34.160]  them i'm not even here to bash the cops i mean but i'm not you know not covering because i'm
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:39.520]  covering up i'm just totally it's passe where they're caught dealing drugs selling drugs
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:43.200]  half the towns around austin or more the sheriffs and police chiefs have been caught
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:47.760]  are their children dealing drugs with them cops caught stealing drugs out of drug lockers
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:52.640]  taking protection money from criminals and then it and then you know cities all over the country
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:58.000]  stealing people's cars and homes with acid for which are seizure to me it's the corrupting of
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:05.440]  society with black markets that is the biggest thing while we have got to you know got to
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:11.360]  decriminalize now um well i certainly share your view i would have said let me just say
[2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:15.120]  one small thing i would use the word legalization not decriminalization because
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:18.640]  by decriminalization some people mean that you're legalizing the possession
[2:15:18.640 --> 2:15:23.520]  but not the production sale uh my analysis to get the full benefits to eliminate the black
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:28.800]  market you have to legalize and allow all aspects of the of the market to be above ground
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:34.080]  but you know fact clarification um absolutely the corruption is a horrible aspect of it
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:38.560]  and the disrespectful law that's bred even more generally because most people realize
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:43.760]  that the laws are being widely disobeyed both by users and by producers and so people get into
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:48.800]  this mindset of realizing that basically laws are for suckers only the only people who are stupid
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:52.960]  they are bothered to obey the laws that they don't like most people get around them then and that's
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.680]  really destructive for a civil society yeah i saw a report there's something like 54 million
[2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:03.120]  non-filers now and it's growing by millions every year because it turns out half of congress isn't
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:09.120]  paying taxes are behind and most the ceo's are paying like one percent and and then i'm and then
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:13.360]  they admit they don't enforce on the rich guys they enforce on the middle class and and working
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:18.560]  people so it's not just the drugs i mean uh professor are you not seeing just a more and more
[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:25.680]  lawless two-tier system uh where governments uh are exempt uh well i'm sure you've heard about
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.960]  california where a million people now uh have government license plates that can't be pulled
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:36.160]  over or read i hadn't heard that fact but that's very interesting oh i'm not kidding in fact i'll
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:40.720]  pull it up later it was we're live at prison planet dot tv but uh okay well i'm pontificating
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:45.360]  here uh you study the history of this i mean going back to the thirties everything was legal
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:50.800]  at the local drug store and we had much less drug use what's the what's the psychology then
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:54.480]  uh behind this bogus argument that if we legalize drugs everybody will become drug addicts
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:17:00.880]  well we i mean we criminalize marijuana in 1937 we criminalize cocaine and opiates in 1914
[2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:05.840]  uh it's hard to say for sure at what drug use is done before and after because we don't have
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:11.600]  good data once it's been driven underground and i think it's perfectly reasonable to suspect that
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:17.280]  if we legalize that some additional people might choose to use and if we legalize the price would
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:21.520]  fall in some cases by substantial amounts and that would also be a reason why some people might use
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:27.440]  or use more but the crucial thing to think about is it is it a negative if more people use and my
[2:17:27.440 --> 2:17:32.480]  answer is not necessarily what's negative is if people use in a irresponsible way either toward
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:37.360]  others or toward themselves or to their family members but what we observe from virtually all
[2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:42.560]  commodities all activities is that a few people misuse them in stupid ways you know some people
[2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.960]  go bungee jumping in ways that are you know super dangerous but most people go bungee jumping
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:50.800]  don't want to die and they make sure they have adequate safety restraints and things like that
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:55.520]  and most people use alcohol in a way which is moderate and beneficial or pleasurable to them
[2:17:55.520 --> 2:18:00.160]  and it's a relatively small fraction that misuse it and my assessment of the evidence is we would
[2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:05.360]  see exactly the same thing for legalized marijuana or cocaine or heroin of course there are many
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:10.080]  mild ways to consume the drugs which are conventionally thought of as being the hard drugs you can
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:15.840]  drink coca-tea instead of snorting crack cocaine you drink coca-tea you get a bit of an up in the
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:20.080]  way you would from a super caffeinated cola or something like that but you don't become some
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:24.800]  sort of homicidal killer any of the bizarre things that people claim based on very little evidence
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:30.720]  yeah we refer madness shows you know people murdering folks when they smoke pots and we know
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:35.920]  that's ridiculous um but everybody who's had any experience with marijuana realizes that
[2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:40.320]  that's ridiculous and of course the current claim about marijuana is that it causes a
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:44.640]  motivational saint syndrome it makes people lazy and lethargic as exact opposite of what the
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:51.200]  government was claiming a few decades ago absolutely well in my experience in austin all
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:57.600]  these potheds people that do use it a lot do become lackadaisical but again that's being
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:02.240]  abused it's great for people with stomach aches and george washington smoked it and grew it so we
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:08.720]  know that uh he was not lazy or stupid professor final segment coming up but i've seen a lot of
[2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:13.200]  the studies and statistics in europe where when they do decriminalize or legalize drug use goes
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:18.480]  down because now it's not risque it's not associated with being cutting edge and we actually see when
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:24.480]  it's legalized it and i have seen some statistics from 80 90 years ago where uh use was actually
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:29.200]  less because you know i mean coca-cola had cocaine in it uh but uh you know there's that
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.760]  point i want to talk about when we come back uh but there's also some of the other facets
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:39.520]  the serotonin reuptake inhibitors the ridlands uh the you know the speed drugs you have tens of
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:44.400]  millions of americans on these and i've interviewed medical doctors their molecules are more toxic in
[2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:49.600]  many cases than the illegal drugs so why do we have the government and the media with one hand
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:54.960]  pushing all of these legal drugs that are just as bad with their chemical makeup or worse but then
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:59.120]  saying we got to give up all our rides and have swat teams rating everybody for stuff that isn't
[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:04.560]  even as bad let's talk about that when we get back today we cannot afford to ignore the current state
[2:20:04.560 --> 2:20:10.640]  of our country the economy job layoffs mass foreclosures and now we are all at risk of being

[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:32.000]  gives an answer but all right harvard professor of economics jeffrey myron i totally agree with
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.480]  the information he's covering and throwing over here you know most people who use illegal drugs
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:43.440]  never use them again i took cocaine twice when i was in high school at parties and it made me
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:48.560]  have the feeling of like the few times i had car wrecks or that i saw people in car wrecks
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:53.120]  that were really hurt kind of that freaked out wide awake feeling i was like this hidden for me
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:59.680]  me i had a girlfriend that took prozac and i took a couple of those a couple times and it
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:04.640]  didn't really just made me kind of feel like i was disconnected so i never really liked illegal
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:08.560]  drugs you know most people that try them don't ever get into them unless they are illegal the
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:13.280]  studies show then they think it's cool and they want to keep using it but i don't like marijuana
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:17.840]  i don't like anything but caffeine now these days i don't even drink beer but going back to our
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:23.440]  guest uh professor myron uh finishing up here in the time we have we appreciate your time
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:28.480]  in summation people are waking up they're realizing the war on drugs is a fraud the bigger it gets
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:33.280]  the more drugs we have the more people in prison where is all this going and how do we overthrow
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:38.160]  this corrupt system i mean the government's you know involved in the drug trade up their eyeballs
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:41.600]  laundering the money and the rest of it are they ever going to let us get out from under this or
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:46.640]  or is that it well i think it's pricey up to the people to send a clear signal to the government
[2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:52.320]  that they wanted to change politicians are like anybody else they want to succeed and for politicians
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:58.080]  succeeding means getting reelected so if there were a widespread support amongst the voters
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:03.440]  for changing the laws i think the laws would change uh the fact is that so far people don't
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:08.400]  seem to see not enough of people see the wisdom of changing our laws and so we're sort of stuck
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.280]  with the ones that we've got so i wouldn't put the onus just on the politicians i think we need
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:20.480]  to get more people to think about the issues as well absolutely uh but i mean does studying this
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:24.320]  i've seen the numbers but is the worm starting to turn are people really starting to get what
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:30.480]  a ridiculous fraud this war on drugs is i don't know i think that there's been a lot more discussion
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:35.760]  other than the last three six months but there have been other times where there's been a lot
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:41.040]  of discussion and yet nothing has really changed oh and on the whole the pattern has been for
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:48.000]  enforcement and uh the strength of the law to go up and not down so i'm not it's hard to be too
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:54.800]  optimistic i mean i hope i'm wrong this time but uh i don't quite see any mainstream politicians
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:27:00.880]  standing up and taking on this issue you know talk radio takes it on and certain mainstream
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:06.640]  media types have taken it on so it is getting more airtime but it's not obvious getting enough
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:11.760]  attention from the right people for there to be a change professor jeffrey miren i'll tell you what
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:17.360]  i think the last piece of the puzzle is it's all the newscasts pointing at the scum and the meth
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:23.760]  heads and the labs and the toddler walking around in the broken glass and the degeneracy of trash
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:28.880]  that is always going to be involved in whatever is illegal you know you make bruen whiskey illegal
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:32.080]  they're going to be involved in it you make making methamphetamine illegal they're going to be
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:37.120]  involved then it's going to be dirty and kill people and so they can point the criminal element
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:42.000]  and then go see the criminal element we got to keep this illegal and just how trashy they are
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:47.600]  the white trash and the rest of it uh but the criminal elements going to be what you know
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:52.960]  always involve with wherever they can make a quick buck so that isn't an honest argument in my opinion
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:58.720]  well i think it's true that there are going to be people who tend to behave as criminals regardless
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:03.680]  but they're only able to make a lot of money and it's only attractive to draw in people who are
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:08.560]  not inherently sort of oriented toward being criminals if there's a lot of income there
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:13.120]  and that's the result of prohibition so i think although you would see some people to continue
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:18.480]  to be sort of criminals regardless i think a large fraction of people involved would would turn to
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:23.120]  something legitimate because there's no income to be made if you leave there's no excess income
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:28.000]  to be made if you legalize the trade absolutely i had a great uncle who in prohibition ran most of
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:34.320]  whiskey in south texas and he worked with some of the locals here in austin texas uh but uh
[2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:39.040]  i mean he wasn't what you'd call a criminal person it just everybody knew it was a fraud
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:43.120]  they could make a lot of money having fake dairies around the state you know making whiskey and
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:49.040]  delivering it in milk trucks exactly exactly so you're drawing a lot of people who in a better
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:52.960]  in a different world would not be inclined to engage in criminal activity but the temptations
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:59.520]  become sort of awfully hard to resist what about police i mean we've got some numbers they vary but
[2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:04.560]  man i tell you places like chicago and la and places i mean there's more corrupt cops you
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:09.520]  can shake a stick at uh it's a huge problem i think in many ways it's an even bigger problem
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:15.120]  in other countries where the level at which police are compensated is substantially below
[2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:20.640]  in the u.s so the temptations are even greater um and again there's nothing you can do to escape
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:25.280]  that once you have the activity prohibited and once a society gets to a level of corruption
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:30.400]  where enough people accept corruption it then races like a staff infection through the body
[2:29:30.400 --> 2:29:34.480]  the body politic and it collapses folks can just google your name find some of your great
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:39.600]  research studies and writings uh we appreciate uh harvard professor jeffrey myron of economics

[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:16.880]  uh world order that i think all of us would like to see the obama deception completely destroys the

[2:31:22.560 --> 2:31:27.840]  yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement

[2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:46.320]  reporter uh and he went down to mexico city we've had a lot of folks from mexico city on
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:50.480]  sherry 10 venting from mexico other people from mexico reporting and they were all saying a lot
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:54.560]  more people sick than was being said a lot more people and that there were troops running around
[2:34:54.560 --> 2:34:59.280]  it was all scary but then suddenly it turned out those were just regular flues regular coals regular
[2:34:59.280 --> 2:35:04.480]  people dying of pneumonia kind of a mass panic kind of a war of the world's deal where folks were
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:09.840]  out shooting water towers thinking they were tripod alien creatures you know and when orson
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:14.080]  wells did that kind of the same deal so george i remember when he was i saw a youtube video where
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:18.320]  he was freaked out about to go down to mexico city already wearing a mask in southern california
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:25.280]  he got there and found it was a huge hoax and the show ran out yesterday as we were finishing up uh
[2:35:25.280 --> 2:35:31.040]  and so uh tell us exactly what you witnessed you said just to prove this you've gone and shot video
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:34.880]  i haven't seen your channel lately uh but have you posted that or had a chance to where you go
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:39.280]  into the hospital and take your mask off tell us what you saw in mexico city george
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:44.880]  calyx thank you i you know as you come down here you have a total sense of fear from what
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:50.400]  them mainstream media has been telling you about the the flu but as you get here and you start to
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:57.040]  talk to people you start to realize more and more that it's just entirely a big charade and i just
[2:35:57.040 --> 2:36:02.160]  got so frustrated one day uh i actually have a video this on my website i said i'm going to go
[2:36:02.160 --> 2:36:08.960]  into this emergency room and they had uh swine flu cases in this hospital i said i'm going to go
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:12.720]  in there i'm going to take off my mask and i'm going to hang out in there and you know what
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:18.720]  i did that and even my taxi driver came with me and i videotaped it and um you know i just wanted
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:25.520]  to prove to my followers or my listeners that it's it's a charade this is the regular flu
[2:36:25.520 --> 2:36:30.960]  people are going in with regular flu they're not dying in these massive numbers that they're talking
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:36.320]  about and and even if they even if we had a few hundred deaths here that doesn't justify shutting
[2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:42.320]  down a city of 20 million plus i mean it's 20 million people live here and that's okay let me
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:47.040]  stop you that's the key is that imagine if they're talking about total martial law forced
[2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:52.160]  inoculations going to level six for a few dozen people dying when regular flu kills
[2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:57.040]  a quarter of a million every year conservatively what is the deal what is going to happen when
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:02.000]  there's just a regular flu and it kills thousands are they going to use that for martial law takeover
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:08.880]  as a smoke screen during economic collapse and yes that is the number one playbook attack
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:15.360]  profile this was a beta test we know now what their attack profile is going to be that is again
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:20.160]  let's say they got five plays they might pull on us coming up as things collapse that's the
[2:37:20.160 --> 2:37:24.000]  number one play kind of like when they keep throwing Hail Mary's you know that's what this
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:30.160]  coach is going to do well these guys are running it up the middle with the bio uh you know attack
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:34.400]  hysteria and they beta tested this what were folks saying inside the hospital
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:41.040]  basically I didn't really get to talk to them but when we I eventually got to a doctor and
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:46.080]  I have a footage on my channel the hidden camera talking to a doctor and I was actually somewhat
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:52.240]  sick I think I had the stomach flu and I went in there as a regular patient and she she basically
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:58.480]  said in Spanish people translated this for me that it is totally overblown that you know I
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:05.200]  didn't I with even with my symptoms my similar flu like symptoms she I did not have swine flu I
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:10.160]  did not have the symptoms and I believe in the report she talks about that she talks in detail
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:16.240]  like a 10 minute report in Spanish of what's actually really going on I mean it is scary when
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:21.440]  you go in there everyone it has mass on their carrying people's clothes in red shirt sir how
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:25.520]  do you know you even had stomach flu I mean anybody that goes to Mexico for a few days
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:30.720]  especially Mexico City you're going to get Montezuma's revenge I mean you know that that's
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:35.120]  probably what it is I'm taking Baktrim an antibiotic which they gave me and I'm taking
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:39.600]  a modium so I don't know how well I mean I mean sir I mean I mean have you ever been in Mexico
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:48.400]  City before yes I mean did you did you get a stomach ache last time no no I haven't been here
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:52.720]  for a long period of time I'm sure well I mean I mean it could be that it could be that or it
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:57.760]  could be this we did get confirmed reports from caller after caller and doctors and people in
[2:38:57.760 --> 2:39:02.560]  Mexico but a lot of people had stomach type flu but this is supposedly respiratory though
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:09.120]  so it's probably just a regular stomach virus the evidence shows this is a very communicable virus
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:14.240]  it's just very mild but that's what we were saying earlier it could be that it's going to
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:18.720]  mutate into something worse because it's clearly designer so the globalists are evil we have to
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:24.160]  say is this a dummy virus to test spreads as they have said in papers they wanted to do
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:30.080]  a virus that's weak but very communicable to test a very virulent deadly flu or is it going to
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:34.880]  mutate into something worse or combine with other viruses the UN's now fear-mongering saying that so
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:41.760]  I'm thinking everything from their perspective their mindset your comments on that all I have
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:48.000]  to say Alex is is is my my taxi driver is now sick so he's at home I mean I don't believe yet
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:53.920]  swine flu I'm getting over whatever I have it was probably monazuma's revenge but I can tell you
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:58.800]  as you go into the emergency room you can see the fear in people's eyes I mean if you open the
[2:39:58.800 --> 2:40:03.680]  newspapers here everything is about the influenza but when you talk to people they're they're basically
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:08.640]  telling you it's it's a panic they call it to even have a name for it they call it panico it's
[2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:14.160]  it's like a commonly used term for but you know government just but you know folks are not worried
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:17.600]  about that now they're not worried about the police state they're not worried about the
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:22.960]  collapsing economy they're not worrying about sdr's and the imf taking mexico over they're only
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:28.240]  worried about the flu or talking about how it's shut down their life again a perfect way when
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:34.000]  revolution's coming to a head to slap it down is to release this anything else serve from mexico
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:39.280]  city real quick two points that i've been hearing from the people here they they they wonder why
[2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:45.440]  obama visited obama left and then all the politicians got together for some type of meeting here
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:51.920]  and then all of a sudden it just hit the streets big panic uh epidemic and then the second point
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:41:00.320]  is this is timed just with their senator senator elections in one month and that just kind of put
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:05.920]  off bells in my head well there's no doubt and every Mexican we've talked to from mexico says
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:11.120]  they're using it as a smoke screen from all their criminal activity okay well the website is george
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:17.200]  for title uh upon youtube channel hey what do you think of them uh banning the alex jones channel
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:23.120]  for showing a news article when when when google is stealing every book on the planet claiming they
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:28.800]  own it and digitizing it flaunting i mean it's obviously fair use washington journal does it
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:33.440]  all these other tv shows show news articles i mean i mean the news shows clipouts this is
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:40.000]  asinine crap and they said of the pittsburgh post cassette does not remove their dnc tech
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:43.920]  down order the site isn't going back up so i guess that give me the number of the pittsburgh post
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:48.880]  cassette and in fact i want their number i'm gonna give that out later i mean they are a real piece
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:55.120]  of work but who's the bigger piece of work them or youtube i mean i mean think about it over 2000

[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:06.240]  there million here no way to count up a year and a half with you know uh the last six months or so
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:12.480]  millions of views a week my god this is incredible so alex you know what it is there's groups behind
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:18.560]  this that are flagging your videos they're reporting your videos and they're working in collusion with

[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:41.600]  within hours of the man of the cops being killed had the southern primary law center that's involved
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:45.840]  with the adl at youtube running things it's all interconnected that's been admitted censoring
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:50.800]  they already had the white supremacists shoot some poor cops she's throwing a fit because his dog
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:54.800]  was urinating on the ground and mommy told him to get out turned out the guy was attacking me on my
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:44:02.160]  comment page they take it the southern primary law center feeds it my name out of hundreds of sites
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:08.080]  he admittedly had visited to the paper implies i'm the reason he killed the cops that's not enough
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:14.960]  pittsburgh post gazette i show the article and say on air that it's uh uh liable and you bastards
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:21.280]  that isn't enough for you you got to go file a fake copyright claim i mean even in some twisted
[2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:26.320]  universe you could claim we couldn't show articles on air which is pure bull under fair use and everybody
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:32.000]  does it you know c span uh the the uh in the papers show on news and in new york everybody
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:37.200]  does it you know 60 minute shows clips of articles they're not getting rights to that it's news
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:44.720]  even in a twisted world if that was okay you bastards implied that i basically did the cause
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:51.680]  the killing i mean your your hardcore assault on me working with a private group with the police
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:57.520]  within hours to attack me i'm the number one target after cops are killed within hours this is up
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:04.240]  within hours the same afternoon the same day and then that is enough then you want to shut down
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:10.640]  my free speech because it was an audio of me criticizing them on the sunday show showing their

[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:42.640]  other papers did retract the the uh pittsburgh poskazette wrote two articles saying okay the
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:46.720]  white supremacist didn't like alex but they never retracted the original story they just kind of
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:51.360]  halfway did it and i talked to the reporter and he just said well i was fed this by the
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:54.800]  southern poverty law center and then they're in the article i mean you know the southern
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:59.040]  poverty law center i know you don't like it that i get up here with the fbi secret memos
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:03.840]  and then we get it to the newspapers and it's in the rocky mountain news and it was in the ap and it

[2:54:17.200 --> 2:54:23.520]  you uh prison planet tv members since the first year and i have to say and watching and listening
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:29.440]  all these years i don't know if there was a finer moment for the truth movement then the last couple
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  of weeks um i have never seen such an assemblage come together and i think this is what scared them i
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:40.560]  know this was a beta test i agree this was a beta test on the flu i believe however they plan on
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:45.840]  getting a lot more mileage out of it than they did and one of the key central cogs to that was
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:52.880]  george nurie yourself and dr lin harwitz and steven quail the four of you together uh
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:57.760]  literally changed millions of opinions of people across the country people i knew they were the
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:01.680]  most of the people that i knew were either absolutely feeling like the government had
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:06.400]  overblown this even though there was 24 seven coverage in your face trying to get people to
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:12.720]  freak out they didn't or they said something's going on here and uh those that listen to you
[2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:18.320]  through george nurie your program were absolutely blown away that's the point i made over and over
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:23.600]  again i said either i said this is clearly engineered which is now documented a lab virus
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:28.320]  that's mainstream british news clearly a lab virus and they're overblowing it in an act of
[2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:33.120]  psychological terrorism or they've released the big one and because they're eugenicists
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:37.680]  they're capable of anything go ahead yeah oh absolutely alex and god bless you we pray for
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:41.520]  you constantly but you're the one that caught them with their pants down i would happen to be
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:46.160]  listening to the morning the baxter story broke and it was a minor story in the united states
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:50.960]  until you broke that story and i happen to be listening and you said to all your listeners
[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:55.520]  look i went on before 9 11 two months before told everybody it's going to happen this is bigger than

[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:01.840]  and said look the flu doesn't start in the west and move east it always starts east and moves west
[2:57:01.840 --> 2:57:05.920]  and we're at the tail end of the flu season they were caught with their pants down they were
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:10.960]  absolutely exposed in every possible way they could be exposed yeah that guy called in and said it
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:16.240]  comes out of the west and i just said i'm sorry it's not true right and you cut him off immediately

[3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:03.120]  because they're only allowed to ask you how people live there that's it right and uh it also says that
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:10.480]  it will only become public knowledge after 72 years oh yeah right now i've got their little

[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:41.760]  the guys the kids and stuff go out on campus pass them out they're going to be fully informed well
[3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:47.920]  before you have uh obama comes here i'm suspecting he's going to find the excuse not to come to
[3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:54.400]  arizona with all the freed mind that we have using obama deception the kids here then the activists
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:15:01.920]  they were so enthusiastic about your film that they wanted to get it out into their peers so what
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:07.360]  they did is we helped them with equipment and so on to mass produce this at our workshop here
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:13.120]  then they we have our own printing press we do so screen we got our own video and radio studios
[3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:18.400]  and they get to do whatever they want and this is also notice you guys are smart the college
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:24.240]  students are getting some smoking gorgeous girls who are patriots to go out and be the voice of
[3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:33.040]  this on local campus tv and radio well any any effort has a you know a cumulative effect
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:38.320]  and what has happened is we have the university newspapers have come by and interviewed and
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:44.800]  taken pictures and promoting this and uh a big story about their college times this thursday
[3:15:44.800 --> 3:15:52.320]  so we have a lot of press that's covering this so what's happened is before he even gets here
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:57.680]  the 90 percent of the impact that we're going to have will already be there we also have our own
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:03.120]  fm transmitters for a little micro uh pirate radio stations that we do on universities
[3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:07.680]  we're doing in the past year during the revolution around the country so we set up one of those we
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:13.200]  have big banners that obama deception listed at and put the frequency up there by the way you
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:17.360]  know how we learned about pirate urnist you know we learned about pirate fm in the country i'm sure
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:22.720]  you know a lot of the eastern block use those to bring down the soviets even little quarter
[3:16:22.720 --> 3:16:28.560]  waters in their neighborhoods use that to smash the enemy and fax machines we've got greater tools
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:33.760]  than they had we need to follow in the example of these great patriots so tell folks the frequency
[3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:38.160]  of that tell them what university it is and then i want to ask for your help i've made the obama
[3:16:38.160 --> 3:16:42.880]  deception it was a bigger success than i thought it would be careful what you ask for we are having
[3:16:42.880 --> 3:16:49.680]  hack attacks from the government hardcore death threats youtube channel shut down uh i am definitely
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:54.480]  on their radar and so i need everybody's support if they try to set me up or plant drugs on me or
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:16:59.680]  god knows what they'll do but i am definitely you know the little probe that everybody shot

[3:17:19.920 --> 3:17:27.360]  top of the list and you're way up there towards the top i know it's quite a feeling yeah my
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:31.360]  john handcock is up there but it's i mean how should i can't counter that earnest always enjoy
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:34.720]  your perspective because it really is i don't even try to talk about it on air it's what folks
[3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:40.320]  know what's going on it's become three-ring circus level the system is the eye of sauron is definitely
[3:17:40.320 --> 3:17:46.320]  looking at me now oh no no no i you know there's no doubt that we've been active a lot of people
[3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:51.120]  here that provided the facility for that we've been active libertarians since the early 90s
[3:17:51.120 --> 3:17:56.400]  we went through when they had their missouri list the patriots kind of homeland defense thing
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:18:01.360]  we went through that and that started here in phoenix with the fbi that list back in 94
[3:18:01.360 --> 3:18:06.560]  that said those that talk about the constitution are terrorists yeah yeah no we've been through
[3:18:06.560 --> 3:18:11.040]  this we just take it with you know it's just part of the game that they play it's a scyop i mean
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:16.480]  you're very effective in making sure that people understand it is a scyop this whole thing is that
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:22.240]  they can get you uh afraid i mean fear is their only weapon it's becoming more and more obvious
[3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:27.280]  that they don't have any other trick in their bag it's just making you afraid in fact i'll tell
[3:18:27.280 --> 3:18:34.720]  us the bad guys right now we have a new campaign that will start we have no fear you know and it's
[3:18:34.720 --> 3:18:40.400]  just a big logo four by eight of the you know squinting eyes no fear and we'll have freedoms
[3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:46.000]  phoenix dot com on there in the revolution logo and that's what they don't want they don't want
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:51.920]  people to be unafraid they need them looking to the government to solve whatever problem that they
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:58.240]  created so we're just not afraid now of course that doesn't mean that they they're not out to get you
[3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:04.000]  but you know fear if you're afraid then they already won you just can't so our the frequency
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:10.080]  by at asu is going to be 91.3 and uh then of course we tell you don't plan block it but it
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:14.400]  doesn't matter at the banners that just go out promoting it is enough it just because they're
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:20.000]  so predictable they just they they can't allow exactly what you're talking about that happened
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:24.800]  in the eastern block and so on giving the information out is what brought them down
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:29.040]  and it's the same thing that's going to happen here what we have done and i've noticed over the
[3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:34.320]  past few years you know since you know even after you and i have met in crofford what we have learned

[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:45.440]  this revolution and such is because they grew up and matured than their teenage years along with

[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:44.720]  always out there setting bushfires in the minds of men and women everywhere obama and the entire
[3:24:44.720 --> 3:24:48.160]  republican democratic party they keep saying we're rebranding the democrats we're rebranding
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:52.880]  the republicans we're new we're new we've changed you see that on fox and seeing in
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:58.080]  and but they're not changing so the system is imploding congress still has an approval
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:05.200]  rating in single digits and now the obama kool-aid the obama uh... hex or the obama spell
[3:25:05.200 --> 3:25:10.960]  is wearing off the obama supporters and they're realizing my gosh this guy lied about everything
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:15.840]  i mean that's why the obama deception smashes him because it shows how day one he turned over
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:21.280]  everything hired nothing but lock what effect is it having their at the campus and you see
[3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:23.920]  you've handed out ten thousand
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:28.560]  oh it did it got them motivated to come do stories are the first girl
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:31.920]  that was uh... representing campus newspapers
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:38.880]  i came in she was wearing a hope shirt so she really got a dose from a lot of young guys
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:44.240]  wanted to show her all kinds of stuff and she left uh... with some new things to think about
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:54.240]  and it's the future for us i think it is secure but it has to go through a phase
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:58.080]  in the end freedom always wins it just gets really messy first
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:00.880]  and we need to prepare for the messy part like on
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:04.720]  previous phoenix dot com and on your site and so on we're doing the same kinds of things
[3:26:04.720 --> 3:26:10.000]  we're promoting you know firearms training and get your heirloom seeds and making sure that
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:15.120]  you're not you know uh... having a bad diet and that you're you know uh... get your mind
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:20.160]  right around what's happening in your family and take care of your personal relationship
[3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:25.600]  and quit worrying so much about the fear and it's good that that we had the last couple
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:30.880]  years for these young people to go through this revolution process and with the ron paul thing
[3:26:30.880 --> 3:26:36.240]  because they got to see how the system really works and absolutely and we had it exactly we
[3:26:36.240 --> 3:26:41.600]  see a lot of negative people when paul didn't win saying it was a defeat we gained massive ground
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:46.000]  the libertarian patriot idea became dominant on universities
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:49.200]  a third rail something separate from the control left right
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:53.360]  and now people know about the private fellow reserve now they've got a hundred and fifteen
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:59.280]  sponsors up from a hundred and twelve yesterday to audit the private fed we're on the march
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:06.240]  the empires on the run brother you know and i i think they know it too that's why they've amped up
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:10.240]  uh... the rhetoric and the speed at which they're doing what they're doing
[3:27:10.240 --> 3:27:14.320]  because there there is no saving it you know a lot of people go where we what can we do this
[3:27:14.320 --> 3:27:20.320]  you can't save it you just need to survive it you know i'm i'm looking i have four children
[3:27:20.320 --> 3:27:24.480]  from nineteen to twenty three my daughter just got married saturday my oldest daughter
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:30.320]  and you know i have you know then to think about the future in my grandchildren coming
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:35.840]  and all this and i can see what the revolution um... kind of starts to focus not just on the
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:41.840]  younger people but as you become a grandfather and and you get into that age bracket you kind
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:46.480]  of get locked here it's not like i can go to some other country and just leave you have so much
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:51.040]  room i was about to say now that i have three children i can envision my grandchildren and
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:54.960]  it was just like when i had that professor on from the netherlands expo not from the netherlands
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:28:01.040]  uh... from a denmark he's saying netherlands for denmark uh... you know he's getting attacked
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:04.160]  for exposing how there was thermite in the buildings he did the test but he said well
[3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:08.640]  look at my four grand children and my children it doesn't even matter i mean there's not even
[3:28:08.640 --> 3:28:13.280]  a question that's the thing i'm not worried about being tortured killed and if we have that
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:19.200]  attitude we're gonna win it's the caloring that lets the evil wind it's so good to have courage
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:24.560]  and be committed it's not even courage i don't care i'm telling the truth i'm pulling out the stops
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:29.840]  i don't have fear anymore my only fear is that i don't work hard enough to light enough bushfires
[3:28:29.840 --> 3:28:35.120]  in the minds of men and women to kick these people's butts Ernest you know you had there's a couple
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:40.960]  really good points in your movie that i thought you know like uh... krf1 did a great job you know
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:45.520]  and the whole thing was edited very well but i tell you the one thing for my generation people
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:50.480]  that you'll kind of know the history that really had an impact on me and a lot of people probably
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:56.400]  didn't see you know realize it but we had that one segment that the first job that obama dot
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:29:00.800]  coming out of college is given him to him by Kissinger he didn't even need to have any more
[3:29:00.800 --> 3:29:07.440]  movie i already got it absolutely and and and geithner got his first job through one of his
[3:29:07.440 --> 3:29:12.240]  subsidiaries i mean this is a criminal cruise so where does it go from here how do folks volunteer
[3:29:12.240 --> 3:29:16.880]  and get involved to get more obama deceptions out at that university and other universities folks

[3:33:09.840 --> 3:33:17.520]  michelle sherry and wendy i'll at least get to those but i've got to recap what youtube subsidiary
[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:26.080]  minions have done google subsidiary minions youtube have done and all this other stuff
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:32.240]  going on with just open attacks on free speech everywhere i mean it is just off the charts
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:37.200]  finishing up with ernaz handcock out there with freedoms phoenix dot com we are changed phoenix
[3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:45.920]  arizona incredibly active out there uh... finishing up what is the response so far i know i asked
[3:33:45.920 --> 3:33:50.160]  us but i want to hear specifically what i mean what are the obama no it's doing and the right
[3:33:50.160 --> 3:33:55.120]  wingers because when they see this film a right winger goes oh good it's bashing obama they watch
[3:33:55.120 --> 3:34:00.400]  it they find out it exposes the controlled right as well and it shatters their paradigm and the
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:04.960]  experience i've had that's what the film's designed to do is take the blinders off stop the little
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:09.760]  false you know orbit of left right around each other's in this binary system
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:17.440]  and what is it doing to the left i mean who are you finding is the hardest to the program out there
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:24.800]  you know the left um we had a lot of experience with the left in the anti-war part of this so
[3:34:24.800 --> 3:34:31.040]  they were already when obama started you know bombing pakistan and adding into afghanistan
[3:34:31.040 --> 3:34:38.000]  not pulling out of iraq i think pretty much the the bloom on the rose was done and this was a very
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:42.960]  empowering and gave them the idea of where they should be directing their effort but i tell you
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:49.040]  the biggest thing is is a lot of the people that were very hardcore obama supporters i think they
[3:34:49.040 --> 3:34:55.840]  kind of knew that this was all just a sham is to bring in what they wanted was the centralized
[3:34:55.840 --> 3:35:00.400]  central plan to lead kind of government thing and they were going to get a part of it exactly
[3:35:00.400 --> 3:35:05.440]  exactly i've talked to the hardcore i've talked to the hardcore obama supporters and they're like
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:11.840]  communism we're going to get your guns and i go well wait a minute but obama works for the banks
[3:35:11.840 --> 3:35:17.280]  that's right we're i mean it's a power trip it's we're going to suck off the middle class we're
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:23.760]  parasites we're going to get power go ahead no i think that's exactly right so you can see a lot
[3:35:23.760 --> 3:35:28.160]  of people that they counted on and you know when i really started to see it was when we were in
[3:35:28.160 --> 3:35:35.440]  crofford the blogs that were there when they mowed down all those uh arlington west crosses and so on
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:40.960]  the obama people that were heavy on the blogs they're from the freedom house did not want that
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:47.920]  reported and it started to see what was happening they were there to control the media in such a way
[3:35:47.920 --> 3:35:53.360]  as to get the war the extraction from the war they try to get cindy she hand and that's where
[3:35:53.360 --> 3:35:59.680]  their break was if they wanted her to advocate they slow withdraw the removal not this immediate
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:04.240]  thing and she didn't sell out democrat she didn't sell out she kept her soul briefly and i gotta let
[3:36:04.240 --> 3:36:07.600]  you go have you back on because i was out there quite a few times but you stopped there a lot
[3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:13.040]  and i talked to cindy too i interviewed her when i was out at the at the denver thing they came to
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:18.720]  her explain what was really happening how the how the crosses symbolizing the troops got mowed over
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:26.000]  and and and what they came to her with now this whole thing is was wanted her to advocate for
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:31.040]  slow withdraw to be what obama is doing now and she wouldn't do it and then she lost favor
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:36.320]  with uh this machine that they had and i could see since then what the obama machine has all
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:40.960]  been key individuals they have the ability to do what you're talking about with google video and
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:46.240]  youtube and all they want to eliminate access to this information of people and your film has
[3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:51.120]  been very effective and us being able to get them exposed to it and it's had a big impact these
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:56.560]  young people are mad or they're just disillusioned or whatever but they're being woken up and the
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:01.520]  older generation you know i really don't worry about i you know i've always been at the opinion
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:06.160]  when i was young in the early 90s that they're just gonna have to die off and the next generation
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:12.240]  come replace it so i i don't even worry about them instead of youth it's damn that's why it's not
[3:37:12.240 --> 3:37:17.440]  my debt dot com is what we did to put up that you can't in debt the unborn we have billboards
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:23.920]  all over phoenix that is just on that one issue you cannot in debt the unborn to fund your crap
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:30.320]  they will repel and we're gonna help and speaking of that now bloomberg's reporting 14.8 trill it
[3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:36.960]  was 12.8 uh trill now they've added two trillion on top you know at this rate one year from the
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:43.680]  banker takeover it'll be 26 trill 26 trillion i mean these numbers and now the democrats on top
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:50.800]  of that one another 92 billion today and i mean it's just an orgy of stealing and corruption
[3:37:50.800 --> 3:37:56.160]  i mean when does it end earnestly these people have gone completely over the the edge well
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:38:04.000]  for nakey's trade is helicopter for a blend i mean there is no limit they're gonna go until
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:08.800]  dr paul understands we've understood libertarians have known for decades it's simple math it's
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:14.320]  arithmetic sooner or later the dollar goes away it's what they're going to try and do after that
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:19.600]  that's right they got offshore banks they got offshore banks they've got villas outside the
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:25.760]  country they don't care i mean they admit we're raping you we're destroying you ha ha ha we

[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:45.360]  various information sources that provide a forum for interpretations of events and issues that
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:49.840]  differ radically from those presented in mass media products and outlets and they tell the police
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:54.160]  just like they say veterans the number one threat gun owners ammo buyers they say they
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:58.880]  are terrorists they could be terrorists that want to kill you and it just goes on it says if you

[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:26.800]  leaderless resistance everything our founding fathers talked about they mix it in with nazis
[3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:31.600]  and people so see first they take nazis free speech because they're unsavory and then they

[3:44:02.640 --> 3:44:07.840]  homosexual just to say the word which isn't even derogatory is arrestable offense he was arrested
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:16.240]  robin page i have hundreds of examples i mean it goes on and on and on and on then our unofficial
[3:44:16.240 --> 3:44:22.560]  youtube page that uh it was nothing but my video show the simulcasted tv show that a fan started
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:27.920]  a year and a half ago was getting on average we i was just counting this up last week and uh you
[3:44:27.920 --> 3:44:34.720]  and uh and uh youtube was telling him in in emails one more strike you get uh two strikes in a year
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:42.640]  of the third one your your your band and they sent him one from a year and a half ago over a video
[3:44:42.640 --> 3:44:48.960]  clip which is obviously fair use a short clip of the news but whatever then he got a message suddenly
[3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:54.800]  last week saying we're counting those strikes from a year before supposed to go away according
[3:44:54.800 --> 3:45:01.920]  to the rules in a year didn't they said we're keeping that that strike and now uh we're looking at
[3:45:01.920 --> 3:45:07.280]  your account because uh you uh showed and and and they and they showed him the order from the
[3:45:07.280 --> 3:45:13.280]  pittsburgh poskazette you uh you showed the news article about the pittsburgh shooter an article
[3:45:13.280 --> 3:45:18.480]  attacking me saying i influenced him killing now that stuff all had to get retracted later
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:25.040]  what did the pittsburgh poskazette do they say i can't show an article i'm in and defend myself
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:32.400]  it's not enough to libel me they have to then say i'm not allowed i'm not allowed to counter them
[3:45:32.400 --> 3:45:37.360]  now i mean if that is a tyranny i don't know what ish so
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:45.840]  i saw this last night posting an article about it up on info wars dot com and prismont dot com

[3:45:54.080 --> 3:45:58.000]  done that yet but since you accused me of it we're gonna do it right now but it's more important
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:03.280]  to call the pittsburgh poskazette and say you put in a uh internet takedown notice of copyright
[3:46:03.280 --> 3:46:10.080]  infringement saying we can't show a news article which which washington journal does which uh in

[3:56:43.280 --> 3:56:49.280]  of your um station and i was wondering if there's any way you can up it from five ninety five to
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:54.800]  like ten dollars a month so that would help you continue with uh what you're doing it would just
[3:56:54.800 --> 3:56:59.360]  be better and i wouldn't have to have so many ads and things if folks would just everybody that's
[3:56:59.360 --> 3:57:02.800]  listening would become a member or think about becoming a present planet dot tv member i mean
[3:57:02.800 --> 3:57:07.600]  i'm trying to give the videos out free a lot of them i just don't have the money and so i know so it
[3:57:07.600 --> 3:57:13.120]  is members that are subsidizing the few videos i make you know and i'm put out for free uh you
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:16.960]  know people that tell me i should give them all out for free it's a word is the money come from
