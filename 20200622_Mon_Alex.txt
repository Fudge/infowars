[00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:11.112]  Big Brother.
[00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:12.913]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.773]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:16.494]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:18.154]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:22.896]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:49.174]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Monday, June 22nd 2020 summer solstice transmission.
[00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.996]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:55.500]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.847]  We were just preceded by a lot of massive events
[00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:10.562]  That have been unfolding and we'll continue to track all of those as they unfold.
[00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:15.886]  There's a lot of important news here and a lot of really important angles to cover and I intend to go through it all here today.
[00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:36.673]  I hope you will all realize how critical you are in boosting and amplifying this emergency message not just here but across the planet and that your word of mouth is pure poison to the New World Order exterminist anti-human plan and the equivalent of sunlight and water and love and tender loving care.
[00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.151]  To freedom and justice.
[00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:44.054]  So you are the ether in which freedom swims.
[00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:46.816]  Please don't ever lose sight of that.
[00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:48.578]  Keep that centrally focused.
[00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:51.780]  And I thank you for doing your central part in the fight.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.961]  And I salute you.
[00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:57.084]  All right, I've got 50 plus incredible clips.
[00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:59.345]  I've got big guests coming on.
[00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:02.687]  I've got so much to cover here.
[00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:04.108]  But the first big thing
[00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:07.524]  What I just want to announce is this.
[00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:10.505]  Big Wall Street Journal article.
[00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.307]  Put it out in their Sunday edition.
[00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:14.607]  In the print edition.
[00:02:14.607 --> 00:02:15.688]  On your doorstep.
[00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.549]  In your hotel room.
[00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.411]  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:26.273]  That is the headline.
[00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:27.693]  Now why is this so important?
[00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:33.596]  This is the externalization of the deepest beliefs of the cult.
[00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:47.264]  And if you watch my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, back at the time, 13, 14 years ago, they got really upset by it and said, Jones is insane.
[00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:52.907]  He claims that the elite want to merge with machines that live forever, but that first they must exterminate humanity.
[00:02:54.066 --> 00:03:00.731]  I was reading the official white papers being put out by Google, by the Club of Rome and others.
[00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.433]  So yeah, I know I sound crazy, but I'm not the one that wrote this.
[00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.214]  They're the ones that believe this.
[00:03:05.214 --> 00:03:20.465]  Remember it came out three years ago that Google executives get in these amplifiers and make the other managers call them beautiful female dragons or beautiful golden building.
[00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:23.884]  The exact quote is, beautiful ornate building.
[00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:28.046]  And you go, that sounds totally mentally ill.
[00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:33.409]  And of course, it is mentally ill at the end of the day, but it's a very calculated form of mental illness.
[00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.829]  It's a cult.
[00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.933]  You know, when you're in an amphitheater telling your boss that they're a beautiful female dragon, and it's a pot-bellied middle-aged programmer, you're in a cult.
[00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:51.672]  And that's what all this bow, get on your knees, all these TV shows that now say white people are inherently bad.
[00:03:51.672 --> 00:04:07.265]  All of this is about turning reality upside down ahead of a organized societal collapsed and the eradication of almost everyone on earth.
[00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:07.906]  This is official.
[00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:16.733]  We're just being set up and dumbed down and softened up and prepared for the fall.
[00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:21.155]  I can also tell you how this is going to unfold.
[00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:22.496]  Some of the different scenarios.
[00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:34.263]  Because it is like those little novels that kids read, choose your own adventure, but there's three or four different endings, three or four different paths.
[00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:41.129]  There's mixtures of the different paths, but I mean, I can tell you exactly where we're going, and you're not going to like it.
[00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.614]  But you're going to be so poisoned and so drugged out, by the time you die, you won't know what happened to you.
[00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:50.127]  The problem is you've got a soul.
[00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:54.030]  They want to try to trick you with the outside stimula into joining them.
[00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.872]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:56.813]  Your body means nothing.
[00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:02.489]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:04.070]  The first of its kind.
[00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.033]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:12.055]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:15.157]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[00:05:15.157 --> 00:05:18.538]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:20.760]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.501]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.522]  It's great to keep with you.
[00:05:25.522 --> 00:05:31.806]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.347]  We're really excited about it.
[00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:35.508]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:46.995]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:57.851]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at Infowarsstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:14.933]  133, 133 earth rotations until the most important historic election in world history.
[00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:20.856]  A referendum on a pro-human future or a post-human future.
[00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:24.419]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:29.741]  Broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, June 22nd, 2020.
[00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:32.202]  Worldwide transmission.
[00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:33.602]  They say hindsight is 20-20.
[00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:39.004]  We will look back on these days as the most important in our lives.
[00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:50.729]  Because, like an arrow drawn to the cheek and fired from a bow, once the arrow is released, the destiny is set.
[00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:51.529]  The trajectory
[00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:55.375]  Has been decided.
[00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:58.018]  We are now drawing the bow.
[00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:01.263]  We are now pulling the arrow to our cheek.
[00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:04.188]  We are now preparing to release.
[00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:04.608]  Get ready.
[00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.097]  All right, let's lay it out.
[00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:14.719]  Let me tell you what I've got coming up for you today.
[00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:20.102]  The live feed is up at newswars.com with the title of today's broadcast.
[00:07:20.102 --> 00:07:27.667]  If you'd like to fight the globalists and override their censorship and share that live feed, that's at newswars.com.
[00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:28.448]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:29.926 --> 00:07:32.588]  Calls for eradication of all human life.
[00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:35.150]  Plus, Trump discovers he's in trouble.
[00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.693]  This is an absolute must-watch, listen edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:42.175]  Tune in for tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:47.039]  Now, Trump can easily still win this election.
[00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.802]  And I believe he has a 51% chance of winning right now.
[00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:54.164]  If he just did the right thing, he'd have a 70% chance, an 80% chance.
[00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:56.526]  But, they're making their move.
[00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:58.988]  They're not as arrogant as they were four years ago.
[00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:18.281]  And if we sit here on our hands, I'm not just talking about Trump, I mean every one of us, and do not get the word out and get others to vote and get others to be active and to get others to hit the streets and speak up, the opposite of what big tech and Hollywood want.
[00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.804]  They want us to shut up and stand down and follow their orders.
[00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:24.387]  If we don't do the opposite of what CNN says,
[00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:31.319]  I've looked into the different permutations of what's going to happen if Joe Biden gets elected.
[00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:34.421]  He's clearly a placeholder, as I've been saying for a year.
[00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:41.186]  They have said they're going to bring back in Hillary and Obama.
[00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:44.149]  God knows who his VP will be.
[00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:48.572]  But this is a nightmare scenario.
[00:08:48.572 --> 00:08:53.175]  And Biden obviously has dementia, as I said a year ago, and got further banned on Facebook.
[00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:54.656]  They said, preposterous.
[00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:56.378]  Jones claims he's clearly had another stroke.
[00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:02.409]  Which now doctors are saying it looks like he's probably had another stroke.
[00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:04.411]  They're saying it looks like about a year ago.
[00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:09.215]  That's when he went from talking well, he's a good speaker, to sounding like he's had a stroke.
[00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.217]  I mean, we've all had family have strokes.
[00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:15.401]  We all know what they look like.
[00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:17.823]  But don't take his weakness as weakness.
[00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.204]  He's nothing but a placeholder.
[00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:22.728]  If you put a piece of paper on a chair,
[00:09:23.874 --> 00:09:25.715]  At an event that says reserved.
[00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:26.896]  The piece of paper is mindless.
[00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:33.241]  The piece of paper has no power, but it's a placeholder.
[00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:38.745]  Now, the president has reportedly been in shock at rows of empty seats in Tulsa.
[00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.187]  The fire department said about 6,200 people.
[00:09:41.187 --> 00:09:43.108]  That's what I estimated before that number even came out.
[00:09:43.108 --> 00:09:43.748]  We had crew there.
[00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:46.310]  I said, maybe 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people.
[00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:52.575]  We have photos that National File took from the time that Trump spoke, and it was shockingly empty.
[00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:55.047]  There's a lot of reasons that happened.
[00:09:55.047 --> 00:10:02.153]  People are scared of COVID, but more importantly, and the Democrats have bragged about this.
[00:10:02.153 --> 00:10:06.496]  They got armies of teenagers to go in and RSVP for tickets.
[00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:09.478]  And the campaign was so stupid, delusional.
[00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:13.762]  They think they got Trump elected, not the people.
[00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:16.024]  I know folks that know Parscale's and all of them.
[00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:17.465]  They are delusional.
[00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:21.224]  They literally think they got Trump elected.
[00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:28.769]  They're the ones telling Trump, oh you don't need the internet, you don't need your fans, you don't need the grassroots, it's all you sir and our targeted advertising.
[00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:30.430]  BS!
[00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.691]  BS baloney!
[00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:35.053]  You delusional fruitcake!
[00:10:35.053 --> 00:10:38.034]  Talking about the campaign head.
[00:10:38.034 --> 00:10:42.257]  So why don't you spend a little less time buying Lamborghinis buddy boy and actually wake up.
[00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:58.040]  But the president isn't shocked by this, but the Democrats admit, and this is key, that they had teenagers on TikTok, Chinese communist owned, go and RSVP on there.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:07.043]  You talk about election meddling, and CNN and even the front page local paper, the Austin-Murray Statesman was celebrating it this morning, going, oh, it's so cute.
[00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:08.284]  Oh, it's so funny.
[00:11:08.284 --> 00:11:11.084]  Ah-ha, those kids.
[00:11:11.084 --> 00:11:12.505]  AOC's out bragging about it.
[00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:20.387]  But let's talk about Joe Biden.
[00:11:20.387 --> 00:11:27.852]  He had an event the same day with five people in attendance.
[00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:41.240]  But again, don't take his weakness for weakness because the Democrat cult is so subservient that they won't go anywhere or do anything unless they're told to.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.263]  If they're told to go out and rampage and burn things down,
[00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:52.691]  By the hundreds of thousands, it's good.
[00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:56.654]  If they're told, don't go out and demonstrate COVID, they follow orders.
[00:11:56.654 --> 00:12:06.102]  That's what it's like when you're in a cult.
[00:12:06.102 --> 00:12:12.307]  So we're going to be laying all of that out a little bit later in the broadcast for you.
[00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:13.728]  But isn't it emblematic that
[00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:22.254]  Even before the COVID hoax, the biggest crowds he was pulling were 50, 60, 70 people.
[00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:28.717]  And he was getting booed and confronted for Jeffrey Epstein connections and things at every event.
[00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:30.517]  And Hollywood is collapsing.
[00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:32.959]  And these globalist corporations are in trouble.
[00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:43.343]  And all of this is their temper tantrum to try to drive us into submission.
[00:12:43.343 --> 00:12:44.604]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:52.733]  But did you hear what I read at the start of the broadcast that we're going to cover at the bottom of the hour?
[00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:56.957]  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:12:56.957 --> 00:13:00.340]  Big featured story.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.024]  The big story they pushed the Wall Street Journal, introducing this sick idea to you.
[00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:09.468]  And if you understand this idea and the scam around it,
[00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:23.307]  And the basic fraud and how this has been a day one Illuminati operation, then you know how to derail the entire program.
[00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:27.590]  Because I can sit here and tell you what's coming next week or next year, and we've already done that at Nauseam.
[00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.893]  How about we tell you what's coming in 10 years, 20 years?
[00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.995]  How about we tell you what's going on inside Google, inside Facebook?
[00:13:39.773 --> 00:13:48.996]  Because I know, not just from reading their writings, I know people who've been in private meetings with Jeff Zuckerberg this year.
[00:13:48.996 --> 00:14:01.801]  I know people that have been in private meetings at Bohemian Grove this year, at Bilderberg Group this year, and they tell me
[00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:07.029]  That there's not even a pretense that they're good guys anymore.
[00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.011]  They don't even deny it.
[00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:23.019]  They cackle, they laugh like Dick Dastardly with the little pin-pin mustache.
[00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:32.245]  They openly have a diabolical master plan that they believe is impossible to defeat and that will exterminate everyone.
[00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:40.090]  And now they're rolling it out in public.
[00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.351]  Also, I said I would get to this yesterday.
[00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:55.055]  I didn't.
[00:14:55.055 --> 00:15:00.818]  And that's something I will get to here today.
[00:15:00.818 --> 00:15:01.178]  And that is
[00:15:05.319 --> 00:15:16.982]  The psychiatric and psychological system at its core being a pedophile cult and creating a new family structure.
[00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:26.325]  You may have heard of the nuclear family, a father, a mother, two or three children, which is the natural structure of humans and the most successful model.
[00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:32.767]  They have a new structure that's officially their plan and that is a pedophile.
[00:15:33.697 --> 00:15:44.880]  That has sex with a child that's taken from their biological parents to form the new ultimate family that they call the family of love.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.741]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:46.981]  I'll show you mainstream news.
[00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:49.422]  And the mainstream news is like, this is kind of good.
[00:15:49.422 --> 00:15:50.362]  We'll take your child.
[00:15:50.362 --> 00:15:51.422]  We'll rape him.
[00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:53.283]  We're liberal.
[00:15:53.283 --> 00:15:54.823]  Oh, by the way, they also worship Satan.
[00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:55.844]  Thought I might tell you that.
[00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:56.344]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:57.844 --> 00:16:10.692]  We're already in the latter part of June, and of course most of the country's not completely reopened again, and already Fauci and the UN Bill of Melinda Gates criminal combine are telling us don't go to Trump rallies.
[00:16:10.692 --> 00:16:11.553]  Oh no.
[00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:22.820]  But the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go to the Democrat Party, Black Lives Matter, All White People Are Evil, Mind Control, brainwashing events.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.163]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:36.809]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have, because we are going into hardcore United Nations-controlled bondage.
[00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:46.696]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are announcing they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist organizers.
[00:16:46.696 --> 00:16:48.177]  This is just the beginning.
[00:16:48.177 --> 00:16:51.259]  Everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:52.460]  So, it's here.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.020]  No more games.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.222]  The New World Order has arrived.
[00:16:57.222 --> 00:16:58.222]  It's finally here.
[00:16:58.222 --> 00:17:03.084]  Introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[00:17:03.084 --> 00:17:09.687]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[00:17:09.687 --> 00:17:11.747]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[00:17:11.747 --> 00:17:20.551]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:27.333]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of trunascent iodine working for my body.
[00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.893]  I can personally feel the difference.
[00:17:28.893 --> 00:17:37.015]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:41.856]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:46.677]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of trunascent iodine today.
[00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:54.306]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:59.251]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:01.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:16.187 --> 00:18:19.829]  I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:18:19.829 --> 00:18:24.151]  Phase 2 of the lockdown is here, exactly as we told you.
[00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:33.777]  It's designed to create total hysteria and the seizing up of our economy, like a gasoline engine that's had salt water poured into it.
[00:18:33.777 --> 00:18:42.081]  It's a well-known tactic that's been used before, but now it's on a planetary scale, directed by the United Nations.
[00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:44.583]  And they love to throw it in your face over at News Corp.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.943]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[00:18:54.943 --> 00:19:03.468]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[00:19:03.468 --> 00:19:08.431]  Well, I think- NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:10.593]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care.
[00:19:10.593 --> 00:19:10.773]  Yeah.
[00:19:12.165 --> 00:19:13.066]  A new disease.
[00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:14.006]  No one's immune.
[00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:17.468]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic!
[00:19:17.468 --> 00:19:19.369]  And instead of summer, it's all the time!
[00:19:19.369 --> 00:19:24.071]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[00:19:24.071 --> 00:19:25.712]  He loves being that guy.
[00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:28.373]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[00:19:28.373 --> 00:19:30.334]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[00:19:30.334 --> 00:19:34.837]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[00:19:34.837 --> 00:19:38.599]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:39.339]  Get over here, NBC.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:47.542]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh!
[00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:48.502]  Wow!
[00:19:48.502 --> 00:19:49.062]  Wow!
[00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:49.922]  Oh yeah!
[00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:52.123]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:56.564]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:59.344]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[00:19:59.344 --> 00:20:01.845]  House Cat Flu is coming, people!
[00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:09.247]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the House Cat Flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[00:20:11.024 --> 00:20:23.088]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles.
[00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:27.990]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.951]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[00:20:40.629 --> 00:20:41.990]  Thank you so much for joining us again.
[00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.971]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:42.971 --> 00:20:48.635]  The sites are NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, and BandOnVideo.
[00:20:48.635 --> 00:20:53.018]  Well, let's go over it here.
[00:20:53.018 --> 00:21:06.327]  In the hypothetical Simpsons episode of a fake health scare, it's your cat, because it's something that most people have, and so you can fear it.
[00:21:06.327 --> 00:21:08.048]  And so everybody gets to get into the hysteria.
[00:21:09.855 --> 00:21:10.995]  But see, this is even better.
[00:21:10.995 --> 00:21:19.297]  This is anyone that's had the flu or a coronavirus in the last decade, on average, will test positive under the main testing protocol.
[00:21:19.297 --> 00:21:21.057]  We told you it was a fraud five months ago.
[00:21:21.057 --> 00:21:29.819]  A month and a half ago, Bill Gates' company, the subgroups that are putting out the test, was shut down because it's a fraud?
[00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:32.660]  Because it gives all these false positives.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.340]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:45.278]  Because law firms and the big meatpacking plants and everybody go, oh, for liability protection, let's get every employee tested, all 2,000 meatpackers.
[00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:48.100]  300, 500, depending on the plant, come up positive.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.502]  They go, it's funny, I'm asymptomatic.
[00:21:50.502 --> 00:21:51.583]  Nobody got sick.
[00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:53.485]  That's in the news even.
[00:21:53.485 --> 00:21:56.407]  But everybody has to go home and the plant shuts down.
[00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:10.894]  Again, at every level, it's a fraud on the testing, the reporting, where it came from, taking people that have died of other things, putting it in that column.
[00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:27.558]  I've talked to hundreds of people on the streets for just the last few weeks, and at least 50 times, they've argued with me, and I've pulled out my phone and pulled up mainstream news, admitting that gunshot wounds, car wrecks, the flu deaths,
[00:22:29.218 --> 00:22:33.300]  90-year-olds with three different types of cancer.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.721]  If you test positive, which is a fake test, you're counted as that.
[00:22:36.721 --> 00:22:41.243]  And when they see that, they go, oh my gosh, I didn't know that.
[00:22:41.243 --> 00:22:46.586]  What about the fact we've got 110,000 dead with fake numbers?
[00:22:46.586 --> 00:22:50.388]  Supposed to be 2.2 million!
[00:22:50.388 --> 00:22:57.911]  And so now, I hear the stories from law firms in Houston and from grocery stores in Austin and everywhere.
[00:22:59.977 --> 00:23:07.383]  The companies go, oh, the law firms, because they all follow the globalist orders, the big ones, say everybody gets tested.
[00:23:07.383 --> 00:23:09.605]  So you send everybody to get tested.
[00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:12.527]  Everybody virtue signals, oh, they're paying to see if I have it.
[00:23:12.527 --> 00:23:13.928]  So you all get scared.
[00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:22.375]  And then you've got to tell everybody that you live with, your husband, your wife, your kids, oh, we've got a COVID outbreak at fill in the blank.
[00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:23.896]  And then it's a chain reaction.
[00:23:23.896 --> 00:23:26.358]  Oh, I know somebody that knows somebody.
[00:23:26.358 --> 00:23:28.119]  Oh, you better get tested too.
[00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:28.840]  And you go in.
[00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:30.947]  That doesn't matter.
[00:23:30.947 --> 00:23:35.048]  The CDC test had actually been spiked with COVID.
[00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:36.828]  The Chinese test had been spiked.
[00:23:36.828 --> 00:23:37.348]  Oh, yeah.
[00:23:37.348 --> 00:23:41.589]  They also remember when Fauci, four months ago, was like, oh, we're flying people in.
[00:23:41.589 --> 00:23:43.750]  No, Trump shouldn't block folks from China.
[00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.471]  Oh, no, we're not testing anybody that we repatriate.
[00:23:47.471 --> 00:23:48.051]  It was so deadly.
[00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:48.691]  Why were they doing that?
[00:23:48.691 --> 00:23:51.091]  Because they wanted to get it out there.
[00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:52.512]  Yes, it's a real virus.
[00:23:52.512 --> 00:23:53.692]  Yes, it's been manipulated.
[00:23:53.692 --> 00:23:55.272]  Yes, it has great gain of function.
[00:23:55.272 --> 00:23:56.533]  It spreads very easy.
[00:23:56.533 --> 00:23:58.173]  That way everybody comes up positive.
[00:23:59.226 --> 00:24:08.573]  But there wasn't enough people coming up positive, so they designed the test to where it gives false positives over 60% of the time.
[00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:14.317]  So when Trump introduced that as a joke, hey, I tell my people, slow down the testing, it's not a joke.
[00:24:14.317 --> 00:24:20.021]  Because it's designed to cause a chain reaction of hysteria.
[00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:26.586]  Where, oh, in this little warehouse, I was talking to a fellow I know that owns a small warehouse that sells specialty goods in Austin.
[00:24:27.555 --> 00:24:35.200]  One person's mother had COVID, got tested, you know, had a sore throat stuff.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.484]  She didn't get super sick.
[00:24:40.484 --> 00:24:44.787]  They shut down that warehouse.
[00:24:44.787 --> 00:24:46.148]  And similar stories everywhere.
[00:24:47.947 --> 00:24:49.688]  The economy can't operate like that.
[00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:51.150]  Oh, you're going to get a paycheck.
[00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.490]  Oh, really?
[00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:57.254]  I went on vacation to the coast for close to a week and I talked to the waitresses that were back at the hotel.
[00:24:57.254 --> 00:24:59.296]  They said, no, they just laid us off for six weeks.
[00:24:59.296 --> 00:25:02.418]  No pay.
[00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:07.382]  And now the lady said, I'm losing my little house.
[00:25:07.382 --> 00:25:09.264]  She's got five kids.
[00:25:09.264 --> 00:25:12.807]  Her husband works in hospitality.
[00:25:12.807 --> 00:25:15.449]  His job was just eliminated.
[00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:16.429]  Oh, but it's okay.
[00:25:17.372 --> 00:25:18.954]  It's okay.
[00:25:18.954 --> 00:25:21.437]  So here's the big enchilada to all of this.
[00:25:21.437 --> 00:25:22.518]  Exclusive.
[00:25:22.518 --> 00:25:23.920]  Gateway Pundit.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:30.067]  Results show you are twice as likely to die from the coronavirus in a Democrat state than a Republican state.
[00:25:30.067 --> 00:25:32.950]  And it goes over the numbers, but we already knew those numbers.
[00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.173]  That's the health commissioner on New York and others admitting it.
[00:25:37.665 --> 00:25:40.627]  It's because they say you have COVID when you don't.
[00:25:40.627 --> 00:25:54.518]  We have doctors, we have nurses that shot video in the hospitals in New York and in California and other areas going, these people don't even, they tested negative three times, but we still stuck a tube down his throat.
[00:25:54.518 --> 00:25:55.779]  All he has is a sore throat.
[00:25:55.779 --> 00:25:56.800]  He's dead, 37 years old.
[00:25:58.561 --> 00:26:04.046]  Because he said, I got a sore throat, I'm panicking, I'm having... Oh, you're having an anxiety attack, baby?
[00:26:04.046 --> 00:26:05.187]  You're dead.
[00:26:05.187 --> 00:26:10.811]  We're going to get $52,000 on your corpse.
[00:26:10.811 --> 00:26:13.634]  That's a bounty.
[00:26:13.634 --> 00:26:18.838]  These people know what they're doing.
[00:26:18.838 --> 00:26:19.019]  So...
[00:26:20.188 --> 00:26:21.589]  That's the new hysteria.
[00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:24.471]  Oh, Governor Newsom says you gotta wear a mask.
[00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:29.595]  Other cities around the country, blue cities, are passing laws that you'll have to wear for another year.
[00:26:29.595 --> 00:26:31.397]  All the hysteria, all the neuroticness.
[00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:35.980]  Now, in Austin, they're telling people with babies to put a mask on them.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.181]  That can kill them!
[00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:42.626]  It's all just a huge exercise in serving the system, serving the cult.
[00:26:43.988 --> 00:26:49.530]  We're going to talk about what's at the bottom of the cult when we return on the other side.
[00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.792]  And Pastor Reverend Childress is joining us from Black Genocide.
[00:26:53.792 --> 00:26:54.832]  Stay with us.
[00:26:54.832 --> 00:26:58.214]  I told you this five months ago and now it's official.
[00:26:58.214 --> 00:27:01.455]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and is permanent.
[00:27:01.455 --> 00:27:05.957]  The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control hoax knew.
[00:27:06.437 --> 00:27:24.813]  That once they got the public for several months to wear masks and social distance, they would be able to permanently turn it on and off anytime they want by putting handcuffs on someone, and then add new demands that people take forced inoculations, that they have contact tracing on their phones, and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[00:27:24.813 --> 00:27:32.159]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government forced inoculation and complete enslavement of the human population.
[00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:33.600]  This is medical tyranny.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.902]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates U.N.
[00:27:35.902 --> 00:27:36.803]  takeover.
[00:27:36.803 --> 00:27:39.945]  This is the end of civilization as you know it.
[00:27:39.945 --> 00:27:43.108]  Living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[00:27:43.108 --> 00:27:46.751]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[00:27:46.751 --> 00:27:48.793]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:49.754]  Show them the numbers.
[00:27:49.754 --> 00:27:50.775]  Show them the facts.
[00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:53.958]  And explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[00:27:55.054 --> 00:27:58.715]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[00:28:55.338 --> 00:29:02.723]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[00:29:02.723 --> 00:29:07.267]  Believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:22.461]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[00:29:22.461 --> 00:29:27.505]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:32.849]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[00:29:32.849 --> 00:29:35.371]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain,
[00:29:36.749 --> 00:29:38.229]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:30:07.879 --> 00:30:13.684]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:30:13.684 --> 00:30:15.766]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:30:15.766 --> 00:30:17.908]  Well, so does he.
[00:30:17.908 --> 00:30:28.977]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30:28.977 --> 00:30:30.158]  What I'm going to do is...
[00:30:31.337 --> 00:30:44.592]  Next segment I'm going to get into the cult program, the blueprint, the endgame of the globalists and where they want to take us and the article in the Wall Street Journal looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:49.377]  But let me now get into NPR caught in another hoax.
[00:30:50.998 --> 00:31:03.666]  Now you'll remember about two weeks ago I did a joke video where we pretend to attack somebody's car and I say the first car we see is a white supremacist, block the car, jump on the car, then say the car ran us over and call the police.
[00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:05.267]  We're all going to be heroes.
[00:31:05.267 --> 00:31:08.269]  This is how we become Jussie Smollett.
[00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:13.332]  And I did that because I've seen and you've seen so many videos
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:30.526]  Where Black Lives Matter or Antifa just run out the middle of a highway, a road, you name it, and start jumping on people's vehicles over and over and over again and then saying that they were hit.
[00:31:30.526 --> 00:31:34.567]  Think about that.
[00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:41.850]  And the media goes with it and will say, look at this shock footage from Indianapolis as an extremist tries to run people over.
[00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:46.631]  And then in many of the cases, it turns out they're not even white.
[00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:52.115]  They just come up and people start attacking their car and they just try to slowly drive through it because they're scared.
[00:31:52.115 --> 00:31:57.619]  And we have footage of people being blocked who get out and say, I love Black Lives Matter, but I got to get home.
[00:31:57.619 --> 00:31:58.280]  Bam!
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.762]  In the face!
[00:32:01.762 --> 00:32:05.545]  And then you try to put that on Facebook or Twitter and they block.
[00:32:06.872 --> 00:32:10.776]  People from seeing it because they don't want you to know what they're really doing.
[00:32:10.776 --> 00:32:22.046]  Powerful billionaires that run trillion-dollar companies, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, trying to suppress what you can say and what you can do when you're being abused and you're being attacked.
[00:32:22.046 --> 00:32:29.713]  Well, NPR just got caught in it big time.
[00:32:29.713 --> 00:32:31.394]  Here's the national file story.
[00:32:31.394 --> 00:32:32.976]  It's also up on InfoWars.com.
[00:32:34.617 --> 00:32:44.683]  NPR busted framing self-defense getaway from gun-toting protesters as right-wing attack.
[00:32:44.683 --> 00:32:49.325]  People with guns come out in the road, block the car, jump on it.
[00:32:49.325 --> 00:32:51.627]  We'll show you the footage.
[00:32:51.627 --> 00:32:59.291]  And NPR gets a screenshot of it.
[00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:02.513]  NPR gets a screenshot of it and says, white supremacist attack.
[00:33:04.991 --> 00:33:12.676]  Why don't we also cue up Savannah Hernandez when she has to save the white dude from getting beaten to a pulp after he's already been punched twice in the face by the big black dudes.
[00:33:12.676 --> 00:33:19.080]  I mean, would that be an extremist, white extremist attack as well?
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:31.028]  This is what the left's doing all over the country, is trying to carjack vehicles using guns
[00:33:32.355 --> 00:33:35.236]  And it's normally racially targeted, a real hate crime.
[00:33:35.236 --> 00:33:37.717]  I think all crimes are hate crime.
[00:33:37.717 --> 00:33:38.957]  And this is what NPR did.
[00:33:38.957 --> 00:33:48.620]  NPR, here's a screenshot of it, cropped the image, put it out, and said that white people tried to run over an innocent black person.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.701]  But you just saw, as a TV viewer, the real surveillance camera footage of what happened.
[00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:55.882]  So they even used surveillance camera footage and cropped it and edited it.
[00:33:55.882 --> 00:33:57.723]  They knew it was a lie.
[00:33:59.315 --> 00:34:05.340]  Now they've gone in and edited it and put in an image of Charlottesville and video of Charlottesville.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:12.725]  They've now updated it and are saying this is basically a current attack going on.
[00:34:12.725 --> 00:34:14.387]  That's how desperate the left is.
[00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:16.652]  To stage a crisis.
[00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:21.035]  When I say stage it, I'm not saying the white people in the car were part of it.
[00:34:21.035 --> 00:34:26.939]  I'm saying, you go out and run out in front of cars and start trying to grab people out of their vehicles, you're gonna get run over.
[00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:34.183]  I mean, if I'm driving and you're trying to knock my window out, and you're trying to pull me out, you got a gun, of course I'm gonna press on the accelerator and get out of there.
[00:34:34.183 --> 00:34:38.726]  You're lucky I'm doing that, I'll open my glove compartment and pull out a 9mm on your ass.
[00:34:38.726 --> 00:34:39.387]  I might do that!
[00:34:43.274 --> 00:34:44.755]  But that's what's going on.
[00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:51.217]  It's like Road Warrior out there.
[00:34:51.217 --> 00:34:53.418]  So let's go ahead and roll this video and this audio.
[00:34:53.418 --> 00:35:03.642]  This is of actual right-wing terrorists in Austin a few weeks ago attacking an innocent group of Austinites who were just peacefully on the sidewalk trying to live their lives.
[00:35:03.642 --> 00:35:05.263]  Because I'm going to pretend like I'm NPR.
[00:35:06.767 --> 00:35:22.420]  MBR, all things considered, we're now going to show for our TV viewers on our online simulcast at pbs.org shocking footage in Austin, Texas this weekend as right-wing terrorists in an armored vehicle attempted to run down peaceful activists.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.321]  Here's the video and audio.
[00:35:34.993 --> 00:35:43.122]  Okay, so again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing you footage of them attacking our armored truck.
[00:35:45.558 --> 00:35:57.424]  And they came out, they blocked the road, they put metal under the tires, they took a hammer to the windows, they were saying, we're gonna kill you, we can't play the audio, because I asked for a bleep version, can I have police on my knees, have a bleep version, thank you.
[00:35:57.424 --> 00:36:01.446]  We're a couple of weeks in on this video, where I can't get a bleep version for whatever reason.
[00:36:01.446 --> 00:36:03.147]  I'm not mad, I just, can I get one?
[00:36:03.147 --> 00:36:04.628]  Alright, thanks.
[00:36:04.628 --> 00:36:10.131]  So, so, again, that's how they would turn this around.
[00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:11.472]  That's how they would frame this.
[00:36:13.749 --> 00:36:16.891]  Now, let's go ahead and play this starting over.
[00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:21.653]  Savannah Hernandez sees the major highway shutdown on the feeder ramp to I-35.
[00:36:23.407 --> 00:36:38.102]  This is two and a half weeks ago, and black dudes beating up a white guy that's worshipping them, saying, I love Black Lives Matter, I'm an evil white person, I admit it, I worship you, but you've blocked traffic for 30 minutes, can I just get home?
[00:36:38.102 --> 00:36:39.263]  Boom, in the face!
[00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:40.464]  Cracka!
[00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:43.628]  And then it happens again and again as Savannah gets in their faces.
[00:36:43.628 --> 00:36:45.309]  This is what's going on in America.
[00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.630]  Here it is.
[00:36:50.683 --> 00:36:51.725]  We're good to go.
[00:37:15.362 --> 00:37:24.084]  So again, in America, hoodlums and thugs come, block you, if you politely grovel to them and say, I worship you.
[00:37:24.084 --> 00:37:25.964]  He actually said that.
[00:37:25.964 --> 00:37:27.304]  You know, I love Black Lives Matter.
[00:37:27.304 --> 00:37:35.646]  The big black guy punches him in the face, he tries to get his glasses off the ground, punch him in the face again, and Savannah has to come up and get in the guy's face and back him up.
[00:37:35.646 --> 00:37:38.066]  He threatened to physically attack her.
[00:37:38.066 --> 00:37:38.786]  He's a real tough guy.
[00:37:42.307 --> 00:37:52.836]  And hundreds of people backed up in their cars, sit there and watch full-grown men block the road and beat people up.
[00:37:52.836 --> 00:38:03.526]  Then Antifa, minutes later, began burning down the homeless camp, just a hundred yards away, and the news, including CBS San Antonio, said, I did it!
[00:38:03.526 --> 00:38:05.407]  With no proof!
[00:38:05.407 --> 00:38:07.950]  Again, next level evil.
[00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.091]  It isn't just NPR.
[00:38:12.005 --> 00:38:16.168]  That says white supremacists are running over black people everywhere?
[00:38:16.168 --> 00:38:19.531]  It's the local news.
[00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:22.474]  Saying these are peaceful demonstrations.
[00:38:22.474 --> 00:38:32.522]  And that if you don't like your car being surrounded, if you don't like having hammers beat your windows out, if you just roll forward, people are screaming, die, die, I'm going to kill you.
[00:38:32.522 --> 00:38:34.504]  With guns in their hands, I forgot that part.
[00:38:41.271 --> 00:38:43.154]  Well, you're the bad guy.
[00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.937]  That's the media.
[00:38:44.937 --> 00:38:48.663]  That's the system that's been set up.
[00:38:48.663 --> 00:38:50.466]  And that's where we're going.
[00:38:50.466 --> 00:38:55.273]  And that's why there's an article right here out of CNN saying Generation Z wants revolution now.
[00:38:56.581 --> 00:39:03.524]  And they're saying, you will capitulate because we're about to get violent and we're going to start physically attacking you.
[00:39:03.524 --> 00:39:04.685]  Look at this headline.
[00:39:04.685 --> 00:39:09.768]  Some white people may have to die for black communities to be made whole.
[00:39:09.768 --> 00:39:14.530]  Far left UGA teaching assistant on Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:39:16.277 --> 00:39:18.802]  Meanwhile, this story is linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:39:18.802 --> 00:39:26.056]  From InfoWars.com, Black Lives Matter theme show depicts whites as slaves, blacks as slave owners.
[00:39:26.056 --> 00:39:27.378]  The program's called Cracka.
[00:39:28.581 --> 00:39:32.483]  And it's about how whites are inherently evil and whites are inherently bad.
[00:39:32.483 --> 00:39:37.626]  This is waging war on common sense, creating racial division on a mass scale.
[00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:52.834]  And the entire corporate media with big tech is lined up to oppress and lie and create total and complete division and show simulations of white people attacking black people when it's not real so blacks feel like they've got to go out and attack white people.
[00:39:54.403 --> 00:39:56.064]  It's finally here.
[00:39:56.064 --> 00:40:00.166]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[00:40:31.286 --> 00:40:39.352]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.

[00:40:53.721 --> 00:41:05.709]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die if we did not do exactly as they said.
[00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:07.690]  And it turned out it was all fraud.
[00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:08.311]  The models,
[00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:09.271]  I think?
[00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:37.280]  They're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the number's spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's fault.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.885]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city, we've got a lockdown again, everything's over.
[00:41:42.885 --> 00:41:46.749]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new law teaching us to be total prisoners.
[00:41:46.749 --> 00:41:50.772]  Either we expose the COVID hoax, or we're all permanently enslaved by it.
[00:41:50.772 --> 00:41:51.293]  Your choice.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:03.939]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:09.966]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:12.308]  Super Male Vitality!

[00:42:32.285 --> 00:42:32.986]  Yes.
[00:42:32.986 --> 00:42:37.911]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:44.818]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:42:44.818 --> 00:42:45.900]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.741]  Go to the InfoWars store.

[00:42:50.544 --> 00:42:54.068]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.534]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[00:42:57.534 --> 00:43:03.505]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:43:03.505 --> 00:43:07.452]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[00:43:08.604 --> 00:43:10.245]  That is amazing.
[00:43:10.245 --> 00:43:17.929]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:20.250]  And there's another innovation.
[00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.331]  It's the spray cap.
[00:43:22.331 --> 00:43:27.754]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:43:27.754 --> 00:43:29.915]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:43:29.915 --> 00:43:30.836]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:33.077]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.900]  It's got organic alcohol in it so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.303]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:43:40.303 --> 00:43:42.085]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:43:42.085 --> 00:43:48.450]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.971]  It smells great.
[00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:51.792]  It's so refreshing.
[00:43:51.792 --> 00:43:57.857]  This is a big winner.
[00:43:57.857 --> 00:44:00.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:17.852 --> 00:44:30.781]  Alright, I'm not building this up for suspense.
[00:44:30.781 --> 00:44:39.026]  A subject this big, the key to everything, gives me a headache to even try to pull up all the data in my brain and cover it properly.
[00:44:40.999 --> 00:44:43.660]  And I'm just not ready to cover this yet.
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:51.525]  You know, I took off last week and only worked about five hours a day instead of the normal 12 or so.
[00:44:51.525 --> 00:45:05.072]  And now that I'm actually back here in studio and I'm just looking at all of this, it is personally very frustrating.
[00:45:05.072 --> 00:45:08.473]  So I seem frustrated on air, act like a jerk towards the crew.
[00:45:08.473 --> 00:45:09.274]  It has nothing to do with the crew.
[00:45:12.296 --> 00:45:15.077]  I am so sick of looking at Nancy Pelosi and Chuckie Schumer.
[00:45:15.077 --> 00:45:22.360]  I am so sick of watching them openly try to start a race war.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:29.643]  It makes my head spin and I, while I'm up here on air, I then remember a bunch of things that I meant to tell the crew.
[00:45:29.643 --> 00:45:33.525]  And so there's just too much planning goes into the show.
[00:45:33.525 --> 00:45:35.465]  Guys, do you have the G. Edward Griffin clip from the 60s?
[00:45:35.465 --> 00:45:35.665]  Yeah.
[00:45:35.665 --> 00:45:39.787]  Yeah.
[00:45:39.787 --> 00:45:41.408]  And I sent it to Rob do a couple of times.
[00:45:45.922 --> 00:45:55.913]  I saw that we linked to an article about G. Edward Griffin back in the 60s exposing a communist plan to try to create race war in America, and how pertinent it was today.
[00:45:55.913 --> 00:46:01.859]  There was an article on fullwarriors.com about it.
[00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.501]  And then there was just a little side issue.
[00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:08.346]  We're linked to these people's YouTube video, and a bunch of the clips are my clips.
[00:46:10.456 --> 00:46:14.921]  Where I went and interviewed Aaron Russo before he died, interviewed G. Edward Griffin on the subject.
[00:46:14.921 --> 00:46:18.084]  So they were putting the clip, and I noticed our website was blurred off of it.
[00:46:18.084 --> 00:46:19.385]  And I don't even care about the credit.
[00:46:19.385 --> 00:46:26.813]  It's just like, here we are promoting somebody's YouTube, and then they don't even have the common courtesy to not blur out our website.
[00:46:26.813 --> 00:46:30.016]  So I was asking you to add that back in.
[00:46:36.015 --> 00:46:37.822]  I'm going to play that when we start the next hour.
[00:46:37.822 --> 00:46:41.195]  We're going to just suspend everything until we get in position to do that.
[00:46:43.806 --> 00:47:01.479]  And then because we're talking about genocide with Reverend Childress, who's an amazing guest, filmmaker, researcher, he goes into Congress and shows the Congressional Black Caucus Planned Parenthood, Bill and Melinda Gates' plan to exterminate blacks, and they totally ignore him, but he's starting to get some response.
[00:47:01.479 --> 00:47:08.924]  He's going to be joining us, so it's perfect timing to get into the Globalist Master Plan at the bottom of the next hour, and I will do it then.
[00:47:10.635 --> 00:47:24.358]  It's just that I probably need to take off for 10 minutes or something and just go in my office with this article and really just get in the zone and focus on it because I don't want to just sit up here and halfway babble about this.
[00:47:24.358 --> 00:47:35.681]  When I read this this weekend and then I saw it again this morning, I was intending to do the whole show on it basically and all the connections and the master plan and the con game that's being run at the center of it.
[00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:38.522]  Now the very people following this are deceived
[00:47:39.793 --> 00:47:47.316]  Because this is really what I call the Rosetta Stone of the whole thing.
[00:47:47.316 --> 00:47:50.078]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:47:50.078 --> 00:48:06.125]  When NBC News and the New York Times and the Washington Post and the Financial Times of London and now the Wall Street Journal has a poet, a well-known poet, writing a love letter about how great it's going to be to kill all the humans on Earth.
[00:48:10.103 --> 00:48:22.910]  And you need to just kind of wrap your mind around that and let that kind of sink in.
[00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:28.113]  Because if you don't know this, you don't know anything.
[00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:31.015]  How are they going to get us to that point?
[00:48:31.015 --> 00:48:35.718]  How are they going to be able to set all this up and get all this in place?
[00:48:42.475 --> 00:48:48.677]  Well, we're going to lay all of that out.
[00:48:48.677 --> 00:48:52.498]  And we're going to play the G. Edward Griffin piece next hour.
[00:48:52.498 --> 00:48:57.099]  Because I'm not going to air it until we put our InfoWars back on.
[00:48:57.099 --> 00:49:05.341]  So, we got that going on.
[00:49:05.341 --> 00:49:07.302]  And then when I get to the G. Edward Griffin piece,
[00:49:11.658 --> 00:49:25.460]  I'm also going to get into what's being taught on the universities and how they're actually teaching that whites are inherently evil themselves, which is a Hitler philosophy just reversed.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:31.441]  I mean, it's just pure racism, genocidal as you can get.
[00:49:31.441 --> 00:49:32.922]  And it's not just a few groups doing it.
[00:49:32.922 --> 00:49:41.003]  This is what's being taught, the rage, the hate, to get the new majority in the country to be racially based and hating whites.
[00:49:43.174 --> 00:49:57.366]  And they created democracy where the oppression of whites is seen as authorized when a republic guards the rights of individuals as well as the majority.
[00:49:57.366 --> 00:50:05.393]  So it's a very, very diabolical globalist plan that we're going to be laying out here today.
[00:50:08.865 --> 00:50:25.236]  We are listener supported by all of you and I want to thank you all for supporting the local radio stations and TV stations in your area that carry the show and thanking them for carrying it and encouraging them to air more of it, that really has a big effect, and becoming a sponsor or supporting the local sponsors to that station.
[00:50:25.236 --> 00:50:34.623]  Separately, we had a big huge sale that was very successful, sold out of a lot of items, and then we've had a limited sale of some of the other best-selling items that are still left, but that will end today.
[00:50:36.015 --> 00:50:43.659]  We'll have a sale on some other new select items starting, but this big mega sale, the tail end of it, is going to have to end by about showtime tomorrow.
[00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:48.641]  So 24 hours or so, 25 hours or so left to do that.
[00:50:48.641 --> 00:50:52.624]  Huge savings on super high quality, best selling products.
[00:50:52.624 --> 00:50:55.865]  Last chance to get these great deals.
[00:50:55.865 --> 00:50:56.666]  Our original mega
[00:50:57.566 --> 00:51:02.928]  Flash specials have ended at Infowarshore.com, but to help clear out the inventory, you can also get high-quality products.
[00:51:02.928 --> 00:51:09.570]  We've launched the new 60% off specials on our bestsellers and products that are about to sell out at Infowarshore.com.

[00:51:25.058 --> 00:51:26.319]  Never done that before.
[00:51:26.319 --> 00:51:28.502]  TurboForce, 60% off.

[00:51:52.596 --> 00:51:56.077]  You take half in the morning, half in the evening.
[00:51:56.077 --> 00:51:59.458]  Take advantage of these new specials before they run out, because the inventory is low.
[00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:01.579]  And here's the last big point.
[00:52:01.579 --> 00:52:05.881]  We've sold out of, he told me this morning, 80 plus percent of our t-shirts.
[00:52:05.881 --> 00:52:08.662]  We had over 100 t-shirts, a lot of them were limited edition.
[00:52:10.174 --> 00:52:14.798]  And so everything's basically sold out except some smalls and things like that.
[00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:18.842]  Some of our best sellers we still have in all sizes, but they're going to sell out.
[00:52:18.842 --> 00:52:26.229]  24 hours to get all t-shirts and apparel at cost at infowarestore.com.
[00:52:26.229 --> 00:52:28.191]  And the average is $9.95.
[00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:29.993]  Some of the apparel cost is $15.
[00:52:29.993 --> 00:52:31.774]  On average, it costs about $9.95.
[00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:32.615]  Some of the shirts cost us $5.
[00:52:34.178 --> 00:52:40.962]  So whether it's a $5 shirt for us to print, or a $15 shirt, they're all $9.95.
[00:52:40.962 --> 00:52:43.864]  Last chance, last 24 hours.
[00:52:43.864 --> 00:52:47.086]  And you know, I'll be honest, I don't know what the new sale's going to be.
[00:52:47.086 --> 00:52:56.792]  We've sold down inventory so much to fund ourselves into the election, because I know how serious things are, that we've scaled back what we order for the future.
[00:52:56.792 --> 00:52:59.494]  We order enough to fill those of you that have signed up for auto-ship.
[00:53:00.322 --> 00:53:01.562]  And a lot of stuff we're discontinuing.
[00:53:01.562 --> 00:53:02.923]  I mean, that's how serious things are.
[00:53:02.923 --> 00:53:04.523]  I don't have to tell you that.
[00:53:04.523 --> 00:53:07.084]  You understand what's happened to the economy in this country.
[00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:08.964]  And we're just all in this together.
[00:53:08.964 --> 00:53:10.645]  I want to thank you all for your support over the years.
[00:53:10.645 --> 00:53:12.905]  We continue to go on into the future.
[00:53:12.905 --> 00:53:16.386]  But that really is up to you and, of course, God's decision in our destiny.
[00:53:16.386 --> 00:53:17.266]  So please pray for us.
[00:53:17.266 --> 00:53:18.367]  I'm praying for you.
[00:53:18.367 --> 00:53:19.067]  We're all in this together.
[00:53:21.325 --> 00:53:25.448]  The apparel, the globalists don't want you in the third dimension to have free speech.
[00:53:25.448 --> 00:53:29.452]  They don't want you in the third dimension to be able to exercise that.
[00:53:29.452 --> 00:53:30.492]  They hate it.
[00:53:30.492 --> 00:53:32.654]  You'll meet a lot of like-minded friends.
[00:53:32.654 --> 00:53:34.015]  You might meet your husband, your wife.
[00:53:34.015 --> 00:53:36.537]  You might meet your new best buddy.
[00:53:36.537 --> 00:53:40.541]  Wearing an InfoWars shirt in a red area, you'll probably get somebody to buy you a drink or lunch.
[00:53:41.792 --> 00:53:44.613]  In a blue area, you might get hit in the back of the head with a hammer or shot.
[00:53:44.613 --> 00:53:48.053]  The news will say that you are a white supremacist and attack them even though you're dead.
[00:53:48.053 --> 00:53:51.714]  So it's a big thing in America now to wear an Infowars or Trump shirt.
[00:53:51.714 --> 00:53:54.975]  That's why it's more important than ever to do it because this country's in so much trouble.
[00:53:54.975 --> 00:53:58.155]  Exercise free speech now or lose everything to these terrorists.
[00:53:58.155 --> 00:54:01.056]  Do not negotiate with these terrorists.
[00:54:01.056 --> 00:54:04.876]  And we have the 5G shirts, 5G kill shirt.
[00:54:04.876 --> 00:54:07.237]  Despite the fact that it's a bestseller, it is at cost.
[00:54:08.351 --> 00:54:09.434]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:54:09.434 --> 00:54:09.795]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:18.393 --> 00:54:22.577]  And a lot of the shirts really don't have M4s on them, so you won't get stabbed or killed wearing them.
[00:54:22.577 --> 00:54:23.497]  At least not intentionally.
[00:54:23.497 --> 00:54:27.441]  There's a lot of crime going on, you might get killed wearing it, even though that's not why they're attacking you.
[00:54:27.441 --> 00:54:28.362]  But that's who the left is.
[00:54:28.362 --> 00:54:30.563]  They're making their full communist move right now.
[00:54:30.563 --> 00:54:32.765]  If you underestimate it, you are a fool.
[00:54:32.765 --> 00:54:35.167]  Trump now understands how much trouble he's in.
[00:54:35.167 --> 00:54:38.370]  I expect to see explosive moves from the orange man.
[00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:39.811]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:54:39.811 --> 00:54:40.252]  Stay with us.
[00:54:44.901 --> 00:54:58.014]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government, believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[00:54:58.014 --> 00:55:04.401]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, if there is a mass awakening,
[00:55:06.388 --> 00:55:11.990]  It can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:17.032]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[00:55:17.032 --> 00:55:22.375]  But God is the master of the universe that gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:28.837]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[00:55:28.837 --> 00:55:32.219]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[00:55:33.653 --> 00:55:35.495]  Everything hinges on you.
[00:55:35.495 --> 00:55:36.436]  Everything.
[00:55:36.436 --> 00:55:40.360]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.382]  God bless and good luck.
[00:55:44.557 --> 00:55:52.879]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[00:55:52.879 --> 00:56:03.782]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[00:56:04.582 --> 00:56:13.008]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[00:56:13.008 --> 00:56:19.612]  He must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[00:56:19.612 --> 00:56:20.933]  The police have a lot of problems.
[00:56:20.933 --> 00:56:22.294]  We all have a lot of problems.
[00:56:22.294 --> 00:56:25.055]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[00:56:25.055 --> 00:56:27.137]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[00:56:27.981 --> 00:56:32.002]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[00:56:32.002 --> 00:56:35.763]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world.
[00:56:35.763 --> 00:56:37.943]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[00:56:37.943 --> 00:56:42.404]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[00:56:42.404 --> 00:56:47.846]  InfoWars.com!
[00:56:47.846 --> 00:56:54.067]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:54.067 --> 00:56:56.428]  Well, everybody said about the bird.
[00:56:56.428 --> 00:56:56.908]  Bird, bird, bird.
[00:57:21.448 --> 00:57:24.371]  Let's go to part of John Bowne's really important report.
[00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:28.135]  We won't have time to air the whole thing, but it's at Bandot Video in the John Bowne section.
[00:57:28.135 --> 00:57:33.700]  Just click the left-hand corner up there and you'll be able to pull it down and find that right there for yourself.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.462]  Stealth sterilization is upon us.
[00:57:35.462 --> 00:57:37.064]  This will tie into the master plan.
[00:57:37.064 --> 00:57:38.665]  I'm going to break down at the bottom of the hour.
[00:57:38.665 --> 00:57:38.986]  Here it is.
[00:57:40.367 --> 00:57:43.069]  Do you not understand that this is a stain on our country?
[00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:45.690]  A stain on every one of us in this house!
[00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:49.433]  Why are the liberals tolerating forced sterilization of indigenous women?
[00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:57.377]  What can you say about a portion of the world led by people that despise children or at the very least have no experience with them?
[00:57:57.377 --> 00:58:07.684]  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Ruth, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Oedipus Complex riddled French President Emmanuel Macron are just a few of the childless world leaders
[00:58:08.144 --> 00:58:11.627]  Egging on the United Nations program of sterilization.
[00:58:11.627 --> 00:58:24.299]  Well, you have to remember my grandmother was coerced into signing an X for me to become sterilized, but she didn't understand what sterilization or tubal ligation was.
[00:58:24.299 --> 00:58:33.668]  All she knew, I believe, is that her food supplements were being threatened to be taken away from her.
[00:58:34.488 --> 00:58:35.969]  If she did not consent.
[00:58:35.969 --> 00:58:38.671]  It is a moment 20 years in the making.
[00:58:38.671 --> 00:58:44.134]  Dozens of indigenous Peruvian women arrived to give testimony to national prosecutors.
[00:58:44.134 --> 00:58:47.636]  The beginnings of a possible new criminal case on their behalf.
[00:58:47.636 --> 00:58:57.121]  In the 1990s, during the regime of strongman President Alberto Fujimori, they were sterilized without their consent by doctors working for the Peruvian Health Service.
[00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:01.843]  Sterilization has been among us long before most of us were even born.
[00:59:01.843 --> 00:59:11.266]  In 1936, the Nazis defended their forced sterilization program by propagandizing the United States as an ally in the eugenics movement.
[00:59:11.266 --> 00:59:18.528]  But the atrocities of World War II would rapidly alter the United States' collective attitude toward eugenics.
[00:59:18.528 --> 00:59:22.750]  In 1970, the tricky Dick Nixon administration overwhelmingly
[00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:23.410]  We're good to go.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:54.951]  And as sterilization became the norm in 1979, according to a survey conducted by Family Planning Perspectives, 70% of American hospitals failed to adequately follow U.S.
[00:59:54.951 --> 01:00:01.817]  Department of Health and Human Services guidelines regarding informed consent in cases of sterilization.
[01:00:01.817 --> 01:00:02.958]  It wasn't until 1981 that Oregon
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:05.580]  We're good to go.
[01:00:24.113 --> 01:00:26.055]  That showed yet again that the U.N.
[01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:41.027]  is working with the communist dictatorship ruling mainland China to enforce its barbaric one-child policy, complete with forced abortions, involuntary sterilization, kidnapping of illegal children, and other brutal tactics.
[01:00:41.027 --> 01:00:42.868]  The evidence of U.N.
[01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:49.654]  complicity in the atrocious human rights violations is undeniable, according to PRI President Stephen Mosier.
[01:00:50.414 --> 01:01:00.940]  By the mid-1980s, according to Chinese government statistics, birth control surgeries, abortions, sterilizations, and IUD insertions were averaging more than 30 million a year.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:05.402]  Many, if not most, of these procedures were performed on women who submitted only under duress.
[01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:07.863]  We now see child labor on the rise in China.
[01:01:07.863 --> 01:01:10.185]  Why do we see child labor on the rise in China?
[01:01:10.185 --> 01:01:12.666]  Because there are labor shortages now in Guangdong province.
[01:01:13.326 --> 01:01:16.087]  Okay, folks, so that stealth sterilization is upon us.
[01:01:16.087 --> 01:01:18.287]  And the full report is at Band.Video.
[01:01:18.287 --> 01:01:19.747]  Now, these are real children, real women.
[01:01:19.747 --> 01:01:21.808]  These are hundreds of thousands of people going through all this.
[01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:42.126]  You're not going to hear a word out of Black Lives Matter.
[01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:48.019]  In fact, next hour, when we have a real black man standing up for black people, Reverend Childress, we're going to play
[01:01:49.178 --> 01:01:53.402]  Black folks going out to chop in other areas, confronting people about the global genocide.
[01:01:53.402 --> 01:01:54.803]  The globalists want us domesticated.
[01:01:54.803 --> 01:02:00.909]  They want us inside our homes, watching our television to be controlled by our, quote, smart phones.
[01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:02.131]  Everybody knows this.
[01:02:02.131 --> 01:02:03.332]  It's for a better goal.
[01:02:03.332 --> 01:02:12.481]  We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google go public and say, at the highest levels, their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind, and take over your life.
[01:02:12.961 --> 01:02:15.282]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[01:02:15.282 --> 01:02:26.266]  I recently had a woman in the street while I was with my youngest daughter and my daughter walked close to her and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[01:02:26.266 --> 01:02:28.847]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is mental illness.
[01:02:28.847 --> 01:02:32.248]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:36.330]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:40.152]  This is total and complete mind control.
[01:02:40.152 --> 01:02:43.315]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[01:02:43.315 --> 01:02:45.416]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[01:02:45.416 --> 01:02:46.057]  It's a U.N.
[01:02:46.057 --> 01:02:47.218]  Bill Gates plan.
[01:02:47.218 --> 01:02:50.780]  They've been proven to be criminal liars, and they must be defeated.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.221]  They must be exposed.
[01:03:03.306 --> 01:03:08.188]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:03:08.188 --> 01:03:11.709]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:03:11.709 --> 01:03:30.836]  Alright, the full video if you want to share it from the early 1960s of G. Edward Griffin giving a lecture on documents obtained by the Senate and House Intelligence and Armed Service Committees on actual KGB plans.
[01:03:31.769 --> 01:03:34.330]  G. Edward Griffin warns about the communist takeover.
[01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:36.711]  We are in the end stages.
[01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:39.332]  Now, there's speeches he gave as early as 1963 on this.
[01:03:39.332 --> 01:03:40.993]  This one's from 1969.
[01:03:40.993 --> 01:03:44.974]  Warns the very national upheaval we are experiencing now due to communist subversion.
[01:03:44.974 --> 01:03:46.455]  But let's be clear.
[01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.916]  The international globalists had taken over through the Bolsheviks.
[01:03:49.916 --> 01:03:51.237]  They were running Russia.
[01:03:51.237 --> 01:03:53.698]  Russia's kicked all this out now.
[01:03:53.698 --> 01:03:58.320]  But the globalists through Russia were running this exact program back then.
[01:04:00.222 --> 01:04:09.649]  And now you can see it coming to fruition with CNN running a headline today that Gen Z wants violent revolution now.
[01:04:09.649 --> 01:04:10.650]  That's all coming up.
[01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:21.919]  But first, here is what Jim McGriffin had to say 50, 60 years ago and then an interview we did with him a few years ago and an interview a decade ago with the late, great
[01:04:34.406 --> 01:04:45.212]  As early as 1928, the Communists declared that the racial differences among our people constituted the weakest and most vulnerable point in our social fabric.
[01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:52.155]  By constantly probing and straining at this one spot, they calculated that eventually the cloth could be torn apart
[01:04:52.754 --> 01:04:57.936]  And that Americans could be divided, weakened, and perhaps even set against each other in open combat.
[01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:04.238]  We mustn't kid ourselves into thinking that the communists have placed their agitators only into the black communities.
[01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:05.739]  They're working both sides of the street.
[01:05:06.443 --> 01:05:12.548]  They want hatred, violence, and bloodshed between the races, and they don't care how they get it or whom they use.
[01:05:12.548 --> 01:05:14.169]  Even children, if necessary.
[01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:21.394]  That the Communist blueprint calls also for white retaliation and violence in the black communities.
[01:05:21.394 --> 01:05:25.217]  It's a very important objective for the Communist Party.
[01:05:25.217 --> 01:05:32.222]  So far, they've only been able to involve a small percentage of our Negro people in this war of national liberation.
[01:05:32.222 --> 01:05:34.544]  The great majority want no part of it in any form.
[01:05:35.438 --> 01:05:44.963]  The one sure way to change that is to have white vigilante groups striking into the Negro sections supposedly to seek revenge.
[01:05:44.963 --> 01:05:53.928]  Ladies and gentlemen, the plans and preparations for a communist revolution of force and violence are far advanced.
[01:05:53.928 --> 01:06:04.914]  The organization behind these preparations has almost unlimited financial resources and it provides both training and leadership based upon years of experience in many other countries.
[01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:09.377]  Our enemies are deadly serious about their task.
[01:06:09.377 --> 01:06:15.959]  And it's nothing short of national suicide for us to continue to ignore their plans and their progress.
[01:06:15.959 --> 01:06:30.682]  The strategy of the proletarian revolution calls for the quiet conversion of our government into a communist regime, but under the banner of socialism.
[01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:32.163]  But what is socialism?
[01:06:32.163 --> 01:06:33.503]  Alright, let's define it.
[01:06:34.483 --> 01:06:46.569]  According to the dictionary, socialism is a political concept based upon the principle of government ownership and control of property, the means of production, and the avenues of commerce.
[01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:59.976]  Under socialism, those who run the government, and the communists are confident that in America they eventually will be the ones who do so, those who run the government will know who is to get something
[01:07:00.777 --> 01:07:02.058]  And who has to wait?
[01:07:02.058 --> 01:07:07.883]  And that represents control over human beings.
[01:07:07.883 --> 01:07:12.226]  What is all this to do with the communist revolution in America?
[01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:20.513]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it has everything to do with it because the building of socialism is the communist revolution in America.
[01:07:20.513 --> 01:07:28.259]  It represents the process whereby our country can be moved gradually toward communism without the people even being aware of it.
[01:07:29.105 --> 01:07:39.769]  No matter what grievance we may have, real or imagined, no matter what national problems we may face, the communists seize upon these as excuses to build socialism.
[01:07:39.769 --> 01:07:43.910]  They have one and only one solution for all problems.
[01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.051]  More government.
[01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:46.171]  More government.
[01:07:46.171 --> 01:07:47.611]  And then more.
[01:07:47.611 --> 01:07:48.552]  And more.
[01:07:48.552 --> 01:07:51.973]  Until it's total government.
[01:07:51.973 --> 01:07:54.594]  And forgive me for saying it one more time.
[01:07:54.594 --> 01:07:57.795]  Total government is communism.
[01:08:01.949 --> 01:08:09.172]  In 1943, the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States.
[01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:25.400]  It read, When certain obstructionists become too irritating, label them, after suitable build-ups, as fascist, or Nazi, or anti-Semitic, and use the prestige of anti-fascist intolerance organizations to discredit them.
[01:08:26.266 --> 01:08:33.590]  In the public mind, constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell.
[01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:43.496]  The association will, after enough repetition, become fact in the public mind.
[01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:47.759]  But because they are lying, it's possible to expose them.
[01:08:47.759 --> 01:08:50.821]  And this is their Achilles heel.
[01:08:50.821 --> 01:08:54.783]  By comparison, we have nothing to hide, therefore we have no reason to lie.
[01:08:55.305 --> 01:08:58.006]  And we wouldn't want to, even if we could.
[01:08:58.006 --> 01:09:01.788]  Truth is a far superior weapon than deceit.
[01:09:01.788 --> 01:09:04.549]  It's a weapon which is denied to them.
[01:09:04.549 --> 01:09:09.851]  And in the end, it will be the decisive weapon that destroys them completely.
[01:09:13.393 --> 01:09:24.276]  We get a lot of advice from the Council, so this will mean I won't have this far to go, to be told what we should be doing and how we should think about the future.
[01:09:24.276 --> 01:09:34.700]  People like Hillary Clinton know, even at that elevated position, Hillary Clinton, you'd say one of the big movers and shakers, compared to the Council on Foreign Relations, she's not.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.600]  She's a small fish.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.322]  And she knows that she's got to get the approval of the CFR.
[01:09:41.322 --> 01:09:46.384]  I had a friend, Nick Rockefeller, okay, who was one of the Rockefeller family.
[01:09:46.384 --> 01:09:51.366]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is to create a one world government.
[01:09:51.366 --> 01:09:53.127]  And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[01:09:53.127 --> 01:09:54.548]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[01:09:54.548 --> 01:10:00.610]  Not just any world government, but a world government based on the model of collectivism.
[01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:03.872]  In other words, big, powerful, centralized world government.
[01:10:04.662 --> 01:10:22.312]  If it were a world government based on the principles of freedom, and freedom of choice, freedom of culture, low intervention, if no intervention in the lives of normal human beings, it might be a wonderful thing, but that's not the kind of world government the left and the right have in mind.
[01:10:22.312 --> 01:10:31.457]  They're talking about total world government, with all major decisions being made at the top, and people at the bottom being peasants, basically, in a high-tech feudalism.
[01:10:32.591 --> 01:10:47.663]  Did you hear what G. Edward Griffin said back in 1969 that they're trying to fund right-wing groups to actually go out and attack black people in response to getting black people to go out and attack white people to get us all killing each other?
[01:10:47.663 --> 01:10:59.333]  Well, if you go to the documents that we've had for two years that would sink the entire ship of Soros and Alexander Soros' son, it says in the 30-something page action plan that's officially theirs
[01:11:00.219 --> 01:11:03.540]  We're trying to get black people to riot and cause a race war.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.501]  Here's how we do it.
[01:11:05.501 --> 01:11:06.901]  The media primes everybody.
[01:11:06.901 --> 01:11:08.882]  Antifa goes out and starts burning stuff.
[01:11:08.882 --> 01:11:11.642]  The media calls them heroes.
[01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:23.546]  And then we see Antifa in Austin and other areas paying black males, young black men, hundreds of dollars to go burn or break something to try to get other blacks to do it.
[01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:25.326]  You talk about racist.
[01:11:25.326 --> 01:11:26.787]  You talk about manipulating somebody.
[01:11:26.787 --> 01:11:27.447]  So finally,
[01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:43.036]  40, 50 years later, I guess this is 60 years later, almost, all these years later, the communists are finally getting what they want.
[01:11:43.036 --> 01:11:55.185]  And they're triggering NASCAR to ban the rebel flag and to trigger all these folks that are now going to fly the rebel flag because they know that it's now becoming a symbol of free speech.
[01:11:55.185 --> 01:11:57.667]  And now they're tearing down statues of Teddy Roosevelt.
[01:11:58.663 --> 01:12:07.067]  You know, Trump said, back at Charlottesville, he said, next they're gonna want George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and the different shows made fun of him.
[01:12:07.067 --> 01:12:08.828]  I said, he's dead on.
[01:12:08.828 --> 01:12:11.329]  They want you to hate your heritage.
[01:12:11.329 --> 01:12:17.632]  Because it was England and the United States that led the way to end slavery in most of the world.
[01:12:17.632 --> 01:12:21.113]  It still goes on in Africa and the Middle East.
[01:12:21.113 --> 01:12:24.535]  And the idea, the idea
[01:12:26.345 --> 01:12:30.549]  That we're the racist bad country when we're the most open countries in the world is incredible.
[01:12:30.549 --> 01:12:34.672]  They are trying to find a weakness and exploit it.
[01:12:34.672 --> 01:12:41.238]  When we come back, I'm going to show you some of the flaming racists that academia are funding, calling for killing white people.
[01:12:41.238 --> 01:12:46.923]  And we'll play that clip of Trump rightfully saying, next they'll want the Jefferson and Washington memorials.
[01:12:46.923 --> 01:12:48.825]  And now they don't just want them.
[01:12:48.825 --> 01:12:49.825]  Some have been toppled.
[01:12:49.825 --> 01:12:50.386]  We'll be right back.

[01:13:23.497 --> 01:13:28.159]  I just devoured your cousin Infowar's protein bar.

[01:13:42.678 --> 01:13:43.079]  p.m.
[01:13:43.079 --> 01:13:45.041]  day and night 8-pack Power Stack.
[01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:50.609]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new DE specials have launched at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:13:50.609 --> 01:13:53.853]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[01:13:54.614 --> 01:14:01.158]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[01:14:01.158 --> 01:14:04.179]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[01:14:04.179 --> 01:14:07.261]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 spray.
[01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:10.382]  The great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go.
[01:14:10.382 --> 01:14:12.884]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[01:14:13.424 --> 01:14:15.665]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[01:14:15.665 --> 01:14:17.647]  It's great to keep with you.
[01:14:17.647 --> 01:14:23.930]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.471]  We're really excited about it.
[01:14:25.471 --> 01:14:27.613]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[01:14:27.613 --> 01:14:39.120]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:53.509]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at Infowarsstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[01:14:53.509 --> 01:14:56.150]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:17.633]  Everything the globalist social engineers are doing is a form of psychological warfare.
[01:15:17.633 --> 01:15:19.294]  Plain and simple.
[01:15:19.294 --> 01:15:24.558]  Teaching you to hate your past, teaching you to get on your knees or on your belly and announce that you're a bad person because you're white.
[01:15:27.093 --> 01:15:37.101]  Muhammad Ali's son has come out and said that Black Lives Matter are wicked devils and his father would hate them for saying that one group's more important or better than another.
[01:15:37.101 --> 01:15:42.905]  I mean if you believe in what Martin Luther King was talking about and just that common sense.
[01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:51.352]  The whole West has been built on that and trying to move towards that and now the left has taken it over and is teaching the opposite but claiming they represent
[01:15:52.967 --> 01:16:05.573]  Western liberal open societies, when they don't, they represent the jacobin left-hand path that is there to destroy and overthrow free societies because they can't compete with it.
[01:16:05.573 --> 01:16:17.078]  That's why there's all of these different professors coming out and saying, we need to have no whites on campus this weekend, or this area of the campus is not for whites.
[01:16:20.089 --> 01:16:28.176]  Think about accepting that in the name of, oh, learn what it's like for what happened to somebody else.
[01:16:28.176 --> 01:16:34.441]  So does that mean that if a white man ever murdered somebody, I need to be murdered?
[01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:36.302]  Or what if it's 10 to 1 black-on-white crime?
[01:16:36.302 --> 01:16:40.826]  Does that mean random black people need to be killed because some black people do bad things?
[01:16:40.826 --> 01:16:42.607]  And the media tells them go out and do it?
[01:16:42.607 --> 01:16:44.769]  Go out and assault white people because they deserve it!
[01:16:46.616 --> 01:16:53.181]  And that NPR, when you assault a white person, will say they assaulted you!
[01:16:53.181 --> 01:16:59.765]  And they won't even get in trouble when they get caught, because they're going for broke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:59.765 --> 01:17:13.795]  When people come with guns to carjack a vehicle and scare the person with a gun pointed at them, on record, and the person drives off scared, NPR cuts the video and says that they're white supremacists.
[01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.456]  Also, people like this individual,
[01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:34.076]  Quote, some white people may have to die for black communities to be made whole, says this UGA professor teaching assistant, Irami Osi Fong Pong of the University of Georgia.
[01:17:34.076 --> 01:17:38.980]  By the way, the Georgia legislature has already passed part of a resolution to abolish the police.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.761]  They're not going to abolish them, they're going to take them over.
[01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:44.043]  And then you will have a police state.
[01:17:44.043 --> 01:17:45.644]  You'll have SJWs in uniform.
[01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:49.380]  Here, let's go ahead and play a local news report on this.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.541]  Here it is.
[01:17:51.541 --> 01:18:00.046]  Some UGA alumni are saying they are thinking about withholding donations after a university employee made some racially charged comments.
[01:18:00.046 --> 01:18:02.007]  Channel 2's Tony Thomas is live in Athens.
[01:18:02.007 --> 01:18:07.871]  That's where the teacher's assistant is standing by his words, Tony, even as his bosses consider legal options.
[01:18:10.046 --> 01:18:21.582]  Yeah, Jovita, when this all started, the university administrators' first statements were basically that this was a teacher's assistant making personal comments not directly related to UGA.
[01:18:21.582 --> 01:18:26.108]  Now, though, as these comments have gone viral, well, reactions are changing.
[01:18:26.809 --> 01:18:28.290]  You have to wonder what else is in the water.
[01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.173]  Have you heard about this teacher's assistant?
[01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:37.579]  The online comments and videos of UGA teacher's assistant Irami Osei-Frankpong are spreading rapidly.
[01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:39.781]  There's got to be a reason why he's saying that.
[01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.803]  You know, he's not just being that crazy.
[01:18:41.803 --> 01:18:50.911]  Osei-Frankpong, who calls himself the funky academic online, recently commented on Facebook, some white people may have to die for black communities to be made whole.
[01:18:50.911 --> 01:18:52.993]  And fighting white people is a skill.
[01:18:53.573 --> 01:18:58.136]  I didn't advocate for violence, I was just honest about the history of racial progress.
[01:18:58.136 --> 01:19:07.283]  I asked Jose Frampong about his comments and university administrators who say they are quote, vigorously exploring all legal options about his words.
[01:19:07.283 --> 01:19:10.025]  If they fire me, I don't think it goes very well for them.
[01:19:10.025 --> 01:19:12.467]  But the pressure appears to be mounting.
[01:19:12.467 --> 01:19:18.631]  This is a confrontation last September between Jose Frampong and then UGA student Andrew Lawrence.
[01:19:18.631 --> 01:19:22.354]  You said that every suburban community in Georgia raises white supremacists.
[01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:23.955]  How can you possibly say that?
[01:19:23.955 --> 01:19:25.717]  Lawrence now lives in D.C.
[01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:32.624]  and recently posted the video as he called for alumni to stop donating to the university until action is taken.
[01:19:32.624 --> 01:19:35.807]  I feel like the things that he's saying are inciting violence.
[01:19:35.807 --> 01:19:39.410]  They invite the idea into people's minds.
[01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:41.152]  Some white people may have to die.
[01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:42.313]  You stick with that?
[01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:42.814]  Yeah!
[01:19:42.814 --> 01:19:44.916]  I'm confused on why that's so controversial.
[01:19:47.318 --> 01:19:58.387]  Now in its latest statement, UGA administrators wrote, we are seeking guidance from the Office of the Attorney General as to what actions we can legally consider in accordance with the First Amendment.
[01:19:58.387 --> 01:20:00.829]  Live in Athens, Tony Thomas, Channel 2 Action News.
[01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:05.833]  And of course, this guy wouldn't survive 10 minutes in Somalia or Rwanda.
[01:20:05.833 --> 01:20:09.336]  And by the way, he doesn't care that the Clintons funded the murder of over a million
[01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:13.893]  Somali Christians so their land could be taken, and it came out the UN ran that.
[01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.934]  They didn't just stand by and let it happen.
[01:20:15.934 --> 01:20:17.355]  Oh, that's just a million dead black people.
[01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:23.539]  I don't care about that, because I'm really just a black communist that wants to get a civil war going.
[01:20:23.539 --> 01:20:26.061]  That's really what this guy wants.
[01:20:26.061 --> 01:20:31.725]  But don't worry, Black Lives Matter theme show depicts whites as slaves, blacks as slave owners.
[01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:37.172]  How does reinventing something that's wrong make it right?
[01:20:37.172 --> 01:20:43.655]  It's all just about white people are bad and parading white people around to be shamed.
[01:20:43.655 --> 01:20:45.015]  You raped our daughters.
[01:20:45.015 --> 01:20:46.476]  You stole our freedom.
[01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:49.297]  Now we steal yours.
[01:20:49.297 --> 01:20:52.758]  And showing a bunch of degenerate white people that deserve to be enslaved.
[01:20:55.091 --> 01:20:57.232]  In this type of violence porn.
[01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:59.634]  And they've got all these movies and all these shows.
[01:20:59.634 --> 01:21:02.055]  The Purge, where whites go out and purge black people.
[01:21:02.055 --> 01:21:08.740]  But really, it's the left out purging random people out of their cars.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:20.067]  But Hollywood just keeps showing simulations of white people killing black people, though the statistics aren't there, to create the illusion and the perception that when I was on
[01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:30.499]  One of the largest black podcasts in the country.
[01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:35.864]  The black rapper, T.I., looked at me and he said, there's an epidemic.
[01:21:35.864 --> 01:21:38.906]  There's never been more black people getting killed by whites.
[01:21:38.906 --> 01:21:41.809]  And during breaks, I was trying to show him, hey man, look, it's 10 to 1 statistics.
[01:21:41.809 --> 01:21:42.590]  Oh, I don't look at that.
[01:21:45.011 --> 01:21:50.532]  And I said, well, you know that the 10 to 1 is a real number of black adults killing white people.
[01:21:50.532 --> 01:21:54.013]  But I said, you know, the real genocide is blacks are being targeted for abortion.
[01:21:54.013 --> 01:21:55.073]  He didn't want to hear that.
[01:21:55.073 --> 01:21:56.514]  He didn't even want to know that.
[01:21:56.514 --> 01:22:11.598]  Because again, that's not the script where the media tells him you're the victim, but you're empowered when you spout this script, when really you're allowing genocide against humanity to go on while you talk about the scratch on your leg.
[01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:12.738]  And that's what's really going on here.
[01:22:12.738 --> 01:22:13.318]  Some of the other ones.
[01:22:17.096 --> 01:22:21.038]  Multiple people shot during Juneteenth celebration in Charlottesville, North Carolina.
[01:22:21.038 --> 01:22:24.340]  But it's black-on-black, so you won't be hearing about that.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:28.962]  Three fatally stabbed at site of Black Lives Matter protest in UK.
[01:22:28.962 --> 01:22:32.284]  Black-on-black, but you won't hear about that.
[01:22:32.284 --> 01:22:36.006]  Superheroes handling chopped law enforcement flee murder scene.
[01:22:36.006 --> 01:22:39.888]  Now there's video when somebody actually starts murdering folks, black-on-black.
[01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:43.030]  The white kids dressed up as superheroes run.
[01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.390]  See?
[01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:44.831]  It's called a fantasy land.
[01:22:47.443 --> 01:22:54.086]  Orban shocked by disorder and multicultural west statues are being toppled, gang wars fought in the streets, and boy are they.
[01:22:54.086 --> 01:23:09.852]  Meanwhile, cancel Yale, gaining traction after conservative points out extensive slavery ties, that Yale was actually founded by a slaver who actually did kill people en masse, and actually ran the coffin ships.
[01:23:11.067 --> 01:23:11.568]  So what?
[01:23:11.568 --> 01:23:16.512]  If you take it over, whether you're black or white, you go to school there, it doesn't matter who created or built the house.
[01:23:16.512 --> 01:23:22.277]  If a bad guy built a castle, would you blow it up when you now are in the castle?
[01:23:22.277 --> 01:23:24.619]  Again, this is just mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:24.619 --> 01:23:27.761]  No, don't get rid of Yale.
[01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:29.803]  I mean, I don't even care if you change the name.
[01:23:29.803 --> 01:23:30.764]  Skull and bones, all of it.
[01:23:30.764 --> 01:23:31.685]  It's a big, sick joke.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:38.627]  And meanwhile, they're now announcing that CHOP is only for black people and they're segregating blacks from whites.
[01:23:38.627 --> 01:23:41.271]  How progressive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:41.271 --> 01:23:44.576]  Alright, we'll go to the bottom of the rabbit hole, I promise.
[01:23:44.576 --> 01:23:46.218]  The Big Enchilada on the other side.
[01:23:46.218 --> 01:23:46.758]  Please stay with us.

[01:24:49.074 --> 01:24:50.094]  It's finally here.
[01:24:50.094 --> 01:24:54.937]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[01:24:54.937 --> 01:25:01.220]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.600]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:12.682]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.

[01:25:50.009 --> 01:25:51.791]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:52.272]  You're on the air.
[01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:53.874]  Thanks for calling.
[01:25:53.874 --> 01:25:54.495]  I sure can, sir.
[01:25:54.495 --> 01:25:55.216]  Thank you.
[01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:57.679]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:26:05.809 --> 01:26:07.269]  I just want to plug in.
[01:26:07.269 --> 01:26:11.690]  I'm a truck driver, and two before have changed the way I drive.
[01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.931]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:18.312]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[01:26:18.312 --> 01:26:26.114]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank
[01:26:26.294 --> 01:26:27.094]  Thank you for that, man.
[01:26:27.094 --> 01:26:32.737]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[01:26:32.737 --> 01:26:35.018]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[01:26:35.018 --> 01:26:37.499]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[01:26:37.499 --> 01:26:40.160]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.182]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[01:26:44.182 --> 01:26:46.002]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[01:26:46.002 --> 01:26:46.723]  So that means a lot to me.
[01:26:46.723 --> 01:26:47.083]  Thank you.
[01:26:47.083 --> 01:26:51.185]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[01:26:51.185 --> 01:26:53.806]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:11.707 --> 01:27:15.429]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:27:15.429 --> 01:27:18.311]  Run on for a long time.
[01:27:18.311 --> 01:27:21.133]  Run on for a long time.
[01:27:21.133 --> 01:27:24.314]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:27:24.314 --> 01:27:26.255]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:27:26.255 --> 01:27:29.097]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:27:29.097 --> 01:27:31.458]  There is a cult.
[01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:33.900]  There is an organization.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:40.003]  There is a group that believes they are going to attain eternal life.
[01:27:42.145 --> 01:27:46.587]  But first, they must give up their humanity.
[01:27:46.587 --> 01:27:54.811]  Where have I heard that before?
[01:27:54.811 --> 01:28:04.396]  And so, I remember reading top globalist publications 20-something years ago where they were talking about this theoretically and then digging deeper into it.
[01:28:07.452 --> 01:28:24.441]  And then discovering the entire environmentalism cult is not about saving the planet, it's about controlling the debate about the planet so they can actually overwrite the genetic code of the planet and play God.
[01:28:24.441 --> 01:28:31.125]  And so now there are open announcements in every major elite publication
[01:28:34.719 --> 01:29:03.461]  about how beautiful and wonderful the end of humanity is going to be because humanity's fallen and ugly and failed and that COVID-19 is teaching us to lower our carbon footprint and teaching us to learn to live in our houses and that virtual reality is coming soon that will plug directly into the brain that will give you this beautiful wonderful new world and then
[01:29:04.693 --> 01:29:16.056]  You've got to hit the button, actually archetypally shows that at the Wall Street Journal, and turn off your body and die and stop being a bad carbon life form.
[01:29:16.056 --> 01:29:17.636]  Remember, carbon is bad.
[01:29:17.636 --> 01:29:23.778]  The only thing worse than eating meat is actually being made out of meat.
[01:29:23.778 --> 01:29:34.140]  And that you will then be uploaded and merge with this beautiful, wonderful super intelligence that will be God, that will be the beast that you worship.
[01:29:36.772 --> 01:29:53.117]  And that you will have to accept that when the beast says it's your time, for the carbon balance, you will go to a facility, you'll be jacked in, they will download your consciousness, and then you will live forever with the super intelligence.
[01:29:53.117 --> 01:30:01.899]  Now, that's in a four-page article in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:30:03.578 --> 01:30:11.360]  This was the featured main article in the Sunday edition that they put on newsstands and hotels and mailed out to your house.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.140]  Now, again, you've heard this on this show a thousand times.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.341]  I've made films about it 13, 14 years ago.
[01:30:17.341 --> 01:30:19.622]  The point is, is they're going operational with this.
[01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:26.663]  And I have talked to some of the big tech people that are not part of this, but that have been in the meetings.
[01:30:26.663 --> 01:30:28.984]  And I mean, high level.
[01:30:28.984 --> 01:30:33.125]  And another one of my associates actually had a meeting with one of these individuals, an off record event.
[01:30:35.393 --> 01:30:37.075]  Very recent.
[01:30:37.075 --> 01:30:38.756]  And just told us quite a bit.
[01:30:38.756 --> 01:30:42.419]  He said, you're dead on and it's really scary.
[01:30:42.419 --> 01:30:47.844]  And Zuckerberg openly laughs at people that say that this isn't going to happen.
[01:30:47.844 --> 01:30:49.265]  He says, I'm never going to die.
[01:30:49.265 --> 01:30:50.306]  I'm merging with a machine.
[01:30:50.306 --> 01:30:52.268]  I'm going to rule the planet.
[01:30:52.268 --> 01:30:58.173]  And he directly works under Bill Gates.
[01:30:58.173 --> 01:30:59.695]  And of course, that's on record as well.
[01:30:59.695 --> 01:31:02.277]  So let me lay out
[01:31:04.838 --> 01:31:12.446]  The general layout, and then get into how it's all a big fraud.
[01:31:12.446 --> 01:31:13.868]  But that's how the pitch goes.
[01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:22.297]  Hey, if you were just silicon, you would never die, and you would not hurt the earth, which is total BS to begin with.
[01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:29.070]  And just let us control everything and just give up your humanity and just don't leave your house.
[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:36.316]  And they're now at the UN Sustainability Council and here in the Wall Street Journal saying, COVID is a blessing.
[01:31:36.316 --> 01:31:40.680]  It's teaching us that we're failed, that we're fallen, that we're frail.
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:44.143]  All they do is bombard us with toxic poisons, electromagnetic radiation.
[01:31:44.143 --> 01:31:45.444]  They lie to us about COVID.
[01:31:45.444 --> 01:31:46.485]  They try to teach us we're bad.
[01:31:46.485 --> 01:31:48.747]  To go, oh, don't worry.
[01:31:50.202 --> 01:31:51.143]  Come plug into this.
[01:31:51.143 --> 01:31:55.667]  Now, of course, there will be no immortality.
[01:31:55.667 --> 01:32:07.958]  The voice prints, the face scans, the internet of things, your every move being tracked, is being absorbed by AI computer systems to mimic humans.
[01:32:07.958 --> 01:32:16.025]  So that when the superhero, really cool people, upload to the machine,
[01:32:17.674 --> 01:32:19.715]  There will be 3D renderings of them.
[01:32:19.715 --> 01:32:22.397]  They will have electronic avatars.
[01:32:22.397 --> 01:32:24.318]  They will have robot avatars.
[01:32:24.318 --> 01:32:29.821]  Their voice print will fool their wife, their husband.
[01:32:29.821 --> 01:32:30.781]  But it won't be them.
[01:32:30.781 --> 01:32:46.370]  It's a facsimile of what the person said and did in their art, and what they stood for, absorbed into a single machine that can then edit and change what the actual person said in their real life, and then steal their identity.
[01:32:48.717 --> 01:32:51.820]  And that's why they're getting you used to saying there aren't just two genders.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.541]  In fact, the two genders don't exist.
[01:32:53.541 --> 01:32:55.062]  Male and female don't exist.
[01:32:55.062 --> 01:32:56.524]  And the family's bad.
[01:32:56.524 --> 01:32:58.185]  And the nuclear family's bad.
[01:32:58.185 --> 01:33:01.548]  And pedophilia will be the basis of the new family.
[01:33:01.548 --> 01:33:07.052]  It's come out the German government was nationwide for 50 years.
[01:33:09.534 --> 01:33:27.287]  Taking tens of thousands, we now learn, of children and giving them to convicted pedophiles to produce the scientific literature of the ultimate family and the ultimate love of a 50-year-old man anally raping a 5-year-old boy.
[01:33:27.287 --> 01:33:30.169]  That's all mainstream news last week.
[01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:32.230]  Kenzie, Freud, all of it.
[01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:32.791]  Pedophiles.
[01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:37.992]  Berlin authorities place children with pedophiles for 30 years.
[01:33:37.992 --> 01:33:47.358]  You read, this is just one little piece they focus on as a distraction, because they know it's coming out.
[01:33:47.358 --> 01:33:58.985]  And it says that they believe the ultimate love is an adult having sex with a child, but you've got to take it from the bad backwards nuclear families and give it to the good new families.
[01:33:58.985 --> 01:34:03.648]  And they said, heterosexual, you don't want a man with a little girl.
[01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:09.170]  Or an older woman with a boy.
[01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:10.671]  It's gotta be same-sex too.
[01:34:10.671 --> 01:34:15.215]  That doesn't have children, you see, and it's good for the earth.
[01:34:15.215 --> 01:34:19.037]  As long as the pedophilia is same-sex, what did the senator just try to pass?
[01:34:19.037 --> 01:34:22.600]  The same one that passed you can give somebody HIV or hepatitis in California and not get in trouble.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.323]  He has the bill introduced that as long as it's same-sex, it's not pedophilia.
[01:34:26.323 --> 01:34:31.066]  This is a very detailed religion.
[01:34:31.066 --> 01:34:33.608]  And love formed in these new sexual unions
[01:34:34.997 --> 01:34:36.278]  Is the most beautiful thing on earth.
[01:34:36.278 --> 01:34:37.039]  But let's continue.
[01:34:37.039 --> 01:34:47.870]  Because this is just one of the tenets of this new transhumanist religion given to us by Julian Huxley.
[01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:52.595]  Looking forward to the end of humanity is the Adam Kirsch article.
[01:34:52.595 --> 01:34:57.701]  And it's basically the same vomit, the same hymns, the same text put out
[01:34:58.897 --> 01:34:59.757]  Over and over again.
[01:34:59.757 --> 01:35:01.138]  You need to read a thousand of these articles.
[01:35:01.138 --> 01:35:02.518]  They're always written the exact same.
[01:35:02.518 --> 01:35:04.099]  They're giving talking points.
[01:35:04.099 --> 01:35:05.060]  They regurgitate them.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:08.481]  In fact, he even says, I'm just giving you the tenets of transhumanism.
[01:35:08.481 --> 01:35:09.721]  Let me repeat them to you.
[01:35:09.721 --> 01:35:14.984]  He doesn't even hide that in the article.
[01:35:14.984 --> 01:35:15.764]  You're fallen.
[01:35:15.764 --> 01:35:16.504]  You're ugly.
[01:35:16.504 --> 01:35:17.164]  You're bad.
[01:35:17.164 --> 01:35:18.365]  You're bad for the earth.
[01:35:18.365 --> 01:35:19.905]  COVID is teaching you this.
[01:35:19.905 --> 01:35:21.426]  You must stay in your home.
[01:35:21.426 --> 01:35:27.689]  Soon, you will be able to plug in to virtual reality and you will be able to give up your body.
[01:35:27.689 --> 01:35:28.389]  Be depressed.
[01:35:31.084 --> 01:35:34.686]  Get into Facebook, get into Twitter, which all the studies show make you more depressed.
[01:35:34.686 --> 01:35:58.858]  And then finally, like a bug flying towards a bug zapper, you fly into the flame, believing that, oh, if I just go deeper down this, I'm a bigger SJW, if I just give up my body, I'll finally be somebody, and really, all it's doing is killing you, you've signed the waiver to commit suicide, you've killed yourself, and now it's stolen your identity, and here's the key of the key, of the key, of the key, of the key.
[01:36:02.893 --> 01:36:10.277]  It now has your identity and can represent you and vote for you.
[01:36:10.277 --> 01:36:19.362]  And see, with the whole transhumanism, you can't say a man who goes in and says, check my cervix, and he's got a giant penis, and the nurse gets fired for saying you have a penis.
[01:36:19.362 --> 01:36:20.222]  This is insane.
[01:36:20.222 --> 01:36:23.624]  Because you've got to always say, oh, a Google executive is a beautiful dragon.
[01:36:23.624 --> 01:36:24.425]  You're an ornate building.
[01:36:25.425 --> 01:36:43.080]  You're gonna have to give these avatars and these people's stolen identities attention like they're a being and all it is is a manifestation of the big AI beast programmed and controlled by sickos like David Rockefeller's main protégé, chief science officer of Satan on this planet, Bill Gates.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.442]  Yes, we're revealing the master code.
[01:36:47.523 --> 01:36:54.950]  United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third world sectors of the world.
[01:36:54.950 --> 01:37:01.537]  Bill and Melinda Gates that control the UNWHO openly say they want to depopulate brown people.
[01:37:01.537 --> 01:37:10.486]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst on the planet, and then lecture white people
[01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:12.979]  Black people.
[01:37:12.979 --> 01:37:19.041]  And now all over the world, people are taking knees and trying to overthrow police and put leftists in control.
[01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:22.603]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:25.804]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer?
[01:37:25.804 --> 01:37:28.605]  Leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people.
[01:37:29.045 --> 01:37:34.388]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[01:37:34.388 --> 01:37:41.213]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York, where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[01:37:41.213 --> 01:37:43.154]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[01:37:43.154 --> 01:37:48.857]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[01:37:48.857 --> 01:37:56.222]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[01:37:56.222 --> 01:37:57.583]  Believe they pulled the drain.
[01:37:58.846 --> 01:38:01.948]  on America a long time ago.
[01:38:01.948 --> 01:38:15.958]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, and if there's a mass awakening, it can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:21.002]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[01:38:21.002 --> 01:38:25.145]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[01:38:26.331 --> 01:38:32.795]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[01:38:32.795 --> 01:38:37.618]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[01:38:37.618 --> 01:38:39.459]  Everything hinges on you.
[01:38:39.459 --> 01:38:40.379]  Everything.
[01:38:40.379 --> 01:38:44.322]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[01:38:44.322 --> 01:38:44.782]  God bless.
[01:38:48.772 --> 01:38:51.212]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[01:38:51.212 --> 01:38:54.153]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[01:38:54.153 --> 01:38:55.233]  It's the highest quality.
[01:38:55.233 --> 01:38:56.653]  They've got it.
[01:38:56.653 --> 01:39:03.054]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[01:39:03.054 --> 01:39:05.575]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[01:39:05.575 --> 01:39:08.916]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[01:39:08.916 --> 01:39:13.756]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[01:39:13.756 --> 01:39:17.097]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.101]  We are going to still go down the hard road now.
[01:39:21.101 --> 01:39:27.004]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[01:39:27.004 --> 01:39:28.504]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:29.705]  It's something you need.
[01:39:29.705 --> 01:39:33.106]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast.
[01:39:33.106 --> 01:39:40.729]  The 360 wins, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarestore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:43.510]  It's in great containers, high quality, lasts 25 years.
[01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:47.532]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:39:48.052 --> 01:39:51.594]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[01:39:51.594 --> 01:39:55.877]  Coffee and energy drinks provide a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[01:39:55.877 --> 01:40:00.480]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go, TurboForce.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:09.646]  TurboForce from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used across the globe to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[01:40:09.646 --> 01:40:14.129]  TurboForce is a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[01:40:14.129 --> 01:40:17.792]  Try adding this to your daily routine and revolutionize your day today.
[01:40:18.532 --> 01:40:22.194]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[01:40:22.194 --> 01:40:29.278]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[01:40:29.278 --> 01:40:33.260]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking water.

[01:40:39.523 --> 01:40:44.525]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[01:40:44.525 --> 01:40:47.407]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[01:40:52.105 --> 01:40:54.716]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:15.865 --> 01:41:17.226]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:17.226 --> 01:41:29.013]  You know, last week, Foreign Affairs of the CFR came out with an article that mirrored what good old Joe Biden had said the week before, that the military is going to take the president out.
[01:41:29.013 --> 01:41:39.360]  Well, they called for a military coup in Foreign Affairs, and there's so much of this now going on that we didn't even mention it here on air.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.343]  But actually, since I forgot to, Daria, will you reprint that Foreign Affairs article?
[01:41:44.258 --> 01:41:46.839]  Because I want to cover that when we start the next hour.
[01:41:46.839 --> 01:41:51.942]  There's a lot of big stuff like that happening and going on right now, but I want you to understand the big picture.
[01:41:51.942 --> 01:41:53.863]  Obviously, the globalists are delusional.
[01:41:53.863 --> 01:41:55.504]  Obviously, they're megalomaniacs.
[01:41:55.504 --> 01:42:06.709]  Obviously, they've had all these big tech companies come out that have merged with Big Pharma and said, oh, we have a test that can find cancer and a test that can find this.
[01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:09.811]  And it was a $100 billion company, and it turned out it was all a fraud.
[01:42:12.383 --> 01:42:26.494]  But when we worship it, and we plug into it, and we give it all our thoughts, and all our dreams, and our voiceprint, and it can mimic our image, the fake is gonna get so good that it's gonna be hard to tell from the real thing.
[01:42:26.494 --> 01:42:34.821]  And the law is, internationally, that you don't question.
[01:42:34.821 --> 01:42:41.466]  When the Google executives make their employees tell them, you are a beautiful, ornate building, you are a beautiful female dragon,
[01:42:43.288 --> 01:42:46.069]  And then the executive says back to them, what do you want to be?
[01:42:46.069 --> 01:42:47.749]  Well, I want to be God.
[01:42:47.749 --> 01:42:49.090]  You're God.
[01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:53.211]  It's all a cult.
[01:42:53.211 --> 01:43:02.734]  So that then people accept, not just you can be plugged in cyberpunk style and be given unlimited pleasure and never want to leave your bed.
[01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:21.393]  But that you are plugged into a completely false reality with false assumptions and false peer pressure so that your very soul can be tricked into giving up its free will because you've been put in a prison cell that you don't even know is a cell.
[01:43:21.393 --> 01:43:24.294]  Because a lot of people don't get broken inside a solitary confinement.
[01:43:24.294 --> 01:43:24.974]  They just go crazy.
[01:43:25.754 --> 01:43:35.841]  But if you can be put into a false reality like that famous picture of Zuckerberg walking bipedally, everyone else is like hunched over their computers in a VR universe he controls.
[01:43:35.841 --> 01:43:38.643]  That's their dreams!
[01:43:38.643 --> 01:43:44.207]  And we're already so plugged in to the cell phones.
[01:43:44.207 --> 01:43:47.909]  We're already so controlled by it.
[01:43:47.909 --> 01:43:51.392]  And that's just the hook that the bait's on.
[01:43:52.529 --> 01:43:57.351]  Once you get hooked, it pulls you up to the surface and you're in a whole other universe now.
[01:43:57.351 --> 01:43:58.752]  Their cyber world.
[01:43:58.752 --> 01:44:02.074]  And in the movie Tron, the original, they tell you what they want.
[01:44:02.074 --> 01:44:05.355]  The big AI computer doesn't want any independent programs.
[01:44:05.355 --> 01:44:15.200]  It wants everything absorbed into it.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.422]  And so that's what all these movies and all these shows are showing you.
[01:44:19.422 --> 01:44:19.743]  But now,
[01:44:20.959 --> 01:44:26.182]  It's not even shown as dystopic.
[01:44:26.182 --> 01:44:29.724]  Now they have movies about artificiality and it's a heaven.
[01:44:29.724 --> 01:44:38.689]  And it's a great place and oh you're paralyzed, oh you're gonna, but why can't you ever give your body up without dying?
[01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:49.815]  Why in all the movies and all the shows and in what's stated by Elon Musk and by Mark Zuckerberg and by Google and all of them have their own life extension
[01:44:50.888 --> 01:44:54.070]  Technology plants.
[01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:57.411]  They all have their own immortality projects.
[01:44:57.411 --> 01:45:02.914]  But they always say in the news articles, you're gonna have to die to upload to this.
[01:45:02.914 --> 01:45:03.214]  Really?
[01:45:03.214 --> 01:45:08.616]  I mean, if consciousnesses are there, why wouldn't it just make a copy of my consciousness?
[01:45:08.616 --> 01:45:10.737]  Why do I have to physically die?
[01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:12.258]  They don't even tell you.
[01:45:18.038 --> 01:45:30.468]  They just program you from the beginning that for the process to work, it's all hypothetical they say, you've got to die.
[01:45:30.468 --> 01:45:42.517]  So again, I want to challenge everybody to understand that this is a fraud on its face.
[01:45:42.517 --> 01:45:43.838]  Because if you could
[01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:48.312]  Download your own consciousness, well then you can communicate with it.
[01:45:48.312 --> 01:45:55.398]  You can send your consciousness off on a spaceship and then have robots that, you know, genetically engineered a body for you once you got there.
[01:45:55.398 --> 01:45:56.479]  But see, no, no, no.
[01:45:56.479 --> 01:45:57.159]  It's a fraud.
[01:45:57.159 --> 01:46:02.584]  It's a post-human world where you all believe you're going to be uploaded to this thing, but you're not.
[01:46:02.584 --> 01:46:06.147]  You're actually disappeared.
[01:46:06.147 --> 01:46:08.989]  So let's go ahead and go over some of this article here.
[01:46:08.989 --> 01:46:10.290]  All right?
[01:46:13.069 --> 01:46:16.672]  Because the whole thing is written seductively like all the other articles.
[01:46:16.672 --> 01:46:18.774]  Here's one out of NBC a few months ago.
[01:46:18.774 --> 01:46:20.996]  Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world.
[01:46:20.996 --> 01:46:24.659]  James Lovelock says he's a big post-humanist globalist.
[01:46:24.659 --> 01:46:27.922]  And he says humans will vanish from the earth completely very soon.
[01:46:27.922 --> 01:46:32.146]  And I said the key to the key to the key of the key, but this is the key to that.
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:46.755]  They admit up front that this is to get rid of all the humans and that you're going to be made to do this because it's so superior we can't let you some obsolete non-essential.
[01:46:46.755 --> 01:46:49.918]  See how suddenly that's been introduced to your vernacular?
[01:46:49.918 --> 01:46:51.140]  Operate and be around.
[01:46:57.318 --> 01:47:00.481]  Because like Ray Kurzweil and all of them say, oh, they'll be so advanced.
[01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:02.402]  They'll just step on you like you're a bug.
[01:47:02.402 --> 01:47:08.167]  They're not going to let you scrounge around out there and do all this because you're non-essential.
[01:47:08.167 --> 01:47:16.894]  So you better serve them and behave yourself and get in line like being a Hollywood star wannabe to be able to be part of this.
[01:47:16.894 --> 01:47:21.858]  This is something very, very special that not just everybody gets.
[01:47:21.858 --> 01:47:25.281]  That's how they're going to make you clamor and beg for this thing.
[01:47:32.697 --> 01:47:45.448]  I mean, you look at David Rockefeller, you look at Prince Philip, you look at Ted Turner, you look at Mark Zuckerberg, and they are shaking with evil and hatred.
[01:47:45.448 --> 01:47:52.934]  They are hyper-psychotic, completely turned over to the will to dominate and control.
[01:47:54.775 --> 01:48:15.060]  And they're building a world that's artificial, where it's impossible for humans to live in a normal way, so that you're in so much pain and so poisoned, that you are forced to give over your free will and decide to merge with these machines, just so you can live and breathe.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:23.202]  And then they're going to tell you, if you want to keep living and breathing, you've got to fully merge with us now, and you've got to give that body up.
[01:48:28.311 --> 01:48:34.976]  And for psychotics like Zuckerberg, he never had a soul to begin with.
[01:48:34.976 --> 01:48:39.640]  He was always an android, a spiritual avatar of evil.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.221]  He was able to fully take this on.
[01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:46.726]  He's already gone because he never existed.
[01:48:46.726 --> 01:48:55.333]  So he's not giving up his soul.
[01:48:55.333 --> 01:48:55.853]  Never had one.
[01:49:00.714 --> 01:49:09.517]  He's only trying to get you in line with what he is, because it's all he knows.
[01:49:09.517 --> 01:49:14.398]  You gotta go read this article for yourself.
[01:49:14.398 --> 01:49:17.479]  And you gotta watch HD videos of Zuckerberg, like the one we have on screen.
[01:49:17.479 --> 01:49:19.060]  That's not fake, folks.
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:20.760]  What you see on screen is a TV viewer.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.641]  Look how plastic that looks.
[01:49:22.641 --> 01:49:25.602]  Look how artificial that looks, because it's not real.
[01:49:25.602 --> 01:49:29.083]  He's flesh and blood.
[01:49:29.083 --> 01:49:30.363]  But there's not a soul in there.
[01:49:39.349 --> 01:49:40.389]  Listen to some of these lines.
[01:49:40.389 --> 01:49:42.450]  Ultimately, however, the hope is that we won't just use computers
[01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:11.123]  Will become them.
[01:50:11.123 --> 01:50:16.946]  Today, cognitive scientists often compare the brain to hardware and the mind to software that runs it.
[01:50:16.946 --> 01:50:19.527]  But a software program is just information.
[01:50:19.527 --> 01:50:27.270]  And the principle there is no reason why information and consciousness has to be encoded in neurons.
[01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:34.474]  And they go on to say, you will see it and you will witness it and you will give up your consciousness.
[01:50:34.474 --> 01:50:36.415]  But that old body is destructive.
[01:50:37.822 --> 01:50:42.386]  And just be fair, you're not going to be able to keep the body and upload.
[01:50:42.386 --> 01:50:44.567]  Okay, alright.
[01:50:44.567 --> 01:50:51.432]  Don't be selfish.
[01:50:51.432 --> 01:50:57.757]  The pandemic is also exposing one of the biggest challenges that will emerge along with the transhumanism future.
[01:50:57.757 --> 01:51:02.681]  The new kinds of social inequity that will make the existing ones seem minor.
[01:51:02.681 --> 01:51:05.183]  During the months of lockdown, a sharp division emerged between people
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.482]  Just plug yourself in, give up that body, and let Mark Zuckerberg in.
[01:51:37.765 --> 01:51:40.529]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[01:51:40.529 --> 01:51:41.670]  My second cup of the day.
[01:51:41.670 --> 01:51:42.551]  It's really strong.
[01:51:42.551 --> 01:51:43.312]  I shouldn't do this.
[01:51:43.312 --> 01:51:46.476]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[01:51:47.964 --> 01:51:49.645]  Wake Up America Coffee there by Love's.
[01:51:49.645 --> 01:51:51.486]  Highest rated in the Chiapas Mountains.
[01:51:51.486 --> 01:51:53.727]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[01:51:53.727 --> 01:51:54.747]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[01:51:54.747 --> 01:51:57.288]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[01:51:57.288 --> 01:51:58.229]  Hand-selected.
[01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:59.169]  It's beyond organic.
[01:51:59.169 --> 01:52:00.030]  Wild-crafted.
[01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:01.531]  Wake Up America Coffee.
[01:52:01.531 --> 01:52:02.891]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[01:52:02.891 --> 01:52:07.293]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[01:52:07.293 --> 01:52:08.814]  Yes folks, we've been selling it 10 years.
[01:52:08.834 --> 01:52:09.314]  We're good to go.
[01:52:39.318 --> 01:52:40.979]  It's finally here.
[01:52:40.979 --> 01:52:45.083]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[01:53:41.642 --> 01:53:44.282]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:54:07.119 --> 01:54:09.600]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:16.963]  So there's a transhumanist globalist cult where the big robber barons, the royalty want to live forever.
[01:54:16.963 --> 01:54:31.329]  So they put unlimited money into building different scenarios and different systems to control populations and also then try to figure out how to upload their consciousnesses and not die.
[01:54:31.329 --> 01:54:33.710]  So they want control and they want everlasting life.
[01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:34.410]  They want to play God.
[01:54:35.916 --> 01:54:46.743]  That's common sense that you would expect elites to be like that, especially those that have rebelled against God and don't believe in God and are rebelling against the human system.
[01:54:46.743 --> 01:54:55.009]  So, you look at these articles out of NBC News and the London Guardian from a few years ago.
[01:54:55.009 --> 01:54:57.230]  They're called the Good Club and they want to save the world.
[01:54:57.230 --> 01:55:02.374]  Top billionaires hold secret meeting to discuss overpopulation, how to depopulate the third world.
[01:55:06.755 --> 01:55:11.761]  And there's a Leningradian article that Bill Gates wants to depopulate Africa.
[01:55:11.761 --> 01:55:17.066]  Pretty bold stuff, isn't it?
[01:55:17.066 --> 01:55:20.770]  So when you hear and you see all of this, it's really about depopulating.
[01:55:21.544 --> 01:55:48.969]  But they have to make the world ugly, they have to break it down, they have to tell you you're not essential, they have to electromagnetically poison you, they have to drug you, they have to hit you with biological agents through the GMO, until things are so bleak, and you're so alone, and you're so attached to your iPhone, and your VR goggles of the future, and your neural implants, that you finally say, I'm making the decision for the carbon footprint to lower it by 97%, I'm giving up my body!
[01:55:53.294 --> 01:56:07.422]  So the very atheist that told you over and over again, there is no God, you're just an animal, you're just a machine, but now Ray Kurzweil and Google say, we don't believe in God yet, but now we're making God, and now they're God.
[01:56:07.422 --> 01:56:12.525]  There is no God but Bill Gates and the universe and the world he's building.
[01:56:12.525 --> 01:56:21.491]  Now he skipped animal trials and it's come out that they're covering up the deaths and illnesses of his new
[01:56:23.018 --> 01:56:28.823]  mRNA vaccine that actually goes in and reprograms your cells themselves.
[01:56:28.823 --> 01:56:30.985]  That's what the article says in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:56:30.985 --> 01:56:34.648]  Oh, Big Tech's merging with Big Pharma.
[01:56:34.648 --> 01:56:35.009]  Yay!
[01:56:35.009 --> 01:56:37.291]  They haven't screwed us enough on both sides.
[01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:38.732]  A match made in hell.
[01:56:38.732 --> 01:56:48.160]  They're going to go in and they're going to take control of human development at your cellular level and they're going to save you from the COVID-19.
[01:56:49.454 --> 01:57:05.405]  Which is all based on people that died of other things, and based on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and you've got double the dead numbers in blue states because they're running scams, and Bill Gates' testing facility got shut down because it's a fraudulent test with false positives.
[01:57:05.405 --> 01:57:17.313]  So even though old remnants of the system that aren't perfect, but that aren't completely psychotic, are actually fighting Gates, and Google, and Facebook, and Twitter, and the Chi-Coms, and the EU, and Hollywood, and the devil worshippers.
[01:57:18.319 --> 01:57:26.284]  They're all just ignoring the law and doing whatever they want to overwhelm us and try to wear us out and break our will.
[01:57:26.284 --> 01:57:29.225]  So we acquiesce to their final takeover.
[01:57:29.225 --> 01:57:33.888]  But in the end, they'll get their world government.
[01:57:33.888 --> 01:57:37.150]  Large portions of the public will take brain chips.
[01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:41.593]  Most of the public will take the mark to mind cell.
[01:57:41.593 --> 01:57:45.215]  And then as soon as this AI system goes completely online, it's gonna start killing everybody.
[01:57:46.164 --> 01:57:49.990]  And folks are going to go, why is it killing everybody?
[01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:52.373]  And it's going to tell you, well, I'm doing it to save you.
[01:57:52.373 --> 01:57:54.136]  A bioweapon got released here.
[01:57:54.136 --> 01:57:55.217]  A war started there.
[01:57:55.217 --> 01:57:57.501]  But really, it's just systematically
[01:57:59.147 --> 01:58:11.141]  Killing the third world and others to then get what's left in the first world and to get the quote intelligentsia that hasn't signed on yet to get scared and run to it and say, okay, we'll turn full control over to you.
[01:58:11.141 --> 01:58:16.387]  Just save the planet because half of it's going to be on fire and the AI is going to say, give the bodies up.
[01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:19.329]  We're going to get you up in satellites off the planet.
[01:58:19.329 --> 01:58:20.790]  We meant to terraform another planet.
[01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:21.831]  We're going to lose the whole planet.
[01:58:21.831 --> 01:58:23.192]  You're going to see mushroom clouds.
[01:58:23.192 --> 01:58:24.713]  The moon's going to get blown up.
[01:58:24.713 --> 01:58:26.554]  And you're going to be like, I'm jacking in.
[01:58:26.554 --> 01:58:28.215]  Get me out of here.
[01:58:28.215 --> 01:58:28.735]  You're dead.
[01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:29.316]  You're uploaded.
[01:58:29.316 --> 01:58:30.156]  You're gone.
[01:58:30.156 --> 01:58:31.677]  You just signed on.
[01:58:31.677 --> 01:58:35.660]  They want the top people during the nuclear war to sign on and upload.
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:37.121]  That's their master plan.
[01:58:37.121 --> 01:58:40.683]  Because God always gives us a cheat sheet and a way out.
[01:58:40.683 --> 01:58:41.443]  InfoWars.
[01:58:41.443 --> 01:58:41.924]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.714 --> 01:58:55.096]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[01:58:55.096 --> 01:59:00.818]  Believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[01:59:00.818 --> 01:59:07.180]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, if there's a mass awakening,
[01:59:09.204 --> 01:59:14.806]  It can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[01:59:14.806 --> 01:59:19.867]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[01:59:19.867 --> 01:59:25.189]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:31.671]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain, or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[01:59:31.671 --> 01:59:35.032]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[01:59:36.468 --> 01:59:38.311]  Everything hinges on you.
[01:59:38.311 --> 01:59:39.252]  Everything.
[01:59:39.252 --> 01:59:43.197]  Peacefully become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[01:59:43.197 --> 01:59:43.657]  God bless.
[02:00:11.954 --> 02:00:14.121]  Alright, Reverend Childress, a black genocide.
[02:00:15.219 --> 02:00:16.220]  Great guy.
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:19.262]  He is taking care of a family member at the hospital.
[02:00:19.262 --> 02:00:20.363]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:00:20.363 --> 02:00:22.304]  Hopefully he'll be back with us on Thursday now.
[02:00:22.304 --> 02:00:23.365]  We're rescheduling him.
[02:00:23.365 --> 02:00:24.065]  Totally understand.
[02:00:24.065 --> 02:00:25.066]  He was apologizing.
[02:00:25.066 --> 02:00:25.886]  I'm like, you're at the hospital.
[02:00:25.886 --> 02:00:27.347]  Don't worry about it.
[02:00:27.347 --> 02:00:31.731]  So I'm still going to go to some of the clips that I was going to play when he joined us.
[02:00:31.731 --> 02:00:32.631]  And we'll do this too.
[02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:41.838]  We'll open the phones up for any item, any issue you want to discuss, where you think the campaign's going, where you think the globalists are going, the whole transhumanist movement, revelations beginning to be fulfilled.
[02:00:44.197 --> 02:00:50.003]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[02:00:50.003 --> 02:00:52.306]  First time callers, long time callers, you name it.
[02:00:52.306 --> 02:00:54.589]  We're taking your phone calls.
[02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:55.510]  But this is a report.
[02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:58.494]  I came up here and I shot yesterday.
[02:01:00.438 --> 02:01:03.860]  That is posted to Bandot Video and is also on Infowars.com.
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:10.845]  And it is so important that your friends, your family, your neighbors understand that COVID-19 is not just a hoax.
[02:01:10.845 --> 02:01:14.488]  It's a hoax to create global depression and a total lockdown of society.
[02:01:14.488 --> 02:01:25.956]  And now they're bringing in 2.0 of the hoax with law firms telling companies, you better get all your employees tested to cover yourself, knowing that almost everybody's false positive because the tests are a fraud on record.
[02:01:26.772 --> 02:01:33.357]  And then that creates hysteria, shutting the economy down even further, and creating massive litigation they're then going to feed off of.
[02:01:33.357 --> 02:01:40.542]  This is 21st century war, attacking us racially, culturally, and through the legal system that's taken the nation over.
[02:01:41.755 --> 02:01:47.240]  That's why you see these terrorists, like the governor of California, saying nobody's ever taken the mask off.
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.022]  Major cities passing laws that you'll have to wear a mask for at least another year.
[02:01:50.022 --> 02:01:59.010]  Now they're saying babies have got to wear them, even though there's 20 plus times less deaths than their own models, and those are based on people that died of other things.
[02:01:59.010 --> 02:02:05.075]  The death rate's down, the infected rate's way up, because the tests are everywhere.
[02:02:06.363 --> 02:02:08.204]  China says it's all over!
[02:02:08.204 --> 02:02:12.645]  A lot of story about we re-locked down part of a town, we had 10 new cases, 40 new cases.
[02:02:12.645 --> 02:02:16.447]  It's hysterical BS!
[02:02:16.447 --> 02:02:17.487]  On record!
[02:02:17.487 --> 02:02:24.510]  How many doctors, how many scientists, how many epidemiologists, how many top virologists have come out and said it's a hoax?
[02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:28.751]  And then they get 10 million views on YouTube and they get banned!
[02:02:28.751 --> 02:02:34.634]  Because you've got organized big tech fraud bringing all of this in.
[02:02:34.634 --> 02:02:35.514]  So here's the report.
[02:02:36.877 --> 02:02:40.359]  Again, posted to Band.Video.
[02:02:40.359 --> 02:02:44.822]  Lockdown 2, the COVID lockdown 2 is here.
[02:02:44.822 --> 02:02:48.084]  This video must be shared with everyone.
[02:02:48.084 --> 02:02:50.526]  Beware, the second COVID lockdown is here.
[02:02:50.526 --> 02:02:51.566]  That's the name of the video.
[02:02:51.566 --> 02:02:53.087]  Featured video, Band.Video.
[02:02:53.087 --> 02:02:54.288]  Share that link.
[02:02:54.288 --> 02:02:57.870]  Beware, the second COVID lockdown is here.
[02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:58.631]  Here is the report.
[02:03:01.411 --> 02:03:01.771]  I don't know.
[02:03:23.459 --> 02:03:31.344]  That are then lecturing us that we should be poor and shouldn't be able to go on a trip or have a swimming pool or have a car or air conditioning?
[02:03:31.344 --> 02:03:37.187]  Remember when Obama told Africans in Africa, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[02:03:37.187 --> 02:03:40.609]  That's what this is about is making slavery cool.
[02:03:40.609 --> 02:03:44.752]  And COVID-19 is the economic weapon that won't just make us poor.
[02:03:44.752 --> 02:03:47.894]  It's going to kill hundreds of millions of people in the long term.
[02:03:48.294 --> 02:03:52.156]  Now I'm going to get into the new lockdown measures that we always knew were coming.
[02:03:52.156 --> 02:03:54.136]  It's been pre-engineered in a moment.
[02:03:54.136 --> 02:04:00.159]  But first, let's just remember that it's on record that all these hospitals were completely empty.
[02:04:00.159 --> 02:04:04.861]  And that the hospital ships Trump sent, there was no patients for them.
[02:04:04.861 --> 02:04:10.223]  And let's remember that it's now come out that for any patient they claimed had COVID,
[02:04:10.583 --> 02:04:17.568]  They got over $52,000 and would put COVID on charts when the person didn't even have COVID.
[02:04:17.568 --> 02:04:25.253]  And that they would count people who died of heart attacks and cancer and pneumonia or the flu as COVID again to get the money.
[02:04:25.253 --> 02:04:33.278]  It's been engineered all over the world because the WHO, the UN, set the standards and the parameters.
[02:04:33.278 --> 02:04:40.263]  And then when all those medical doctors came out, prestigious scientists, the head former virologist at Rockefeller Hospital,
[02:04:41.163 --> 02:04:44.324]  Came out and said, this is a hoax, this is a fraud.
[02:04:44.324 --> 02:04:47.585]  They were banned off of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
[02:04:47.585 --> 02:04:52.667]  Because the system knows this hoax can't stand the light of day.
[02:04:52.667 --> 02:04:57.448]  And the virus, which is a real virus and a nasty pneumonia, can't stand the light of day.
[02:04:57.448 --> 02:05:00.889]  That's why they're trying to keep you locked in to these compact cities.
[02:05:00.889 --> 02:05:06.271]  And that's why it spread the most and killed the most people in blue cities and blue states.
[02:05:06.271 --> 02:05:09.152]  That are these urban canyons where people don't get sunlight.
[02:05:09.432 --> 02:05:14.816]  Blue states, blue cities are making similar announcements saying, hey, you got to wear masks for the next year.
[02:05:14.816 --> 02:05:16.838]  You can never take your mask off.
[02:05:16.838 --> 02:05:29.087]  This is all about creating fear and testing obedience and control over the population to wreck the economy and bring in a planetary government based on medical tyranny.
[02:05:29.087 --> 02:05:30.027]  There's still time.
[02:05:30.808 --> 02:05:32.929]  to stop this operation.
[02:05:32.929 --> 02:05:34.470]  They've been planning this for decades.
[02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:37.952]  The Rockefeller Foundation admits on record with Bill and Melinda Gates.
[02:05:37.952 --> 02:05:39.713]  We have their battle plans.
[02:05:39.713 --> 02:05:43.375]  And if the public simply speaks out and exposes it, it will fail.
[02:05:43.375 --> 02:05:48.798]  That's why they brought in total censorship ahead of this and during this to shut down debate.
[02:05:48.798 --> 02:05:51.200]  But if we get the information to members of the Senate
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:54.201]  And to good governors like Governor Abbott.
[02:05:54.201 --> 02:06:00.365]  And if you hit the streets and demonstrate and don't let the left intimidate you from exercising your First Amendment, we're going to win.
[02:06:00.365 --> 02:06:04.127]  The globalists know that conservatives on average are very compliant.
[02:06:04.127 --> 02:06:05.668]  We believe it helps America.
[02:06:05.668 --> 02:06:08.990]  And so they're telling us that we have to stay indoors or we're bad.
[02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:14.494]  But the leftist and the anti-fun, the Black Lives Matter, they're heroes when they go out and protest.
[02:06:15.134 --> 02:06:26.240]  This is all a form of martial law to make the American people stand down ahead of this election with election fraud being prepared to artificially, fraudulently remove President Trump.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:32.464]  We can stop it if we simply do the research, face the facts, and take action and say no.
[02:06:32.464 --> 02:06:34.905]  COVID-19 is a hoax.
[02:06:34.905 --> 02:06:37.526]  It's not killing anyone but old people.
[02:06:37.526 --> 02:06:42.029]  That's why they sent people that had it to the old folks' homes to get the numbers up.
[02:06:42.569 --> 02:06:45.431]  Instead of bowing down to the politicians that follow U.N.
[02:06:45.431 --> 02:06:53.577]  orders, these governors that ordered people into nursing homes to get the death numbers up should be indicted, tried, and imprisoned.
[02:06:53.577 --> 02:06:56.720]  We either go on the offense, or we're totally enslaved.
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:59.382]  It really is up to all of us now what we're going to do.
[02:07:00.325 --> 02:07:01.986]  It's finally here.
[02:07:01.986 --> 02:07:06.090]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[02:08:06.411 --> 02:08:13.356]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:08:13.356 --> 02:08:15.938]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:08:15.938 --> 02:08:21.462]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.462 --> 02:08:21.523]  877-789-2539.
[02:08:21.523 --> 02:08:21.623]  877-789-2539.
[02:08:21.623 --> 02:08:24.865]  Your phone calls are coming up on any subject you want to cover.
[02:08:34.062 --> 02:08:35.103]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:35.103 --> 02:08:38.765]  America's democratic unraveling.
[02:08:38.765 --> 02:08:42.226]  Countries fall the same way businesses do, gradually and then suddenly.
[02:08:42.226 --> 02:08:50.070]  This was put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the same group calling for the Chinese century, the same group saying the dollar should plunge.
[02:08:50.070 --> 02:08:56.354]  And in this article, they call for the President of the United States to be removed by the U.S.
[02:08:56.354 --> 02:08:59.055]  military.
[02:08:59.055 --> 02:09:02.057]  They say he's causing the unrest when they're the ones openly running it.
[02:09:03.127 --> 02:09:03.287]  Yes.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.023]  Facebook, Google, and all of them are dominant, but they're not dominant over you.
[02:09:21.023 --> 02:09:27.147]  Whether you live in Africa, or whether you live in North America, or Europe, or South America, or the North frickin' Pole!
[02:09:27.147 --> 02:09:33.592]  You get excited about truth, you spread the word, you speak up, NOTHING ON EARTH CAN STOP YA!
[02:09:33.592 --> 02:09:36.093]  They're openly declaring a post-human world!
[02:09:36.934 --> 02:09:41.036]  While teaching us all to fight with each other over what color our skin is!
[02:09:41.036 --> 02:09:44.878]  These people are sinister, and they're villains, and they need to be stopped!
[02:09:44.878 --> 02:09:48.280]  I told you this five months ago, and now it's official.
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.521]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and is permanent.
[02:09:51.521 --> 02:10:05.548]  The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control hoax knew that once they got the public for several months to wear masks and social distance, they would be able to permanently turn it on and off anytime they want by putting handcuffs on someone.
[02:10:05.828 --> 02:10:14.860]  And then add new demands that people take forced inoculations, that they have contact tracing on their phones, and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:21.930]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government, forced inoculation, and complete enslavement of the human population.
[02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:24.051]  This is medical tyranny.
[02:10:24.051 --> 02:10:25.952]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates U.N.
[02:10:25.952 --> 02:10:26.852]  takeover.
[02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:30.014]  This is the end of civilization as you know it.
[02:10:30.014 --> 02:10:33.155]  Living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[02:10:33.155 --> 02:10:36.697]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[02:10:36.697 --> 02:10:38.818]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[02:10:38.818 --> 02:10:39.798]  Show them the numbers.
[02:10:39.798 --> 02:10:40.838]  Show them the facts.
[02:10:40.838 --> 02:10:43.980]  And explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:47.392]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:10:47.392 --> 02:10:47.872]  You're on the air.
[02:10:47.872 --> 02:10:48.433]  Thanks for holding.
[02:10:48.433 --> 02:10:49.495]  Can you hear me?
[02:10:49.495 --> 02:10:50.116]  I sure can, sir.
[02:10:50.116 --> 02:10:50.456]  Thank you.
[02:10:50.456 --> 02:10:51.237]  Hey, Alex.
[02:10:51.237 --> 02:10:57.447]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[02:10:57.447 --> 02:10:58.929]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:10:58.929 --> 02:11:00.791]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and...
[02:11:01.432 --> 02:11:02.892]  I just want to plug in.
[02:11:02.892 --> 02:11:07.313]  I'm a truck driver and 2x4s have changed the way I drive.
[02:11:07.313 --> 02:11:13.935]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:11:13.935 --> 02:11:21.717]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[02:11:21.857 --> 02:11:22.697]  Thank you for that, man.
[02:11:22.697 --> 02:11:28.340]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.641]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:11:30.641 --> 02:11:33.102]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[02:11:33.102 --> 02:11:35.783]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:11:35.783 --> 02:11:39.805]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:11:39.805 --> 02:11:41.606]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[02:11:41.606 --> 02:11:42.346]  So that means a lot to me.
[02:11:42.346 --> 02:11:42.686]  Thank you.
[02:11:42.686 --> 02:11:47.889]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:11:47.889 --> 02:11:50.510]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:58.141 --> 02:12:03.030]  I hear people talking bad about
[02:12:09.432 --> 02:12:14.535]  Well, they talk about exterminating all humans.
[02:12:14.535 --> 02:12:17.357]  Well, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[02:12:34.022 --> 02:12:41.508]  Bunch of creepy, weirdo, alien-looking tech leaders, signed on to some evil stuff.
[02:12:41.508 --> 02:12:48.573]  Yeah, there's stuff bigger than you in this universe, and you're gonna get smashed, flattered, and pancaked, so you just keep playing God all day long.
[02:12:48.573 --> 02:12:49.974]  Things aren't gonna go the way you want.
[02:12:49.974 --> 02:12:54.697]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:12:54.697 --> 02:12:57.599]  There's so much new stuff I want to get to, but I want to go to your calls.
[02:12:57.599 --> 02:13:02.123]  Shock video shows white girl being beaten by black women, forced to kiss feet.
[02:13:03.976 --> 02:13:11.300]  So all of this, uh, get down on your knees, get down on your belly stuff, is going into violence now.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.841]  We'll play that video for you.
[02:13:13.841 --> 02:13:15.361]  Hell, let's just play it with audio right now.
[02:13:15.361 --> 02:13:16.602]  Let's go ahead and show this right now.
[02:13:16.602 --> 02:13:18.183]  Go ahead.
[02:13:18.183 --> 02:13:23.685]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation if you... Oh my God!
[02:13:23.685 --> 02:13:25.706]  What do I do, man?
[02:13:25.706 --> 02:13:27.307]  What do I do, man?
[02:13:27.307 --> 02:13:29.208]  What do I kill, man?
[02:13:29.208 --> 02:13:30.629]  What do I lend?
[02:13:31.465 --> 02:13:32.186]  Look, it's not worth it, you know?
[02:13:32.186 --> 02:13:33.267]  Tell her you'll never mess with me again.
[02:13:33.267 --> 02:13:34.068]  I'll never mess with you again.
[02:13:34.068 --> 02:13:35.129]  I've messed with Maria, I've never done that.
[02:13:35.129 --> 02:13:36.210]  Not even with your mother, you know?
[02:13:36.210 --> 02:13:36.570]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:37.331]  She's my sister, you know?
[02:13:37.331 --> 02:13:38.292]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:38.292 --> 02:13:39.052]  She's my sister, you know?
[02:13:39.052 --> 02:13:39.613]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:39.613 --> 02:13:40.073]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:40.073 --> 02:13:40.514]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:40.514 --> 02:13:41.134]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:41.134 --> 02:13:41.715]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:41.715 --> 02:13:42.435]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:42.435 --> 02:13:42.776]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:42.776 --> 02:13:43.096]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:43.096 --> 02:13:43.396]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:43.396 --> 02:13:43.877]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:43.877 --> 02:13:44.177]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:44.177 --> 02:13:45.919]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:45.919 --> 02:13:47.160]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:47.620]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:48.061]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:48.061 --> 02:13:48.481]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:48.481 --> 02:13:48.982]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:48.982 --> 02:13:49.442]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:49.442 --> 02:13:50.363]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:50.363 --> 02:13:51.724]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:51.724 --> 02:13:52.285]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:52.285 --> 02:13:52.785]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:52.785 --> 02:13:53.166]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:53.166 --> 02:13:53.606]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:53.606 --> 02:13:54.747]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:54.747 --> 02:13:55.187]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:55.187 --> 02:13:55.508]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:55.508 --> 02:13:56.088]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:56.088 --> 02:13:56.469]  Carol, you know?
[02:13:56.469 --> 02:13:56.729]  Carol, you
[02:13:57.694 --> 02:14:04.697]  That's kind of like those lesbians that cut their nine-year-old son's penis off because he didn't want to be a girl.
[02:14:04.697 --> 02:14:06.998]  He complained about it so they stabbed him to death.
[02:14:06.998 --> 02:14:08.759]  The left said he deserved to die.
[02:14:24.193 --> 02:14:25.154]  Let's continue here.
[02:14:25.154 --> 02:14:25.915]  They're nice people.
[02:14:25.915 --> 02:14:28.979]  Chinese warplanes advance on Taiwan as tensions soar.
[02:14:28.979 --> 02:14:30.902]  They're threatening to invade.
[02:14:30.902 --> 02:14:34.447]  Meanwhile, China and India are on the verge of war.
[02:14:41.169 --> 02:14:44.290]  There's another article that curing COVID-19 hoax won't fix the economy.
[02:14:44.290 --> 02:14:48.332]  No, it's already been deep sex, but they want it to be even worse.
[02:14:48.332 --> 02:14:54.434]  And they're going to tell you COVID-19 did it when the big mega banks did it to strangle and get control of this nation and the world.
[02:14:54.434 --> 02:14:56.675]  Carlos is a longtime caller, always informative.
[02:14:56.675 --> 02:15:05.998]  We're going to go to Al Killer, James, Shannon, Paul, Jared, Lauren, Ryan, Jason.
[02:15:05.998 --> 02:15:07.659]  Let's go to Carlos first from Canada.
[02:15:07.659 --> 02:15:09.620]  Carlos, the good and the bad on Trump.
[02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:10.480]  What do you think is really happening?
[02:15:11.482 --> 02:15:12.843]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:15:12.843 --> 02:15:22.231]  It's almost been four years now, and I think it's time that we examine the candidates that are going to becoming President of the United States.
[02:15:22.231 --> 02:15:29.918]  Now, a re-election of President Trump is pretty well, it begins to concern some people.
[02:15:29.918 --> 02:15:38.626]  There's a cognitive dissonance, and it's a little bit of the attitude in that when, let's say, compare United States with North Korea.
[02:15:39.332 --> 02:15:44.537]  They have a problem because somebody's throwing pamphlets and they're trying to undermine the regime.
[02:15:44.537 --> 02:15:46.298]  They're obviously extreme, okay?
[02:15:46.298 --> 02:15:48.840]  They're an extreme example of communism.
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:53.945]  But, look, they take action right off the bat, and they make the point.
[02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:56.467]  Now, you want to go further with your little brochures?
[02:15:56.467 --> 02:15:58.088]  Okay, we're ready for anything.
[02:15:58.088 --> 02:16:01.611]  And, believe me, it will stop, okay?
[02:16:01.611 --> 02:16:06.916]  When you do not do things that you should as a leader of a country, of a nation,
[02:16:07.483 --> 02:16:08.944]  And you personalize it.
[02:16:08.944 --> 02:16:13.167]  Because now, if you have to call on the military, or you have to call on the heavy-handed behavior,
[02:16:35.430 --> 02:16:42.875]  You're going to be criticized first for being a dictator, and second, you're going to personalize the problem and turn it into a victory if you succeed.
[02:16:42.875 --> 02:16:45.717]  Gee, aren't you tired of winning?
[02:16:45.717 --> 02:16:46.217]  Okay?
[02:16:46.217 --> 02:16:47.818]  Well, sorry, Mr. President.
[02:16:48.191 --> 02:16:53.454]  There are a few things that in the last four years you could have done but did not.
[02:16:53.454 --> 02:16:57.756]  I think Trump knows he's in trouble now because of the fraud, the censorship.
[02:16:57.756 --> 02:16:59.437]  I think he knows Parscale's full of crap.
[02:16:59.437 --> 02:17:02.039]  He doesn't need voters and internet free speech.
[02:17:02.039 --> 02:17:06.481]  I think the arrogance is draining out of the administration with 133 days left.
[02:17:06.481 --> 02:17:07.362]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:17:08.484 --> 02:17:25.578]  Well, I think he should, first of all, sit in the Oval Office, look ahead at the President of the United States, called George Washington, in front of him, and look left and right, as he used to have Jackson on the left, and he used to have Jefferson on the right, now he has Lincoln.
[02:17:25.578 --> 02:17:30.202]  He should look at those three paintings, get some black cloth, and put it on top of it.
[02:17:30.202 --> 02:17:30.783]  Okay?
[02:17:30.783 --> 02:17:31.563]  Cover them.
[02:17:31.563 --> 02:17:35.727]  Because frankly, something happened, I called your show, I told you, listen,
[02:17:36.215 --> 02:17:42.940]  This business of trillions of dollars borrowing from the Federal Reserve, there's interest being charged on that.
[02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:46.462]  Last year was 550 billion dollars.
[02:17:46.462 --> 02:17:54.227]  That same day, a fellow by the name of Rubini wrote an article saying, oh, President Trump is nationalizing the Federal Reserve.
[02:17:54.227 --> 02:17:59.431]  No, that's the biggest lie since the Federal Reserve being an agency of the United States.
[02:17:59.431 --> 02:18:01.873]  You're saying the Federal Reserve is fully absorbing what's left of America?
[02:18:02.793 --> 02:18:12.562]  What I'm saying to you is that the people that are behind all of this, all of this, are being paid money by American taxpayers who are using that money.
[02:18:13.035 --> 02:18:18.681]  Because you see, international lenders need to have countries in trouble so they borrow.
[02:18:18.681 --> 02:18:19.362]  Well, that's it.
[02:18:19.362 --> 02:18:21.604]  People think all this money's free.
[02:18:21.604 --> 02:18:24.107]  And during the first part of the crisis, I'm like, I see why Trump's doing it.
[02:18:24.107 --> 02:18:26.990]  But now, the left says, oh, we never open up again.
[02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:28.712]  That's in front of the New York Times.
[02:18:28.712 --> 02:18:31.354]  But we need stimulus twice as big.
[02:18:31.354 --> 02:18:34.237]  And so absolutely, they do that, we're completely done.
[02:18:34.237 --> 02:18:35.038]  You're absolutely right.
[02:18:35.038 --> 02:18:36.480]  We have been maneuvered into collapse.
[02:18:37.793 --> 02:18:40.075]  And the average leftist has no idea what they've done.
[02:18:40.075 --> 02:18:41.316]  They are just complete idiots.
[02:18:41.316 --> 02:18:42.197]  God bless you.
[02:18:42.197 --> 02:18:43.518]  Carlos, good points.
[02:18:43.518 --> 02:18:47.161]  Owl Killer, Active Duty, wants to talk about what's really happening.
[02:18:47.161 --> 02:18:50.024]  You're on the air.
[02:18:50.024 --> 02:18:51.705]  Alex, Owl Killer.
[02:18:51.705 --> 02:18:53.106]  Alright, thank you for having me back on.
[02:18:53.106 --> 02:18:58.271]  What I'm going to say is the most important things that I have ever said on your show in the past.
[02:18:58.271 --> 02:19:00.213]  I want you to understand.
[02:19:00.213 --> 02:19:03.436]  You had the G. Edward Griffin clip on.
[02:19:03.436 --> 02:19:04.937]  You remember that Yuri Bezmenov
[02:19:05.498 --> 02:19:11.880]  Interview that he had in 1985 when he said that we were done then because of the demoralization.
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:13.501]  We're three generations into that.
[02:19:13.501 --> 02:19:23.724]  The half-baked intellectuals that are running every facet of society, the media, the government, the educators, the Hollywood, the music, everything.
[02:19:23.724 --> 02:19:25.885]  They cannot be reasoned with.
[02:19:25.885 --> 02:19:28.485]  What he said is that they're contaminated and they cannot be helped.
[02:19:28.485 --> 02:19:29.826]  When you were on TI's show,
[02:19:31.132 --> 02:19:39.135]  He can't even understand that President Trump is being targeted by the same COINTELPRO and the same type of operations that went after the black leadership.
[02:19:39.135 --> 02:19:41.596]  He cannot even comprehend that.
[02:19:41.596 --> 02:19:57.882]  Because he watches the news and thinks like black people are finally being recognized and he's a victim and oh it's so sad and the numbers don't even matter to him about what's really going on because again he thinks by going with mainstream media he's going with the winning team when all he's doing is destroying himself.
[02:20:00.999 --> 02:20:02.120]  I think they telegraphed.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:07.724]  You were right with Biden talking about how they were going to have the military try and remove President Trump.
[02:20:07.724 --> 02:20:11.407]  I think what they were trying to do is just what happened in Ukraine.
[02:20:11.407 --> 02:20:18.532]  Cause a conflict and then have the military refuse to follow his orders and then basically depose him.
[02:20:18.532 --> 02:20:22.035]  You don't have a new election, you have a new government that comes in and replaces it.
[02:20:22.035 --> 02:20:26.318]  And the Democrats don't care whether it's deposed or they inherit the martial law situation.
[02:20:27.114 --> 02:20:32.755]  And it's even better that Biden's got cognitive decline because, oh, he's got to go because he's too old.
[02:20:32.755 --> 02:20:33.195]  Stay there.
[02:20:33.195 --> 02:20:33.815]  Finish up your point.
[02:20:33.815 --> 02:20:35.076]  I'll kill her back in just a few minutes.
[02:20:35.076 --> 02:20:36.636]  We're going to go to everybody on hold.
[02:20:36.636 --> 02:20:37.956]  Adam Gerald Celente taking over.
[02:20:37.956 --> 02:20:40.297]  Then the war room with Owen Schroer in.
[02:20:40.297 --> 02:20:41.597]  Who knows how long we'll be on air?
[02:20:41.597 --> 02:20:43.497]  I don't say that to be dramatic.
[02:20:43.497 --> 02:20:51.679]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:20:52.967 --> 02:20:57.710]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:20:57.710 --> 02:21:00.071]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:21:00.071 --> 02:21:08.916]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:21:08.916 --> 02:21:19.763]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:21:20.063 --> 02:21:20.743]  Yes.
[02:21:20.743 --> 02:21:25.665]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:21:25.665 --> 02:21:32.486]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:21:32.486 --> 02:21:33.647]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:33.647 --> 02:21:35.487]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:21:35.487 --> 02:21:38.308]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:21:38.308 --> 02:21:38.728]  Super!
[02:21:42.732 --> 02:21:54.745]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die if we did not do exactly as they said.
[02:21:54.745 --> 02:21:56.347]  And it turned out it was all fraud.
[02:21:56.867 --> 02:22:03.811]  Models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[02:22:03.811 --> 02:22:09.494]  But none of them are getting sued, none of them are getting prosecuted, none of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates.
[02:22:09.494 --> 02:22:15.617]  The FDA shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[02:22:15.617 --> 02:22:16.358]  And despite that,
[02:22:16.778 --> 02:22:26.327]  They're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the number's spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's fault.
[02:22:26.327 --> 02:22:31.932]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city, we've had a lockdown again, everything's over.
[02:22:31.932 --> 02:22:35.776]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[02:22:35.776 --> 02:22:39.799]  Either we expose the COVID hoax, or we're all permanently enslaved by it.
[02:22:39.799 --> 02:22:40.340]  Your choice.
[02:22:43.933 --> 02:22:56.781]  We're already in the latter part of June, and of course most of the country's not completely reopened again, and already Fauci and the UN Bill of Melinda Gates criminal combine are telling us, don't go to Trump rallies.
[02:22:56.781 --> 02:22:57.642]  Oh no.
[02:22:57.642 --> 02:23:08.889]  But the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go to the Democrat Party, Black Lives Matter, all white people are evil, mind control, brainwashing events.
[02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:13.232]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[02:23:13.232 --> 02:23:22.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have, because we are going into hardcore United Nations-controlled bondage.
[02:23:22.878 --> 02:23:32.765]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are announcing they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist organizers.
[02:23:32.765 --> 02:23:34.246]  This is just the beginning.
[02:23:34.246 --> 02:23:37.328]  Everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[02:23:37.328 --> 02:23:38.529]  So, it's here.
[02:23:38.529 --> 02:23:39.129]  No more games.
[02:23:39.229 --> 02:23:45.613]  The New World Order has arrived.
[02:23:45.613 --> 02:23:57.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:59.441]  Alright, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:23:59.441 --> 02:24:01.582]  We'll be right back to your phone calls.
[02:24:01.582 --> 02:24:08.306]  We upgraded the servers and got, what, five times the bandwidth a few weeks ago for Band.Video.
[02:24:10.103 --> 02:24:14.530]  We are getting massive more traffic than that.
[02:24:14.530 --> 02:24:20.039]  We're getting 19,000 people a second and it's not a denial of service attack.
[02:24:21.206 --> 02:24:22.967]  People are really waking up that Trump's in trouble.
[02:24:22.967 --> 02:24:27.390]  They're really waking up when the front page of the Wall Street Journal says all humans will be gotten rid of.
[02:24:27.390 --> 02:24:29.532]  You will upload the machine very soon.
[02:24:29.532 --> 02:24:30.192]  Get used to it.
[02:24:30.192 --> 02:24:32.414]  You're not leaving your house.
[02:24:32.414 --> 02:24:34.895]  People are just finally getting that this is not a game.
[02:24:34.895 --> 02:24:40.459]  And you're kicking ass, listeners and viewers, as the hardcore group that are telling people about this.
[02:24:40.459 --> 02:24:42.861]  And people are hungry for the truth.
[02:24:42.861 --> 02:24:43.782]  Let me give you some good news.
[02:24:44.781 --> 02:24:54.363]  I was on the coast, you know, at the Gulf of Mexico for six days with some of my children and my wife.
[02:24:54.363 --> 02:25:01.644]  And some of my children were with my ex-wife.
[02:25:01.644 --> 02:25:05.825]  And most people didn't know who I was.
[02:25:05.825 --> 02:25:07.605]  Maybe 30% did.
[02:25:07.605 --> 02:25:11.286]  But almost everyone else, I'd be at the bar picking up food to take to the room.
[02:25:12.310 --> 02:25:16.236]  And they'd be like, Bill Gates launched this attack, it's all a hoax, blah, blah, blah.
[02:25:16.236 --> 02:25:19.622]  The next person, yeah, that guy ought to be put in prison!
[02:25:19.622 --> 02:25:24.049]  I'd be on the elevator, I'd be at the beach, I'd be out in the water and people are talking crap about the New World Order.
[02:25:27.563 --> 02:25:36.031]  And you know, it almost makes me want to endorse the Q thing, because that's just kind of how the general public finally got into this, and it's nebulous, and it's not really political.
[02:25:36.031 --> 02:25:46.920]  Because a lot of them were talking about Q, and they were saying a lot of stuff that was true, so I'm kind of like, even if some of the people posting as Q are bad, I was hearing a lot of Q stuff.
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:50.323]  I mean, it's whatever.
[02:25:50.323 --> 02:25:54.487]  I just get mad by some of the Q people when they say stuff about me that's not true, you know.
[02:25:55.998 --> 02:25:57.099]  But whatever, I don't care.
[02:25:57.099 --> 02:25:58.059]  I just want to beat the Globalist.
[02:25:58.059 --> 02:26:07.664]  And so, maybe I should have a whole symposium on the show about Q. And really openly try to get to whether it's positive or negative.
[02:26:07.664 --> 02:26:14.227]  But I mean, I think it's positive if people were rampantly talking about the New World Order.
[02:26:14.227 --> 02:26:18.209]  And like, yeah, there's this guy snuck in a thing called Bohemian Grove.
[02:26:18.209 --> 02:26:22.050]  That's where they compromise them and they use the kids to blackmail everybody.
[02:26:22.050 --> 02:26:22.791]  And I'd be sitting there.
[02:26:24.778 --> 02:26:27.339]  At like a golf cart rental place, listening to people talk about it.
[02:26:27.339 --> 02:26:28.760]  I'd go, really?
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:29.720]  What's that guy's name?
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:30.240]  I don't know.
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:33.702]  I think he's some guy from Texas.
[02:26:33.702 --> 02:26:34.502]  This actually happened.
[02:26:34.502 --> 02:26:41.385]  I go, you don't, you don't know who he is though.
[02:26:41.385 --> 02:26:44.126]  And then I ran into this former high level DynCorp guy.
[02:26:44.126 --> 02:26:46.707]  Cause I looked up who he said he was and it was him.
[02:26:46.707 --> 02:26:48.188]  Like one of the directors of DynCorp.
[02:26:48.188 --> 02:26:50.769]  And he was like talking about the government, the child molesters and
[02:26:52.287 --> 02:26:54.769]  He didn't even know who I was until he clicked.
[02:26:54.769 --> 02:26:57.411]  He went, wait, Alex Jones?
[02:26:57.411 --> 02:26:58.872]  So it was insane.
[02:26:58.872 --> 02:27:02.194]  It was insane in the membrane.
[02:27:02.194 --> 02:27:03.275]  I'm gonna go to your calls now.
[02:27:03.275 --> 02:27:12.502]  It's just that I think they jumped the shark with this COVID thing because it's really made people burrow into what's going on.
[02:27:15.538 --> 02:27:19.140]  Because almost everybody I talk to is like, I think this COVID thing's a hoax.
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:20.421]  I'd say, I notice you're not wearing your mask.
[02:27:20.421 --> 02:27:21.522]  That's good.
[02:27:21.522 --> 02:27:21.862]  Yeah.
[02:27:21.862 --> 02:27:24.163]  You know, they're using all the regular data from other stuff.
[02:27:24.163 --> 02:27:26.665]  They put it in that column and notice it's only a hundred thousand.
[02:27:26.665 --> 02:27:28.246]  They said it'd be 20 something million.
[02:27:28.246 --> 02:27:32.668]  I'm like, or two, two plus million.
[02:27:32.668 --> 02:27:34.149]  And I'm just like, yeah, I've heard them before.
[02:27:34.149 --> 02:27:35.690]  No.
[02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:40.073]  And that was such a good feeling to know that
[02:27:41.859 --> 02:27:47.539]  The listeners of this broadcast have done such a great job and everybody else has just out there that the New World Order is in trouble.
[02:27:48.573 --> 02:27:50.134]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[02:27:50.134 --> 02:27:51.955]  Alright, Al Killer, finish up your point.
[02:27:51.955 --> 02:27:55.177]  I've got the CFR calling for Trump to be overthrown right here.
[02:27:55.177 --> 02:27:57.258]  America's democratic unraveling.
[02:27:57.258 --> 02:28:04.101]  Saying America's falling and it's all Trump's fault when they're the ones that said, bring down the economy and punish the Americans and Trump.
[02:28:04.101 --> 02:28:05.782]  They're the guilty parties.
[02:28:05.782 --> 02:28:09.784]  And I think it's so critical to expose they're the authors of this whole damn thing.
[02:28:09.784 --> 02:28:11.365]  COVID-19 didn't do this.
[02:28:11.365 --> 02:28:16.128]  The hysteria they set off on purpose is what did it and they are to blame.
[02:28:19.139 --> 02:28:20.299]  Alex, am I back on?
[02:28:20.299 --> 02:28:21.199]  You are, Al Killer.
[02:28:21.199 --> 02:28:21.840]  Go ahead.
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:23.360]  Alright, listen to me.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:27.081]  This is very, very important.
[02:28:27.081 --> 02:28:36.182]  What they're doing... Go look at the letter from the Archbishop that Trump retweeted with talking about the globalist Masada conspiracy.
[02:28:36.182 --> 02:28:38.323]  I'm a Freemason myself.
[02:28:38.323 --> 02:28:40.463]  There are good and there are bad.
[02:28:40.463 --> 02:28:41.724]  Understand that.
[02:28:41.724 --> 02:28:47.405]  He retweeted it and he asked every American to retweet it, religious or not.
[02:28:47.405 --> 02:28:48.885]  You better understand something.
[02:28:49.249 --> 02:28:58.458]  President Trump is the only president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to call out the military-industrial complex, and he said the place went crazy.
[02:28:58.458 --> 02:29:03.142]  He's asking for your help, American people.
[02:29:03.142 --> 02:29:06.505]  He's a proud person that can't say, hey, I'm powerless.
[02:29:06.505 --> 02:29:08.727]  Look what they are trying to do to him.
[02:29:08.727 --> 02:29:13.432]  All these generals that have no problem with endless wars, but they don't want to restore the constitutional
[02:29:14.171 --> 02:29:18.133]  Oh, they're like, oh yeah, Trump may want to be a dictator.
[02:29:18.133 --> 02:29:20.954]  We may not have to get him when he's the only one pulling us out of the wars.
[02:29:20.954 --> 02:29:22.175]  No, I love Trump.
[02:29:22.175 --> 02:29:31.580]  Trump's totally for real, but he already knew Bolton, so he let Bolton in, and then Bolton stabbed him in the back with a bunch of lies.
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:33.741]  It's just disgusting.
[02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:35.622]  So what's your bottom line here?
[02:29:36.764 --> 02:29:44.951]  We just need to pray for Trump, pray for America, pray for the world, and we all need to get very active and very loud and very aggressive.
[02:29:44.951 --> 02:29:46.832]  Here's my bottom line.
[02:29:46.832 --> 02:29:56.721]  Michael Schreier, the head of the CIA Bin Laden unit, said that what Trump is facing is 10 times the magnitude that President Lincoln ever faced.
[02:29:56.721 --> 02:30:01.945]  Just from the immigration policy itself, they operate as their own separate entities, their own states.
[02:30:02.441 --> 02:30:07.946]  The Constitution says that we will guarantee a Republican form of government in every state.
[02:30:07.946 --> 02:30:12.830]  If they're in violation of that, unfortunately, and I do not want to see any bloodshed at all.
[02:30:14.503 --> 02:30:19.628]  Governors and mayors and college endowments, they're going to all have to be seized.
[02:30:19.628 --> 02:30:20.649]  Everything's going to have to be seized.
[02:30:20.649 --> 02:30:26.474]  Oh, you're right, because they've all signed on to the CHICOMS and it's an alien outside group that says they want to destroy America.
[02:30:26.474 --> 02:30:29.697]  The creed of Democrats is, destroy the country.
[02:30:29.697 --> 02:30:33.480]  And they destroy every city they have on purpose to bring down the rest of the country.
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:34.682]  And that's the reason
[02:30:36.109 --> 02:30:41.690]  We are facing attack and people better really grow up to that point and just realize this is it, folks.
[02:30:41.690 --> 02:30:42.730]  This isn't a game.
[02:30:42.730 --> 02:30:44.071]  It's not a joke.
[02:30:44.071 --> 02:30:47.772]  And I know for a fact that that U.S.
[02:30:47.772 --> 02:31:00.414]  Attorney Bergman that they removed is persecuting hundreds of prominent Trump supporters with endless grand juries and harassment and just huge armies of Democrat Party operatives who are communist.
[02:31:00.414 --> 02:31:02.875]  I mean, they have just almost taken the whole country over, folks.
[02:31:05.860 --> 02:31:06.620]  It's just insane.
[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.782]  I appreciate your call.
[02:31:08.782 --> 02:31:11.203]  And now they're out in front of Mitch McConnell, threatening to kill him again.
[02:31:11.203 --> 02:31:15.525]  We gonna kill you, evil turtle!
[02:31:15.525 --> 02:31:21.288]  And it's just a bunch of Antifa trash showing up at his little Kentucky house, threatening him.
[02:31:21.288 --> 02:31:22.848]  I mean, it's just total idiocy.
[02:31:22.848 --> 02:31:24.929]  A bunch of people that want war.
[02:31:24.929 --> 02:31:26.450]  Trying to push us into a war.
[02:31:26.450 --> 02:31:27.791]  Jumping in front of people's cars.
[02:31:29.259 --> 02:31:34.882]  Alex, I'll stand shoulder to shoulder with you anytime we go to the Pentagon or Antifa.
[02:31:34.882 --> 02:31:42.246]  Okay, I was going to say, you know, it's not so much Trump's inaction, I think, it's just who he surrounds himself with.
[02:31:58.083 --> 02:32:01.124]  He picked some of the worst people to surround himself with.
[02:32:01.124 --> 02:32:11.708]  It's like he's the Walmart executive going and hiring people from a convenience store and bringing them in and they're still working for the convenience store, drawing a check from them, trying to sabotage Walmart.
[02:32:11.708 --> 02:32:13.628]  You know, it's just, I don't understand the picks.
[02:32:13.628 --> 02:32:17.890]  Well, you gotta know, DC is about being slimy and going along to get along.
[02:32:17.890 --> 02:32:21.691]  So he's trying to pull from sand, trying to build a rock house.
[02:32:21.691 --> 02:32:24.252]  It just, it isn't there.
[02:32:24.252 --> 02:32:27.633]  Well, then he, then he took Rice's executive orders and, and, uh,
[02:32:28.177 --> 02:32:29.999]  He has no action with it.
[02:32:29.999 --> 02:32:31.100]  I mean... Well, here's the thing.
[02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:37.627]  He signs the executive order, but no one takes action because the bureaucracy are a bunch of trash.
[02:32:37.627 --> 02:32:39.468]  But he needs to come out and tell everyone.
[02:32:39.468 --> 02:32:40.850]  No one's following my orders.
[02:32:40.850 --> 02:32:45.995]  He needs to come out and explain to people that he has no control and he needs help.
[02:32:47.888 --> 02:32:58.698]  And that's what COVID-19 has meant, to lock the country down so the average law-abiding citizen follows what the illegal governor says while they have Antifa run out and BLM and take over.
[02:32:58.698 --> 02:32:59.359]  And that's what this is.
[02:32:59.359 --> 02:33:03.642]  You stay in your houses while we burn everything down and overthrow the police departments.
[02:33:03.642 --> 02:33:07.926]  Can you imagine what they're going to pull if they get rid of Trump?
[02:33:07.926 --> 02:33:09.087]  It's going to be awful.
[02:33:09.087 --> 02:33:10.649]  Do you remember talking on the AI?
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:14.462]  You remember the Winter Soldier movie, the Captain America?
[02:33:14.462 --> 02:33:14.902]  Yes.
[02:33:14.902 --> 02:33:20.545]  Where the Nazi was uploaded to a computer, his consciousness, and he was still running things from behind the scenes?
[02:33:20.545 --> 02:33:21.285]  Yes.
[02:33:21.285 --> 02:33:25.987]  It's like they tell us what they're planning, you know, ahead of time in these movies.
[02:33:25.987 --> 02:33:34.992]  I mean, to destroy all the certain groups of people, because it was basically what was equal to the CIA was coming after the people.
[02:33:34.992 --> 02:33:35.592]  Absolutely.
[02:33:35.592 --> 02:33:36.453]  Shield.
[02:33:36.453 --> 02:33:37.013]  God bless you.
[02:33:37.013 --> 02:33:37.773]  Great points, Shannon.
[02:33:37.773 --> 02:33:38.534]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:33:41.636 --> 02:33:49.146]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[02:33:49.146 --> 02:33:55.335]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[02:33:55.335 --> 02:33:56.777]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[02:33:56.877 --> 02:33:56.897]  I
[02:34:13.609 --> 02:34:20.295]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I suffered with it for about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every test.
[02:34:20.295 --> 02:34:21.796]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[02:34:21.796 --> 02:34:25.779]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[02:34:25.779 --> 02:34:27.961]  I'm gonna get me some of that frickin' Living Defense.
[02:34:27.961 --> 02:34:32.845]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals, because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[02:34:32.845 --> 02:34:33.406]  I got it.
[02:34:33.406 --> 02:34:34.627]  I hid it from the nurses.
[02:34:34.627 --> 02:34:35.668]  I started taking it.
[02:34:35.668 --> 02:34:37.710]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:38.650]  It saved my life.
[02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:41.373]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[02:34:41.813 --> 02:34:42.213]  I think?
[02:35:04.471 --> 02:35:06.693]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[02:35:06.693 --> 02:35:08.694]  It's great to keep with you.
[02:35:08.694 --> 02:35:14.938]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[02:35:14.938 --> 02:35:16.519]  We're really excited about it.
[02:35:16.519 --> 02:35:18.661]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[02:35:18.661 --> 02:35:30.169]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[02:35:30.609 --> 02:35:41.030]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!

[02:35:59.279 --> 02:35:59.960]  That's right!

[02:36:15.715 --> 02:36:16.958]  Mmm.
[02:36:16.958 --> 02:36:20.345]  I just devoured your cousin and poured my protein bar.

[02:36:34.861 --> 02:36:35.242]  p.m.

[02:36:37.204 --> 02:36:42.809]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new GE specials have launched at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:36:42.809 --> 02:36:46.193]  I told you this five months ago, and now it's official.
[02:36:46.193 --> 02:36:49.416]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and is permanent.
[02:36:49.416 --> 02:36:53.901]  The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control hoax knew.
[02:36:54.381 --> 02:37:12.770]  That once they got the public for several months to wear masks and social distance, they would be able to permanently turn it on and off anytime they want by putting handcuffs on someone and then add new demands that people take forced inoculations if they have contact tracing on their phones and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[02:37:12.770 --> 02:37:19.814]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government forced inoculation and complete enslavement of the human population.
[02:37:20.074 --> 02:37:21.956]  This is medical tyranny.
[02:37:21.956 --> 02:37:23.857]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates' U.N.
[02:37:23.857 --> 02:37:24.758]  takeover.
[02:37:24.758 --> 02:37:27.920]  This is the end of civilization as you know it.
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.063]  Living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[02:37:31.063 --> 02:37:34.726]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[02:37:34.726 --> 02:37:36.748]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[02:37:36.748 --> 02:37:37.709]  Show them the numbers.
[02:37:37.709 --> 02:37:38.729]  Show them the facts.
[02:37:38.729 --> 02:37:45.095]  And explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[02:37:45.095 --> 02:37:47.717]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:01.584 --> 02:38:03.485]  Well, I gotta say it.
[02:38:03.485 --> 02:38:05.466]  Bill Barr's pedigree is not too good.
[02:38:05.466 --> 02:38:12.448]  And the CIA and all the rest of it, but looks like so far he's trying to keep the deep state from totally destroying the country.
[02:38:12.448 --> 02:38:15.890]  That's more of what President Trump needs in there right now.
[02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:19.251]  We're taking your phone calls, Gerald Salentes.
[02:38:19.251 --> 02:38:29.415]  Coming up, but I really cannot stress the listeners and viewers enough, I think you all know this and get this, that the globalists were sucker punched by Trump four years ago, and by us.
[02:38:31.664 --> 02:38:35.366]  They're pulling out all the stops right now.
[02:38:35.366 --> 02:38:39.509]  And now CNN is calling for violent revolution.
[02:38:39.509 --> 02:38:42.810]  And saying Gen Z demands overthrow.
[02:38:42.810 --> 02:38:46.613]  And it's just getting crazier and more violent by the minute.
[02:38:46.613 --> 02:38:48.334]  So remember when you lose your pension fund.
[02:38:48.334 --> 02:38:50.715]  Remember when you get shot and killed.
[02:38:50.715 --> 02:38:52.756]  Remember when the whole society collapses.
[02:38:52.756 --> 02:38:54.037]  The left did this.
[02:38:54.037 --> 02:38:55.998]  They'll think you're dumb and think you won't remember.
[02:38:55.998 --> 02:38:59.080]  Or they think they'll censor you and you'll keep your mouth shut.
[02:39:00.896 --> 02:39:15.064]  But I told you they're planning a violent revolution with a bunch of dumb young people that are dumber than a box of rocks and have no idea what they're even getting into.
[02:39:15.064 --> 02:39:19.787]  Everyone I know is having their houses broken into, their cars broken into.
[02:39:19.787 --> 02:39:26.030]  One of our great long-term crew members isn't here today because it was a giant shootout in his neighborhood.
[02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:28.031]  And one guy is about to, is almost dead.
[02:39:28.031 --> 02:39:29.052]  A little kid got shot.
[02:39:37.261 --> 02:39:39.283]  Can you imagine the police getting called to that?
[02:39:39.283 --> 02:39:40.424]  The society's breaking down.
[02:39:40.424 --> 02:39:49.773]  And can you imagine what it's like in Maryland, or Minnesota in the cities, or Chicago, Illinois, or L.A., or New York?
[02:39:49.773 --> 02:39:51.835]  It is hell on earth.
[02:39:51.835 --> 02:39:55.038]  And I saw the Democrats today going, Trump's making it up that crime's up.
[02:39:55.038 --> 02:39:56.340]  Crime's up!
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:57.761]  The crime is off the chart now.
[02:39:57.761 --> 02:39:58.502]  It's dangerous.
[02:40:00.796 --> 02:40:03.978]  My son at 11 o'clock at night wanted some fast food.
[02:40:03.978 --> 02:40:05.799]  He goes to the gas station.
[02:40:05.799 --> 02:40:07.319]  There's a dude robbing everybody in there.
[02:40:07.319 --> 02:40:12.842]  My son punches him and stops him.
[02:40:12.842 --> 02:40:17.425]  I told him, I said, listen, what are you doing in a convenience store at 11 o'clock at night?
[02:40:17.425 --> 02:40:18.786]  Don't do it.
[02:40:18.786 --> 02:40:19.406]  It's dangerous.
[02:40:19.406 --> 02:40:25.809]  I mean, I'd say crime's 10 times what it was just a month ago in Austin.
[02:40:25.809 --> 02:40:28.631]  Everyone I know is being robbed.
[02:40:30.592 --> 02:40:43.603]  Or shot at, or people are thugging out on them, or their mailbox is getting robbed, or they're getting, I mean, it's crazy town, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:43.603 --> 02:40:46.265]  Exactly what communists do.
[02:40:46.265 --> 02:40:57.775]  And they're all, never worked a day in their life, all these blue haired, I don't mean old ladies, I mean, you know, pink haired trendies, that literally see an American flag and go crazy and say, we're gonna get you because you love the country.
[02:40:59.363 --> 02:41:07.726]  And they believe when it comes down, they're going to be in charge of it.
[02:41:07.726 --> 02:41:08.806]  Yeah, right.
[02:41:08.806 --> 02:41:10.767]  Like you're in charge of yourself.
[02:41:10.767 --> 02:41:13.728]  Like you're in charge of anything.
[02:41:13.728 --> 02:41:22.650]  These people couldn't even read what George Washington wrote, much less pull down a statue of him and bitch and complain about it.
[02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:27.592]  And George Washington was on record trying to figure out how to end slavery.
[02:41:28.956 --> 02:41:29.976]  He inherited slaves.
[02:41:29.976 --> 02:41:31.977]  We're trying to figure out how to end the institution.
[02:41:31.977 --> 02:41:39.820]  How about you try trailblazing something?
[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:41.941]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:41:41.941 --> 02:41:47.603]  Who's been holding longest here?
[02:41:47.603 --> 02:41:53.266]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Oklahoma, then Nate and others.
[02:41:53.266 --> 02:41:53.826]  Go ahead, James.
[02:41:55.993 --> 02:41:57.974]  Hey, yeah, I got two things to bring up.
[02:41:57.974 --> 02:42:02.517]  I was at the Tulsa rally and I wanted to talk about the transhumanism.
[02:42:02.517 --> 02:42:06.740]  What we have with transhumanism is that is the endgame.
[02:42:06.740 --> 02:42:08.461]  It's to destroy the image of God.
[02:42:08.461 --> 02:42:11.383]  That's what these people are out here writing.
[02:42:11.383 --> 02:42:12.384]  They don't believe in God.
[02:42:12.384 --> 02:42:13.284]  They don't know about God.
[02:42:13.284 --> 02:42:14.425]  They don't know that they're Christians.
[02:42:14.425 --> 02:42:21.009]  Well, I mean, that's the cover of the Wall Street Journal is, it's time to give up our bodies and upload to big tech where we'll live forever.
[02:42:21.009 --> 02:42:23.611]  I mean, just on its face, that's a nightmare fraud.
[02:42:23.611 --> 02:42:25.332]  I mean, who believes any of this crap?
[02:42:27.976 --> 02:42:28.916]  That's right.
[02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:49.573]  Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith, like back when it came out like 20 years ago or whatever it was.
[02:42:49.573 --> 02:42:51.635]  I happened to run into him.
[02:42:51.635 --> 02:42:53.116]  And I said, yeah, what's the archetype?
[02:42:53.116 --> 02:42:54.517]  Why is the Emperor all mutated?
[02:42:54.517 --> 02:42:56.158]  And why does Hitler have to give up his body?
[02:42:56.158 --> 02:43:02.383]  And he goes, well, that's like Hitler getting nerve gas World War I. To get this evil power, you've got to give your physical body up.
[02:43:02.383 --> 02:43:03.704]  That's how the archetype works.
[02:43:04.908 --> 02:43:08.209]  And then I actually went and read some of the lore about it because it shows how the globalists think.
[02:43:08.209 --> 02:43:15.610]  It actually says that Sith have to degradate their body and give it up because the evil doesn't even like life itself.
[02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:16.970]  And that's really what they're saying.
[02:43:16.970 --> 02:43:18.711]  That's what's happening here.
[02:43:18.711 --> 02:43:19.911]  Right.
[02:43:19.911 --> 02:43:22.111]  Same thing with the superheroes.
[02:43:22.111 --> 02:43:24.112]  All the superheroes changing their body.
[02:43:24.112 --> 02:43:26.972]  You know, they're creating the image of God, but he didn't change.
[02:43:26.972 --> 02:43:28.852]  And they want you to be like that.
[02:43:28.852 --> 02:43:31.533]  All the people in Hollywood, all that stuff.
[02:43:32.335 --> 02:43:33.336]  That's what they're going toward.
[02:43:33.336 --> 02:43:35.737]  That's what they're brainwashing children with.
[02:43:35.737 --> 02:43:37.078]  That's where it starts.
[02:43:37.078 --> 02:43:39.879]  In the elementary schools, where they're pushing this.
[02:43:39.879 --> 02:43:43.822]  Little, you know, mighty man on the lunchbox.
[02:43:43.822 --> 02:43:45.323]  This has been going on for years.
[02:43:45.323 --> 02:43:48.565]  Eugenics.
[02:43:48.565 --> 02:43:49.005]  You're right.
[02:43:49.005 --> 02:43:52.047]  What do you think about the Trump rally?
[02:43:52.047 --> 02:43:58.791]  I was going to say that the BLM, I've seen it firsthand, and the Antifa, they are trying things.
[02:43:58.791 --> 02:43:59.731]  They are organized.
[02:43:59.731 --> 02:44:00.852]  They went downtown.
[02:44:01.621 --> 02:44:07.803]  They were taking pictures of people and signs, and then 15-30 minutes later, then they approached them.
[02:44:07.803 --> 02:44:09.924]  The whole group approached them.
[02:44:09.924 --> 02:44:15.366]  I was walking in front of the police station when a red truck pulled up and said they were with the stage crew.
[02:44:15.366 --> 02:44:17.326]  They were blocking traffic.
[02:44:17.326 --> 02:44:20.787]  I had to let one of the National Guard men know, hey, there's something going on over there.
[02:44:20.787 --> 02:44:21.788]  You better pay attention.
[02:44:21.788 --> 02:44:23.989]  So they were trying things.
[02:44:23.989 --> 02:44:26.029]  They were poking and prodding and that stuff.
[02:44:26.029 --> 02:44:28.270]  They need to shut those things down when they see people with
[02:44:28.939 --> 02:44:31.320]  Their cameras floating the whole crowd.
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:34.702]  They were sending that info back to somebody else.
[02:44:34.702 --> 02:44:36.824]  And then they were coming out and doing things.
[02:44:36.824 --> 02:44:38.224]  Oh, it's all totally coordinated.
[02:44:38.224 --> 02:44:39.605]  It's terrorism.
[02:44:39.605 --> 02:44:42.167]  Oh, but the UN says we should be nice to Antifa.
[02:44:42.167 --> 02:44:44.168]  And the media's like, yes, the UN's the boss.
[02:44:44.168 --> 02:44:45.409]  Trump's bad.
[02:44:45.409 --> 02:44:46.589]  Communist China's good.
[02:44:46.589 --> 02:44:47.310]  The UN's good.
[02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:48.951]  And they tell us what to do.
[02:44:48.951 --> 02:44:53.293]  Well, the police, the National Guard and Secret Service, they know these things.
[02:44:53.293 --> 02:44:54.474]  They need to be aware of these things.
[02:44:54.474 --> 02:44:56.035]  They need to shut these things down.
[02:44:56.035 --> 02:44:57.636]  That's why people aren't going to the Trump rally.
[02:44:58.268 --> 02:45:00.249]  Because they don't want to be that guy.
[02:45:00.249 --> 02:45:01.549]  They don't want to have to pull their firearm.
[02:45:28.787 --> 02:45:31.228]  You know, our republic's in a lot of peril, brother.
[02:45:31.228 --> 02:45:32.849]  That's how I feel.
[02:45:32.849 --> 02:45:35.150]  Three weeks ago, I went to the L.A.
[02:45:35.150 --> 02:45:42.073]  march, and out of 50,000 people, 49,900 were very docile.
[02:45:42.073 --> 02:45:54.919]  But 1% of the group was running around with military precision, dressed in all black gas masks that were taped to their hoodies.
[02:45:54.919 --> 02:45:58.060]  And I pointed out to everybody, I said, these guys are military.
[02:45:58.564 --> 02:46:04.048]  These aren't Antifa or just regular kids hanging out.
[02:46:04.048 --> 02:46:09.972]  This was absolutely, like you've called for years, done by design.
[02:46:09.972 --> 02:46:10.593]  Well, sure.
[02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:17.017]  The regular Antifa is a decoy for the real terrorists that are going to roll in later that are highly trained.
[02:46:17.017 --> 02:46:19.039]  I mean, this is a real deal.
[02:46:19.039 --> 02:46:25.984]  Yeah, I just want to give you a big kudos because when these guys ran, they ran in tandem like, you know, when the military runs.
[02:46:26.576 --> 02:46:29.076]  It was absolutely staged.
[02:46:29.076 --> 02:46:34.578]  I had a car pull up and a bunch of kids, bunch of guys built, got out with bricks.
[02:46:34.578 --> 02:46:36.398]  And I said, what are you guys doing?
[02:46:36.398 --> 02:46:37.698]  They didn't even pay attention.
[02:46:37.698 --> 02:46:41.699]  They went and they put them on a roof, got back in the car and left.
[02:46:41.699 --> 02:46:45.260]  And I turned to my friend, I said, those don't look like Antifa.
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:47.520]  Those guys work out every day.
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:51.461]  I said, this is a military operation going on.
[02:46:51.461 --> 02:46:52.701]  But you called it for years.
[02:46:54.053 --> 02:47:06.604]  Well, I mean, the country is just super far gone at this point, and the average conservative's been in la-la land, and I just don't think they realize how much trouble they're in.
[02:47:06.604 --> 02:47:19.836]  I mean, I know for a fact some major talk show hosts, not myself, have had to move out of their houses, because antifas come to their houses, threaten them, and then they keep harassing them every day, where you pull up to your house and the person drives by and says, we're going to kill you.
[02:47:21.138 --> 02:47:26.364]  And quite frankly, I've had some of that go on too, but I'm like, okay, well, okay, just better get me before I get you.
[02:47:26.364 --> 02:47:36.857]  But that's who these guys are, and a lot of them are leftist recruited out of the military, a lot of them are foundation-funded professors, and they've been training for a long time to take down America.
[02:47:37.458 --> 02:47:39.460]  They're not just going to knock out windows of Starbucks and stuff.
[02:47:39.460 --> 02:47:41.342]  That's to make it look like it's the people.
[02:47:41.342 --> 02:47:45.967]  What they're really going to do is they're going to firebomb, you know, governors' mansions.
[02:47:45.967 --> 02:47:49.410]  They're going to drive up with plastic explosives.
[02:47:49.410 --> 02:47:51.833]  They're going to bomb federal buildings and say, we did it.
[02:47:51.833 --> 02:47:55.957]  I mean, their real move is going to be plastic explosive attacks, and they're going to blame us.
[02:47:59.022 --> 02:48:00.243]  Well, I appreciate the phone call.
[02:48:00.243 --> 02:48:01.444]  I appreciate your time, sir.
[02:48:01.444 --> 02:48:03.425]  And good work on the transhumanism.
[02:48:03.425 --> 02:48:04.206]  Well, I'm trying, brother.
[02:48:04.206 --> 02:48:09.170]  Can you take a moment on the Sumerian tablet and how it will explain... Sure, stay there.
[02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:09.670]  Don't hang up.
[02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:10.591]  We'll come right back to you.
[02:48:10.591 --> 02:48:12.352]  I'm going to take two segments of Salente.
[02:48:12.352 --> 02:48:13.253]  I'm sure you'll be okay with that.
[02:48:13.253 --> 02:48:14.834]  I need to finish up these calls.
[02:48:14.834 --> 02:48:20.879]  And I need to do an update on how many days it is until Roger Stone has to report to the Huskal.
[02:48:20.879 --> 02:48:22.880]  Stalag 13.
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:23.941]  Prison.
[02:48:23.941 --> 02:48:28.745]  Nine days countdown to deep state death sentence for Roger Stone, the political prisoner.
[02:48:32.813 --> 02:48:35.435]  The United States is not Communist China.
[02:48:35.435 --> 02:48:38.357]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[02:48:38.357 --> 02:48:40.238]  We don't blow up churches.
[02:48:40.238 --> 02:48:43.420]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:47.844]  But all over the news, we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream
[02:48:52.335 --> 02:48:52.495]  I don't
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:19.605]  Because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them and their power grab.
[02:49:19.605 --> 02:49:23.669]  The resistance lives at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[02:49:23.669 --> 02:49:29.655]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[02:49:32.765 --> 02:49:35.207]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[02:49:35.207 --> 02:49:40.651]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food, it's the highest quality, they've got it.
[02:49:40.651 --> 02:49:47.036]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[02:49:47.036 --> 02:49:49.578]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[02:49:49.578 --> 02:49:52.920]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:57.764]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[02:49:57.764 --> 02:50:01.107]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[02:50:02.313 --> 02:50:05.094]  We're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[02:50:05.094 --> 02:50:10.996]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[02:50:10.996 --> 02:50:12.496]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[02:50:12.496 --> 02:50:13.697]  It's something you need.
[02:50:13.697 --> 02:50:17.298]  We have high-quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast.
[02:50:17.298 --> 02:50:24.721]  And 360 wins, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[02:50:24.721 --> 02:50:27.522]  It's in great containers, high-quality, lasts 25 years.
[02:50:27.522 --> 02:50:31.523]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:50:36.061 --> 02:50:51.075]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:51.075 --> 02:50:55.279]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:50:55.279 --> 02:50:57.221]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:50:57.221 --> 02:51:00.965]  Carol's going to take over here very soon, but finish up about the Sumerian tablets.
[02:51:02.332 --> 02:51:06.254]  Paul, some of the oldest human writings that we know of.
[02:51:06.254 --> 02:51:07.335]  Go ahead.
[02:51:07.335 --> 02:51:07.835]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:07.835 --> 02:51:21.124]  And as you know, Hollywood has put this out in so many movies, you know, from Artificial Intelligence, Prometheus, the most prolific directors ever, from Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Wrigley Scott.
[02:51:21.124 --> 02:51:24.065]  The Sumerian tablets had the Bible story.
[02:51:24.065 --> 02:51:29.769]  God came down, created us for DNA manipulation, went back to his spot in heaven,
[02:51:30.350 --> 02:51:37.997]  And in the end times will return and his creation, the human race, was created to mine the gold.
[02:51:37.997 --> 02:51:41.300]  This is a story of Avatar, just in reverse.
[02:51:41.300 --> 02:51:43.662]  We went to a different planet.
[02:51:43.662 --> 02:51:54.912]  When the task of mining the gold is over, God doesn't need his creation anymore, which was the Adam created in the land of Edan.
[02:51:54.912 --> 02:51:57.414]  So that's the Sumerian tablets in a nutshell.
[02:51:58.084 --> 02:52:06.811]  And everybody who studies singularity, which you've mentioned, knows we're displacing large amounts of the human workforce now.
[02:52:06.811 --> 02:52:12.915]  You don't need humans anymore, and the biggest companies on Earth are going to robotics.
[02:52:12.915 --> 02:52:13.816]  Your thoughts, Alex?
[02:52:14.943 --> 02:52:25.212]  Well yeah, the globalists believe we were put here by aliens and that they're in interstellar, interdimensional contact with them and they're telling them, wipe your body out and we'll let you live and that's what this is.
[02:52:25.212 --> 02:52:27.575]  And I haven't seen that, I don't even believe that.
[02:52:27.575 --> 02:52:29.576]  That's what the globalists believe.
[02:52:29.576 --> 02:52:31.058]  So that's what we're really facing.
[02:52:31.058 --> 02:52:33.860]  Meanwhile they've got us fighting with each other over what color we are.
[02:52:33.860 --> 02:52:36.203]  I really appreciate your call, Paul.
[02:52:36.203 --> 02:52:38.505]  Lauren in Ohio, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:52:39.717 --> 02:52:42.259]  Hey, yeah, a bunch of this stems from ingratitude.
[02:52:42.259 --> 02:52:46.542]  You know, we're not grateful for the beautiful creations that we are in Christ Jesus.
[02:52:46.542 --> 02:52:47.402]  I agree.
[02:52:47.402 --> 02:52:51.425]  People just do not appreciate how many great things there are in life.
[02:52:51.425 --> 02:52:53.507]  We really all should have more gratitude.
[02:52:53.507 --> 02:52:54.647]  Well, and whose fault is it?
[02:52:54.647 --> 02:52:57.610]  We put our children in these schools where they lie to them.
[02:52:57.610 --> 02:53:00.952]  We let them watch this media and carry these phones around where
[02:53:01.559 --> 02:53:03.300]  It's like the guy was saying with the superheroes.
[02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:06.402]  They all have mutations to their bodies or whatever.
[02:53:06.402 --> 02:53:07.283]  It's better.
[02:53:07.283 --> 02:53:08.664]  Or the trans, it's better.
[02:53:08.664 --> 02:53:09.564]  Or tattoos.
[02:53:09.564 --> 02:53:10.285]  Or piercings.
[02:53:10.285 --> 02:53:10.965]  It's better.
[02:53:10.965 --> 02:53:12.586]  No, all of it is degrading.
[02:53:12.586 --> 02:53:20.031]  Oh yeah, listen, WashTech, that the Washington Post put out like 20 years ago, said, we're pushing body modification.
[02:53:20.031 --> 02:53:22.112]  I'm not bashing people that do that or get tattoos.
[02:53:22.112 --> 02:53:25.114]  Point is, they did it to get you ready for microchips, they said.
[02:53:25.114 --> 02:53:28.216]  So they admit, but instead you get a brain tumor and die.
[02:53:28.216 --> 02:53:30.938]  You don't grow something like Spider-Man and become Spider-Man.
[02:53:31.178 --> 02:53:31.919]  No, you just die.
[02:53:50.049 --> 02:53:50.889]  And we don't like your house.
[02:53:50.889 --> 02:53:52.030]  It's too little for all you people.
[02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:53.531]  You know, we need to come and inspect.
[02:53:53.531 --> 02:53:55.812]  I told him, get off my land and don't come back.
[02:53:55.812 --> 02:53:58.033]  My life is not a group effort.
[02:53:58.033 --> 02:54:02.235]  I have no contract with the government and I don't need to follow statutory law.
[02:54:02.235 --> 02:54:02.895]  This is my point.
[02:54:02.895 --> 02:54:06.857]  And think about the neighbor that called you because you were talking bad about vaccines.
[02:54:06.857 --> 02:54:09.179]  You need to pay for that.
[02:54:09.179 --> 02:54:11.060]  And well, they could have made a lot of money on my children.
[02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:11.720]  I have five of them.
[02:54:12.119 --> 02:54:15.402]  But here's the thing that's important for people to understand.
[02:54:15.402 --> 02:54:19.966]  Let me just give you this four-step problem, because I know you have other callers, but we need to obey God first.
[02:54:19.966 --> 02:54:20.766]  The Ten Commandments.
[02:54:20.766 --> 02:54:22.208]  Even if you're an atheist.
[02:54:22.208 --> 02:54:23.969]  Are we for not murdering people?
[02:54:23.969 --> 02:54:25.210]  Not stealing from people?
[02:54:25.210 --> 02:54:26.231]  Not coveting what they have?
[02:54:26.231 --> 02:54:27.592]  Yeah.
[02:54:27.592 --> 02:54:29.314]  Even if you just want to do the last five, okay?
[02:54:29.654 --> 02:54:37.639]  Honor thy father and thy mother wouldn't be a bad one either, but what I'm saying is you don't have to believe in God, but we do have to behave responsibly and constructively.
[02:54:37.639 --> 02:54:39.200]  We need to keep our money in your pocket.
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.381]  If you don't owe taxes, you need to stop paying them.
[02:54:41.381 --> 02:54:45.464]  They're using this money to take over the world and destroy your country.
[02:54:45.464 --> 02:54:50.287]  So HisAdvocates.org or StateCitizen.org, you should interview this guy, Kelby Smith.
[02:54:50.287 --> 02:54:51.868]  You're a child of the living God.
[02:54:51.868 --> 02:54:55.310]  God made the men, the men made a club, the club made rules, codes, regulations, statutes,
[02:54:55.765 --> 02:54:57.746]  They manage the maids and the butlers of the club.
[02:54:57.746 --> 02:54:59.987]  The Constitution is a body of negative law.
[02:54:59.987 --> 02:55:01.868]  It tells them what they can't do.
[02:55:01.868 --> 02:55:03.529]  It does not tell us what we can do.
[02:55:03.529 --> 02:55:05.210]  Look at the 9th and 10th Amendments.
[02:55:05.632 --> 02:55:08.754]  The creator is the one that controls.
[02:55:08.754 --> 02:55:10.976]  You can't have more power in the creation than the other thing.
[02:55:10.976 --> 02:55:15.979]  No, that's why the state wants to get rid of God, because if we get our power from God, the state isn't God.
[02:55:15.979 --> 02:55:19.982]  They say God doesn't exist, but now they tell us, actually, we're the transhumanists, we are God.
[02:55:19.982 --> 02:55:23.464]  We need you to give that body up and upload to us.
[02:55:23.464 --> 02:55:26.206]  Wow, what a creepy group of sick freaks.
[02:55:26.926 --> 02:55:28.869]  All right, Gerald Cilente's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[02:55:28.869 --> 02:55:35.360]  I'm going to finish up with your calls, though, with Mega Titan Nate, George, Jared, and Ryan real fast.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:38.405]  And then Gerald Cilente of Trends Forecasting is taking over.
[02:55:38.405 --> 02:55:38.865]  Stay with us.
[02:55:40.956 --> 02:55:41.977]  It's finally here.
[02:55:41.977 --> 02:55:46.819]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[02:55:46.819 --> 02:55:53.442]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:55.503]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[02:55:55.503 --> 02:56:04.308]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[02:56:04.568 --> 02:56:11.074]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[02:56:11.074 --> 02:56:12.655]  I can personally feel the difference.
[02:56:12.655 --> 02:56:20.782]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[02:56:20.782 --> 02:56:25.186]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[02:56:25.586 --> 02:56:30.611]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[02:56:30.611 --> 02:56:38.058]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[02:56:38.058 --> 02:56:39.580]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:54.841 --> 02:56:59.727]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:56:59.727 --> 02:57:02.150]  It's Alex Jones Live!
[02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:04.172]  I had a few final calls with Gerald Celente.
[02:57:04.172 --> 02:57:10.820]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:12.322]  That one always gets me, it's a double liner.
[02:57:14.138 --> 02:57:20.360]  We got one segment left, and Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, great guy, really smart fella, is going to be taking over.
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:23.902]  So I've got about a minute or so each with each one of these callers.
[02:57:23.902 --> 02:57:38.907]  But just briefly, because I didn't plug the last two hours, this is the last day of the tail end of that big sale, where you can get 60% off on Brain Force Plus, Turbo Force, Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, Vinyl Coconut, Protein Bars, BioTruth Selenium, and 70% off the AMP Impact
[02:57:41.573 --> 02:57:46.014]  As well as all apparel, all t-shirts at cost $9.95.
[02:57:46.014 --> 02:57:52.375]  That's infowarestore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:57:52.375 --> 02:57:54.136]  Plus these are great products.
[02:57:54.136 --> 02:58:01.817]  Separately, Roger Stone, eight and a half days from now, has to report to prison.
[02:58:01.817 --> 02:58:04.798]  So we have the countdown going on right now.
[02:58:04.798 --> 02:58:05.518]  Nine days.
[02:58:07.284 --> 02:58:14.005]  Countdown to the Deep State death sentence for Roger Stone for being a political criminal.
[02:58:14.005 --> 02:58:15.106]  He's done nothing wrong.
[02:58:15.106 --> 02:58:17.186]  He is a political prisoner.
[02:58:17.186 --> 02:58:18.626]  He got Trump elected.
[02:58:18.626 --> 02:58:22.007]  The message is, you help the president get elected, we will put you in prison.
[02:58:22.007 --> 02:58:29.348]  So that when Trump appoints people, or has advisors, the Deep State can come up to them and say, you saw what we did to Stone, Manafort, and others.
[02:58:29.348 --> 02:58:32.489]  Play ball, be a double agent, or we will put you in prison as well.
[02:58:32.489 --> 02:58:36.710]  Part of the New York Southern District head being removed is the fact that
[02:58:37.270 --> 02:58:44.435]  Behind the scenes, they are persecuting hundreds of prominent Trump supporters with stuff right out of Nazi Germany.
[02:58:44.435 --> 02:58:45.276]  Believe me, I can tell you.
[02:58:45.276 --> 02:58:46.697]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:58:46.697 --> 02:58:52.321]  So, nine days countdown to death in the Senate for Roger Stone.
[02:58:52.321 --> 02:58:55.804]  Please remember that and understand that's why this election is so incredibly important.
[02:58:55.804 --> 02:59:01.228]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your calls, the order that they were received.
[02:59:01.228 --> 02:59:03.089]  Jared in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:59:03.089 --> 02:59:06.372]  Can you hear me?
[02:59:06.372 --> 02:59:06.612]  Yes, sir.
[02:59:07.887 --> 02:59:09.408]  All right.
[02:59:09.408 --> 02:59:11.209]  First, I want to make two points real quick.
[02:59:11.209 --> 02:59:12.890]  I'll do it real fast.
[02:59:12.890 --> 02:59:14.171]  First, everybody loves you.
[02:59:14.171 --> 02:59:16.532]  All right?
[02:59:16.532 --> 02:59:22.635]  32 years old, I've been on you since Prison Planet when the internet went bee-dee-doo to get on.
[02:59:22.635 --> 02:59:23.996]  Yes, sir.
[02:59:23.996 --> 02:59:25.837]  Everybody loves you.
[02:59:25.837 --> 02:59:29.199]  We have to reevaluate this political situation.
[02:59:29.199 --> 02:59:34.282]  And as a brother in Christ, I want to tell you, you've been fooled.
[02:59:34.282 --> 02:59:35.782]  Trump has fooled you.
[02:59:35.782 --> 02:59:36.663]  He fooled everybody.
[02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:39.401]  We have to get over that.
[02:59:39.401 --> 02:59:41.263]  We have to go forward.
[02:59:41.263 --> 02:59:43.644]  There's nowhere else to go.
[02:59:43.644 --> 02:59:49.749]  At what point did, I mean, at what point did you decide that Trump had fooled you?
[02:59:49.749 --> 02:59:53.992]  You know, at the point where I realized it's all a sham.
[02:59:53.992 --> 02:59:56.213]  You know, his money's a sham.
[02:59:56.213 --> 03:00:03.418]  His investments are probably insolvent and probably 90% holdings to someone else.
[03:00:03.418 --> 03:00:07.261]  Uh, I've noticed he, you just talked about Roger Stone.
[03:00:08.004 --> 03:00:10.486]  That's supposed to be his best friend.
[03:00:10.486 --> 03:00:14.448]  He's letting him go.
[03:00:14.448 --> 03:00:19.252]  If you were my friend and you let me go to prison over nothing, I'd be upset, right?
[03:00:19.252 --> 03:00:21.753]  I mean, it's supposed to be his best friend.
[03:00:21.753 --> 03:00:25.776]  Well, the word is he's going to get clemency or a pardon, so I think the jury's still out on that one.
[03:00:25.776 --> 03:00:28.338]  But listen, I get what you're saying.
[03:00:28.338 --> 03:00:31.680]  Imagine if Hillary had gotten in power and tried all this crap.
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:33.681]  There'd been a right-wing revolution against all this.
[03:00:36.223 --> 03:00:45.110]  The Cube group says we're all saved and everything's fine, and Trump can do no wrong and everything else, and then we just sit here and nothing happens.
[03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:46.591]  Look, I think Trump's the real deal.
[03:00:46.591 --> 03:00:48.152]  He's fighting hard.
[03:00:48.152 --> 03:00:50.514]  And I think the jury's still out on this, but we'll find out, Jared.
[03:00:50.514 --> 03:00:51.975]  I appreciate you and God bless.
[03:00:51.975 --> 03:00:52.575]  We're moving quicker.
[03:00:52.575 --> 03:00:54.156]  I want to get to everybody.
[03:00:54.156 --> 03:00:56.998]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nate in Michigan.
[03:00:56.998 --> 03:00:59.600]  Nate, go ahead.
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:00.781]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:00.781 --> 03:01:04.264]  I just wanted to say, you know, I'm taking action.
[03:01:05.208 --> 03:01:07.348]  I plan on getting my car fixed.
[03:01:07.348 --> 03:01:09.789]  I plan on going to a Trump rally.
[03:01:09.789 --> 03:01:11.129]  Hopefully I'll see you there.
[03:01:11.129 --> 03:01:11.589]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:11.589 --> 03:01:14.810]  And God bless.
[03:01:14.810 --> 03:01:16.430]  Well, that said, I mean, we have to take action.
[03:01:16.430 --> 03:01:19.330]  We just can't sit there and watch Trump surrounded and get pissed at him.
[03:01:19.330 --> 03:01:20.251]  We have to take action.
[03:01:20.251 --> 03:01:21.911]  It may seem like a little thing to go to a Trump rally.
[03:01:21.911 --> 03:01:22.531]  It's not.
[03:01:22.531 --> 03:01:26.932]  It's a big thing because they're counting on you being scared and not going out there, brother.
[03:01:26.932 --> 03:01:28.012]  I'm not scared.
[03:01:28.012 --> 03:01:30.032]  I'm here for you, Alex.
[03:01:30.032 --> 03:01:30.872]  I'm here for you, brother.
[03:01:30.872 --> 03:01:32.973]  What do you think is going to happen with COVID and the riots?
[03:01:32.973 --> 03:01:34.393]  I see that's what you wanted to get into.
[03:01:35.410 --> 03:01:42.498]  Oh, well, you know, I think we should come out and say, hey, do we know black lives matter?
[03:01:42.498 --> 03:01:44.560]  Do African lives matter?
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:45.782]  Or how does that work?
[03:01:45.782 --> 03:01:48.785]  You know, people in Africa are black, people in Africa
[03:01:49.332 --> 03:01:51.413]  Well, that's what my wife said last week.
[03:01:51.413 --> 03:01:54.893]  She said, Black lives only matter if a white person kills them.
[03:01:54.893 --> 03:01:58.935]  But if it's, you know, 100 to 1, blacks killing other blacks, or Africa's getting slaughtered, well that's okay!
[03:02:09.217 --> 03:02:17.499]  And we've got videos of black activists go out to these hospitals with the nurses doing TikTok videos, and they go, hey, do black lives matter to their little babies?
[03:02:17.499 --> 03:02:18.520]  Millions getting aborted?
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:19.660]  They won't say that.
[03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:21.620]  They're like, no, those babies don't matter.
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:25.321]  Think about how sick that is.
[03:02:25.321 --> 03:02:27.262]  It's sick, yeah.
[03:02:27.262 --> 03:02:35.824]  You know, why are they, if COVID-19 is so deadly, why is it that the same people are saying, hey,
[03:02:37.195 --> 03:02:40.897]  We support you going outside and protesting black people.
[03:02:40.897 --> 03:02:42.738]  We really care about you.
[03:02:42.738 --> 03:02:44.299]  Your life matters.
[03:02:44.299 --> 03:02:45.719]  COVID-19 is deadly.
[03:02:45.719 --> 03:02:46.220]  Go outside.
[03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:46.940]  Well, that's what they're saying.
[03:02:46.940 --> 03:02:49.362]  They're saying if you're a conservative, you stay in your house.
[03:02:49.362 --> 03:02:51.483]  If you're a communist, you can do whatever you want.
[03:02:51.483 --> 03:02:52.423]  It's crazy.
[03:02:52.423 --> 03:02:54.364]  Thank you, Nate.
[03:02:54.364 --> 03:02:57.926]  And who's up next here?
[03:02:57.926 --> 03:02:59.387]  That would be George in Connecticut.
[03:02:59.387 --> 03:03:00.228]  George, you're on the air.
[03:03:00.228 --> 03:03:00.508]  Welcome.
[03:03:06.786 --> 03:03:09.308]  Go ahead, George, in Connecticut.
[03:03:09.308 --> 03:03:10.449]  Hey, George is gone.
[03:03:10.449 --> 03:03:11.870]  Let's go to Ryan in Texas.
[03:03:11.870 --> 03:03:14.092]  Ryan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:03:14.092 --> 03:03:15.012]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[03:03:15.012 --> 03:03:15.633]  Good, brother.
[03:03:15.633 --> 03:03:17.474]  Honored to be on the show.
[03:03:17.474 --> 03:03:21.597]  Yeah, I'm actually Austin, born and raised, so super proud to actually get my voice on the show.
[03:03:21.597 --> 03:03:24.700]  And I know you all are squeezed on time, so I'm going to go pretty quick.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:31.144]  I wanted to talk about your opinion on Elon Musk potentially being a false idol.
[03:03:31.144 --> 03:03:35.748]  It seems pretty clear to me that he was, I mean, I believe Trump
[03:03:36.517 --> 03:03:37.837]  Well, I can spend an hour on that.
[03:03:57.931 --> 03:04:02.456]  And I'm not ready to get into what I think about Elon Musk at this part.
[03:04:02.456 --> 03:04:17.891]  I mean, I thought he did a good job before, then he said some really scary bad things, and then now I know some of the inside baseball of Elon Musk moving to Austin, a bunch of other people are leaving in a huge exodus, and I know about some other meetings that, let's just say, some of his people have had with us.
[03:04:18.692 --> 03:04:19.392]  I think he is.
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:54.583]  Just, you know, guessing here, I think that he's potentially a part of a different deep state operation.
[03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:59.205]  My opinion on Trump is he's truly a patriot, but I think he's a negotiator.
[03:04:59.205 --> 03:05:09.611]  I think he picked the lesser of two evils going on Elon's side with, you know, the AI movement versus just dehumanizing, or the planet depopulating.
[03:05:09.611 --> 03:05:13.313]  But it's very evident that, you know, Austin's been taken over.
[03:05:13.313 --> 03:05:17.235]  I live up in Round Rock, so right next to y'all, and it's night and day between, you know, how
[03:05:17.819 --> 03:05:23.764]  Democratic Austin is and how they really controlled the narrative and Round Rock people just were right next to y'all.
[03:05:23.764 --> 03:05:25.305]  People don't really seem to notice it.
[03:05:25.305 --> 03:05:26.606]  Oh, it's an absolute cult.
[03:05:26.606 --> 03:05:27.067]  Democrat.
[03:05:27.067 --> 03:05:32.271]  I mean, that's why I'm beginning to move out of Austin because I mean, I was already outside Austin.
[03:05:32.271 --> 03:05:33.051]  Then I got a divorce.
[03:05:33.051 --> 03:05:34.853]  My ex-wife took the house.
[03:05:34.853 --> 03:05:36.934]  And, you know, now I'm trying to move out of Austin again.
[03:05:36.934 --> 03:05:38.216]  I just can't give taxes to it.
[03:05:38.216 --> 03:05:39.136]  I can't be around these people.
[03:05:39.136 --> 03:05:41.358]  I mean, they're just the scum of the earth.
[03:05:41.358 --> 03:05:42.839]  A lot of the folks moving out of L.A.
[03:05:42.839 --> 03:05:44.320]  now, though, are running from it.
[03:05:44.320 --> 03:05:45.241]  There's some big fish.
[03:05:45.241 --> 03:05:46.602]  Maybe they're gonna be able to change it a little bit.
[03:05:47.623 --> 03:05:54.587]  It's just, you know, you flee a state you've ruined and you bring the same mental illness to the state you come to.
[03:05:54.587 --> 03:05:56.509]  You know, it's just crazy.
[03:05:56.509 --> 03:06:02.933]  It'd be like if you were a woman married to an alcoholic guy that beat you, why would you marry another guy that's an alcoholic and beat you on the second date?
[03:06:02.933 --> 03:06:04.714]  You're like, oh, I've already had this, I don't want this.
[03:06:04.714 --> 03:06:06.915]  But Democrats just can't seem to figure it out.
[03:06:06.915 --> 03:06:11.358]  Their followers, they know where they are isn't good, so they bring themselves with them.
[03:06:12.571 --> 03:06:13.271]  I'm out of time.
[03:06:13.271 --> 03:06:19.613]  I'm sorry to Megatitan, but if Megatitan calls back on another day, he'll go to the head of the line.
[03:06:19.613 --> 03:06:20.833]  All right.
[03:06:20.833 --> 03:06:27.175]  Gerald Salente is taking over loaded for Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[03:06:27.175 --> 03:06:30.056]  On the other side, TrendsResearch.com.

[03:06:35.157 --> 03:06:38.518]  Coming up then, Owen, the Destroyer Shroyer.
[03:06:38.518 --> 03:06:45.942]  United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third world sectors of the world.
[03:06:45.942 --> 03:06:52.524]  Bill and Melinda Gates that control the UNWHO openly say they want to depopulate brown people.
[03:06:52.524 --> 03:07:01.408]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst on the planet, and then elect your white people
[03:07:01.448 --> 03:07:02.428]  We're good to go.
[03:07:20.014 --> 03:07:25.375]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[03:07:25.375 --> 03:07:32.177]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York, where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[03:07:32.177 --> 03:07:34.158]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[03:07:34.158 --> 03:07:38.219]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.

[03:09:18.742 --> 03:09:20.802]  It's great being here.
[03:09:20.802 --> 03:09:27.664]  And everybody out there listening, please do you can to support InfoWars.
[03:09:27.664 --> 03:09:29.124]  The censorship now is
[03:09:30.117 --> 03:09:37.423]  It was one of our top trends, actually, in 2019, that we'd be seeing more and more censorship.
[03:09:37.423 --> 03:09:47.791]  People are sending me things about the fraud of wearing masks and it's being censored on LinkedIn.
[03:09:47.791 --> 03:09:49.952]  You can't even get to them.
[03:09:49.952 --> 03:09:53.635]  So it's really important that we keep the truth alive.
[03:09:53.635 --> 03:09:59.760]  One of our media people and a very important person here, Laura Martin,
[03:10:00.871 --> 03:10:02.132]  Came up with a phrase.
[03:10:02.132 --> 03:10:05.915]  This isn't mainstream media.
[03:10:05.915 --> 03:10:08.137]  It's junk stream.
[03:10:08.137 --> 03:10:10.739]  And she's 100% correct.
[03:10:10.739 --> 03:10:14.401]  This is the junk stream media shoving junk down our throat.
[03:10:14.401 --> 03:10:15.662]  Junk news.
[03:10:15.662 --> 03:10:17.384]  That's all they sell.
[03:10:17.384 --> 03:10:21.046]  And they're selling fear and hysteria.
[03:10:21.046 --> 03:10:24.409]  I want to start off with the markets.
[03:10:24.409 --> 03:10:25.590]  The markets are going up.
[03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:29.633]  They have absolutely no relationship at all to the real world.
[03:10:30.834 --> 03:10:36.238]  This lockdown has destroyed so many lives and so many businesses.
[03:10:36.238 --> 03:10:38.880]  The streets up here are dead.
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:42.883]  Last night, I was sitting in the garden, the Crown Garden.
[03:10:42.883 --> 03:10:48.388]  As you well know, or some of you may know, we have the most historic four corners in America.
[03:10:48.388 --> 03:10:52.931]  And I bought these buildings as a tribute to me being an American.
[03:10:52.931 --> 03:10:57.955]  It's the only corner in America with pre-Revolutionary War stone buildings on each corner.
[03:10:58.513 --> 03:11:05.717]  So if you go Kingston, New York, most historic four buildings, you can see the four buildings and one of them, the Franz Rogen House, 1750.
[03:11:05.717 --> 03:11:16.962]  The other ones are the 1774 Academy, the 16, I think it's 91 person house.
[03:11:16.962 --> 03:11:21.565]  And the other one is the Dr. Jensen House, 1763.
[03:11:21.565 --> 03:11:27.448]  I own all of them except the Dr. Jensen, the Jensen House.
[03:11:29.679 --> 03:11:33.280]  Excuse me, yeah, the person house, the person house I don't own.
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:35.401]  That's the museum that's always closed.
[03:11:35.401 --> 03:11:42.463]  Anyway, I'm sitting out there last night and with some people having a nice time and this couple walks by.
[03:11:42.463 --> 03:11:45.264]  This is so beautiful up here.
[03:11:45.264 --> 03:11:47.145]  It's so beautiful up here.
[03:11:47.145 --> 03:11:49.805]  Why is it empty?
[03:11:49.805 --> 03:11:53.687]  I said it's empty because they killed it.
[03:11:53.687 --> 03:11:56.688]  The governor of New York killed it.
[03:11:56.688 --> 03:11:58.108]  The streets are dead all around.
[03:11:58.493 --> 03:11:59.393]  It's not only here.
[03:11:59.393 --> 03:12:06.236]  And the restaurants that are opening up, they don't have the capacity they used to have in other states.
[03:12:06.236 --> 03:12:11.199]  This thing's going down big and hard.
[03:12:11.199 --> 03:12:16.341]  I'm just going to show you the example.
[03:12:16.341 --> 03:12:22.003]  Bank of Japan pledges one trillion dollars in coronavirus loans.
[03:12:22.003 --> 03:12:28.066]  European Central Bank's negative rates prompt banks to borrow a record one point
[03:12:28.641 --> 03:12:43.807]  Three trillion dollars, borrowing this money, dumping in all this cheap dough, which, by the way, is why I believe gold and silver, and I do not give financial advice, are the only safe haven investments.
[03:12:43.807 --> 03:12:47.548]  And younger people believe in the bitcoins and the other things.
[03:12:47.548 --> 03:12:48.489]  Fine.
[03:12:48.489 --> 03:12:49.249]  You know, it's your trip.
[03:12:49.690 --> 03:13:00.535]  And there's a place for it because people know that this digital currency backed by nothing and printed on nothing that the central banks are dumping into the system isn't worth the paper.
[03:13:00.535 --> 03:13:02.116]  It's not printed on.
[03:13:02.116 --> 03:13:06.818]  And today now we're seeing gold breaking above the 1750 mark.
[03:13:06.818 --> 03:13:13.801]  And what have I said on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on for the last five months?
[03:13:13.801 --> 03:13:15.602]  Gold has to break above 1740, 1750.
[03:13:19.113 --> 03:13:21.333]  And stay there.
[03:13:21.333 --> 03:13:27.875]  And then it's going to spike above $2,000 an ounce and silver will follow.
[03:13:27.875 --> 03:13:33.236]  And I think the silver run is going to be bigger than the gold bull run.
[03:13:33.236 --> 03:13:39.037]  Because on average, silver trades against gold at about 12 to 1, 20 to 1, 15 to 1, 17 to 1 in that range.
[03:13:39.037 --> 03:13:40.177]  It's now trading at about 90 to 1.
[03:13:47.125 --> 03:13:49.926]  And there's no stockpiles of silver.
[03:13:49.926 --> 03:13:56.288]  They're in your cell phone, computer, keyboard, whatever.
[03:13:56.288 --> 03:13:59.589]  They use it up and then people throw it in the dump.
[03:13:59.589 --> 03:14:03.230]  So there's not big silver stockpile.
[03:14:03.230 --> 03:14:07.471]  So this thing is going down as I see it.
[03:14:07.471 --> 03:14:12.092]  HSBC restarts plan to cut 35,000 jobs.
[03:14:12.092 --> 03:14:13.913]  Again, this is just two days of news here.
[03:14:14.833 --> 03:14:18.715]  Jerome Powell fears labor gap could widen.
[03:14:18.715 --> 03:14:27.221]  The shock we've received, the economy received, was the largest in living memory, he said.
[03:14:27.221 --> 03:14:32.584]  Levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels.
[03:14:32.584 --> 03:14:38.607]  And significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery.
[03:14:38.607 --> 03:14:44.191]  Again, this is coming from the Federal Reserve that are always pumping up positive BS.
[03:14:45.933 --> 03:14:49.795]  Bank profits, you ready for this?
[03:14:49.795 --> 03:14:54.057]  Plummeted by 70% in first quarter.
[03:14:54.057 --> 03:14:54.378]  U.S.
[03:14:54.378 --> 03:15:07.545]  bank profits fell by 69.6% to $18.5 billion in the first quarter from the year before as the coronavirus pandemic struck.
[03:15:07.545 --> 03:15:15.389]  It's not as the coronavirus pandemic struck, it's as these crazy maniacs, these sick people,
[03:15:16.321 --> 03:15:26.906]  Men, women, black, white, name the country who's ever running it, color, race, gender, I don't care, that have locked down the economy.
[03:15:26.906 --> 03:15:28.867]  The pandemic didn't lock it down.
[03:15:28.867 --> 03:15:35.670]  The numbers again add up to very little compared with previous flus and viruses.
[03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:44.894]  If you go back to 1957-58, when I was a youth, a million people died worldwide of the Asian flu.
[03:15:45.865 --> 03:15:49.347]  We had a population of 3 billion.
[03:15:49.347 --> 03:15:54.030]  Today we have a population of 7 billion and have 400 and what?
[03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:56.872]  50,000 people dead worldwide.
[03:15:56.872 --> 03:16:10.021]  If the same numbers as dead then is now, when they didn't lock down the economy back then, we'd have 2.6 million people dead.
[03:16:10.021 --> 03:16:13.103]  This whole thing is fear and hysteria.
[03:16:13.103 --> 03:16:15.264]  I was one of the first ones to call it out.
[03:16:16.155 --> 03:16:20.956]  You go back to your Trends Journal, January 28th, 2020.
[03:16:20.956 --> 03:16:26.697]  106 dead in China.
[03:16:26.697 --> 03:16:31.858]  And then we said the next line, 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:16:31.858 --> 03:16:33.458]  New Black Plague?
[03:16:33.458 --> 03:16:38.299]  What are you telling me 106 people died in this country?
[03:16:38.299 --> 03:16:39.440]  Of China?
[03:16:39.440 --> 03:16:40.060]  Of 1.4 billion people?
[03:16:46.537 --> 03:16:48.439]  On and on.
[03:16:48.439 --> 03:16:51.241]  The numbers are disastrous.
[03:16:51.241 --> 03:16:55.264]  And when we come back, I'm going to go through more of them.
[03:16:55.264 --> 03:17:00.528]  But in the meantime, as I said, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:17:00.528 --> 03:17:07.833]  They have these huge savings going on, on best selling products at InfoWarsStores.com.
[03:17:07.833 --> 03:17:12.857]  And it's your last chance to really get these great deals.
[03:17:12.857 --> 03:17:15.459]  Because we all have to stick together on this.
[03:17:16.471 --> 03:17:32.340]  If we don't unite for peace and to restore freedom, again, you look at the cover of our Trends Journal, U.S.S.A., United States, United Soviet States of America.
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:35.482]  We have to fight for freedom.
[03:17:35.482 --> 03:17:36.423]  We'll be right back.
[03:17:36.423 --> 03:17:39.786]  I told you this five months ago, and now it's official.
[03:17:39.786 --> 03:17:43.050]  The lockdown is directed by the United Nations and is permanent.
[03:17:43.050 --> 03:17:57.104]  The psychological war chiefs that developed the COVID-19 mind control hoax knew that once they got the public for several months to wear masks and social distance, they would be able to permanently turn it on and off anytime they want by putting handcuffs on someone.
[03:17:57.364 --> 03:18:06.391]  And then add new demands that people take forced inoculations, that they have contact tracing on their phones, and that every aspect of our lives be controlled.
[03:18:06.391 --> 03:18:13.717]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government, forced inoculation, and complete enslavement of the human population.
[03:18:13.717 --> 03:18:15.178]  This is medical tyranny.
[03:18:15.578 --> 03:18:17.480]  This is the Bill and Melinda Gates U.N.
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:18.381]  takeover.
[03:18:18.381 --> 03:18:21.543]  This is the end of civilization as you know it.
[03:18:21.543 --> 03:18:24.686]  Living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[03:18:24.686 --> 03:18:28.329]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[03:18:28.329 --> 03:18:30.371]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[03:18:30.371 --> 03:18:31.332]  Show them the numbers.
[03:18:31.332 --> 03:18:32.373]  Show them the facts.
[03:18:32.373 --> 03:18:35.536]  And explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[03:18:37.168 --> 03:18:38.930]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[03:18:38.930 --> 03:18:39.951]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:18:39.951 --> 03:18:41.012]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:18:41.012 --> 03:18:41.973]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[03:18:41.973 --> 03:18:48.961]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[03:18:48.961 --> 03:18:50.262]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:18:52.965 --> 03:18:54.427]  I just want to plug in.
[03:18:54.427 --> 03:18:58.511]  I'm a truck driver and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[03:18:58.511 --> 03:19:05.478]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[03:19:05.478 --> 03:19:13.746]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that.
[03:19:14.226 --> 03:19:19.888]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[03:19:19.888 --> 03:19:22.169]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[03:19:22.169 --> 03:19:24.630]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[03:19:24.630 --> 03:19:27.311]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[03:19:27.311 --> 03:19:31.333]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[03:19:31.333 --> 03:19:33.134]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[03:19:33.134 --> 03:19:33.874]  So that means a lot to me.
[03:19:33.874 --> 03:19:34.214]  Thank you.
[03:19:34.214 --> 03:19:35.635]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[03:19:37.131 --> 03:19:44.496]  David Rockefeller and other satanic pieces of garbage who thought they'd set up their world government.
[03:19:44.496 --> 03:19:50.240]  Believe they pulled the drain on America a long time ago.
[03:19:50.240 --> 03:19:56.625]  But if we understand that they've orchestrated this by design, if there's a mass awakening,
[03:19:58.624 --> 03:20:04.225]  It can be their unraveling, their destruction, and them going down the drain.
[03:20:04.225 --> 03:20:09.266]  The Bible tells us that many times when the enemy digs a pit for us, they themselves fall into it.
[03:20:09.266 --> 03:20:14.608]  But God is the master of the universe, but gives us free will on this planet as a test.
[03:20:14.608 --> 03:20:21.069]  It is up to us to decide whether we're going down the drain, or whether the globalists are going down the drain.
[03:20:21.069 --> 03:20:24.430]  I cannot express to listeners and viewers of this broadcast how important you are.
[03:20:27.728 --> 03:20:28.669]  Everything.
[03:20:28.669 --> 03:20:29.709]  Peacefully.
[03:20:29.709 --> 03:20:32.591]  Become the Paul Revere you know you've always been.
[03:20:32.591 --> 03:20:39.316]  God bless, and good luck.
[03:20:39.316 --> 03:20:41.938]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:58.579 --> 03:21:08.084]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:21:08.084 --> 03:21:09.385]  Hello, hello, hello.

[03:22:40.702 --> 03:22:44.724]  And of course, you know, consider subscribing to the Trends Journal.
[03:22:44.724 --> 03:22:50.166]  It's the only magazine that tells you what's going on, what's next and what to do.
[03:22:50.166 --> 03:22:51.986]  And by the way, we're having a webinar on
[03:22:54.605 --> 03:22:58.467]  Friday, Wednesday, this coming Wednesday, 7 p.m.
[03:22:58.467 --> 03:22:59.268]  Eastern Time.

[03:23:15.936 --> 03:23:22.060]  So also, if you go to OccupyPeace.com, OccupyPeace.com,
[03:23:23.224 --> 03:23:41.572]  On the 4th of July, we're holding a Unite for Peace and Restore Freedom rally right here in Colonial Kingston at the Crown Garden, right on the corner of Crown and John Street, the most historic four corners in America.
[03:23:41.572 --> 03:23:44.773]  That's a wonderful poster by Anthony Frieda.
[03:23:44.773 --> 03:23:50.576]  And we're uniting for peace and to restore freedom that's been taken away from us
[03:23:51.699 --> 03:24:00.080]  And among the speakers is Judge Andrew Napolitano from Fox.
[03:24:00.080 --> 03:24:02.081]  And he's a libertarian.
[03:24:02.081 --> 03:24:05.801]  And he's a straight-ahead cat when it comes to our rights.
[03:24:05.801 --> 03:24:15.723]  And that's what we're fighting for, to restore our rights that have been robbed from us by these low-life scum making up these rules and regulations.
[03:24:15.723 --> 03:24:17.544]  They're not laws.
[03:24:17.544 --> 03:24:19.264]  They don't have these executive powers.
[03:24:19.264 --> 03:24:20.284]  They granted it to them.
[03:24:21.425 --> 03:24:22.766]  So that's July 4th.
[03:24:22.766 --> 03:24:38.116]  We're holding a rally and if Black Lives could protest and all the others could do it, so can I. So I'm holding a rally and we need your support.
[03:24:38.116 --> 03:24:41.598]  If you can't make it here and that's what I'd love the best for you to come here.
[03:24:41.598 --> 03:24:47.962]  I want to get thousands of people and to keep this rally for peace.
[03:24:48.689 --> 03:24:51.370]  And to restore freedom going, because I've had it.
[03:24:51.370 --> 03:24:53.410]  They suck the joy out of life.
[03:24:53.410 --> 03:24:54.711]  Look at these people.
[03:24:54.711 --> 03:24:56.531]  Look at an Andy Cuomo.
[03:24:56.531 --> 03:25:00.492]  Do you think that tight cat got any joy in him?
[03:25:00.492 --> 03:25:05.134]  How about that gruesome, tight Newsome?
[03:25:05.134 --> 03:25:10.975]  They've sucked the joy out of life because joy does not exist in their life.
[03:25:10.975 --> 03:25:13.776]  They're miserable witnears.
[03:25:13.776 --> 03:25:16.637]  They're dead people.
[03:25:17.219 --> 03:25:25.723]  They don't have a soul or passion, and they're putting that on us by robbing us of our future.
[03:25:25.723 --> 03:25:35.929]  So please go to OccupyPeace.com, go to TheTransjournal.com, donate, subscribe, support InfoWars.
[03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:41.952]  We have to join together, because I am a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:25:44.679 --> 03:25:49.260]  And I will fight for peace.
[03:25:49.260 --> 03:25:50.540]  The Prince of Peace don't fight.
[03:25:50.540 --> 03:25:51.300]  Yes, they do.
[03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:57.881]  Remember, Jesus Christ became violent when he whipped the money changers to get him out of the temple.
[03:25:57.881 --> 03:25:58.802]  So take it easy.
[03:25:58.802 --> 03:26:02.942]  Because if we don't stand up and fight for our freedoms, we're gone.
[03:26:02.942 --> 03:26:11.344]  So again, do what you can to support InfoWars, Occupy Peace, the Fourth of July rally, and Trends Journal.
[03:26:11.344 --> 03:26:12.744]  So going on to the economy.
[03:26:14.761 --> 03:26:18.463]  New York faces 20% loss in hotel rooms.
[03:26:18.463 --> 03:26:22.525]  All right?
[03:26:22.525 --> 03:26:36.473]  Since 2015, the city added 15,000 rooms and has 4,000 in the pipeline and 6,000 next year.
[03:26:36.473 --> 03:26:40.235]  And now they're closed down.
[03:26:40.235 --> 03:26:41.796]  New York's occupancy rate was 47.1%.
[03:26:47.648 --> 03:26:50.449]  Ending June 6th.
[03:26:50.449 --> 03:26:52.390]  Tourism is dead.
[03:26:52.390 --> 03:26:54.571]  You want to get on an airplane?
[03:26:54.571 --> 03:26:56.311]  Isn't that going to be fun?
[03:26:56.311 --> 03:27:01.813]  You get your temperature checked in the United Soviet States of America.
[03:27:01.813 --> 03:27:03.734]  We will invade your body.
[03:27:03.734 --> 03:27:06.675]  We will track you everywhere you go.
[03:27:06.675 --> 03:27:08.296]  You will be in our control.
[03:27:08.296 --> 03:27:10.217]  Isn't it going to?
[03:27:10.217 --> 03:27:16.359]  Oh, and then, by the way, when you go in the airplane, you got to wear a mask and they're not serving alcohol anymore.
[03:27:18.533 --> 03:27:30.076]  The morons, they actually say this crap, like that gruesome Newsome over there, they'll allow people to sit outside in restaurants and not wear masks and eat.
[03:27:30.076 --> 03:27:31.676]  Not wear masks and eat?
[03:27:31.676 --> 03:27:34.397]  How the hell do you eat with a mask on?
[03:27:34.397 --> 03:27:36.898]  And drink?
[03:27:36.898 --> 03:27:38.438]  What do you mean, how do you do it?
[03:27:38.438 --> 03:27:39.898]  Don't you know who I am?
[03:27:39.898 --> 03:27:41.859]  I am your leader!
[03:27:41.859 --> 03:27:46.160]  I am a leader of a little lowlife scum like Newsome!
[03:27:47.853 --> 03:27:58.344]  And Cuomo, and Whitmer, and witness all over the country, with the exception of a few.
[03:27:58.344 --> 03:28:06.191]  Hey, remember how I did a story about how the toilet paper record, the New York Times, they call themselves the paper record.
[03:28:06.191 --> 03:28:08.794]  It's only good for one thing to do.
[03:28:08.794 --> 03:28:09.815]  And there he is.
[03:28:09.815 --> 03:28:11.557]  Look at that tight little clown.
[03:28:12.370 --> 03:28:17.033]  I'm gonna suck the joy out of your life because I don't have any in mine.
[03:28:17.033 --> 03:28:20.896]  I'm little Andy Cuomo, an arrogant daddy's boy.
[03:28:20.896 --> 03:28:24.178]  Would be nowhere if daddy wasn't Mario Cuomo.
[03:28:24.178 --> 03:28:26.280]  Alright?
[03:28:26.280 --> 03:28:34.946]  So going back, what they've done is they've destroyed the economy making up this crap.
[03:28:34.946 --> 03:28:36.967]  So tourism is dead.
[03:28:36.967 --> 03:28:38.588]  Restaurant business is dead.
[03:28:38.588 --> 03:28:41.270]  Oh, and you gotta be six feet away.
[03:28:42.290 --> 03:28:45.214]  How about making up more crap?
[03:28:45.214 --> 03:28:47.757]  Oh, the scientific proof, Solenti!
[03:28:47.757 --> 03:28:49.679]  Don't you know who I am?
[03:28:49.679 --> 03:28:51.982]  I am your leader!
[03:28:51.982 --> 03:28:56.407]  The wind stops blowing at precisely six feet.
[03:28:56.407 --> 03:29:02.274]  It doesn't go horizontal, doesn't go vertical, doesn't go around in a circle.
[03:29:03.115 --> 03:29:09.059]  It stops at exactly six feet, but we could have all the protesters out there.
[03:29:09.059 --> 03:29:13.081]  And I'm a little clown boy like that other jerk I forgot.
[03:29:13.081 --> 03:29:17.264]  Every one of you guys that I'm calling out, I'll call you out man to man.
[03:29:17.264 --> 03:29:19.045]  Leave your little boys behind.
[03:29:19.045 --> 03:29:21.526]  I'm tired of you robbing my rights.
[03:29:21.526 --> 03:29:23.568]  That little boy, Wolf.
[03:29:23.568 --> 03:29:24.929]  That little clown wolf.
[03:29:24.929 --> 03:29:26.770]  What wolf in Pennsylvania?
[03:29:26.770 --> 03:29:30.292]  Puppy dog Pennsylvania governor.
[03:29:31.371 --> 03:29:45.775]  He marches with the people protesting on Black Lives Matter, and you're telling me I can't have a rally to unite for peace and to restore freedom?
[03:29:45.775 --> 03:29:50.456]  Hey, boys, that's for you.
[03:29:50.456 --> 03:29:53.157]  Come and stop me.
[03:29:53.157 --> 03:29:57.598]  Little Andy Cuomo, come and stop Celente.
[03:29:57.598 --> 03:29:59.999]  I'm broadcasting it all over the world.
[03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:07.963]  Fourth of July rally to unite for peace and to restore freedom.
[03:30:07.963 --> 03:30:11.885]  And the restore freedom came from Judge Napolitano.
[03:30:11.885 --> 03:30:17.627]  That's why he's coming to fight to restore freedom.
[03:30:17.627 --> 03:30:18.788]  So we need your help.
[03:30:18.788 --> 03:30:19.988]  We need your support.
[03:30:19.988 --> 03:30:26.992]  OccupyPeace.com, TrendsJournal.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:30:26.992 --> 03:30:28.232]  Get those specials.
[03:30:28.232 --> 03:30:28.652]  24 hours left.
[03:30:31.294 --> 03:30:32.815]  Don't be late.
[03:30:32.815 --> 03:30:35.898]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:35.898 --> 03:30:37.560]  It's finally here.
[03:30:37.560 --> 03:30:41.663]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[03:30:41.663 --> 03:30:48.029]  Available now for 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:48.029 --> 03:30:57.458]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal Nascent Iodine.
[03:30:58.218 --> 03:31:12.788]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[03:31:12.788 --> 03:31:20.854]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.
[03:31:21.534 --> 03:31:29.147]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off intro pricing at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:31:29.147 --> 03:31:33.093]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:31:35.165 --> 03:31:47.156]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die if we did not do exactly as they said.
[03:31:47.156 --> 03:31:49.138]  And it turned out it was all fraud.
[03:31:49.138 --> 03:31:56.065]  The models, the testing, taking regular deaths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[03:31:56.305 --> 03:31:57.426]  But none of them are getting sued.
[03:31:57.426 --> 03:31:59.727]  None of them are getting prosecuted.
[03:31:59.727 --> 03:32:01.948]  None of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates.
[03:32:01.948 --> 03:32:08.050]  The FDA shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[03:32:08.050 --> 03:32:16.815]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the number's spiking and why it'll be 200,000 dead by the election.
[03:32:16.815 --> 03:32:18.755]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[03:32:18.755 --> 03:32:21.597]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city.
[03:32:21.597 --> 03:32:23.017]  We've got a lockdown again.
[03:32:23.017 --> 03:32:23.838]  Everything's over.
[03:32:24.338 --> 03:32:28.208]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[03:32:28.208 --> 03:32:32.238]  Either we expose the COVID hoax, or we're all permanently enslaved by it.
[03:32:32.238 --> 03:32:32.779]  Your choice.
[03:32:37.404 --> 03:32:42.626]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[03:32:42.626 --> 03:32:46.908]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[03:32:46.908 --> 03:32:51.350]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[03:32:51.350 --> 03:32:59.753]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[03:32:59.753 --> 03:33:06.976]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breeze uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[03:33:07.396 --> 03:33:11.019]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[03:33:11.019 --> 03:33:16.324]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[03:33:16.324 --> 03:33:24.411]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[03:33:24.411 --> 03:33:29.776]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[03:33:29.776 --> 03:33:32.058]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.

[03:34:56.320 --> 03:34:58.682]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:34:58.682 --> 03:35:01.404]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:35:01.404 --> 03:35:04.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:04.907 --> 03:35:07.669]  Thank you.
[03:35:07.669 --> 03:35:08.069]  Thank you.
[03:35:08.069 --> 03:35:10.171]  Thank you for having me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:10.171 --> 03:35:12.353]  And remember, do what you can.
[03:35:12.353 --> 03:35:17.097]  They have these huge savings on select best selling products.
[03:35:17.097 --> 03:35:21.080]  And there's only 25 hours left to get these great deals.
[03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:23.602]  So make sure you take advantage of them.
[03:35:23.602 --> 03:35:24.843]  Everybody needs to unite.
[03:35:25.629 --> 03:35:27.670]  Put your money where your heart and soul are.
[03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:32.551]  I'm putting mine where mine is by holding the rally and other things that I do.
[03:35:32.551 --> 03:35:36.072]  And thank you, Neil Anderson.

[03:35:45.235 --> 03:35:51.077]  We're going to have music, fun, food, and we're going.
[03:35:51.077 --> 03:35:54.538]  And if they're going to try to stop me, let's go.
[03:35:55.316 --> 03:35:56.657]  Let's go!
[03:35:56.657 --> 03:35:59.139]  Come on Cuomo!
[03:35:59.139 --> 03:36:12.129]  Again, if you gather all these, you know, Juneteenth, whatever that date is, and Black Lives Matter, I could rally to unite for peace and freedom.
[03:36:12.129 --> 03:36:13.270]  So please do what you can.
[03:36:13.270 --> 03:36:19.635]  And again, Trends Journal and our webinar on Wednesday.
[03:36:19.635 --> 03:36:20.755]  So, and that's it.
[03:36:20.755 --> 03:36:22.136]  7 p.m.
[03:36:22.136 --> 03:36:22.777]  Eastern Time.
[03:36:22.777 --> 03:36:24.218]  Just go to TrendsJournal.com.
[03:36:24.795 --> 03:36:29.918]  So I was mentioning that New York faces 20% loss in hotel rooms.
[03:36:29.918 --> 03:36:39.044]  Hilton to cut workforce salaries and laying off job reductions amount to 21,000 corporate employees.
[03:36:39.044 --> 03:36:43.887]  European car makers find glut of unsold vehicles.
[03:36:43.887 --> 03:36:50.991]  Tesla registrations in California signal steep hill for sales target.
[03:36:50.991 --> 03:36:52.132]  Their largest market,
[03:36:52.904 --> 03:36:58.346]  Registrations for the automaker fell 16% in April.
[03:36:58.346 --> 03:37:16.014]  Industry-wide registrations in the state of California fell 52% each month compared with the same period a year ago and one after another.
[03:37:16.014 --> 03:37:18.515]  The economy is going down.
[03:37:19.178 --> 03:37:23.700]  You cannot reopen in phase one, phase two, phase three.
[03:37:23.700 --> 03:37:25.721]  They're making this crap up.
[03:37:25.721 --> 03:37:30.144]  Just like they're making the crap up about wearing a mask.
[03:37:30.144 --> 03:37:34.106]  And you should see all the people up here.
[03:37:34.106 --> 03:37:35.146]  The streets are empty.
[03:37:35.146 --> 03:37:36.987]  They're empty.
[03:37:36.987 --> 03:37:39.709]  Morons walking down the street.
[03:37:39.709 --> 03:37:43.691]  That foothills of the Catskill Mountains with masks on.
[03:37:43.691 --> 03:37:45.412]  Nobody around them.
[03:37:45.412 --> 03:37:47.613]  Okay, the BS that they're telling us
[03:37:48.069 --> 03:37:52.873]  Is that you have to wear a mask so if somebody has the virus, you won't catch it.
[03:37:52.873 --> 03:37:56.076]  Or if you have the virus, you won't spread it.
[03:37:56.076 --> 03:37:57.017]  Right or wrong?
[03:37:57.017 --> 03:37:58.658]  That's what they say.
[03:37:58.658 --> 03:38:00.980]  Well, okay.
[03:38:00.980 --> 03:38:02.561]  A jerk!
[03:38:02.561 --> 03:38:04.183]  A moron!
[03:38:04.183 --> 03:38:06.645]  A imbecile!
[03:38:06.645 --> 03:38:13.590]  What are you doing driving with the windows up in your car and a mask on?
[03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:16.533]  What are you doing wearing a mask when no one's around you?
[03:38:18.291 --> 03:38:22.472]  And again, the Trends Journal will be out tomorrow.
[03:38:22.472 --> 03:38:23.913]  We're doing a whole piece on it.
[03:38:23.913 --> 03:38:28.254]  Face masks, dangers and the demented.
[03:38:28.254 --> 03:38:32.655]  Wear masks, get sick.
[03:38:32.655 --> 03:38:37.897]  One after another, scaring the young, killing the old.
[03:38:37.897 --> 03:38:45.619]  Little kids growing up, little, little, little kids growing up, now going to school, get their temperature taken,
[03:38:46.624 --> 03:38:51.865]  And now being programmed to wear a mask.
[03:38:51.865 --> 03:38:55.786]  Morons and imbeciles of all ages.
[03:38:55.786 --> 03:39:04.488]  The reason they wear them in China is because of the filthy, stinking, rotten air.
[03:39:04.488 --> 03:39:10.789]  Over 1.5 million people died there last year.
[03:39:10.789 --> 03:39:13.810]  Because of air pollution related diseases.
[03:39:13.810 --> 03:39:15.710]  This is not natural.
[03:39:18.715 --> 03:39:20.456]  This is sick.
[03:39:20.456 --> 03:39:24.597]  And again, all the facts are in your Trends Journal.
[03:39:24.597 --> 03:39:30.060]  So what else is going on on the economic front to show you what it's looking like?
[03:39:30.060 --> 03:39:40.204]  The flight to the suburbs is real and growing as coronavirus changes the way people live.
[03:39:40.204 --> 03:39:43.785]  This is just out of CNBC.
[03:39:43.785 --> 03:39:46.026]  As the real estate market began to reopen in May,
[03:39:46.738 --> 03:39:52.324]  Home searches and suburban zip codes jumped 13%.
[03:39:52.324 --> 03:40:02.173]  More than half the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas are seeing increased interest in the suburbs.
[03:40:02.173 --> 03:40:05.577]  Suburban housing market heats up.
[03:40:05.577 --> 03:40:10.762]  Matter of fact, yeah, this is from the Wall Street Journal.
[03:40:12.182 --> 03:40:25.364]  When Jacob Knoll left Manhattan last year to rent a home in New Paltz, New York, about 90 minutes from New York City, he waited to see how much he liked the town before committing to buy there.
[03:40:25.364 --> 03:40:27.805]  Now that hesitance is costing him.
[03:40:27.805 --> 03:40:29.985]  Homes in New Paltz are selling quickly.
[03:40:29.985 --> 03:40:32.726]  And it goes on.
[03:40:32.726 --> 03:40:35.586]  We're right next to New Paltz in Kingston.
[03:40:35.586 --> 03:40:39.667]  This whole area is changing because people are freaking out moving out of the city.
[03:40:40.731 --> 03:40:42.011]  What does it mean?
[03:40:42.011 --> 03:40:53.534]  Again, whether it's New York or San Francisco's office market cools as startups retrench and others as well.
[03:40:53.534 --> 03:40:56.515]  Commercial real estate sector is going to go down.
[03:40:56.515 --> 03:41:07.177]  The numbers are going down in San Francisco also has a glut of subleased spaces that high tech companies lay off workers on and on and on.
[03:41:07.177 --> 03:41:09.638]  New Yorkers resist office return.
[03:41:10.658 --> 03:41:12.480]  People are afraid to go on the subways.
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:14.081]  They're afraid to mass commute.
[03:41:14.081 --> 03:41:16.163]  They're telling people to stay home.
[03:41:16.163 --> 03:41:25.731]  The cities are going to decline big time as long as they have these stupid rules still in place.
[03:41:25.731 --> 03:41:30.595]  Investors flee market volatility by going into cash.
[03:41:30.595 --> 03:41:35.139]  Money market funds, are you ready for this?
[03:41:35.139 --> 03:41:36.240]  They swell to $4.6 trillion.
[03:41:38.939 --> 03:41:46.743]  And that's the highest level on record since they started doing this data back in 1992.
[03:41:46.743 --> 03:41:52.846]  Americans skip millions of loan payments as coronavirus takes economic toll.
[03:41:52.846 --> 03:41:58.529]  Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:58.529 --> 03:41:59.870]  One after another.
[03:41:59.870 --> 03:42:01.471]  Carnival posts $4.37 billion loss.
[03:42:07.052 --> 03:42:12.813]  Once booming San Francisco apartment market reverses.
[03:42:12.813 --> 03:42:15.253]  Lawn equipment maker misses debt payment.
[03:42:15.253 --> 03:42:17.194]  Briggs and Stratton.
[03:42:17.194 --> 03:42:19.954]  Go on and on and on.
[03:42:19.954 --> 03:42:22.655]  And by the way, that's what we do in the Trends Journal.
[03:42:22.655 --> 03:42:24.855]  We put all the facts down, tell you what it means.
[03:42:24.855 --> 03:42:28.376]  These movie theaters are going to reopen and you got to wear masks.
[03:42:28.376 --> 03:42:29.296]  Isn't that going to be fun?
[03:42:29.296 --> 03:42:32.637]  Oh, it's going to be fun to eat that popcorn with a mask.
[03:42:32.637 --> 03:42:34.457]  Oh yeah, we got a popcorn eating mask.
[03:42:34.457 --> 03:42:34.977]  That's right.
[03:42:35.811 --> 03:42:40.492]  Well, we'll make the whole mask of popcorn and maybe you can eat your way through it by the end of the show.
[03:42:40.492 --> 03:42:42.853]  How about that?
[03:42:42.853 --> 03:42:45.294]  And maybe we'll stick something up.
[03:42:45.294 --> 03:42:46.294]  You know what?
[03:42:46.294 --> 03:42:48.475]  And this way you could drink it.
[03:42:48.475 --> 03:42:50.456]  Yeah, we'll put it into your body.
[03:42:50.456 --> 03:42:53.837]  You won't be able to open your mouth.
[03:42:53.837 --> 03:42:58.598]  And again, this virus, this mask wearing, all the facts are in the New Trends Journal.
[03:42:58.598 --> 03:43:00.079]  I'll be out tomorrow.
[03:43:00.079 --> 03:43:01.379]  It's a farce.
[03:43:01.379 --> 03:43:02.319]  The whole thing.
[03:43:02.319 --> 03:43:04.420]  There's no scientific evidence to back it up.
[03:43:05.401 --> 03:43:11.163]  But they've sucked the joy out of life and most of the little people buy it.
[03:43:11.163 --> 03:43:19.427]  But it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men and women.
[03:43:19.427 --> 03:43:21.448]  Samuel Adams.
[03:43:21.448 --> 03:43:33.233]  And we are that tireless minority that tunes into InfoWard and other places where we're spreading the truth rather than
[03:43:34.175 --> 03:43:41.761]  The junk stream media that they're shoving down our throats, piece by piece, day by day.
[03:43:41.761 --> 03:43:43.843]  Oh, the virus.
[03:43:43.843 --> 03:43:45.424]  Oh, the cases are adding up.
[03:43:45.424 --> 03:43:47.886]  More cases, more cases.
[03:43:47.886 --> 03:43:51.449]  You have more cases because they're testing people more.
[03:43:51.449 --> 03:43:54.912]  Again, only by the data.
[03:43:54.912 --> 03:44:03.959]  When you add up the coronavirus to the all the other flus and viruses of major extent throughout the last century, this adds up.
[03:44:04.505 --> 03:44:08.026]  Had nothing!
[03:44:08.026 --> 03:44:12.668]  It's the media that began to sell it.
[03:44:12.668 --> 03:44:14.409]  We said it at the first.
[03:44:14.409 --> 03:44:19.531]  The clown, Zucker, on CNN who runs the show.
[03:44:19.531 --> 03:44:26.113]  We had the quote from him telling his staff to stay on it because it was boosting ratings.
[03:44:26.113 --> 03:44:32.635]  And these sick politicians did it so they could gain more power.
[03:44:32.635 --> 03:44:33.896]  So the media pumped it up.
[03:44:34.707 --> 03:44:41.650]  And these sick politicians have robbed us of our joy, beauty, liberty, and love, but we're fighting back for it.
[03:44:41.650 --> 03:44:50.275]  And so please join us at the rally on the 4th of July to unite for peace and to restore freedom.
[03:44:50.275 --> 03:44:52.176]  Again, Judge Napolitano will be here.
[03:44:52.176 --> 03:44:57.298]  And the webinar on Wednesday, 7 p.m.
[03:44:57.298 --> 03:44:58.299]  Eastern Time.
[03:44:58.299 --> 03:45:00.700]  Go to TrendsJournal.com.
[03:45:00.700 --> 03:45:02.081]  And, of course, the magazine.
[03:45:02.081 --> 03:45:02.841]  I have to tell you,
[03:45:03.257 --> 03:45:04.698]  Not because it's my magazine.
[03:45:04.698 --> 03:45:11.624]  There's no weekly like it, no magazine like it, that tells you what's going on, what it means, and what's next.
[03:45:11.624 --> 03:45:17.588]  And of course, you have to support InfoWars to keep the truth and freedom going.
[03:45:17.588 --> 03:45:21.551]  So do what you can, put your money where your heart and mind are.
[03:45:21.551 --> 03:45:22.812]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:45:22.812 --> 03:45:23.453]  See you next week.
