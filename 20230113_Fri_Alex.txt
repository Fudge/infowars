[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Info Wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:52.000]  I have decided we really need camps for adults. And we need the kind of camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  There are millions of Americans, almost all white, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  There are millions of people who believe that the election was rigged. How do you begin to deprogram them?
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  Once we educate them, we coach them on how to interact and empower the person to start thinking for themselves.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  There are members of a cult, the Trumpist cult, and we have to be deprogrammed.
[01:29.000 --> 01:36.000]  Because they've been brainwashed, Joy. I really believe that they have been brainwashed by this misinformation campaign.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  So how do you deradicalize these people?
[01:39.000 --> 01:48.000]  We probably need to double, triple, quadruple, or increase funding for these deradicalization programs.
[01:48.000 --> 02:09.000]  It's 11.59 a radio-free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn. Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[02:09.000 --> 02:22.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  The FBI has arrested hundreds of people in connection with the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol, and more could be on the way.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  Approximately 800 people have been arrested.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  Joseph Biggs was indicted earlier this week by a federal grand jury along with four other members of the group with conspiracy to commit sedition.
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  Joseph Biggs facilitated political violence even if they weren't armed and didn't assault anybody at the Capitol on January 6th.
[02:47.000 --> 03:03.000]  A couple hours ago, I was informed by my attorney that there is a warrant out for my arrest with allegations involving January 6th. I will have to turn myself in Monday morning.
[03:03.000 --> 03:18.000]  The DOJ, the five administration, announced is charging a host at InfoWars, a man called Owen Shroyer, with several federal crimes, including, quote, entering a restricted area on January 6th.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  Well, that sounds bad. What did Owen Shroyer do? He didn't go inside the Capitol building on January 6th. He stood on the Capitol steps with hundreds of other people.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  Enrique Tario pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges, including the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.
[03:29.000 --> 03:38.000]  As for those text messages, the January 6th committee is now planning to subpoena them as it looks into Jones' role in the Capitol attack.
[03:38.000 --> 03:47.000]  The American people are not buying the whole fraud. The January 6th was the new Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11, all these preposterous ass-ine things that were said and done.
[03:47.000 --> 03:59.000]  January 6th was a false flag. Everybody knows it at this point, from Ray Epps to the Pipe Bomber. I mean, it's obvious. It's all coming out. It's all being exposed.
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  We're not going to be the ones on trial anymore. No, globalist, we're coming after you. Nuremberg 2.0 begins now.
[04:06.000 --> 04:19.000]  Wolverines!
[04:19.000 --> 04:30.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[04:36.000 --> 05:01.000]  It's Friday, ladies and gentlemen. January 13th, 2023. The special Friday 13 transmission. Straight ahead.
[05:01.000 --> 05:14.000]  I'm going to explain one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds. Famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[05:14.000 --> 05:24.000]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die. And it's the same si-op today. Info Wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[05:24.000 --> 05:36.000]  Because the facts of what we've covered is coming true. But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[05:36.000 --> 05:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Info Wars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners. If you decide we're done, we're done.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  If you decide to go to infowarstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[05:51.000 --> 05:59.000]  It is all in your hands. So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists. Go to infowarstore.com right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[06:22.000 --> 06:43.000]  I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes. I can sleep for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles.
[06:43.000 --> 07:00.000]  Oh yeah. The Eiffel Tower and the Tartmonger, let's see our clear days. You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see you right through the face.
[07:00.000 --> 07:16.000]  You're gonna poke at you, you're gonna choke on it too, you're gonna lose that smile, because of why. I can sleep for miles and miles. It's Friday, January 13th, 2023.
[07:16.000 --> 07:23.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next four hours ahead of the war room here on the Info Wars Network with Owen Shroyo, 3PM Central.
[07:23.000 --> 07:32.000]  Wow. Look, I'm not gonna talk about the Pierce Morgan interview yesterday until the third hour.
[07:32.000 --> 07:43.000]  I'm gonna play some excerpts and just look at it as a exhibit of disinformation and propaganda, because I wouldn't just cover it if it was an interview I was involved in.
[07:43.000 --> 07:54.000]  That's not really newsworthy enough, but the level of deception, the level of manipulation and how they use this playbook is very important to understand.
[07:54.000 --> 08:07.000]  So that's coming up for some of the third hour. We have Gerald Salente, one of our favorite guests joining us to talk about the trends for 2023 and beyond in the second hour today.
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  And I intend to open the phones up so you can also ask specific questions of Gerald Salente.
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  And in the meantime, wow, are we gonna be covering the waterfront?
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  You can learn a lot about where our hijacked government wants to take us.
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  If you look at operations they run in places like Brazil and areas of Africa and the Middle East and just all over the world,
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  but also especially what globalists are doing in the UK and the European Union.
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  And one of those big things they're doing is outlawing their political opposition after they steal elections.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  And there's a report we're gonna be getting to coming up here in the next segment.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  Brazilian concentration camps exposed and the government's admitting they have these camps they built.
[08:58.000 --> 09:11.000]  And now they're putting their political opposition in there, including people that just won House and Senate seats who are patriots and were in Bolsonaro's party.
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.000]  And they're forcing poison COVID shots on them.
[09:17.000 --> 09:27.000]  So we're going to be going over that coming up because whatever you see being done there, the globalist plan to bring here, it's all being run by the State Department.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  The State Department even brags that they helped Lula steal this way back into office.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  So that's why you see the parallels being extremely similar.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  And that's why Bolsonaro had to leave and go to Florida because they promised to arrest him if he lost the election.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  That's what left us do. That's the authoritarian model they carry out.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  So that's an important stack.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  We're gonna tackle very early.
[09:55.000 --> 10:09.000]  MTG was on yesterday and she said what is true and what's politically obvious, not just by what the Justice Department's done or the way the governmental officials are handling it,
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  but the way the media is handling it, ABC, CNN, the Associated Press.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  Oh, Biden's got to go.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  Biden's engaged in criminal activity.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  He had these documents illegally.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  Trump's allowed to declassify documents that Biden isn't.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  So they can fry Biden and fry Trump is the move they're making.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  Yesterday in the videos on M4Wars.com, MTG says deep state preparing to dump Biden.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  A.G. Gardland appoints special prosecutor, probe Biden's classified dots.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  Biden's top secret document problem.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  He is on the way out.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  Biden's political future clouded by classified document probe AP.
[10:50.000 --> 11:01.000]  So they all covered up the 100 Biden laptop that's way worse than these illegal documents, which are illegal, pertaining to China, Ukraine,
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  the European Union and other key areas.
[11:04.000 --> 11:14.000]  In the Biden laptop, this is one of the Biden laptops, it's the payoffs he's making to his dad, the payoffs he's making to others.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  And there is his son talking about how they're under the command of the head of Chinese intelligence.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  But now that video from a year ago of Biden driving around in an agreeably really cool green Corvette.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  Got good taste on that.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  Backing it up into the garage where they now admit there were tons of these documents stored.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  You can even see piles of the documents there in the background as he's backing in.
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.000]  But a larger discussion, he's been a placeholder, he's been a true Marionette, a true puppet the entire time.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  But why are they getting rid of him now?
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  Because they don't want him to announce he's about to run for president again.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  He actually thinks he's the president.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  That's the big joke about him.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  And Obama doesn't think he's an effective puppet, even with the election fraud, they can get back in in two years.
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  So they're preparing to flush him down the toilet.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  Well, they were moving from office.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  I don't know, but they certainly want to let him know we're going to prosecute you if you don't go away.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Which is what they do to who they don't want to run for office, whether it's Trump or Biden.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  If you like the candidate or dislike him, if the globalists don't want you, well, they're going to block you.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  It's like Tulsi Gabbard's won the first two debates.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  All the poll numbers showed she was the front runner and they just removed her from the media, no coverage, and put out fake polls.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  And then she basically got almost no votes at the voting booth because she'd been taken out of the discussion.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  So there's different ways they manipulate elections, different ways they do it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  Yeah, they have fake mail-in ballots.
[12:38.000 --> 12:39.000]  Yeah, they have deputable voting.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  Yeah, they have illegal aliens voting.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  But more importantly, they manipulate the whole process up to that point as top computer scientists Epstein,
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  not of Jeffrey Epstein's fame, exposed years ago.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  He said there'll be no more free elections four years ago in testimony.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  If Google and Facebook and Twitter are allowed to manipulate the algorithms with AI.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  So that's coming up as well.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  Multiple Biden aides have been interviewed by the federal law enforcement and classified document review.
[13:06.000 --> 13:21.000]  Second set obviously found at his house, though he said he had no idea why they were founded his Penn State office in a building paid for six years ago by the Communist Chinese that he literally moved into.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  It cannot get more ridiculous.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  And folks are looking at the numbers of Chinese money going to Penn State was negligible until he got in and then hundreds of millions of dollars poured in after he became the chair of that.
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  Now, speaking of AI manipulation, this ties into all that we're going to be getting to this as well.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  AI replaced humans in job role for months and no one noticed.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  Popular news outlet has been publishing AI articles since November and no one noticed.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  Now, what am I told you the last couple of years?
[13:56.000 --> 14:10.000]  I said most of these articles on Buzzfeed and on even CNN and in articles over that seen at you name it are written by AI.
[14:10.000 --> 14:19.000]  The CIA about 15 years ago came out with a headline CIA has created AI that writes articles on its own.
[14:19.000 --> 14:30.000]  And that way the CIA can put in a couple pages of data and then make it look like thousands of writers are saying it because it rewrites it different ways of different combinations.
[14:30.000 --> 14:40.000]  So basically you write one article that's 10 pages long and then it gets recycled into thousands of other articles that are a page to three pages long and the AI just moves around.
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.000]  And I remember seeing articles I could tell didn't quite make sense and didn't have names on them or had names I'd look up that don't exist.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  So they now admit in the latest document, I thought the one last week was 14.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  I got mixed up. This is 14.
[14:59.000 --> 15:10.000]  We added up 14 to Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone last night and it confirms that congressional trolls.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  Twitter files show company new Democrat claims about Russia bots were false.
[15:15.000 --> 15:24.000]  But indeed there were massive bot farms posing as humans up to 80% of Twitter was computer bots.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  They are interacting with these bots. These bots are complimenting you if they agree.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  They're attacking you if they disagree. They're reporting you if they disagree.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They're promoting you if they agree.
[15:34.000 --> 15:45.000]  And most of these people on Facebook and Twitter, it's not just Twitter, they are interacting and living their lives out with imaginary friends online that are giving them up votes and telling them great job.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  And it's a form of currency.
[15:47.000 --> 15:56.000]  But it's inflated. It's not real. It's fraudulent, but it does give them the dopamine kick they need all this and more straight ahead.
[16:18.000 --> 16:29.000]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment to keep Info Wars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  They're already given to pregnant women.
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.000]  Info Wars users are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  Let's do it together.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  And the fight starts at infowars.com.

[19:31.000 --> 19:40.000]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms including

[20:11.000 --> 20:26.000]  So I talked about something last segment I'm going to dig into more and it ties into Biden and ties into all of us.
[20:26.000 --> 20:38.000]  Think about how we just calmly discussed the fact that oh AI for many years secretly is writing news articles with information, with disinformation it's fed.
[20:38.000 --> 20:46.000]  That way you don't have a reporter that can come back later and say I was told to lie or you can't even basically expose the person.
[20:46.000 --> 20:56.000]  It's following orders, it doesn't have a conscience and it goes to the military and drones and combat robots being the real in game of the system
[20:56.000 --> 21:04.000]  because they won't ask questions, they will follow criminal orders and they can have their memories wiped.
[21:04.000 --> 21:11.000]  So there's no record of what the robots actually did. This is the world I'm talking about that removes humans from the process.
[21:11.000 --> 21:23.000]  On Tuesday I talked about how until the 1990s most public schools and schools for that matter made you use your mind to do math
[21:23.000 --> 21:35.000]  even though calculators, the Texas Instrument Calculator were around since the early 1970s and were thousands of dollars then and hundreds of dollars by the 80s and then just a few dollars by the 90s.
[21:35.000 --> 21:42.000]  And that through that process it's on record that most people are completely mathematically illiterate now.
[21:42.000 --> 21:53.000]  And I said the calculator is a great tool but look how it basically removed mathematics from our species. Think about cell phones.
[21:53.000 --> 22:02.000]  Until cell phones and until iPhones and smartphones came out in the last 15 years, I could remember the phone number I had when I was a teenager.
[22:02.000 --> 22:11.000]  I could remember my grandma's phone number, I could remember some of my girlfriend's numbers because I was trained, we were all trained to commit numbers to memory.
[22:11.000 --> 22:18.000]  Once I dialed a number two or three times, I could remember that number. You couldn't write it down but you could just punch it into the phone.
[22:18.000 --> 22:30.000]  It was mental memory, a form of like muscle memory. And now I can't remember my own phone number most of the time unless I go look it up because we all count on the phone to have the information for us.
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.000]  It's very convenient. And so the Democrats picked that up and the clip went viral online on Twitter and Facebook and news articles were written about it.
[22:38.000 --> 22:49.000]  Jones says the beginning of the end of humanity was calculators. No, that's not what I said. I said it was an example of how we were becoming domesticated mentally or beyond domesticated.
[22:49.000 --> 23:00.000]  I mean, go back to skeletons they dig up in ancient England, in ancient Africa, in ancient Europe, in ancient Asia, ancient, you name it.
[23:00.000 --> 23:24.000]  The people they estimate were twice as strong as they are today and a man from 5,000 years ago in England or a man from 1,000 years ago in Africa or a man from 6,000 years ago in the Middle East was twice as strong as the average man today just with their genetics.
[23:24.000 --> 23:42.000]  But now we're becoming softer and softer and softer and the televisions and the dopamine and the smartphones on record have lowered the average human's attention span in the modern world to less than 14 seconds.
[23:42.000 --> 23:58.000]  The attention span of a goldfish is about 16 seconds. A lot of fish have short attention spans and short memories. That's why you have Finding Nemo and there's the joke with Dory, the fish that can't remember 10 seconds to the next because it just doesn't have an attention span.
[23:58.000 --> 24:12.000]  And once you haven't been trained to have an attention span, even if you're watching a two-hour program, there's lots of new things happening every three or four seconds. You look at old movies, they're drawn out, they build the scenes.
[24:12.000 --> 24:19.000]  There's more to the lighting and more to the nuance and you watch it and it's so much more fulfilling and real.
[24:19.000 --> 24:29.000]  And now you look at the Avengers movies and the rest of it, stuff's changing every two seconds and that wires the brain in all the studies to not operate as well.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  And television and screen time is directly linked, going back decades, to early onset of neurological disorders and things like Alzheimer's.
[24:37.000 --> 24:49.000]  Let's type into Google Web, television, watching linked to Alzheimer's and British study, you'll get a 15, 16, 17-year-old articles out of the BBC.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  But now that I've even run those articles and point that out and warn people, so what does it mean when humans are taken out of the equation?
[24:56.000 --> 25:11.000]  Well, it means we become, by action, obsolete, which is what Noah Yamal Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are telling you.
[25:11.000 --> 25:20.000]  So do we really want to be obsolete? Do we really want to be sedentary? Do we want to be like the people on the big cruise ship floating around in space in the movie Wally?
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  Because that's how the establishment sees you and that's the system they set up and I'm not perfect either. I'm not saying I don't watch too much TV or eat too much food or not exercise enough.
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  But at least I understand the condition I'm in, I understand the condition they want to get me deeper into and knowing is literally half of that fight.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  So here it is, AI replaces humans in job role for months.
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.000]  No one noticed. A popular news outlet has been publishing articles written by AI since November, keeping it on the down low.
[25:50.000 --> 26:00.000]  According to Futurism and online marketing, Gail Bretton, tech brand CNET has been using AI writers and lots of readers don't seem to have noticed.
[26:00.000 --> 26:08.000]  Artificial intelligence replaced humans in job role for months and no one noticed.
[26:08.000 --> 26:17.000]  Professional trolls, Twitter files show company New Democrat claims about Russian bots were false, but they put out the fake news knowing was alive.
[26:17.000 --> 26:25.000]  Of course they did. Breaking New Twitter files expose how Democrat politicians knowingly spread the Russiagate lie.
[26:25.000 --> 26:35.000]  And it goes on from there. So I know you all already know this, but I'm simply saying we should have a bigger or in-depth discussion about it and ask ourselves,
[26:35.000 --> 26:44.000]  how do we basically protect ourselves from these type of systems and how do we make ourselves stronger, not weaker?
[26:44.000 --> 26:55.000]  Well, we first recognize it's going on and don't make jokes about it because it's documented that this is hurting humanity and that we're going in the wrong direction
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  and the technology can be used to empower us, but instead it's being used to enslave us.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  Obviously the big elephant in the room I haven't mentioned yet. I'm going to get to it next segment.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  Update, 54-year-old Lisa Marie Presley suffered full cardiac arrest at home, rushed to hospital and died.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  You say, well, she didn't die from the shot. It could just be a coincidence.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  Well, not when the statistics show a 13% increase in overall death year after year since the shots began, a record number.
[27:24.000 --> 27:34.000]  We've got some other unbelievable news that ties into this when we come back and then that gets into this other stack of news
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  that the whole transgender movement is a transhumanist movement for a post-human genetic engineered cybernetic world
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  and it's groups of academics and academic elites that are actually the high priest of this new system.
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  It's not about a man's right to feel like a woman and live their life as a woman. That's somebody's right and I don't hate them for it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.000]  It is a larger program to get us to accept that, then we'll accept human animal hybrids, human spliced, genetically engineered humanoids
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  and we'll be forced to accept them as having rights, but they'll be controlled by the system and programmed by the system
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  and will be a new force to be used against what's left of humanity.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  Organization of non-binary scientists influence universities, professional orgs and publications, big article on infowords.com
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  and then we've got this important stack of news.
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  University Medical System at Pittsburgh says they're going to get taxpayer money to put uteruses in men.
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  I have video of that. That's coming up next segment and we're going to get into the COVID vaccine poison news
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  and at least I'm going to read Presley straight ahead on the other side.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Then we're going to look at the economy, war, all the big trends with your old Shalinte
[28:54.000 --> 29:09.000]  and then we're going to get into a bunch of other critical news in the third hour.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aid video, but you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect,
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.000]  an amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[29:48.000 --> 29:56.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.

[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[33:28.000 --> 33:37.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.000 --> 33:47.000]  So, a lot of videos have come out in the last few years of medical ads at major universities across not just the United States but the Western world.
[33:47.000 --> 33:59.000]  Particularly the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Europe saying, hey, we're going to make a lot of money cutting women's breast off mastectomies,
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  hysterectomies cutting out their uteruses.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  We're going to make a lot of money cutting little boys' penises and testicles off.
[34:07.000 --> 34:17.000]  And then they'll mention, well, we make 50 grand on this and 20 grand on that. And our universities, you know, just done a thousand of these this year, we're ramping up to 10,000 next year.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  You've seen the chilling videos.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  And that's what this is about at the level of the hospitals is making the money.
[34:25.000 --> 34:43.000]  But the big academics and the big think tanks and MI6 and the Pritzker's and a lot of the big Republican Party donors are also pushing this, not just the Democrats and major groups like Disney and Microsoft have given every year
[34:43.000 --> 34:56.000]  millions and millions of dollars, not just here but all over the world to pay for drag queen story time with big fat, ugly men dressed like clowns who were hideous to get children to go sit in their laps.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  In some cases when the men are not even wearing underwear, they put glitter on their penises.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  And we shot this in Austin in a major event.
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.000]  Stations have asked us not even to show it, but this is what children are going through, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  If you went and sat on a man's erection that had glitter on it at a topless bar, the police would arrest you.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  It's illegal.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  But if it's a child, oh, it's liberal, it's supposedly normal.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  That's been pointed out at different school boards all over the country.
[35:26.000 --> 35:37.000]  I saw a new one that Crowder put out two days ago where the school board would not let the mother read what was in the book that the middle schoolers were given.
[35:37.000 --> 35:47.000]  And they cut her time off and say, you can't speak. So her son steps up who's in high school and says, our software at school won't let us go to this book.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  And he lists the book that has graphics of little boys having sex with old men.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  And he says, but it's in the library.
[35:55.000 --> 36:03.000]  So the software the school has won't let you go to that site, rightfully so, off of the libraries or off your laptop.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  But it can be given to the children as a book. See how evil that is?
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  We can't show you this on air.
[36:10.000 --> 36:19.000]  And I don't want to. What is given to middle school and elementary students and high schoolers, but they can give it to them.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  School board cuts off mom for reading out of sex scene from book available to students.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Yeah, there's an example. Epic times right there.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Epic times.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  So this is a big, big deal and it's scientific and it's corporately funded.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  It's not a bunch of lone perverts out there doing this.
[36:36.000 --> 36:52.000]  They have recruited many of the sex criminals to go out and do this because if you'll put up with children dancing in front of men in G strings with their Johnson's flopping around and let the kids stick money in their G strings.
[36:52.000 --> 36:59.000]  You'll go along with anything. And yeah, target sells books like let's summon demons.
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.000]  And I got a copy of the book. It's a very serious black magic, very, very dangerous stuff.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.000]  And that's what's going on. So this is a brutal assault on our children.
[37:10.000 --> 37:25.000]  They're not just assaulting them in the womb. They're not just assaulting them with poison shots or GMO or 5G. They're assaulting them to go out of their very innocence and have the state set up a sexual relationship with them about the future of their gender.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  And that leads us to this.
[37:27.000 --> 37:47.000]  Allison Simpson, who works for the UPMC Children's Hospital, that's the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, describes the possibility of uterine transplants from live donors being given to men who are trying to become women.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  Now, let me tell you how this sick part swapping operation works.
[37:51.000 --> 38:02.000]  There aren't just tens of thousands of cases a year in the U.S. alone and it's exponentially going up of 10, 12, 13, 14 year old girls having double mastectomies because they want to be a boy.
[38:02.000 --> 38:14.000]  Women are now having their uteruses removed because they quote want to be a man and then they wear plastic genitals in their pants.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  This is a big push and they're teaching kids about it in school.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  But now they're starting and it's already begun, uterine transplants.
[38:22.000 --> 38:33.000]  Uteruses are being cut out of women who don't want to be women and they're being stuck in the guts of men, even though they're not designed for it.
[38:33.000 --> 38:44.000]  Their penises and genitals are being removed and they're putting in false vaginas and there's, there it is, the Penn Medicine, Penn Uterus Transplant Program.
[38:44.000 --> 38:51.000]  Uterine transplant trials welcomes its first baby.
[38:51.000 --> 39:07.000]  So this is mad scientist stuff out of a Hellraiser novel and now men are going to start getting uterine transplants so they can say they're women and the taxpayers are going to pay for it.
[39:07.000 --> 39:15.000]  While they tell people go ahead and just kill yourself in places like California and places like Toronto and places like London, places like Berlin.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  Oh, we don't have money for your spinal surgery for a 55 year old veteran.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  Why don't you just kill yourself?
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  Society doesn't want your need you, but oh, you need a $80,000 uterus transplant?
[39:28.000 --> 39:37.000]  Oh, you want to say you're a woman so you can live in the prison for your sex crime of raping another woman because you're a woman.
[39:37.000 --> 39:44.000]  You're really a man and now you're going to go rape women and get them pregnant or have sex with them and we got to have headlines like two women had a baby.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  This is beyond occult and they know exactly what they're doing.
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  Here's a few of the clips.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  There's two of them.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  Let's just play them back to back of the spokesperson there at the UPMC Children's Hospital.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  So this is the bioethicist over your children.
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  Here it is.
[39:59.000 --> 40:06.000]  One area that had not been looked at before in any serious way was could the donors be live donors?
[40:06.000 --> 40:17.000]  Because in the original study, it was the conclusion was that they would have to be cadaver based donors or from individuals who were no longer alive.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  Right.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  So live donation has been something the community has talked about for decades.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  It was really seen as magical thinking.
[40:28.000 --> 40:36.000]  This would be a live donation from a person who was assigned female at birth but identified as a transgender man.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  And they said, well, you know, I have these parts.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  I don't want them.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  You want them.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  You need them.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  So what if I gave them to you?
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  How would that work?
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  And apparently based on their research, this is actually viable.
[40:50.000 --> 41:04.000]  Anecdotally, many but not all transgender women, especially those who transition younger in life, have expressed an interest in having children in a way that is congruent for their own bodies.
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  But it was still surprising to see the data.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  It was a fairly large study as transgender studies go.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  182 transgender women.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  60% of which were aged in the ideal 20 to 29 age range.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And most had no children.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  94% indicated they had a desire for children.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  All right, let's stop right there.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  I want to go to the next clip.
[41:27.000 --> 41:42.000]  Allison, who is a man who says that she's a woman, totally out of their mind, but running a program targeting children, goes into their personal story of wanting to have a baby.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  So we want to pay people not to have children.
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  We're attacking families.
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  We're going after them.
[41:46.000 --> 41:53.000]  But we need to spend taxpayer money to give men uteruses.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  Here it is.
[41:55.000 --> 42:06.000]  I actually transitioned as a transgender youth 30 years ago at a time when we didn't even use the word transgender very much.
[42:06.000 --> 42:23.000]  And I kept a diary and about five years ago I looked back on that diary and I was actually surprised to see that one of the biggest considerations I had at the age of 20 was the potential for pregnancy.
[42:23.000 --> 42:29.000]  And I wrote in that diary, well, I'll give the medical community 20 years.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  I'm sure they'll figure it out by then.
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.000]  30 years later, one of the main reasons I do the work I do is a desire to push us in that direction.
[42:40.000 --> 42:49.000]  And the data now supports that this is something that members of my community desperately want if it were offered.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  Now, they have record suicides.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  What they need is more mad scientists to be cut on more, cut more children's genitals off.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  This is a death cult.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  We'll be right back.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  Stay with us.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  Info Wars is winning.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Info Wars is reaching more people than ever.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  None of that's true.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  It's all being appealed.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  They want you to think Info Wars is dead.
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.000]  But if you simply stand up and support Info Wars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.

[46:56.000 --> 47:01.000]  Get the Red Pill Plus exclusively, infowarstore.com.
[47:01.000 --> 47:21.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.000 --> 47:38.000]  Every five minutes while I'm sitting here on air, the crew walks over and hands me another article.
[47:38.000 --> 47:45.000]  Every five minutes or so they bring me in more famous people, particularly young people, dying.
[47:45.000 --> 47:53.000]  We have the insurance actuary numbers. Former Alabama running back Ahmed Galloway found dead at 42.
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  He was working as a teacher at St. Louis Middle School. Former Alabama Crimson Tide running back was found dead in his apartment.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  Monday, we're just not learning, according to WVTM 13. He was 42 years old.
[48:06.000 --> 48:16.000]  Galloway was a teacher at Compton Drew Middle School in St. Louis and the school's principal, Susan Reed, set a welfare check, led the discovery.
[48:16.000 --> 48:27.000]  It's still being investigated, they're not saying the cause, but we do know how someone a little more famous died.
[48:27.000 --> 48:36.000]  52-year-old Lisa Marie Presley suffered full cardiac arrest at home a few days ago, was on life support and then died.
[48:36.000 --> 48:49.000]  Died of cardiac arrest at 54 years old, the only daughter of Elvis Presley.
[48:49.000 --> 49:11.000]  I remember during the stolen election in 2000, shooting video of buses driving around in Phoenix the day after we demonstrated there at the counting center.
[49:11.000 --> 49:20.000]  And the buses said two things. The buses said soon nanotech in new vaccines will cure cancer.
[49:20.000 --> 49:27.000]  And the other buses said heart attacks in the young are normal and you need to have your children screened.
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.000]  They're not normal, but now they are becoming the new normal. Look at this disgusting information.
[49:34.000 --> 49:43.000]  I never thought in a million years I would see this for children. Everett Public Schools Athletics Department announced a screen your teen event in March.
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.000]  The goal is to prevent sudden cardiac arrest, which is now so common.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  And what happens is these shots give you clots, they give you lesions, your child has microcarditis and they don't know it.
[49:56.000 --> 50:05.000]  They don't tell you. They think their stomach hurts most of the time. It's really hard. And then when they overexert themselves, they die.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  Free EKG heart screenings at Jackson High School on Wednesday, March 1.
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  The Nic of Time Foundation is raising awareness regarding sudden cardiac arrest in youth.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  It suggests $25 donation to help defer screening costs.
[50:19.000 --> 50:29.000]  And now in Australia, I saw a news report two weeks ago. They said, oh, they're putting thousands of defibrillators up in public places because suddenly there's so many heart attacks.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  This is just today's stack. I'm not even 10th of the way through it.
[50:33.000 --> 50:40.000]  Look at this. NBC News reports young, healthy people don't need COVID booster. What are they really doing here?
[50:40.000 --> 50:47.000]  I have a whole stack of this sudden talking point. I'm going to explain here in just a moment.
[50:47.000 --> 50:57.000]  First, I want to thank you all for your support and keeping us on air, but I really want to encourage you to go to infoworkstore.com to get products that will really enrich and empower your life.
[50:57.000 --> 51:12.000]  We have the Real Red Pill Plus sold out for more than two years finally back in stock that has a lot of great, healthy, safe, proprietary compounds that are in nature that are directly associated with making you healthier,
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.000]  making your cells healthier, and making you be able to produce your proper hormone levels.
[51:17.000 --> 51:25.000]  If you look at all the different studies, men and women have lower hormones. They're supposed to have higher synthetic hormones in their bodies.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  Some people look like mutants. That's why folks eat actual less calories today. They did 1960, but are fatter.
[51:31.000 --> 51:37.000]  This has preglonone, a bunch of other ingredients that are documented to really clean your body out and help you have better, healthier hormones.
[51:37.000 --> 51:51.000]  Men, women, everybody needs it, particularly folks above 40 because your body stops producing as much preglonone, especially in this climate of endocrine disruptors and all the chemicals and things that are in the food and water.
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.000]  Real Red Pill Plus back in stock, 50% off despite the fact it's selling out very, very quickly. We need the funds in now.
[51:57.000 --> 52:07.000]  Plus, I want those of you that never tried the product to try it, people that do try it, love it. It is our most highly rated when it comes to auto-ship product.
[52:07.000 --> 52:15.000]  It's the product that people auto-ship the most of many of our products next to X2 and X3, which is sold out, of course.
[52:15.000 --> 52:23.000]  So people really reorder this. When I first worked with a known scientist doctor to come up with this, because they were already selling at their clinic,
[52:23.000 --> 52:30.000]  and I worked with folks to make it even stronger, similar formula, it was not a big hit.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  But after about a year, it became one of our best sellers, since people by word of mouth that did try it, loved it.
[52:34.000 --> 52:41.000]  Real Red Pill Plus at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com.
[52:41.000 --> 52:53.000]  Also, 1776 Testosterone Boost is the already number one best seller in the country, under another name, the owner of the country, the company's a patriot, and lets us private label it with our own name.
[52:53.000 --> 53:01.000]  1776 Testosterone Boost is tested, is loved, works great. Folks, you really need to get it and experience it. They don't want us to have good testosterone levels.
[53:01.000 --> 53:14.000]  This helps do that. 1776 Testosterone Boost, the HGH Max Boost is sold out, but we do have in stock also from the same company, also the best selling natural painkiller of the nation.
[53:14.000 --> 53:25.000]  We've probably labeled it under the name PaimMD, PaimMD at infowarstore.com. Try it, experience it. It is really amazing.
[53:25.000 --> 53:32.000]  Those are 40% off. Real Red Pill Plus is 50% off, but also back in stock, sold out for five months, is down and out.
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  Our strongest natural, healthy sleep aid for cleaner, better, deeper sleep, so good for your immune system and your whole body.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  Take a half a drop right out of your tongue about an hour before you want to go to bed and just wait and see what happens down and out.
[53:44.000 --> 53:57.000]  Sleep support infowarstore.com, and maybe you should take a lower dose than what I said. That's what I take because it can hit some people a lot stronger than others, and I thank you all for keeping us on air.
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.000]  Okay, let's continue with what's really going on here.
[54:02.000 --> 54:14.000]  NBC reports young, healthy people don't need COVID booster. Now, I have a stack of articles from NBC News, ABC News, Yahoo News, BBC News.
[54:14.000 --> 54:24.000]  They're spiegel all in the last two days saying, you know what, you shouldn't give a booster. If you gave your child one, that's enough.
[54:24.000 --> 54:34.000]  That killed the rats pretty quick. They cut their lifespan in half, and similar to that in humans, they think, we don't know yet, it's not enough time, but we know it's devastating already.
[54:34.000 --> 54:41.000]  It's a little too obvious. So now, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, nobody in the world's even authorizing it for children.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  Bunch of European countries, others have banned these shots outright because they're not vaccines.
[54:46.000 --> 55:00.000]  But here they've done it six-month-ups and old, and you've got all these hop and contract weirdo people that want to give it to their kids, and the heart attacks and deaths are so out the chart, they're afraid it'll upset their whole sterilization long-term heart attack program.
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  It's a little too strong. It's the Moderna that does most of it. It's four Pfizer's.
[55:06.000 --> 55:17.000]  It's equivalent of four Pfizer shots, the exact same compound, same design by the folks brought to you by Bill Gates. That's come out in the documents before COVID was released.
[55:17.000 --> 55:26.000]  They were already making the new mRNA shot for COVID-19. That's mainstream news. You missed it. Tucker Carlson, Lindbeck, the documents, I covered it two plus years ago.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  It's being covered now by them, but that's pretty bombshell, isn't it?
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.000]  So they're now telling you, oh, no, no, no, no, don't do that. There's also a pang of conscience.
[55:36.000 --> 55:46.000]  So the doctors that weren't part of the conspiracy of the population, but still went along with it because they believed it was good, they're saying no now.
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  So this is giving them an out. This is giving them an out.
[55:50.000 --> 56:01.000]  Another one, FDA vaccine advisors disappointed in angry that early data about COVID-19 booster shot wasn't presented for review last year.
[56:01.000 --> 56:13.000]  So on Monday, we started covering the new FDA documents and more coming out next week that they knew it was causing heart attacks and minor carditis when they did their quiet internal studies during the rollout, not studies before, other than rats.
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  They knew how deadly it was there. Of course, they didn't want public studies.
[56:17.000 --> 56:23.000]  But now the FDA boards are saying they're mad they weren't told about the heart attacks. So this is seeing in.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  So how are they going to kind of let it out slowly so you don't get too mad?
[56:26.000 --> 56:33.000]  Oh, the FDA boards are mad that they did emergency authorization, but why the first three boards quit? Because they knew it was wrong.
[56:33.000 --> 56:39.000]  They finally found boards that said things like, we have no idea what it will do, so we're going to go ahead and do it and give it to kids.
[56:39.000 --> 56:50.000]  So I played that clip yesterday and the day before. So seeing in, oh, they're angry. They weren't told what these shots really do and they don't really protect you.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  See, that's the rats leaving the sinking ship. Here's Yahoo! I mentioned.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  Notice I tell you, I have these articles. I actually show them to you. I'm like mainstream media.
[56:57.000 --> 57:05.000]  Younger, healthier people don't need another COVID booster. Vaccine experts say challenging FDA guidance.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  Breaking. Cardiologist says likely contributory factor to excess cardiovascular deaths.
[57:10.000 --> 57:21.000]  A COVID mRNA vaccine and rollout should be suspended, pending an inquiry because he's seeing massive increase in heart attacks in his patients, including his father that died after the shot.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  We'll play that coming up next segment.
[57:24.000 --> 57:31.000]  Here's a WRAL article. One expert recommends parents avoid booster shots for healthy children.
[57:31.000 --> 57:36.000]  It goes on and on and on. The rats leaving the sinking ship.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  I'm going to play some of these clips in that next short little segment.
[57:39.000 --> 57:46.000]  And then Gerald Salente, the great trend forecaster, is going to be joining us to lay out the trends for next year and beyond.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  This is important. Please stay with us.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[57:55.000 --> 58:03.000]  I want to encourage you all to go to infowarsstore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  Gallon Out Sleep Support Liquid is very fast-acting, taken out of the tongue.
[58:08.000 --> 58:16.000]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passion flower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[58:16.000 --> 58:23.000]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.000]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent. They're all different formulas.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[58:36.000 --> 58:39.000]  So, Gallon Out sold out for more than five months.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  Now, back available at infowarsstore.com.
[58:41.000 --> 58:50.000]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the Infowar with Gallon Out Sleep Support at Infowar Store.

[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Good evening, and welcome to Tucker Carlson. Tonight is hard to remember now, but it wasn't that long ago that Andrew Cuomo was not only the governor of New York,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  but also a legitimate hero in the Democratic Party. Do you remember that?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Cuomo was the governor who legalized marijuana, who expanded Medicare, who passed strict gun control, who destroyed the NRA as a political force.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  He was the governor who more than any other person in this country, including Tony Fauci, effectively defended lockdowns masking in vaccines.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  In fact, in the fall of 2020, Cuomo won an Emmy Award for his daily COVID briefings. He was an actual celebrity. He seemed like a future president, and everybody said so.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  But within weeks of getting that Emmy, it began to fall apart. A number of women came forward to claim that Cuomo had once said impolite things in their presence.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  By the standards of Andrew Cuomo's many scandals and office, it seemed like nothing. But for reasons they never explained, Democratic leaders, leaders of his party in Washington, took this scandal very seriously.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  They described Cuomo's behavior as sexual harassment, and they called for his resignation. By summer, it had worked. He was out of office and irreparably disgraced.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  The people who hand out Emmys even took back their award and scrubbed Andrew Cuomo's name from their website. Andrew Cuomo was too immoral to share space with Hollywood actors.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  And that's pretty immoral. What exactly did Andrew Cuomo do wrong? He outlived his usefulness to the party. That's what he did. He stayed too long.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Cuomo was in his 60s. He was white. He was male. He was someone whose demographic profile represented the Democratic Party of the past, not of the future.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  He talked like a mafia don negotiating garbage contracts. He was a little embarrassing. Because of that, his own people iced him, and they replaced him with someone who looked the part.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  No one cried when Andrew Cuomo resigned. They just moved on. The Democratic Party is not a sentimental place.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  It's hard not to think of Andrew Cuomo when you see what is happening to Joe Biden right now. Kamala Harris is certainly thinking about it.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Harris was in a suspiciously good mood today. We know this because she was talking about electric school buses again.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  I love electric school buses, she raved. I just love them for so many reasons. Maybe because I went to school on a school bus.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Raise your hand if you went to school on a school bus.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  Harris was grinning the whole time. And why wouldn't she be grinning? That senile white guy who claims to be her boss is finally going down, down, down, down, down.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  It's a happy day at Kamala Harris' house. But it's not a happy day at Casa Biden. In fact, this is pretty clearly the beginning of the end for Joe Biden.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  We can't prove that. The future is unknowable. But holy smokes, it does not look good. And it doesn't look good in a very recognizable way.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Somewhere in his basement rec room, drinking a Courvoisier on ice, Andrew Cuomo is chuckling to himself. He's seen this movie before.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Joe Biden's own aides keep finding stacks of felonies he's left around the place, in his office, in his car.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  And instead of throwing this evidence in the fireplace, as under normal circumstances they would, they're sending these documents on to the Justice Department.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  That's not a good sign. Meanwhile, Biden's Attorney General, the most unscrupulous, unethical Attorney General this country has ever had,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  has somehow decided that actually, in order to maintain his unsullied record of nonpartisanship, he's going to have to pass these documents, these stacks of felonies,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  onto an independent council because that always works out well for a sitting president. And by the way, in this case, the independent council is a Republican.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Good luck, Joe Biden. Happy 80th birthday. Here's Merrick Garland.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  On the evening of November 4th, 2022, the National Archives Office of Inspector General contacted a prosecutor at the Department of Justice.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  It informed him that the White House had notified the archives that documents bearing classification markings were identified at the office of the Penn-Biden Center
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  on November 14th pursuant to Section 600.2b of the Special Counsel Regulations. I assigned U.S. Attorney Laush to conduct an initial investigation.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  On December 20th, President Biden's personal counsel informed Mr. Laush.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Hi. The whole report is on infowars.com. It's an excellent 14-minute opening monologue.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Gerald Slantel responded to this and so much more on the economy, on the war, on the open borders, and what's going to happen next. The top trend forecaster, straight ahead in 60 seconds, stay with us.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment to keep infowars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children. But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies. They're already given to pregnant women.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  Miscarriages are off the chart. 80-plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us. Let's do it together.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  And the fight starts at infowars.com. And the fight continues with your financial support at infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  Take action now.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  We love to get him on early in each year. Of course, he's a great co-host with us. He's on a reduction.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  To lay out how many trends he got right, you almost always get some 100% right.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  What he's projecting this year into next year and so much more, trendsresearch.com on Twitter, Gerald Salente.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  And I really appreciate Gerald joining us here today to cover the waterfront with us.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  We can dive into how they're obviously getting ready to remove Biden. What do you think has come out of that?
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  The war in Ukraine. We've got updates on that. What's happening with the housing market, the economy, and the bubble.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  We've got the Middle East. We've got so-called going green, World War III, digital cash, AI.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Where's the anti-war movement? In God we trust what God supports war. It is all coming up.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  We've got a copy of his latest French journal right here. So Gerald, great to have you on with us.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  What do you want to tackle first here?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  Well, you know, it's so much going on in the Ukraine war. You mentioned Biden. This is very important.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  The lower Biden goes, the more they're going to ramp up the Ukraine war.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Let's go back to the disaster when Biden ended the disastrous Afghan war.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  Where they left behind billions and billions, countless billions of dollars of weapons.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  He BS saying that, no, no, the Taliban is not going to take over. Don't worry about it.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  And of course, the Taliban totally took over. His ratings were plunging. The people were totally disgusted with it.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Then all of a sudden, the Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. We've got to fight the Russians.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  We've got to fight the Russians. He starts going back up.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  Alex, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  And now with the dirt coming out from what they left behind with Biden,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  the classified documents that he stole that they're finally bringing out again and to show you what a fraud this country is and the clowns running it.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  All you mean, you had this stuff two months before the midterm elections, but you didn't put it out because it would have shown what a disastrous things going on and all the fixes.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  So what I'm saying is when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Once upon a time, there was a thing called the Great Depression.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  You want to get the people's minds off it?
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  World War II. Then there's a thing called the dot-com bust.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  The Nasdaq was crashed, crashing. We're into recession.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Little Georgie Bush, the daddy's boy born on third base and thought he had a home run, a little moron over there.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  Oh, yeah, we got to get that guy Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  88% of the people swallowed it off to Afghanistan. Biden is going to do the same thing.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  They're going to ramp up this Ukraine war. World War III has already begun.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Well, you're dead on there and every major analyst has looked at this.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Even Henry Kissinger says the war should stop. It's going to lead to nuclear war.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  They have that threat ladder. We're already 70% up the ladder towards total nuclear war.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  It's just escalating and escalating. What do these maniacs think they're doing?
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  They're maniacs. They're demonic maniacs.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  Again, like we said, we have the Italian American Foundation up here in Kingston.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  We have the biggest Columbus Day parties outside of New York City.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  We're at one of the meetings the other day and everybody stands up to do the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  I said to myself, one nation under God? What God are you talking about?
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  What God are you talking about that keeps starting war after war after war after war all my life?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  What God and freedom, liberty, justice for all? What justice for all?
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  The bigs get a slap on the wrist. It's prosecution to the fullest. And what liberty?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  You get sensitive if you don't swallow the crap that they're shoving down your throat.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  So that's what we're going. And again, you're talking about building it up.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  This is from business insider. You ready?
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  A nuclear attack would most likely target one of these six cities.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  What are you talking about over here? Oh, they say that a nuclear attack on the U.S. soil
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  would most likely target New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Washington, D.C.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  You ready for this? But the Federal Emergency Management Agency has an emergency strategy.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  But everyday citizens, everyday citizens, what do you mean everyday citizens?
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Anyway, FEMA has some simple advice. She has simple advice for simpletons.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  Get inside, stay inside, and stay tuned. Who are you talking to?
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  What am I, two years old?
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Yeah, there won't be any radio or internet when nukes hit Manhattan.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  It's like saying, before you jump into a woodchipper or blow your head off with a shotgun,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  be sure you put your slippers on.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  We'll be just, we'll be ruined, we'll be annihilated. They're building this up to nuclear war.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  When little lowlifes, that arrogant little lowlifes like business ins...
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  How about business ins outsider that you're publishing garbage like this?
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  They're getting the people prepared. We have demonic people in charge.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  World War II isn't ancient history, annihilating Europe. Oh, you forgot World War I.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  We have demonic evil people in charge that are destroying our lives in front of our faces.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  They're preparing the people for nuclear war.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  There's going to be, World War, again, World War III has already begun.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  There's going to be a false flag event. Remember, the Russians bombed Poland.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Two people dead. Remember that one?
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Oh, two people dead? Hey, how many people in the United States and Saudi Arabia killed in Yemen?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Only according to the United Nations, 377,000 and half of them children under the age of five.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  But we won't talk about that. Two people died in Poland. The Russians are coming the right.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  It was a total lie. A total lie. Oh, how about the Gulf of Tonkin incident?
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  That's when I was growing up, the Vietnam War.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  A total lie by Major Rottenhell Robert McNamara. They keep lying.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  So this is what we got.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  Well, I got to tell you, Gerald, I got to tell you, Gerald, I'm just speechless here. Listen, you talk about this.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  You're not just saying this. When Henry Kissinger and the Pope say this war needs to end, it's going to lead to nuclear war.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  They're the establishment. So it must mean a new establishment is in charge. It's even crazier.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  It's not like the Pope or Henry Kissinger or angels.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Why do you think the establishment is openly writing articles every day I see saying nuclear war is survivable?
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Why are they trying to make Dr. Strange love a owner's manual and a prelude instead of dark satire?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Why are they trying to make that real?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  These are demonic people. They're satanic. They're evil.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Biden has the nerve, the goal to call himself a Catholic.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  What Catholic are you talking about? You just had the celebration of Christmas.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Oh, yeah, we'll only talk about how retail sales did. Oh, no, no, that was the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  The Prince of Peace, you're not allowed to talk about peace. He's not a Catholic.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  What Catholic believes in this? Again, you're talking about the Pope even warning about this.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And where are all the other religions coming out and saying, stop this, where they all have locked your.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  All they're doing is promoting war. There's not a word about peace.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  So anyway, that's our major trend that we're concerned about, because if this continues like this, then all the other trends aren't going to mean anything.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  All right, Gerald, stay right there. We're going to go to break and come back and talk about how we avert this straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Info Wars is winning. Info Wars is reaching more people than ever. We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true. They told you we were going to be shut down. They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  None of that's true. It's all being appealed. They want you to think Info Wars is dead.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  But if you simply stand up and support Info Wars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win. Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.

[01:20:51.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  I guess he's still a top globalist. People like Henry Kissinger are saying, stop now. Where do you see that going? How can we mitigate it?
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  And then you wanted to get into economy next as we go through your latest trends journal.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  All right, going back to the war. As I said, when all else fails, they take you to war and Biden's on a big failing mission.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  World War III has begun. It's going to be, as I said, a false flag event or they're going to or a nuclear exchange.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  It's called mission creep. Lloyd Austin, the guy that's playing our defense contractor, former general.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  And this job before this, sitting on the board of directors of Raytheon, the second largest defense contractor in the United States.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  I mean, you can't imagine, revolving towards one door. Anyway, he has admitted that there are US, quote, advisors in Ukraine helping the Ukrainians with the weapons that we're sending there.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  So we're at war with them. So now what I'm saying, it's mission creep. Now we're bringing, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  They're bringing the Ukrainians here to Oklahoma to show them how to use Patriot missiles.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  What if the Russians brought the Iraqis to Moscow to show them how to use missiles to fight the Americans when they were in Iraq?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  And Patriot missiles like Patriot Act, that's an oxymoron. There's nothing patriotic about this.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  So now going in to show you how they lie us and lead us into war before the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor over 80% of the American people were opposed to be getting involved in another war.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  This is from history today.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  So it's not a conspiracy theory. United States freezes Japanese assets. July 26, 1941.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  When did Pearl Harbor happen? What was that December 19 couple of months later? You ready?
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  On July 26, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt seizes all Japanese assets in the United States in retaliation for the Japanese occupation of French Indochina.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  What are you talking about? What do I care what the Japanese are doing in French Indochina?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Oh, and what is French Indochina? You mean the colonists call the French going into Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia stealing all the rubber, the tin and everything else they could steal and killing the people?
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Oh, how dare the Japanese go into that? And you keep reading.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  On July 24, Tokyo decides to strengthen its position in terms of its invasion of China by moving through Southeast Asia.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  Goes on. Japan followed up by occupying Kamran Naval Base, which of course is in Vietnam, 800 miles from the Philippines where the Americans had troops.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  What are the Americans doing with troops in the Philippines? I'm an American. How about protecting America?
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  Oh, no, Salenti. We're globalists now. We're business beginning. Anyway, and the British base in Singapore. What are the British doing in Singapore?
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  What's wrong with you, Salenti? The sun never sets on the British Empire. Oh, you only killed how many people in India when you occupied it?
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Well, according to the latest study, the British only killed 165 million people from India. I'm showing you how they lied us into the World War Two.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  President Roosevelt swung into action by freezing all Japanese assets in America. No stealing all Japanese assets in America when they didn't do anything to us.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  Britain and Dutch East Indies. Oh, Dutch East Indies? You mean you scum that are stealing stuff all over Indonesia and all that area and robbing them of everything?
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  Oh, yeah. Whether Dutch, we can do it. Goes on.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Followed suit. The result, Japan lost access to three fourths of its overseas trade and 88% of its imported oil. Okay.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  This is how they lead you to war. And they're doing the same thing now.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  So that's what we're warning the people about. And what could you do to change it? Here's my suggestion, Alex, and I would love to hear your comment.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  The Libertarian Party put on the ticket RFK Junior for President and Judge Andrew Napolitano for Vice President.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  And I'm saying the Libertarian Party because they have ballots in all of the states and it's very hard.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  The Libertarian Party in all 50 states.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Right. And so to put these two people on the, on a new, new...
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  And they could inject, they could inject the anti-war, pro-peace, anti-nuclear war, anti-armageddon ideas into the debates.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  They could force their way in and put that on the referendum in the next election or even sooner. They could hit the campaign trail now.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  What do you think? Do you think that'd be a winning ticket?
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  I think it's an absolutely genius move. And I think they should do it now to stop nuclear war.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  And they would not be ignored. It would galvanize people. We could get huge anti-war demonstrations going again.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  And I think it would unify the left and right. And it's something we need to do right now.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  I think we should also introduce impeachment articles for what Biden's done.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  $150 million to Ukraine, the money laundering, all of it to make it front and center and point out what he's doing that's wrong.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  I think that's also important.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  And you said it, left and right. Again, the Kennedy...
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  The Kennedy is... think about it.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  If your uncle, the president was assassinated, RFK Jr., and your father was assassinated, what kind of person would you be?
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  Could you imagine living through that? Could you imagine...
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  Here, I just got this framed.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  Wow. President killed. Governor Connolly shot. Suspect seized. Johnson has sworn in.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  And let me expand on that.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  Kennedy faced Curtis LeMay and L.O. Lemonser on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs being L.O. Lemonser.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  They want to do a false flag attacking U.S. cities, blaming on Cuba and Russia as a pretext for war after Bay of Pigs.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Kennedy said no. And that's one of the reasons they had him killed.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  So there's always been these forces pushing for a winnable nuclear war with Russia.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  And now with all these other nuclear powers, all the different war game scenarios show Pakistan and India going to war, India and China going to war.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  Once there's a limited exchange, almost every analyst agrees it'll lead to total nuclear war, end of civilization, probably all life on Earth as we know it.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  But why are there psychos that are willing to try this?
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  They're demented, evil people. That's why. Why does a murderer murder people? Why does a thief steal stuff? That's who they are.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Why does the rapist rape?
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  Exactly. And they're raping us of our life, liberty, and a pursuit of happiness.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  Alright, Jill Solente, TrendsResearch.com. Get the new magazine. It's monthly, but they also have the big Trends Journal out right now.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  So important to read yourself and then share it with others. It's like a book every episode, every issue.

[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  We'll be right back. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  Information is beyond incredible. Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandod Video.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  Millions of people today visiting Bandod Video, but you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect,
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  If you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  Mr. Revere's kept saying he died decades before he did die and it's the same siob today.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because of the facts and what we've covered is coming true.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Infowars and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done. If you decide to go to InfowarsStore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  It is all in your hands. So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists. Go to InfowarsStore.com right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.

[01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  This is our new Infowars MD, Incredible Line.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  This is our new Infowars MD, Incredible Line.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  This is our new Infowars MD, Incredible Line.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  We're going to talk economy now with Gerald Salente. We're going to talk about the Poison Shots, AI, anti-war. We're going to talk about office building busts, the trends.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  I want to get into the trends now. Bam, bam, bam, back Sunday night with myself, Owen Schreuer and Harrison Smith for a big roundtable discussion.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I haven't really talked about this yet, but we're doing it starting next Tuesday with over 15 big guests that we've already lined up.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  Alex Jones was right, emergency broadcast Tuesday, January 17th from 8 a.m. to midnight.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  We may even go past it.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  These events are about reaching out to new people because once the regular show is in at 6 p.m., we go commercial free.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  We'll take a few breaks, air a few promos, a few special reports, but it will be basically commercial free or commercial light, only a few minutes of breaks an hour.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  And if all of our guests tweet and Facebook and everything that they're coming on for a special event and have listeners that aren't censored like we are,
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  a lot of folks have been let back on Twitter. If you tell folks, hey, they're on air right now covering censored information, we can get millions and millions of new people
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  per event like this to tune in that really haven't done the deep dive on what's happening.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  So it's so important. And it's a fundraiser. Listen, we're only about $230,000 down a month in the last six months for what we need to pay for the bandwidth, the crew, the legal, all of it.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  We've got a two to four year appeal process. They're not going to shut us down. They're saying, unless you don't support, I'm not complaining.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  You've done a great job supporting, but I'm asking for you to really take action, especially if you're a listener that's never bought products at mphilwarstore.com.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  If you did order products and like them to go to mphilwarstore.com and get these great products, regardless, spread the word about mphilwarstore.com.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  That link gets censored a lot. So we have the mphilwar.tv link that we'll put on screen that folks can tweet out and Facebook out an email and share.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  That's how we overpower the AI. That's how we stop the censors.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  And so we've launched a whole new product line, mphilwarzmd, partnering with the top company that already makes some of the best supplements highest rated in the country.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  We can only give you 25% off on these because we already don't have much markup in them.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  But we're talking about a lot of amazing products in the mphilwarzmd line, like high quality CBD oil, like nitric oxide that's so important to clean out your blood and stop blood clots,
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  and really supercharge you, nitric boost, shrimp max is a non-stimulant, new tropic that boosts your brain function.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  mphilwarzmd available at mphilwarstore.com.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  And of course we have the real Red Pill Plus that after all these years of being sold out because of proprietary ingredients,
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  because the lockdowns and things we couldn't get is now back available as well.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  You should really experience Real Red Pill Plus at mphilwarstore.com, down and out our great natural sleep formula, the strongest sleep formula we've got,
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  maybe too strong for some, works really great, very strong doses of the valerian root and the melatonin and like five other ingredients.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  It's 40% off, down and out, you owe it to yourself deep, clean sleep, and it keeps us on air.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  So just take action, and I thank you for making the decision to go to mphilwarstore.com and ordering.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Sign up for auto-shipping, you can cancel any time for free, we've got an additional 10% off on your next order.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  There's Patriot Points as well, and now we have free shipping back at mphilwarstore.com and orders $50 or more.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Going back to Gerald Salente, let's talk about the economy now and what's really going on with interest rates, the Federal Reserve,
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  and what you're predicting is happening.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  You said two years ago that the housing bubble would bust in the next year and a half.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  It started to bust just when you said six months ago, how serious is this going to get?
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  It's going to get very serious, but the worst is going to be in the commercial business sector.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  By the way, I just want to say I want to thank you for everything that you're doing and your staff and how hard everybody works
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  and the great products that you have.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  One of your products that I love the most is SuperMail Vitality. At 76, I got the spirit of 76, you know?
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  This stuff is, yeah, and it's really, really great.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Yeah, I just turned 76.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Well, the good news is, the bad news is it's been sold out for months.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  The good news is we're getting a small shipment in Monday.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  It arrives at like noon, it's scheduled, where it's made in Utah by one of the oldest biggest companies, we probably label it.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Cold pressed herbs, so it has the regular herbs known for boosting stamina, libido, all that, but they're cold pressed, so they're alive and much stronger.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  So thank you, Gerald. It'll be back in stock next week. Please continue.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  Yeah, so going back to the economy, there's going to be an office building bust, the likes of which we've never seen before.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  Before I get into that, I want to look at the general economy in the markets.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  So back to our trends journal in November of 2022, gold prices hit into the 1600 levels.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  We said this is the bottom, they're going to go up from this point on.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  And they have, now as we're speaking, gold is over $1,900 an ounce.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Which again, you hammered and hammered the last few years, and I didn't think you were wrong because you're right about 95% of the time, one of the probably best analysts out there.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  But how did you know two years ago to start hammering gold would go up?
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  Well, we knew when it would go down as interest rates went up.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  And then we knew that they're going to moderate raising interest rates because the money junkies need cheap dough.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  And what nobody talks about by the Federal Reserve and the central banksters, this is the BS that they kept putting out.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  First, they said inflation was temporary. Then they said it was transitory.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  And of course in the woke world, we just call it transgendatory now, then they couldn't stop lying about it.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  So they started raising interest rates.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  We said as interest rates keep going up, the stock market's going to keep going down.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  As the stock market goes down, we said it was going to go down in 2022 and it did.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  You had the Nasdaq down 33% last year. The S&P 500 almost is their territory.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  So what's going to happen to the housing thing and what's going to happen to crypto?
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  So on the crypto, we were very, very bullish on Bitcoin.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  We said when it goes down to $15,000, that that would be the bottom.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  If it went below that, it would go much deeper.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  If it's stabilized around that, we see it moving up and it has.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  Now it's at about 19,000. And you have to put this into perspective.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Yeah, it was up to 60,000 plus.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  But the thing started from zero, what, 10 years ago, and it's now at $17,000, $18,000, $19,000.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  So it's way up.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  It goes up, it goes down, it goes up even higher, it goes down, it goes up even higher.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And so that's what we see.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  On the real estate sector, we don't see a housing bust like we saw in 2008, Panic of 08.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  Because the people that bought houses this time had to go.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  It was no such thing as subprime mortgages.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  Where you don't have a job, you can't have any money in the bank, you're deep in debt here.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  Here's a loan signed over here.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  It didn't do that this time.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  We're going to see a steep decline in the prices.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  But again, this is what it depends upon.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  February 1st, the Federal Reserve is going to come out and they're going to say how much they're going to raise interest rates.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  The bet on the street right now is that they're only going to raise them 25 basis points.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  If they only raise them 25 basis points, the markets are going to go way back up again.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  And here's the other thing.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  You have to look at the data.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  After the last 40, last 40 midterm elections, the S&P 500 has gone up over 15% in the following 12 months.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  So they're going to keep the gamblers gambling.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  If they raise interest rates, 50 basis points, boom, this thing's going to collapse and go down big and hard.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  What's the inside baseball?
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Is the figure going to do 25 or 50?
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  It's a guess.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  It's a guess.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  You don't know.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  You know, I don't know.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  But here's the other thing.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  So the Fed says he doesn't know what he's going to do yet and quote, he doesn't know.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  That's not very comforting.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  They know exactly what they're going to do.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  They're going to lie to us.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  They knew that the inflation wasn't temporary.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  They knew it wasn't transitory.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  These are the bankster bandits that are in charge of our life.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  And notice them increasing interest rates did not slow inflation very much.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  No.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  No.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  And the, oh, the good news was that the inflation numbers only increased what?
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  0.1%.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Oh, how wonderful.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  It only went up that little bit.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  I mean, this is the baloney they're putting out there.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  Inflation is still very high.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  And when you look at shadow stats, it's around 14%.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Absolutely.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  The argument is, well, it didn't go up too much, but it's already super high.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  We want it to go down.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  They're saying, oh, get used to it.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  Now, the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  But this sucker is amazing.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  The rosehips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.

[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  Let me boil this down here in my view with Gerald Salindale to get his take on it and head on to other key trends.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  The global corrupt leptocrats are just highly organized criminals.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  They've created all these huge Ponzi schemes to buy up and get almost every facet of the economy under control.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  And now they need a big war or another viral release or some other group of distractions,
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  power outages, cyber attacks, you name it, as the pretext for them taking more control.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  They don't want to get in trouble for the engineer collapse that's happening, which they orchestrated to consolidate control.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  And that's why they're so scared and that's why the virus and the Wuhan release and the poison shots was their big gambit,
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  which is now blown up in their face and you've got the FDA and CDC documents coming out that they knew it was going to kill people
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  and now they're all pointing fingers at each other.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  I mean, this is epic.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  You have congressional hearings starting and you've got criminal investigations in Japan and in Germany and Florida.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  I mean, this is really a big problem for them, Gerald.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  What's your view on what's about to happen to big pharma and their censorship and their control with government and sending voices and doctors and consumers?
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  I mean, this to me is a spectacular fail for them.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  I don't know how they're going to extricate themselves from this.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Oh, they'll do what they want because they run the government.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  Look at the people in the FDA.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Look at the people one after another.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Tell me where the board members and the head of the FDA are all Pfizer, Moderna former executives.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  It's criminal.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  That's right.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Again, from the military industrial complex, you've got a guy that was sitting on the board of directors of Raytheon.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  Now our defense contractor, you had some clown that was in the FDA that was the head of the tobacco part of it.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  What did he get?
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  He got a job with Philip Morris.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  You know, that other guy that I forgot his name on the under Trump that was there, an advisor to the to Pfizer.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Godly, you know, but what you're saying is important.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Tobacco is a very bad group lying about stuff, but and trying to put chemicals in to make it more addicting.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  But but everybody knows they ran a conspiracy for decades of control of media with payoffs and government.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  Yeah, finally, look at their face with pharma, their crimes a thousand times bigger.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  But you're right.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  They have the very same methodology of control.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  Here's the deal that shows you how bad it got.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  By the way, I did work a major major study for Warner Lambert, which is now brought out by Pfizer back in the late 1990s.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  That little arrogant boy that every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Baghdad, the Yugoslav war, one murderous thing after another, Bill Clinton.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  He's the clown that allowed the drug dealers to put their ads on TV in 1997.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  That wasn't allowed before.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Why do you think that you could hear Clinton BS for free for hours and hours?
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  That's the reason you know so much. You were a bestselling author even back in the 1980s, but you were also a high powered lobbyist.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Yeah, well, yeah, I was, you know, I only learned what I learned because I was on the other side.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  I was killing environmental legislation at the height of the environmental movement.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  Back when it was doing good stuff like catalytic converters and not putting poison reasonable stuff.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  Yeah, so I was on the other side. Here I am, Alex.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  At 30 years old, picking up Ronald Reagan at the Chicago Hilton two days before he's announcing he's running against Jerry Ford.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  So I've been on the other side. That's why I know what it is.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  And I started growing up, you know, and I became, you know, I'm not going to do this anymore.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  You know, so it's a lifetime thing. So going back, no big, the drug deal here. This is who runs America.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  Number one, the banksters. Hey, I'm too big to fail.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  I'm Jamie Dimon, Federal Reserve dumps in $29 trillion from 2007 to 2010 to the Goldman Sachs gang, the Merrill Lynch mob.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  One after another. We're too big to fail. You are just a piece of crap.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  Oh, I'm not making up that number. That's from the Levy Institute of Bard College.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  And then there's a number two. It's the drug deal is that people call Big Pharma.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  And how you watch these ads, you say, how could anybody take this stuff?
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  Oh, these are the side effects, you know, but yeah.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  And by the way, now under this new revolution with Fauci, they're going to get rid of testing on animals and just do it directly to humans
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  and allow unlimited advertising, including on Sesame Street to kids with no adverse reaction reports because no studies are being done.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  This is crazy.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  It's crazy. And that's what I'm going back to. What can we do before I move on?
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  We need a new third party. People are fed up. You saw that study that came out from Gallup just a couple of days ago on Tuesday.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  And by the way, you know, I go to info wars every day and follow the news stories that your crew puts up. They're terrific.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  And the one about how the majority of people look at Congress lower than they do journalists and car salesmen.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  We're ready for a new time because the other people that control the country is the military industrial complex.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  And then the next one is the geeks. High tech.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  And by the way, that's one of our top trends for 2023.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  AI, we own you. If we don't stop this, we're gone.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  They're taking over everything.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  And again, they've brought down society.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  I mean, you know, once upon a time, people played, you know, musical instruments and there was real life in real.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  No, now everything is digital.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  I was about to say, you've been harping on that for 15 years now, but haven't you on a longer? I've known you.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  But they now admit CNET and others have all these writers that are fake AI.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  They put in what they want the writer to write. The editors don't need writers anymore investigators.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  They just didn't rescramble it.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  That's a perfect microcosm of humans being removed as a commodity or even a necessity.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  Before we were commodity treated like animals. Now we're being treated like garbage to be taken out.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  All say no to AI news. We should say no to fake journalists.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  Yeah. Yeah. And people don't read anymore. They're tick-tocked. You know, they're dead. They're gone.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  So again, that's why, you know, people, everybody listening, you need to do all you can to support InfoWars.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  And you go to infowarsstores.com and they got a great line of products, but they're not only helping InfoWars, they're helping you.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  Absolutely. So let me ask you this in closings. We're almost out of time. You're going to be co-hosting Sunday with us.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  Run through some of the other trends that are in your big 2023 trends journal.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  Yeah. The other ones is we're going to see a college crash. You're going to see less and less people.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  More and more colleges closing down and less and less people going to them.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  And another one we're looking at, it's already happening. New political parties.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  The new ones ramping up again, the old new one in Austria.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  People are tired of immigrants. It's going to be anti-immigration, anti-establishment, anti-war, and anti-tax.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  And that's, those are the big ones. And again, we got the other, this one going green and market meltdown, Middle East, office building busts.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  Oh, and by the way, digital cash, here's what they're going to do. Here we are, Alex. We're doing the interview and all of a sudden Gerald,
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  and we just heard that the Russians hacked our banking system. We're sorry, folks.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  The Russians hacked the banking system and you can't get any money, but don't worry, we're going to help you out.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  We're going to come out with a digital currency. We're coming out with a digital currency.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  We know every penny you spent, where you spent it, what you spent it on, so we could get your money in tax dollars and take more control over you.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  They're going to go digital. I tell people, why are you keeping your money in the bank?
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  That was my next question. I want you to host the next five minutes coming up. I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  But Gerald, I was about to ask you, we know the AI system is coming in. We know the digital currency is coming in.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  You warned them decades ago, so they're dying. Now it's here. How do we stop it?
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  We need a new third party. Without it, we lose.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Sure, but that's the big 35,000 of you. How about it ground zero at the one foot view?
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  What do we do? Just refuse to use it, shop mom and pop? What do we do to say no to the digital currency?
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  Never use QR codes at stores.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  I don't carry a cell phone. I won't do it. And I refuse to do it.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  I did work for the cellular telecommunications industry in 1994. I've been reading about radio frequency radiation since then.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  You see what's going to happen with the sperm count going down to zero by 2045?
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Pop can't radiate your balls.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Those are major studies, folks. They put rats in with cell phones with the normal amount of cell phone radiation we use every day.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  They tried their testicles. University of California, Berkeley, you're on a cell phone for 17 minutes a day for 10 years.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  Your chances of getting brain tumor only increased by 60%.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  Even Wired Magazine admits that that's why, folks, when I do use one because they're an incredibly powerful tool,
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  I keep it in a bag and if I got to go in a store or something, I leave it in the car or it's in my back pocket.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  That way, it's not getting full power. You put your front pocket that's shooting through your hip.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  You put it right next to your balls and I'm being serious, folks. It fries them and it's bad for ovaries.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  All these brain tumors, there's hundreds of studies about whatever side of your head you hold the phone on.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  That's where you get the brain tumor. Don't do it. If you can get rid of cell phones, that is the smartest thing for everybody to do.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  What Gerald said is shop local, demand quality.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  In fact, I wanted to talk about solutions just in general to up our culture. When we come back in two minutes with Gerald Salente,
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  then I got a ton of news to hit after he leaves.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  Lemon balm and German chamomile. All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well and they're excellent. They're all different formulas.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  John and Al sold out for more than five months. Now back available at infowarstore.com. So get better, deeper rest,
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  boost your immune system and support the Info War with John and Al sleep support at Info War Store.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of Info Wars under a new brand name, Info Wars Platinum.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail,
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  40% off what these products are found for under other names. And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about pain MD. We're talking about HGH max boost.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:47.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare provider because they're so powerful.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  Thanks a lot, Alex. And thank you again for all you do. You know, one of the top trends we have is the homeless solution. And they refuse to listen to us on this.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  The homeless, we're spending tens and tens of billions of dollars every year to put these people into shelters. They're out on the streets. It's a mess. It's not working.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  So we have a homeless solution. And here it is. Once upon a time, there used to be a movie called Boys Town. And what they did is they took these kids that came from broken families and other disastrous things and they built a Boys Town for them.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  And they show these young kids skills, how to work, how to do things in a beautiful, beautiful place. We could do the same thing with the homeless solution.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  We're putting people in what they call shelters. Isn't that brilliant? A shelter? You're putting them in these crappy places. Oh, and by the way, it ends in Boys Town, yep.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  We're putting them in these crappy places. And by the way, the big, you know, like the old hotels and stuff, these are owned by the people that pay the politicians off to put them in there.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  So what we do is we build homeless towns. And for example, I'm up here in Kingston, New York at the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  One time, there used to be a place called the Borscht Belt. They had grossages, brown. It was where all the top comedians, the Jerry Lewises, all the Sammy Davis juniors, all the top of the top used to come up here.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  It changed when they had the jet set began when they started jet airplanes in the late 1960s and then people started flying around.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  But everybody from the city and other places used to come up here. Now there is all these beautiful Catskill Mountain places empty, empty.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  Rather than spending billions of dollars giving it to the political clowns that get paid off to put people in shelters, we build homeless towns, beautiful places, get them off the streets,
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  get a look at the destruction that they're not only doing to the people that are spending all this money in rents and housing that other people are destroying, but give them a real life.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  We put them in these beautiful areas all over the country, all over the country, into the ex-urban areas where you have these beautiful, beautiful land that's empty and you give them skills.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  Here, you want to eat, you got to do this. You teach them how to paint, teach them how to fix things.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  But the system doesn't want that Gerald. They want a bunch of zombies they control.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  I know. Again, it's up to us. Remember, Alex, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, said Samuel Adams.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  I totally agree with you. And that's what we need is people to have a model of it, show it works, won't be all the homeless that click to it, but a good minority, maybe even a majority will do it, and then it can be a model duplicated everywhere.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  Exactly. Exactly. And we give them skills. We put life back into them. We give them a spirit. Here, this is how you cook. This is how you plant vegetables.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  Everybody should be doing that. Studies show most adults don't know how to cook, even, or plant vegetables, and we're designed to do it. It feels good to do it.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  Alex, my favorite pastime is gardening when I have time and cooking. I zone out. I love making dinner. We're supposed to do it.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  Yep. And that's why we're in the shape we're in. And we're not among the 60 plus percent of the people eating ultra processed foods.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  Well, I'm not in great shape like you. I've done a lot of bad things, but I know what's right. And I know you look like you're 60 and you're 76. That's amazing.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  Thank you. Yeah. The first book I worked on was Natural Healing back in the 1980s.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  Gerald, you're co-hosting Sunday, four to six p.m. Central. Myself, Owen Schreuer. We'll see you then. We love you.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  Trendsresearch.com. Folks, go there and subscribe. He's a great patriot. And then share your subscription. God bless you, Gerald.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  God bless you, and thank you for everything you do.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  You can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it. When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  I tell you, because we've discovered what the enemy fears we know how to beat them, and I think most of you already understand that.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  But a lot of new listeners don't understand why do they have thousands of articles a week, year after year, lying about us attacking us.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  Why do they pull out all the stops to try to shut us down?
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  Because I studied how psyops work decades and decades and decades ago. Years before I got on air, I had family who had worked in secret areas of these systems tell me how things really worked, and they were against what was happening.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  And I just grew up hearing this and knowing this, and as I got older, I saw it happening and thought, oh, they really told me the truth. When you're a kid, it's just kind of background noise, but you're like a sponge taking that all in.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  And so they have congressional hearings about us. They talk about how we're the number one enemy because they're the criminals that have hijacked the country.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  And I can tell you, big tech, the European Union, the big think tanks, and the criminals that have hijacked our government have absolutely 100 and 10% that it wore with info wars because we know how to defeat them.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  We know how to stop them. And so they're on record studying what we do, studying how we operate, because they fear what we're covering, what we're breaking down will spread to the general public.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  But what are they most concerned about? And I've seen this in congressional documents. We played the clips. I even played one earlier in the week. But I want you to understand something.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  They want to know how I've been able, with my guest and my crew and this whole family, to mobilize people and get Trump elected and really punch big stories through that they're suppressing into the mainstream.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  They see us as the weapon that's defeated them because we have together this whole family, God working through us, God gets all the credit.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  And part of being so successful against these enemies is that they come after you.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  So when I tell you about this, I didn't just research this when I was young. I've just been on air 28 years. All these persecutions have really taken my understanding of the cutting edge of their attacks to the next level.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  So I'll explain something right now. When I got up here last hour, just briefly mentioned, hey, we're going to do a special broadcast from 8am past midnight on Tuesday, the Alex Jones was right, emergency broadcast.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  And I said, if you get excited about it, and if you share the link from infowars.com forward slash show, when you do that, it has an ultra massive effect.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  But it's not just about info wars. It's that when you realize how much power you've got, and when you get excited, not just about promoting info wars, but going to your city council, your county commission or your school board or your state house, or to town halls and getting up for two, three minutes,
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  speaking the people, whether you're an old lady or a black man or a white man or a Hispanic person or an Asian person, gay straight, doesn't matter. When you speak that truth, fellow humans listen to you and put the highest level of credibility on you above government, above media, above the corporations who they see as garbage.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  And they're looking for your leadership. And they're looking for you to give them that cue so they can join you.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  So start a local news site that has an article a week, an article a day, whatever you want to do. Go speak out, tell people who you are, tell them about your movement to promote freedom.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  They will join you. They will get involved with you. You can help their movement. The answer is in the people. The answer is in what the globalist fear, what they call the proletariat or the population.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  And so they want to know how we excite people. They want to know why we're so successful mobilizing people. Well, we're promoting things that are ingrained on our souls, ingrained in our guts,
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  ingrained in our very DNA of liberty and injustice and freedom and beauty and art and culture and loving God and having good people together that stand up for what's right.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  That's why they try to sell you on overt evil to where it just gets so extreme you roll over and give up. Giving up only makes it worse.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  So have hope. Know this life as a test. Know that I'm just some regular guy from Texas who saw what was going on and stood up and took action because I believed in you.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  I believed I could inspire you to fight the new world order. And I knew that when I read stuff the globalists had written in the 70s, in the 90s, when I first really got involved, had all basically been done.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  And I went, well, if what they wanted in the 50s was done by the 70s, and if what they wanted in the 70s was done by the 90s, what they want by the 2000s, total control,
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  which you now see all the carbon taxes and shutdowns of energy and crime and deadly drugs and pedophilia and brainwashing and open borders,
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  they said they were going to do all of that in the 90s. And I was like, wow, they just got all this other stuff done. They mean business. I'm going to be ridiculed at first.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  I'm going to be demonized. I'm going to be attacked. But this is an adventure. This is the right thing to do. My guts, my soul, my spirit wants to do this.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  And so no matter how far I get, I knew this 25 years ago. Plus, I'm going to do this because it's the right thing to do and God's watching.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  And I'm always in that moment of conscience. That's God watching. Your soul knows that. My audience is God. My audience is what is God doing?
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  And God loves that and God starts opening doors and God starts giving you intel and God won't give you power.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  You can't handle until you've gone through more tribulations. And once you've been tested and once you've been proven, God then opens up the next weapon armoring.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  Is the best way to describe it of truth and justice and will and encourage and just energy and stamina and just just just and people see it and they know it.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  But by then you're so humble and the presence of God, you don't care that when you walk in a room, everybody knows God's with you.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  And does it mean you're God? Does it mean you're perfect? Does it mean you aren't fallen? Does it mean you aren't a sinner?
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  But the world recognizes that you're different and then they want to come to what you're doing. They want to be shown what you're doing.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  And so that's where we are. So before I hit all this Piers Morgan highlights or lowlights and analyze each piece of the propaganda next segment,
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  I want to just remind all of you that what we have here at Info Wars, what we're doing here at Info Wars, what we are carrying out here at Info Wars is special.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  And the enemy particularly knows it's dangerous to them. And so we've learned through trial and error and action so much about liberty,
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  so much about freedom, so much about how to build a better world, defend our children and defend our own rights.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  And that sacrificing its tyranny and really having empathy and really caring is the opposite of being a psychopathic or sociopathic New World Order minion.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  And as you pull away from that sociopathic evil, though you were never there, you were close to it, I was close to it, life gets so much better,
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  so much more fulfilling, so much more enriched that you feel sorry for people serving evil because they don't know how rich and beautiful and amazing a real relationship with God and reality is.

[02:19:50.000 --> 02:20:17.000]  That's info wars MD now available exclusively at info wars store.com a true 360 win leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:45.000]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide on this Friday the 13th transmission on your host Alex Jones and I'm going to now play some clips.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  Here Carlson's program. It's on England. It's on the United States. And of course I destroyed him 10 years ago in a debate. And I went on there yesterday and his producers were deceptive.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  Of course that was part of the course. I knew it was going to happen. Let's do an overhead shot please. There's a few notes I wrote here but here is what they sent me and I said I don't want to spend much of the time on sending.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  I said oh no that's just one of the topics but he spent 95% of the time on that. He wanted to talk about the rise of the right leaning parties in the US and other parties in Europe.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  That's not what happened. It was all oh you're harassing families. Oh you're being mean to them. He plays a clip of one of these women. I never said her name. You know who she was till she sued me like that FBI agent.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  And they're up there saying things that I never did to them. But the judge found me guilty and then had show trials to decide how guilty I was. And I know you're sick of hearing about that and so am I.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  So I'm not going to start with those clips first. I'm going to get to clip 7. Alex Jones and peers talk about gay frogs. And this is one of the things that he says discredits me.
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  We added a few clips backing it up when it is the act regime making the male frogs want to have sex with other male frogs meaning they become extinct.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  So even stuff that's documented he tries to say is made up. Here it is.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  You said that chemicals in the water which are put there by the government are turning frogs gay in a gay bomb. You said Michelle Obama is a man.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  In a 12 minute video you analyzed footage of photographs proving that Mrs. Obama has a penis. You said that Robert Muller the former FBI director who investigated Trump's Russia ties which turned out to be.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Can we stop. Can we hold on. Was it one of these.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  Hang on. Was it the money.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  And said I would take down.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:53.000]  He's obviously not a pedophile and so on. So here's my point Alex.
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  You're there. You keep flashing up your info. You don't need to promote info wars. We all know about it.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  Listen what I'm trying to tell you is on the front page of info wars charges and I can't respond.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:09.000]  Let me ask you the question I'm about to ask you. I read a piece on info wars all about the danger of falsehoods.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  Right. The cost to livelihoods and lives. The problem with lack of integrity and a false information pandemic.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:22.000]  Your website is promoting that thinking that it's wrong to have false information put out there.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  And yet the guy behind the website making all the money is the guy saying all this stuff which is obviously.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:35.000]  You know it's nonsense. Don't you. You're scared. Let me talk. Your chance to respond.
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  No I don't know it's nonsense. And if you took your time through all those points you just raised I can back every one of them.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  There are more than a thousand university studies from England to Australia to South Africa to Mexico to Austin, Texas.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  That atrazine is literally making male frogs gay. They don't want to have sex with female frogs and their populations are plummeting and even becoming extinct. Boom.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  It might look like we're out in the bush somewhere but 15 feet on either side we're surrounded by agriculture and the runoff ends up in this river.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  All of the algae is the result of all the nutrients. A lot of fertilizers are used in agriculture and once those fertilizers get into the water you get these blooms of algae.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  Our data so far suggests that the mixture of pesticides causes an increase in stress hormones and those stress hormones cause immunosuppression which leads to the inability to respond to any kind of disease pathogen.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  Pays is testing the effects of chemicals like atrazine, a common herbicide.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  We have a whole family of animals where we've eliminated the female chromosome.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  These animals that we know are genetic males have been exposed to atrazine for their entire life and many of these genetic males now are turning into females.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  The one that's sort of remarkable is this parent. These are both males. The one on the bottom acting as the female we've affectionately referred to as Darnell.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  He's a genetic male that not only acts like a female, he lays eggs like a female. He, she has been exposed to atrazine all of his, her life and I don't even really know how to reference it.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  This is Darnell's third clutch. So Darnell has sons and daughters that we've grown up.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  You can see eggs in the bottom. This is actually her second clutch for today. He, she has been compulating for getting close to 24 hours now.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  This is probably one of those remarkable things I've seen in my work.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  Jones has argued that the government has the ability to control tornadoes and that tap water is a gay bomb and that they are putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  This is the most common contaminant in ground and surface water and drinking water and the level of atrazine that it took to make this male turn into a female is three times less than what's allowed in our drinking water.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay. Do you understand that? Turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  So, Pierce Morgan says I'm the devil and just lying and he brought up when Joan Rivers said that Big Mike was a man and we talked about it and that's a big internet thing.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  We discovered it. We're now bad and we made that up to, quote, make money. What? All these media outlets have to make money.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  So here's clip eight, Big Mike, Joan Rivers clip. Here it is.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  Then, 9-11, I don't think radical Islam doesn't exist. There were criminal elements in our government that it came out even in the hearings that stood down and did nothing.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  So you rattle off.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  9-11 was not an inside job. Michelle Obama is not a man. Robert Mueller is not a demonic pedophile.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  Let me talk about Michelle Obama.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  Let me talk about Michelle Obama.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  Let me talk about Big Mike.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  These are all ridiculous lies.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  Let me respond.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  You're not a stupid man.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  You know these things are untrue.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  Let me talk. Let me talk.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  It was, that is a transcript you have.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  I was playing a clip of Joan Rivers two months before she died with fire exploding out of her mouth in a surgery.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  She said, Michelle Obama is a trainee. Everybody knows that we already have a gay president.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  And I was quoting what she said and I was questioning what people were saying.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  Mr. Rivers, how are you? You made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  Is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  I'm so excited. I should do very well because I don't chose.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  Well, we already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  Got it.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  You know Michelle is a transgender.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  A transgender. We all know.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  Oh my gosh.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  Oh gosh. It's okay.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  Okay, so he mixed that with me saying gay bum and with the frogs all together scrambling quotes together.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  The Pentagon BBC ABC News 1994 US military actually considered building a gay bomb and did and tested on US soldiers.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  Okay, so that's mainstream news. It's on screen for TV viewers. That's what I did.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  So we're going to continue here through everything he claims.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  And since he brings up Sandy Hook, I'm going to tell you what I really said about Sandy Hook.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  And Adam Lanza being in this working with the CIA and I have mainstream news showing that, including the Unabomber when we come back.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  Adam Lanza is the guy that killed the kids, not me.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  And everybody thinks about me and Sandy Hook. I did not kill those children.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  Because of the facts, what we've covered is coming true.
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  If you decide to go to infowarshore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  It is all in your hands. So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  Go to infowarshore.com right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:30.000]  On the horse was named Death.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.000]  A book of Revelation.
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  Very serious times to be alive, folks. They're not just doing this as one off.
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives. This is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.000]  The globalists even admit it's leaked. They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:11.000]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:19.000]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:32.000]  We've never put anything out that's powerful. It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at infowarshore.com.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  This is private labeled, three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at infowarshore.com.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:51.000]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:57.000]  Yield it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWars.
[02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:09.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew, you had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:27.000]  And man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know.
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously took basically all of your supplements.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing, it works.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:52.000]  Anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:33:19.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:31.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the floodlines of the Info War.
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  Welcome back, Broadcasting Worldwide on the Tri the 13 Transmission.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  We're going to the Pierce Morgan Disinformation Lies.
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  Got other news coming up beforehand at the top of the next guest host in the fourth hour, J. Dyer.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  So let's get back into this.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  And again, it's not about Sandy Hook, it's not about Alex Jones, it's about the anatomy of a Psyop.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  I come out, say Adam Lanza was with the CIA in a mind control program like Theodore Kaczynski and the Unabomber.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  That's all declassified. Tim McVeigh was controlled by mind control individuals.
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  There's Adam Lanza right there. You're watching on TV.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  And he was in a secret government program about to show you mainstream news articles that cover all this.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  So was the Aurora mass shooter. His dad ran the government brain interface program with DARPA.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  That was the Batman shooter.
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  So we covered that aspect. And a bunch of professors came out and other individuals said it was staged.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  We looked at them saying it was staged.
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  I didn't get any heat for that. We barely covered it, as you know.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  Then when Hillary runs against Trump, she runs $30 million of ads with edited clips of me saying Sandy Hook may not have happened.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:46.000]  And then they have a PR firm we now know that runs the UNPR that said Jones is harassing families and attacking people with Trump.
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  They built it up. The family sued me. The judges defaulted me.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  Had showed trials. Billion and a half dollars. All this ridiculousness.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  And so I only said the name on air ever of Robbie Parker because people were playing the video of him where he gets up there and starts laughing and then he starts crying.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  And I said, yeah, it looks weird.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  Okay, so now that's $90 million or $107 million to him for that.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  But the idea that I targeted these people is a total fraud.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  But now they've been used by the lawyers, by the Democratic Party, by Obama to come after not just guns, but also your first amendment.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  So I saw this lady at the Connecticut trial.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  How can your first response be total garbage, Pierre Morgan said?
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  He played a clip of her and said a bunch of stuff that I was saying was total garbage.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  Then I went on to say, I don't even know her name until she sued me.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  And her saying that I sent people to harass her or them saying that is not the case.
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  So Pears Morgan responds to Alex Jones bizarre reaction after showing a clip of him of a mother who lost her son in Sandy Hook shooting.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  So people know my name and association Sandy Hook, not Adam Lanzas, but we'll look at Adam Lanzas past here in a moment.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  Here's clip two where he plays the clip, but here's what's important.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  She says because of harassment and things that they never show evidence of, that they then say I'm sending people to them with no evidence of that,
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  that she has to sleep with a gun.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  So here she is admitting we need the second amendment.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  So I have nothing against this woman, you know, but the idea that, oh, I never, she never did anything and I came after her.
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  That's just not what happened.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  But again, they live off this, they cover this, they got 73 million from Remington.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  They've gotten over all these groups, hundreds of millions in money, major PR firms constantly raising money and they claiming I'm bringing it up.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  I'm harassing, I'm coming after them.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  This is how they demonize populism.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  Here's the clip.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  I want to play you a clip.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  This is a clip of one of the parents from Sandy Hook because you've talked about this at length now.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  Nicole Hockley and I want to talk after this clip.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  I want you to just listen to what she had to say to me recently on the show.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  He did his first broadcast saying that he thought this was a false flag.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  When I was still in the firehouse and I didn't even know if my child was alive or dead yet, he started off within two and a half hours.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  Nice conflation.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  Adam Lanza was in the news connected to the CIA and a mind control program at Yale that I'll show you CBS New York Times in a few minutes.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  Over a year until I covered the theories by Fetzer and a bunch of others that it didn't happen.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  So see how this works.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  Oh, he instantly attacked us.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  He instantly, no, not true.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.000]  Continue.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  When I was still in the firehouse and I didn't even know if my child was alive or dead yet, he started off within two and a half hours of the shooting.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  And has kept putting out video after video.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  Let's stop again.
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  Our lawyers deposed all these people.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  Most of them said they never heard of me until 2017 before they sued me.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  So she's in the firehouse.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  I'm attacking her.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  Never said her name.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  Continue.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  Year after year after year and calling us all crisis actors, calling our children, you know, either that they were never, they were never killed or they were never alive in the first place.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  That were traitors, that were treasonous, and that were government shills.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  It's been...
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  Pause again.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  No video of me saying they're treasonous.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  No video of me talking about her.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  No video of her saying they're shills.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  But see, we couldn't put that on a court because we were barred from the defense.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  We were already guilty.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  Now we have a show trial.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  Continue.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  Well, it's been easy to turn off some of it, but some of these people have been incredibly dangerous.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  And when he says, when he...
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  By the way, pause again.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  Back in five seconds.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  Stop the videos of me saying all this, not in court, not on the show.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  Pierce tries to read some mixed up transcripts about gay frogs, gay bombs, Michelle Obama, three different shows, all conflated together, mixed together out of context.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  Continue.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  Now we're government shills.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  It's been very difficult.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  It's been easy to turn off some of it, but some of these people have been incredibly dangerous.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  And he says when he... when he stokes this anger in his base, this fear, and then incites them to action by saying, you know, we need to investigate this...
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  Hey, pause again.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  Back in five seconds.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  Where did I tell him go to your house?
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  Don't have that.
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  You just say that.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  Where's the proof they went to your house?
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  There's no proof.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  None of it put on a trial.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  None of it.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  He... Alex Jones did all this.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  No, I didn't.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  Continue.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  Incredibly dangerous.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  And when he says, when he... when he stokes this anger in his base, this fear, and then incites them to action by saying, you know, we need to investigate this.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  You need to look into this more.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  They come at us.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  Well, hit pause again.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  Here she is at her big Sandy Hook promises office.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  How much money have they raised off this?
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  And how much money have they raised by keeping it in the news, attaching it to me, saying I'm attacking him?
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  Continue.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  Social media comments, which can be damaging. It's defaming. It's hurting your reputation.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  People, I don't know if I'm walking around who thinks I'm real and who thinks I'm an actress.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  It's... it's...
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  It pause again.
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  You went with Obama and the rest of the families early on and became super political.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  And a lot of these folks blame the Second Amendment and gun owners for what happened.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  So people are sick of that, lady.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  But again, I didn't know who you were until you sued me.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  Never even talked about you.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  Go back to her.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  Who thinks I'm real and who thinks I'm an actress?
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  It's damaging to my son's memory in terms of his life, his short six-year-old life.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  It's damaging to my surviving son because I don't know what he's going to deal with going forward.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  But it's also scaring the living daylights out of me.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  I sleep with weapons by my bedside.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  I've received death threats.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  I've received harassing calls and mail.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  I've had people send me pictures of dead children because they say,
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  you have no idea what a dead child looks like.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  So let me send you this picture so you can see it.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  This is stuff that has really not only just been distressing, it's disturbing.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  I'll stop again.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  Never in the trial this even happened or that I made people do it.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  But they can just say whatever they want and I'm the bad guy and that's the end of it.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  Continue.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  Security.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  You know, I'm just a mom.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:17.000]  I'm just trying to look after my surviving son, run my organization and make some good in the world.
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  I didn't choose to be part of this.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  Alex Jones chose to tell lies, knowing that they were lies and continuing to harbour them lies.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  Knowing they were lies.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  No, I never said that.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  Never lied about you.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  Those are lies.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  Continue.
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  And for his own profit.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  What's your reaction to that woman who lost her son Dylan at Sandy Hook?
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  Total garbage.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  Never said her name.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  Only person's name I said was Robbie Parker.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  Thirty something million views on YouTube.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  He was laughing.
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  Everything suddenly started crying.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  So your response to that woman's incredibly powerful eloquence.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  So you're going to give me five seconds?
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  I can't.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  How can your first discussion be total garbage?
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  Never let me talk the whole time.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  I'm saying the whole story is garbage.
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  The whole things be yes.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  All I know is Scarlett Lewis was in the Texas trial for two days.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  I came and taped my show the day I was going to testify early morning.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  And I said, I think she's real.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  I think her son died.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  I'm sorry it happened.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  And I go there that day.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  You all saw it.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  I couldn't talk.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  She yelled at me and got in my face for 10 minutes and said, I heard today you went on
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  air and say, I'm an actor.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  No, this happened.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  How dare you?
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  And I got on the stand later that day and I said, I'm on record saying it happened today.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  Because well, my lawyers told me that.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  It's all fantasy land folks to do whatever they want and attach what happened to their
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  kids to me.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  I'm sick of it and I'm tired of it.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  And it's disgusting.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  They'll never silence me until I'm dead.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  We have more straight ahead.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  Info Wars is winning.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  Info Wars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  None of that's true.
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  It's all being appealed.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000]  They want you to think Info Wars is dead.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  But if you simply stand up and support Info Wars, we've got years and years of appeals
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  You name it, then fund the Info War and empower your life and let the globalists know their sigh up has not worked.
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  Take action at infowarstore.com today because the only people that can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  The majority of you have not been sigh up.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  But some of you have.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  Go to infowarstore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world.
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support Info Wars are the real reason you've had the success.
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  God bless you all.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  I salute you.
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  I thank you.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  In some cases, even better.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  There is a war on for your mind. Your mind is a battlefield. This is an information war.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  Info Wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone,
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  they're all using the terms that Info Wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  You can also make straight donations at infowarsword.com, clicking on the big red banner.
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  A one-time recurring. But I'm asking you to take action. We're nonviolent.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:40.000]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air,
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  you are literally nonviolently politically punching the New World Order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  We are going to defeat the New World Order. We're going over the top, but right now is a critical juncture.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  So please go to infowarsword.com and donate now.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  All right, so they want to just keep hammering me and hammering me with tens of thousands of articles,
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  thousands of news reports, Sandy Hook, he's mean to people, he's attacking them, no evidence of it, all made up.
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  So now we're talking about what they don't want you to look at and remember.
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  Overhead shot please for TV viewers. For any illiciters, you can just search this for yourself. ABC News.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  Five disturbing things we learned today about Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  And that's back from the time this all went on. Oh, they don't want us discussing this.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  2006, almost a year after community psychiatrist for a valued Lanza, he was seen at the Yale Child Study Center by clinical psychiatrist.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  The report says the evaluation reportedly to determine if Adam Lanza had obsessive compulsive disorder.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  In the context of a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, their son was angry about having to go to Yale.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  The Yale APR in Advanced Practice Resonation Nurse, the present day interview offered her view that Adam Lanza may not in fact have had autism spectrum disorder,
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  but rather he suffered from disabling anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  The report says, Yale did not think that Adam Lanza was gifted unique pointed to the average cognitive abilities captured by the school psychological testing he was involved in.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  Here's another one out of the local Connecticut news.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  Child advocate report, Yale's psych recommendations for Lanza weren't sent to include the records.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  And what words is going on there?
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  Current exclusive, more than 1000 pages of documents for real, Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza's dark descent into depravity.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  New report, Adam Lanza did not snap. He was already evil and crazy.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  Why does mother get him a gun?
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  Yale's recommendations for support of Newtown shooter are largely unheeded where he said years before he was planning the attack.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  New York Times, Adam Lanza's mental problems completely unrelated before Newtown shooting report says,
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  Adam Lanza threatened Sandy Hook killings years earlier, New York Times.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  Cops heard Adam Lanza wanted to kill Sandy Hook before shooting doc show.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  Sandy Hook report, shooter's mom wanted to buy him a gun for Christmas.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  Yahoo News, Adam Lanza's mental problems completely unrelated.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  So that's what's going on here and that's what they don't want to discuss.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  And then I've got a whole stack of articles here we can show up on screen as well where the CIA and FBI,
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  I wouldn't pull those up, put them on screen, I thought I found the stack, visited him in the years before because of hacks he did and other things.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  I mean, that's what needs to be investigated.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  I don't know what happened there.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  The police report, the police got there and there was no blood in the bathroom but Apollo dead bodies and the police thought the bodies have been moved there.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  So that's what we were covering early on, not what others said later that we covered that they've come after us for.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  So this is what they picked to come after us for.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  This is their attempt to shut us down, but it's not working.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  All right, let's go ahead now and shift gears and other things that Pierce Morgan was up to and that he was doing.
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  Let's go ahead and play clip four and we'll also play the clip as well at the end where 500,000 kids killed by increased sanctions.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  Madeleine Albright said it was a good price to pay, but she's a hero to the left.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  I'm bad for questioning Jesse Small at WMD's in Iraq and Sandy Hook.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:22.000]  Here it is.
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  Yeah, listen, and Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State of Clinton was asked by Leslie Stahl of 16 Minutes that Clinton tripled sanctions on Iraq to kill 2 million people, 500,000 children.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000]  She said it was a good thing to do. She'd do it again.
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  I didn't kill 500,000 children.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000]  I question all these events because many of them are revocateur or staged.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  I understand that, but I also understand that.
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  What about all the kids dying from the poisoned shots?
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  Let me just say, I also understand.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  The problem is, if I deserve to die for questioning a mass shooting, then what happens to the big companies that sold these poisoned shots that weren't approved and weren't safe and didn't protect them?
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  Here's my question.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  I'm the worst guy in the world.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.000]  So, Pierce, hold on.
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  Hold on.
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  I'm the worst guy in the world, right?
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000]  I didn't say that.
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  Listen, I told him in a deposition that back when this went on, and I started questioning it like nine years ago, about a year after, when I said false flag, I believe they may have protected him.
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  They may have known it was coming.
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:26.000]  Like Uvaldi, 75 minutes, the police stood down.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  I believe that was a real shooter.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  Real kids died in Florida at Parkland.
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.000]  There was a stand down.
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:36.000]  The police chief said, well, he thought he'd already killed all the kids, so he didn't want more death.
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  That was in the news.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  That was in the Dallas Morning News yesterday.
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  I'm questioning Parkland saying, did they let it happen?
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  That's a false flag.
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:46.000]  To say a false flag doesn't mean the parents are fake.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  I apologized on Joe Rogan before I was sued.
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  I apologized on dozens of shows when they brought this up in 2016.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  Hold on.
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  Here's my question.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  Here's my question.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  Then they went on the news and said I was currently sending people their houses.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000]  Where is the video of me saying go to their houses?
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000]  Alex.
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  Where is the video of me pissing on their graves?
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.000]  Alex.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  It's not true.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.000]  No.
[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  It's not true.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  Alex.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:14.000]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:19.000]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:30.000]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price we think the price is worth it.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000]  Well, she's a good guy.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  I'm the bad guy.
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  Here he is, bringing up January 6th, trying to imply I did something wrong there.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:40.000]  That's exactly what thousands of people did.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:43.000]  They went down from hearing you say that, and Donald Trump was saying what he said.
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:48.000]  And they launched an unprecedented attack on the capital, the very center of democracy
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  in America.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  Do you regret now what you said at that speech?
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000]  No, I don't.
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:57.000]  I'd had rallies with over a million people, a half million people.
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000]  Before that, it's an information war in FullWars.com.
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000]  We're in an information war.
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:05.000]  We were there to have a 10 day investigation of the Constitution.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  The Democrats have done it before, just a few years before, to look at what was happening.
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  We were there peaceful.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.000]  And then, Piers, I tried to stop people and did keep thousands from going into the capital.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:18.000]  And I've been cleared in the January 6th.
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  Just to be clear, do you denounce those who use violence that day?
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000]  Yes.
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  I denounced Ray Ebb's telling the congressional committee that he orchestrated the attack.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  And I tried to stop the provocateurs in that operation from breaking in.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  We had a million people there.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  They tricked a thousand or so to go in.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  A few hundred provocateurs broke through the police, similar to what we're seeing in Brazil.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  And so I'm on record there that day telling people, don't go in the building and trying to stop it.
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  When I say 1776, I'm saying try to take our guns.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  1776.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  Try to take our free speech.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  1776.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  It means political rebellion.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  It means an awakening.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  It means saying no.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  And then he panicked and kicked me off the show because I was kicking his ass with the truth.
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  These people are disgusting, folks, and they want to demonize independent media by lying about me,
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  by misrepresenting.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  And the people making money on Sandy Hook are the lawyers and, quite frankly, the families
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  with their big foundations and their big think tanks and all the things they've done.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  And a bunch of the ones that sued me have got big charities.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  They live full time off of it.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  And they got the nerve to point at me and claim, I make money off Sandy Hook when I hardly ever covered it.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  So that's the reality.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  That's where this is all gone.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  I'm done talking about Pierce Morgan.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  I've got more clips here, but I'm just going to go ahead and throw this in the trash.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  And I'm done discussing that.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  I've got some other news.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.000]  I want to hit on the Davos Group meeting and coverage we're going to have of that.

[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  how they want to euthanize you, how they want to get rid of you.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  But please, listeners, understand, we are in your hands.
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  They can't shut us down.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  Only you can.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  We're almost at the level we need to stay on air, but we're not there.

[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  We'll still have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula in soon with the same orange bottle, but it's the same pill.

[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:27.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  They're already given to the pregnant women.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  80-plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:41.000]  Let's do it together.
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  And the fight starts at Infowars.com.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfowarsStore.com.

[02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:53.000]  Well, so do I.
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist,
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:00.000]  and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:04.000]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.000]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.000]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front,
[02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:15.000]  but I'm not going to back down, and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  So please keep me on the field.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  that will empower you and your family.

[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:45.000]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:56.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000]  What, uh, what are you doing over there?
[03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000]  What? Nothing. Nothing.
[03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:04.000]  Where?
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000]  In Ukraine. What are you up to?
[03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  Ukraine. What? Ukraine. Nothing's happening in Ukraine.
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:14.000]  Ukraine of all places. Where do you get this stuff?
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  No, it looks like there's some sort of NATO expansion and a CIA-backed coup,
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000]  and something about Joe Biden withholding a billion dollars.
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  Want to get impeached?
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  Impeached. You can't impeach me.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  In that case, just shut up.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  No, no, I'm not kidding. It looks like Russia is massing on the border.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  Well, it's fine. We're sending Anthony Blinken over there.
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  Oh, to prevent a war?
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  No.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  Okay, well, what's he doing?
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:37.000]  He's, uh, going over to, uh, protect democracy.
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  Oh, democracy. I love that word.
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Terrible news.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  Oh, no.
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  Russia invaded Ukraine.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  Oh, no, why?
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  Well, because why did Putin is evil?
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  So, because Putin is evil?
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  Putin evil? Zelensky good.
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  That about sums it up.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  Okay, so the largest country in the world decided to invade a country the size of Texas,
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  and the only reason you're giving me is Putin evil.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  Big country, little country. You get it.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  I'm confused.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  Well, you don't like the fact that a bigger country invaded a smaller country.
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  Do you?
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  No, I mean, I guess not.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000]  Great, you're fully on board. Here's a Ukrainian flag.
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  Hey, have you heard about the ghost of Kiev?
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  He's this lone fighter pilot.
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  It's protecting the whole city.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  He's already downed like six Russian airplanes.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:19.000]  It's incredible.
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  Whoa, really?
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  No, no.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  But there are these guys on Snake Island.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  When the Russians demanded they surrender, they responded, go fuck yourself.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  It's awesome.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  Whoa, really?
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  No, no, that didn't happen either.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  But did you hear about the Russian atrocities?
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  They are committing war crimes against children.
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  Oh my God, really?
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  Nope, but it doesn't matter, because we have to defend Ukraine.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  They are our military ally.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  I don't actually think they are.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  Yeah, well, we're going to do it anyway, because after all, we've got to defend democracy.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  Okay, so what are we doing to help?
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000]  I mean, can we mediate? We can call for peace?
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000]  How many zeros is in a hundred billion?
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  You're writing them a hundred billion dollar check?
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  Yeah, I mean, I was writing checks in the tens of millions, but I was running out of check.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  So I'll just do one big one.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  How much have you sent them?
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  You mean how much have you sent them?
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  No idea.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  Literally impossible to know.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  Okay, well, where's it all going?
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  Again, who knows?
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  Up in smoke or whatever bombs do.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  Okay, that's so much money. Has there even been an official declaration of war yet?
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  A what?
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  I've never even heard of that.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000]  No, there was a declaration that Putin is evil.
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000]  I'm sure you heard me.
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  Yeah, I don't know if I'm really convinced that Putin is evil.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  Well, of course Putin is evil.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  I mean, if he's not evil, why would he drive our gas prices up so high?
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  Putin drove our gas prices up?
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  Well, gas prices are high because of the sanctions that Putin made us put on him.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  Oh, sanctions. So this is hurting Russia.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  They've never been better, actually.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  What about our oil supply?
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  No, it's awful.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  Actually, we're having to sell our strategic reserves.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  You mean use?
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.000]  No sell.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  Sell to who?
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  China.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  You know, our enemy?
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  Okay, if we're having to sell our strategic reserves, like, why don't we just pump our own oil?
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  Don't we have domestic production?
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  Unfortunately, somebody already banned all of the pipelines and drilling permits, so can't use it.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  Yeah, that was you.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  We're going green.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  Gas prices have doubled.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  It's a transition.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  Transition into what?
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  Transition for climate change.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  I thought we were talking about the war in Ukraine.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  Oh, right. Well, the weapons that we're giving Ukraine are extremely fuel-efficient.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  We can kill thousands for the same amount of emissions as a small SUV.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  So, progress.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  And hey, here's some good news.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  Somebody just blew up Russia's underwater pipeline.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:32.000]  My God, who?
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  I don't know.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  Who could it be?
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  No one's going to believe that.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  They're going to think you did it.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  Me?
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  The U.S. government?
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  You know Russia has nukes, right?
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  Like, is this game of brinksmanship really worth it?
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.000]  I'm in my bunker now.
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  It's pretty nice.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  What was that last question?
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  I said it's really worth this game of nuclear brinksmanship.
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  All right, we're going to come back.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  I'm going to hit a few final stories and then J. Dyer's going to take over.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  And then in about 55 minutes, the great Owen Shroyer with the war room,
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  infowars.com, forward slash show.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  I'm very thankful to all the viewers and listeners and the great crew for the work they do.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  That Harrison Smith video, the Ukraine Warpitches at Mandat Video, it needs to go viral.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  I mean, it's gone viral.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  It's got 75,000 views, but some of those videos he's put out have gotten 5-10 million views.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  It's very important.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Please share it, Mandat Video, right now.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  Take action.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  Ukraine Warpitch, Harrison Smith in his section, Mandat Video.
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  Thanks for watching.
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:20.000]  I'll see you next time.
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:49.000]  Thanks for watching.

[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  Thanks for watching.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:07:12.000]  Thanks for watching.
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  I'll try to read for radio listeners as best I can, TV viewers can read it yourself.
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:21.000]  The transcript of the closed captioning, the English translation, have her saying,
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:24.000]  Deep States after us, this is made up, none of it's true.
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  We would never do this.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.000]  It's not happening.
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:27.000]  Here it is.
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:54.000]  Have you witnessed moments of abuse by the tape brothers?
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:59.000]  We are innocent.
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:02.000]  It is completely fabricated case.
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  We are innocent.
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000]  There is no such proof.
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  Who would have fabricated the case?
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:10.000]  The orders are from abroad.
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  Does anybody have problems with the tape brothers abroad?
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:14.000]  Yes.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  They speak truths that hurt.
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  Were they behaving nicely?
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:27.000]  Were they behaving well with everyone?
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  I was never to be used either.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  Why do you think the case was fabricated?
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  There is no evidence against me, she says.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  There is no evidence against me.
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  They are collaborating with tape brothers, they did not do anything either, they are innocent.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:05.000]  They talk too much and scared high ranking people.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  They scared too many high ranking people, so there you go.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  And you know, I didn't even know that Andrew Tate was running webcams and stuff years ago
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  until after I knew him.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  But the guy is a world champion kickboxer, his brother is world champion chess player,
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  his dad is world champion chess player, and his dad turns out was CIA.
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  And I don't know what is really going on.
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  He sounds like a spy or something now that I know more about him.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  But this whole thing reeks of WikiLeaks and what happened to Julian Assange.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:38.000]  All right, let's go ahead and move on to these reports.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  Look at this side of Russia.
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  Russia declares full control over Solodar in first major win in months taking a major city.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  GOP congressman introduces resolution to place a permanent bust of Zelensky in the US capital.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:56.000]  NATO ramps up presence in Ukraine's neighbor.
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  Russia sends in biggest guns into Ukraine.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  And now this video, shop video, it's on infowords.com.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  Knife wielding suspect taken down by bystanders at Walmart.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000]  Crimes exploding and Sandy's exploding.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  This is why we need good people to stop mad people.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  Roll it.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  Oh, he's doing Dave Chameleon.
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  Oh, shit!
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  Oh!
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  Oh, shit!
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  Oh, shit!
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  Good job, Liga.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  One here to quit.
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  Oh, oh, oh!
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  All right, go ahead and shut it down.
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:36.000]  There's too much cussing.
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  We're having trouble covering it up.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  All right, let's continue now here for J. Dyer takes over.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  Here's to me a few moments.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  Catastrophic outcomes.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  Davis elite worried about global volatility, cost of living crisis, which they've helped
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  implement and orchestrate and say they're having their meeting to restore trust in government
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:58.000]  whether the private corporate mouthpiece quarterbacking the entire attack.
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  Meanwhile, Brazil has concentration camps set up in it.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  Owen Shorter did a great report on it.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  J. Dyer takes over now, but the last five minutes of the hour, we're going to air that report
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  with that information.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  J. Dyer takes over.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  Only you keep us on air.

[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  Only way you fail is by sitting on the fence and not taking action.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  I thank you all.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  Now take action.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  infowarstore.com.
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  Real red pills selling out.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  Last final copies of my signed book.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  Great reset in the world of the world, infowarstore.com.
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  This is an info war.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  We need your funds.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  Thanks for your support.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  J. Dyer of Jays Analysis, bestselling author takes over now.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the exchange.
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  I'm your guest host, J. Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  We are covering the rest of the Milner Fabian text, the text that gets into the history of
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  the CFR, the history of the EU, the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations, all of these
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  globalist institutions that exist that are running our world, setting our policy, which
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  came to the forefront, especially in the last three years, given the KUFID and that whole
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  false narrative, we were basically put under the directive of international institutions
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  telling us what we have to do in terms of our daily lives, telling us how we have to
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  be transitioned into the next phase according to the lockstep document of the Rockefeller
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  Foundation from 2010, the next phase of the great reset business plan.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  It's a business plan that's rolled out in phases and successive stages, requires big
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  catalyzing events to bring us to that next phase.
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  Of course, 9-11 was a huge catalyzing event for the past 20 years, or about what, 20-ish
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  years, 22 years past 9-11.
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  We just see the new 9-11, the slow motion 9-11 of the KUFID narrative and the rollout
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  of the bio weapon vaccines or experiment.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  It's not actually a vaccine.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:56.000]  You know what I mean.
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  Well, how do we get to that?
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  What is the history of all that?
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  And what's the next phase?
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  What do we expect to come?
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  That's what we're going to talk about today.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  And I had mentioned that we can't just think about politics as really the only sphere that
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  drives society and drives culture.
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  Religion drives culture.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  Literature, media, the arts drive culture.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  Business actually drives culture.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  Money, monetary policy, finance, all of these things drive culture.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  And what we learned from the last century, and even going back into the 1890s, is that
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  people like the Fabian Socialists, the Revolutionary Marxists, they had figured out that you can
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  actually steer and create culture for control.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  And one of the things that was pointed out in the, the Ratio-Milner-Fabian book that I
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  hadn't really thought about as a person who studies the history of culture creation, is
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  that if you think about the post-war period, whether post-World War I, where they really
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:00.000]  experimented with what I'm getting at, it's actually post-World War II, where the Syops
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  were rolled out to a degree that had never been seen before.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  And this involves the reconstruction of post-war Germany, post-war Japan.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:16.000]  These societies were actually tested with high-level psychological warfare operations
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  on the part of the Allied powers.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:23.000]  Now, I'm not saying that that makes the Axis powers the good guys, where we always think
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  in these very controlled managed dialectics.
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  In my view, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War were essentially high-level
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  controlled dialectics.
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  And they were controlled by the deep industrial power base and the deep finance power base
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  that is essentially identical to what we call the Anglo-American establishment.
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  And so that establishment, in my view, as Dr. Keropogo says, arranged these two World
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  Wars and the Cold War.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  And they did that because they had a long-term goal, a long-term plan, which would be the
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  reorganization of society, including church, state, the world, commerce, the economy, and
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  even business itself, to go under something that would be completely new, completely different
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  than it had ever been seen in the history of the world.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  There have been predecessors to this position, to this worldview, like Plato's Republic.
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  But that had never been instantiated.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  Plato's Republic is the seminal form of a technocracy, even though technology was in
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  a very primitive, nascent form at that time.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  Now that technology has come to full fruition, these elites believe that they can put us
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  under a fully idealistic utopian socialist project, which requires the mass killing off
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  of most of the earth, mass depopulation.
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  So we'll get to that in a moment.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  We're going to look at how church, education, the state, business, economy, everything has
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  to be revolutionized.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000]  All these areas are being changed.
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  That's where we are right now.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:08.000]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global agenda.
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  because of your past support.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:45.000]  And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts of

[03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:16.000]  Welcome back to The Ultra Jones, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:22.000]  We're discussing the history of psychological operations and social engineering to change entire cultures
[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  and how post-war civilization, post-war Europe became a primary testing ground for how to perfect this technique.
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  And the CFR, the OSS, and the CIA and other culture-creating organizations were heavily involved in post-war Europe.
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:51.000]  In terms of not just the creation of the EU, the common market, all of these types of supernational institutions,
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  they were actually involved in testing out new techniques for how to engineer societies to go against what had been their traditional approach.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:08.000]  For example, in Germany, post-war Germany, the OSS and the CIA via the CFR had put into place a lot of programs
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  to reeducate post-war Germans into becoming an agrarian society to deindustrialize Germany,
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:20.000]  because of course Germany was the central powerhouse of Europe prior to World War II.
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:24.000]  And so this allowed a lot of experimentation with the Morgenthau Plan,
[03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  experimentation with re-engineering that society to teach what we might call neoliberal values to change that society.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  Now, it's not just Germany, it's also other testbed areas.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:44.000]  And I've argued, if you go back to my previous fourth hours where we did a whole analysis of Douglas Valentine's book on Vietnam,
[03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  and how Vietnam was an exercise not really in fighting communism.
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:55.000]  There was maybe one level of this, but it was also a mass reorganization of populations experiment.
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:59.000]  It was a mass reorganization and reeducation experiment.
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  So while it's true that reeducation camps is something that we think of as a communist thing,
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:20.000]  it's not exclusive to economists, but it's also wrote. Cecil Rose actually invented the slave labor camp,
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  and this would be used later on in places like Bolshevik, Russia, where they would have reeducation of gulags.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:32.000]  All of that is a model that was kind of pioneered by De Beers slash Cecil Rose's Diamond Mine Empire.
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:38.000]  And that was something set up by Lord Milner and Lord Rothschild to essentially expand the British Empire.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  And by expanding and testing out certain techniques of corporate control,
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  which included slavery, not just racial slavery, but slavery in general for wage slavery,
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:55.000]  that same model gets exported to other countries as a test experiment for corporate control.
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  Did you know the Bolshevik Revolution was really run out of London and New York?
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  We've lectured through all of Anthony Sutton's books,
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  and it was done for the purpose of the advantage of certain corporations,
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:10.000]  particularly the American Industrial Corporation at that time.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:14.000]  Other entities connected to JP Morgan and Rockefeller Interest, other bankers as well.
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:18.000]  That allowed for experiments in not just reorganizing society,
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  but the new ways to create essentially private labor, private slave labor.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  We see the same thing with private industrial prison complex labor nowadays.
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  It's the same model. It's just now done in terms of the state prisons, which are actually private prisons.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  That's the same principle of slave labor.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  And that same model is now what we're seeing.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:45.000]  Jordan Peterson is supposed to go to reeducation camp now, they're saying, right?
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000]  I mean, this is crazy, right?
[03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:50.000]  But this is not just a communist idea.
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  It's also a monopoly capitalist idea utilized by socialist and communists.
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  And now with the new model that we're going into,
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  the corporate capitalist socialist mix system that we're going into, known as technocracy,
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:08.000]  all of those elements are coming into play.
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  But it's really crucial to understand that this was perfected to a scientific degree
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  in the post-war period with the reconstruction plans in terms of World War II.
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:27.000]  And it didn't stop with World War II post-war reconstruction plans, the Schumann plan, the EU plan.
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  All of those things were reconstruction plans coming out of the post-war plans, right?
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:35.000]  Of the reconstruction of Europe into the European Union,
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  which it turns out was actually a Milner-Fabian creation as well.
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  There was a German plan for that.
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  People think it was a German plan.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  It was actually a Milner-Fabian socialist London plan together with the American power elite.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  It was not mainly a German plan.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  There were some German socialists who also favored the idea of the creation of the EU.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  But all of these institutions go back to the same structure that I've been talking about
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:04.000]  and lecturing through for the past few weeks here on the fourth hour.
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  And if we don't understand that, we're never going to understand that all of these institutions have the same origin.
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  All the institutions today.
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  And that helps prove and demonstrate that we're going through a 100-plus-year plan.
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  It's a strategy.
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  It's not a bunch of idiots running things.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:22.000]  There's a layer of idiocy.
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  It's like a cake.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  And there's like the devil is the center of the cake.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:32.000]  And then you've got a layer of really smart people around him, right?
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  High-level demons.
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  And then you've got a layer.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  It's like a layer cake of idiocy, right?
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:42.000]  Well, the layer of idiocy protects the really nefarious, malicious people in the inner core of the cake.
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  But most people can't penetrate beyond.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  They think, oh, Biden, they're all bunch of idiots.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  They're incompetent.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:52.000]  The layer of incompetency protects these people.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:26:02.000]  And so this week, I noticed on Twitter, people were talking about, oh, 4chan figured out that the Spars document predicted that it would come out, that the stabbies are killing everybody.
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:03.000]  It wasn't 4chan.
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  That was Alex Jones and the researchers at InfoWare that put out that documentary.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  I came on that same week, I think a year and a half ago.
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  It was an emergency broadcast.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  I think I got about almost a million views where we went through the Spars document.
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  We talked about back then how the Spars document actually predicted the reaction of the public.
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  And if you remember, the document says that who gets the blame?
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  Oh, it's these public officials.
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  Now, I'm not saying the public officials shouldn't get the blame.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  But the point is that nobody who's actually running this stuff really gets picked out or blamed, right?
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  No Bill Gates, no Klaus Wall.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  None of these people.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  You always burn a few of these sort of low-level people, like a Fauci or something.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  Now, I'm not saying that the Fauci isn't a criminal or whatever he is, but he's not running all of this.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  He's just one of these scientism minions who's been there for 20 or 30 years doing a bunch of AIDS psyops, right?
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  And AIDS testing.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  So they just applied all that research that he had learned about AIDS to all of this the last three years, obviously.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  But that's not who's really running.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:10.000]  This is way older than people like Fauci and even Bill Gates.
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  It's way older than Klaus Schwab.
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  Where does Klaus Schwab come from?
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  Did he just pop up and create Davos?
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  No.
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  He was recruited by a Kissinger for a special society out of the Harvard Research Project run by the CIA.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  And that was to create another kind of layer of this giant double cake, you could say, right?
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  He's another layer of this cake, which is the public face of Bilderberg.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  That's why he used to be part of the Bilderberg steering committee, right?
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:46.000]  I think he was ahead of it at one point.
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  And who set up all that?
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  Well, it was a conglomeration of Fabian socialists, SS members, Prince Bernhardt, David Rockefeller,
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  and members of the Milner, Fabian, Rothschilds, Rhodes, Milner, or little collided and set circles.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  That's who set up all of these institutions.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  In fact, the EU is really creation of Bilderberg, which is the inner group that I'm talking about, right?
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  That's these people.
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  People like Churchill, for example.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  He was actually a stooge of these people if you get into the real history of Churchill.
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  And I'm not saying that makes all the British people bad.
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  It's not the British people, it's not the American people.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  It's the elites that run these things at the CFR, at the World Economic Forum, at Bilderberg.
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  That's who's really calling the shots.
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  Fortune 500, Fortune 100.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  That's who's setting up Federal Reserve, setting up IMF, World Bank, United Nations.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  The United Nations is a successor to the League of Nations.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  And if you didn't know, Churchill was actually a druid.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:47.000]  They'll look up the pictures of Winston Churchill at his famous druid lodge,
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  and druids believe in worshiping the earth and, of course, getting rid of most of the people.
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:52.000]  Many of them do.
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  So don't go anywhere.
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:54.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:56.000]  I'm Jay's analysis.
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars.
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:06.000]  Under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:13.000]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  for the last few years because they work so well.
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan,
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:32.000]  And not just other one name, they sell these under three or four other brands
[03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:44.000]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:48.000]  These things are incredible.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:51.000]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:54.000]  and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:57.000]  Get them at infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:53.000]  This is our new InfoWars MD credible line.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:00.000]  InfoWars secret weapon is finally here.
[03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:03.000]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy,
[03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:05.000]  for your way of life, for your libido.
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:08.000]  And it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:13.000]  And I almost forgot you save at least 50% on these products
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:18.000]  for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:21.000]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation
[03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:24.000]  that supplies some of the top names.
[03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:26.000]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener
[03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:29.000]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:34.000]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:37.000]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:40.000]  You're not going to find two-market 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:43.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:49.000]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.

[03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:14.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:16.000]  I'm your guest, Joe Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:20.000]  I want to remind you to support the InfoWarsStore by going to the InfoWarsStore.com
[03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:23.000]  and getting all of those excellent products there, especially the books.
[03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:29.000]  I'm really enjoying Alex's great reset book, looking to do a good video analysis
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  and podcast on that text pretty soon.
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:37.000]  But you can also get my books in the shop at my website, go to jaysanalysis.com.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  You get access to my archives.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:45.000]  If you sign up for the website, you can also get access to my material on Rockfin,
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  which is a great free speech-based platform.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  Now, we were talking about culture creation and how this was done as a mass kind of experiment.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:56.000]  In the post-war period following World War II, and that this allowed,
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:02.000]  then in the Cold War, a lot of other theaters of war to become culture creation experiments.
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:05.000]  And a lot of those individuals involved in that culture creation,
[03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  reeducation, Cy War techniques, then went from the OSS, not kidding,
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  to being the heads of the major media outlets, the heads of the major networks.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  They all come out of the OSS.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:25.000]  People from the CIA. So they took that wartime psychological warfare information
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  and scientific technique, and then they then applied it to mass media.
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:33.000]  They also had control of most of the press at that time.
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:37.000]  All the big media outlets back in the 40s and 50s were already controlled
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  by the very people that we've been talking about.
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  So we're deep into this.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  This is not something that we just elect a few politicians and we're out of it.
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:48.000]  I'm not saying that you can't elect good politicians. You can.
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:53.000]  But we have to understand the real diagnosis of what the situation is.
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  If we don't understand the diagnosis, if we don't accurately diagnose the problems,
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  we're just going to be spinning hamster wheels and never solving anything.
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  And that's precisely how this system actually works,
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  is that you're constantly given false leads, false conservatives,
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:10.000]  fake right-wing people to follow.
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:13.000]  And then it never gets fixed, nothing ever changes,
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  because there's never an identification of the actual superstructure of how the system is run.
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  And you're always kind of within a predetermined circle,
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  learning and disagreeing and fighting over the daily news cycle,
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  and you're never seeing the big picture.
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  That's why I always try to focus on the big picture,
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  because the daily news cycle is important,
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  but it only really makes sense in terms of the bigger context, the bigger picture.
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  You'll notice that when they develop the PSIOP of news,
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:44.000]  some of the local news and the newsman, the Tom Brokaw,
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  kind of barking at you about what you're supposed to think and all this,
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:52.000]  they never gave you the big historic context.
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  And that's what we try to do here,
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  because we have to understand that this is not something that you can understand
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:35:59.000]  without a bigger paradigm.
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:03.000]  How are you going to fix these issues if you don't understand what the long-term plan is?
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  And the fact that this long-term plan has been kept from the masses
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  is precisely how it has been so successful up to this point.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  People just didn't know what a technocracy was.
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  People in colleges, universities, they're not taught about this,
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  until you get to like the highest levels of doctors, medical people,
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:27.000]  and international relations people who are the people that they recruit into this stuff.
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  That's it.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:31.000]  There are other people that are not really involved in this.
[03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  Maybe there's a couple of philosophers who got recruited into this
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  that are mentioning Quigley's texts, people like Isaiah Berlin, I think,
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:39.000]  people like Carl Popper.
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:43.000]  This is why Soros's name is the institution that opens the Society Institute.
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:45.000]  That's Carl Popper's book.
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  So there's a handful of kind of high-level philosophical academics
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  who've been recruited into this according to Quigley since in the 20th century.
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  So there might be one or two academics that are philosophers or whatever.
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  For the most part, this is people in international relations,
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  people who are lawyers, people who are high-level CEOs, business people.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  That's who's recruited into this kind of stuff.
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  And so they were already pulling information about this out of the libraries
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  And if you go and look up the day tapes, this is a really important overlooked piece of research.
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:28.000]  There was a conference held in the late 60s under the Planned Parenthood organization
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:32.000]  of all the top doctors in the United States at that time.
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  So this is the elite doctors, and they were all brought to this one location
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  to be taught by the head of Planned Parenthood under the Rockefeller ages
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  that there's a plan to have enforced vaccinations of all Americans
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  to have implantable chips or some kind of RFID tracking.
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:57.000]  At that time, it was pretty low-tech, so now it's a lot more advanced with nanotech, right?
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:38:05.000]  There was a plan to increase through degeneracy and sexual control
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  the complete changing of the moral landscape of American sexuality.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:13.000]  That was all mentioned in this 1969 plan.
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  Look up the New Order of Barbarians.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:18.000]  The whole four-hour lecture is on YouTube if you want to find that.
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  And that lays out actually this whole conference, his plans.
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  Now, the reason we know about that is because one of those doctors that was there happened to be a Catholic,
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  and he went to, in the 1980s, they called it a pro-life league.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  I don't know if it still exists anymore, but then he leaked this and so it's known as the daytaves.
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  And I think a lot of people kind of like the silent weapons for quiet wars documents,
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  they probably thought this was something very speculative or a conspiracy theory,
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  which might be plausible had we not gotten into a situation where now by 2023
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  most of the things mentioned in that have rolled out, right?
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  And who would have thought at that time that you would have the push for things like universal basic income,
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:06.000]  the push for total technocracy, the push for changing your gender.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  All of that stuff was mentioned back in the late 60s in this document.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  Also, look up the Barrelson Jaffe memo, which is also fostered by the Rockefeller Foundation as well.
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  It's sent out to all the Planned Parenthoods, and it says the same thing,
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  creation of technocracy, getting rid of having families, basically promoting every type of sexuality,
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:32.000]  not because of anything to do with freedom or liberty, but rather to do with the reorganization of society.
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:39.000]  So you have to understand that all of this makes perfect sense when we look at it from a psychological warfare,
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:41.000]  from a war perspective.
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:43.000]  It's warfare that's being waged.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  And culture and economic warfare are two elements of warfare that most people don't know about.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  People think of warfare as tanks and bombs and soldiers. No, no, no. That's old school.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:40:00.000]  Warfare, especially in the 20th century, developed into economic warfare, developed into culture warfare,
[03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:06.000]  and the creation of toxic culture as a form of ideological cywar.
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  If you don't understand that, you'll never understand what's going on around you.
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  You'll never understand that all of pop culture is basically toxic culture creation.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:18.000]  It all comes out of MKL dream.
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  And it's just, and even myself, somebody who studies this all the time.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  I mean, it was new to me that I didn't even know about the post-war PsiOps experiments in reeducation
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  in terms of the post-war Germany, post-war Axis powers.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  And then I already didn't know about the post for the Cold War experimentation in culture creation.
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  So here we are every day.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  We're learning new things.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:42.000]  Things come out, historians, bright new information.
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  Why history is so important. If we don't know history, we're doomed to repeat it.
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  So what are the areas of society that this plan for 100 plus years, 120 years has been attempted to reorganize all areas of society?
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  The church, church is now being reorganized into after the introduction of ecumenism,
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  higher critical liberalism, and the idea of the social gospel, liberation of theology.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  It is to turn the church not into an institution focused on repentance and belief in resurrection of Christ,
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  or this kind of stuff, but rather to turn it into an NGO or a tool of soft power.
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  During the Cold War, with C.D. Jackson and the Doctrine and Warfare program of the CIA,
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  which is now declassified, now well-known, look at David Wimphoss book.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:34.000]  Now that is a change from the promotion of Americanism to turning the churches into institutions of a new global religion.
[03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  Pachamama, that kind of stuff.
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  That's the end goal of the world religion ecuminous movement.
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:43.000]  Now is its new phase.
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  Its next phase is to, as Aldous Huxley says in the primal philosophy, create a new generic world religion where all the world religions blend into John Blob.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  Education, right?
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  Madame Blavatsky, Horace Mann, John Dewey, all of these socialists and theosophists.
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  Theosophists are basically the creation of the Fabian Milner social circles as well, socialist circles.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  It's a Fabian socialist institution as well.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:21.000]  They all said, let's change education to be not something where you learn to critically think, but you become the socialized cog in a giant system.
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  So it's a socialization tool, public schooling in America, not a tool to create critical thinkers.
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  The state, the state becomes an engine of the march of God in history, as Hegel said.
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  Hegel is the ultimate statist, right?
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  And the technocratic state is a combination of Hegel and Plato.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  It's the idea of the state basically being the voice of God in history.
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  And so it determines truth and falsehood, the corporate state.
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:54.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jasonalsus.com.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.000]  And it's the same psi-op today.
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:24.000]  Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[03:43:24.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away,
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:33.000]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down info wars.
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  And that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  If you decide to go to infowarstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more,
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  It is all in your hands.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  Thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists, go to infowarstore.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  It's up to you.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:01.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:08.000]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:10.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:13.000]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:16.000]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years.
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:40.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support.
[03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  1776 is the promo code. The destination is infowarstore.com.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  And I thank you all for your support.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:01.000]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little,
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:06.000]  We're actually winning the info war.
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:11.000]  And when you realize that Band-Aught Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible,
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at Band-Aught Video.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aught Video.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:28.000]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect,
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  an amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:36.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:45.000]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:50.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:02.000]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in Force MD.

[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:20.000]  You know our body's ultimate turmeric formula is amazing?

[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.

[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  M4Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com.
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:58.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:24.000]  Hi.
[03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  So, if you didn't say that, I didn't.
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  I'll give you a little message.
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.000]  They wouldn't call themselves Hegelians.
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:36.000]  You've probably heard of Hegel from, if you're an M4Wars fan,
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  or if you've listened to, you know, people in the alternative media,
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  thesis antithesis synthesis, right?
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:44.000]  And we know that that's a technique of kind of manipulation and social control
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:48.000]  and psychological warfare techniques to manipulate with false dialectics
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  and then present you with the synthesis, which is the solution to this manufactured thing.
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  Well, for Hegel, it was something much more than that.
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:48:02.000]  It was actually the process of reality itself was in his thesis antithesis synthesis.
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  And all of history is kind of working itself out to this, what he called an omega point,
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  which is where all of reality would become God.
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  And so he's very influential in certain ways to transhumanism.
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  And his vehement critic, Nietzsche, was also influential for transhumanists
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  because Nietzsche thought of the ubermensch, right?
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:27.000]  The overman would eventually emerge and kind of be beyond all limitations,
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  beyond all morality, beyond good and evil.
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:32.000]  So there's kind of elements of all of these figures,
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  as well as elements of Platonism in terms of technocracy
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  that go into the overriding view of today's elites and where they're trying to take us.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  And Hegel's idea that we could evolve to the history itself would produce God, right?
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  We've heard of people like Ray Kurzweil. I don't believe in God yet, right?
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  Because God would be the thing that emerges from creation that is the sentient AI or whatever.
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:06.000]  And this is, again, very close to Hegelianism because the idea is that as we evolve to transhumanism,
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:08.000]  or as we evolve to what he called the omega point,
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:14.000]  all of reality becomes spirit, all of reality becomes self-consciousness, and is God.
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:18.000]  God in process coming to Self-Realization that all reality is God.
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:22.000]  I mean, that sounds crazy, but, I mean, isn't that kind of what New Ages teach?
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  Isn't that kind of what Eastern religions teach?
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  And, believe it or not, Hegel was actually involved in hermetic secret societies.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  This is now confirmed. There's a book, Hegel and Hermeticism.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:42.000]  Now, again, I'm not saying that the world elites are going and hiding in bunkers and reading Hegel, right?
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:44.000]  Very few people can read. I mean, he's almost unreadable.
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  But that's his philosophy. That's his process philosophy that did influence a lot of people,
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  and including people in the transhumanist movement.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  So, if you have heard of Neuval Harari and the way he speaks about things,
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  and Klaus Schwab and Ray Kurzweil, they may not be self-conscious Hegelians,
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  but they're definitely influenced by this train of thought.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:10.000]  This dialectical process philosophy that is moving us towards transhumanism,
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  or this belief that we can transcend time and space, bodily limitations through technology.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  Now, I think that's a pipe dream. I don't think you can actually achieve those things.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  Certainly, technology can help us.
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  But what I'm trying to get at is that these are real philosophical things,
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:30.000]  that real power elites do believe and do get into.
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  And if we don't understand their approach and their ideas, how could you ever go against this?
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:38.000]  You don't even know what you're fighting.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  So, I was talking about the reorganization of societies, cultures, civilizations in every area of life.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  That's what you're up against. That's what we're up against.
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:52.000]  We're not up against political opponents.
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  It's much wilder and crazier and farfetched beyond anything like stupid politics debates, right?
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  It manifests in politics, but it's much more than that.
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  We're talking about the changing of religion everywhere and across the entire globe.
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  We're talking about not necessarily eradication of it, but turning it into a tool for global power structures for globalism.
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  Religion as an NGO for globalism is what I'm saying.
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  Education is purely socialization, purely indoctrination.
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  That's it.
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:33.000]  The state is, as Hegel says, the march of God in history.
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  Okay.
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  And I'm sorry if you're a libertarian, that doesn't mean that it's vindication of libertarianism.
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  For libertarians, it's the private corporations that own the state.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:52.000]  Now, I know many libertarians who believe in opposing monopoly, corporatism would agree with that, or monopoly capitalism.
[03:51:52.000 --> 03:51:58.000]  But it's much more than these older debates of free market versus centralization.
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  It's way beyond that.
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:07.000]  We're talking about full-on, post-industrial, austerity, great reset, shutting down of everything.
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:16.000]  And that's why what you're hearing called for is not people that are stupid that want to shut down gastos.
[03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:21.000]  It's not dumb people who want to call to ban cars.
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:22.000]  They're not dumb people.
[03:52:22.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  They're a layer of dummies run by highly sophisticated psychological warfare and mad scientist elites.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:37.000]  That's why they want death care.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:38.000]  Use in Asia.
[03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:42.000]  That's why they want the banning of cars, the banning of meat.
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  This is warfare 101.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  Plato said you have to control the plebs and the people at the bottom of the pyramid, what they eat.
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  You can't feed them meat, feed them grains.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:52:58.000]  Keep them weak, docile, fat, and dumb.
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  The shutting down of travel, the shutting down of commerce.
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:02.000]  Those are elements of freedom.
[03:53:02.000 --> 03:53:04.000]  Those are elements of sovereignty.
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  Those are elements of you having power and self-sufficiency and independence apart from a global super state.
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  You can't have that in a global super state.
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  And so they said 100 years ago, we'll have a universal basic income credit system.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells said that 100 years ago.
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  This is not something that Mark Zuckerberg jumped up.
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  It's not an invention of any Silicon Valley tech nerd.
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:35.000]  This is something invented by people 100 years ago, like Lord Birkenhead saying that we'll have babies in test tubes.
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:37.000]  In the 1930s, he said that.
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:43.000]  And he was one of the Lord Milner circles, one of the Cecil Rose Roundtable people.
[03:53:43.000 --> 03:53:48.000]  Look up Lord Birkenhead's famous essay in Cosmopolitan magazine where he says,
[03:53:48.000 --> 03:53:54.000]  Save my essay because in 100 years, we'll start genetically engineering babies, bring them out of test tubes.
[03:53:54.000 --> 03:53:57.000]  We'll have a completely controlled technocracy.
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:01.000]  100 years ago.
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  That's the real plan.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:12.000]  And I think the argument here is that if people aren't smart enough to go and read a freaking public essay and figure out that it's a 100-year-old plan,
[03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  then the idea is that you deserve it.
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:22.000]  Now, I don't think that that's true, but we will be defeated if we don't wake up and understand that.
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  I mean, how hard is it to go and look and see if Lord Birkenhead wrote an essay in the 1920s or 1930s in Cosmopolitan magazine about growing babies in test tubes in 100 years?
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:38.000]  There it is.
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  Okay, there you go.
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:40.000]  It's a 100-year plan.
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:48.000]  He was one of the top elites in the circles of Milner, Cecil Rhodes, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  This is the type of thing that you read in Brave New World.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  All of a sudden he's hanging out in the circles of these people.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  That's why he wrote the book.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  So, like, how, why can't anybody figure this out?
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  And that's why they want to ban cars.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  That's why they want to ban stoves.
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  That's why they want to have no families.
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  That's why they want to have 15-minute cities, right?
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  That's why they want to have death care, euthanasia.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:17.000]  It's in all the sci-fi stories.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:18.000]  Logan's Runs.
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:24.000]  That's why this is the Agenda 21 Treaty, the Rio Bush Treaty.
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  Well, if they had plan for 2030, it's all in that as well, which Alex has been talking about for 23 years, 25 years.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  The UN Biodiversity Project, the Rewilding Project.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:44.000]  All of those are real plans and projects for the shutting down of the existing system.
[03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  Remember the CDC guy? He said, let's blow up the existing system to bring in the new medical system.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  And he said that before, the COOF.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  So, why are they letting all of this come out about, you know, the stabbies and all that as the SPARS documents?
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:05.000]  Because that's part of blowing up the existing system by design.
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  It's a technique of warfare.
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  And they're going to blame it, of course, on everybody else.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  It was, you know, these low-level people, oh, and it was your fault that it's everybody else's fault that the stabbies are doing this, right?
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:23.000]  They'll just say that it was a new, you know, COVID-27 is going around and doing it.
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  We didn't know that COVID-27 is causing people to have, you know, cardiac arrest, blah, blah, blah.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  Those are, again, all, it's all just psyopsis, all just gaslighting.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  But the point is that this is all part of a bigger plan.
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:37.000]  You don't understand the bigger plan.
[03:56:37.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  None of this is ever going to be solved.
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  It's not going to be stopped.
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  So, all you have to do is go read Lord Birkenhead's essay.
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:44.000]  It's not very long.
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  And you can see it's a plan.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  It's not a plan that Klaus cooked up.
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  It's not a plan that Henry Kissinger cooked up.
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:58.000]  In fact, it's not even a plan David Rockefeller cooked up because he went and studied under these people.
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  He studied under Harold Lasky at Harvard and at the London School of Economics.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  And that was set up by who? By the Fabian socialists who wanted to align themselves, combine Marxism with big capitalism.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  That's their whole thing.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:15.000]  That explains everything, doesn't it?
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  It's a perfect explanation.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:22.000]  It's a perfect way to understand what's going on now.
[03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  And if we don't understand that, we're not going to fix it.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:29.000]  So, all of these institutions, all these global institutions, they have this as their origin.
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:30.000]  This is the origin.
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:31.000]  This is how to understand.
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  It's a big, huge plan.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  And this is the basis for the UBI.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:39.000]  This is the basis for changing everybody's DNA.
[03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:42.000]  So remember, it wasn't just a way to change the church.
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:47.000]  It's a way to change human beings, to change their own biology.
[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:50.000]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school.
[03:57:50.000 --> 03:57:52.000]  And they had great effects.
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water, and the food, and the feminizing factors,
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:06.000]  it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:08.000]  But these products work great for women as well.
[03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have PainMD.
[03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.

[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:27.000]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:29.000]  Don't do it during the day.
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:33.000]  1776 testosterone boost. Totally incredible.
