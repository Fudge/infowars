[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.320]  no man you just got me and Jason well that's great how are you how you doing Alex man there's
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.200]  too much happening what do you think of this Michael Moore stuff uh I'm gonna I'm gonna bite
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.240]  my tongue on this one you know Alex I personally think it's great Dylan's a little more hesitant
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.400]  but the fact that he's talking about the Pentagon issues and explosions in the buildings of the
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.720]  World Trade Center is only a positive push and it'll continue to open more minds and you know
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.600]  they're not gonna be able to stop that story on Digg well I mean my point is we know Michael Moore's
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.840]  not perfect and I know years ago I've talked to several Hollywood people who've had dinner with
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.960]  him he knows all about it he's put 9-11 truth links on his site before but I mean you know
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.360]  better late than never at least I mean I understand I'm in no love affair with with him as well but you
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.720]  know he's gonna get a lot of heat for this Dylan I mean do you I mean do you have anything uh to
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.040]  say about it well no like I said well actually like Jason said I'm glad to see that he's finally
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.920]  mentioning this stuff it just seems I don't I don't want to say too little too late but you
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.560]  know it's it just I don't know I don't really know let's no no let's see how it pans out I
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.800]  mean I certainly agree with you but again better late than never yeah exactly better late than
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.680]  never so you know good good for him by the way I saw a rough cut you guys aren't done I'm told it's
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.000]  even better now but it was incredibly powerful of just the first half the film you've got most of
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.520]  it done but you're sweetening adding new things because you're going and still getting more
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.320]  interviews up to the minute uh this is huge folks just to fill you in here uh Dylan or Jason just
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.120]  just give him the background you've confirmed who it is he's he's well known he was on television
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.880]  hint hint but he doesn't want to be known publicly until the film comes out he will reveal himself
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:59.360]  in the film it's just that he doesn't want the he's a high-level executive uh well he's an
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.680]  executive at that company he was the boss well it wasn't a company see this was somebody who
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.160]  was called to the oem building that's what I mean to the company that's what I meant yeah yeah well
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.040]  I don't want to give away too much you do it you do it yeah I'll just explain how this came about
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.360]  uh Dylan and I had been looking for this guy for some time didn't even know his name
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.920]  uh had basically just watched you know hundreds of videos of eyewitnesses explosions at the at the
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.760]  World Trade Center and we came across this one and Dylan why don't you tell people how you fished
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.440]  it his name out I just I dug around man I don't I don't want to give away too many details and um
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.440]  the main reason that we don't want to give away too many details you know I I read some comments
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.480]  on 9-11 blogger people were like oh this seems more like a sales technique than you know searching
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.960]  for the truth and that's not the case at all we're trying to keep this guy's life you know
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.480]  somewhat normal until the film comes out because god knows when this man goes public and people
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.040]  know who this guy is all hell's gonna break loose in this guy's life not only are people on our side
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.120]  going to be trying to track him down people like Mark Roberts are probably going to call him up
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.920]  and be like well uh I think you're lying and here's why so this guy is on record off the radar
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.960]  yeah this guy is is now on record that day being in World Trade Center building seven with another
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.600]  individual basically we can prove without a shadow of a doubt that not only was he there
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.840]  everything he's saying is true and we can I can say this with full confidence because we've done
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.080]  our homework on him and and not only that he actually spoke to the 9-11 commission Alex so when
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.240]  Thomas Keene says that they don't have any any evidence of explosions going off in World Trade
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.040]  Center 7 this guy sat down with him and we sent you a couple clips we're going to play a couple
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.120]  more tonight but basically he goes through an amazing account of what happens to him that day
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.480]  and then later on goes into detail about how he told this story how no one seemed to listen to
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.040]  him and he didn't really care because he was telling the truth and it's just an amazing account
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.640]  and like I said we have him on video that day it's going to be a great lead in and it's really the
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.440]  knock the knock it out of the park interview that proves that building seven was demolished exactly
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.160]  and gentlemen all I can say is excellent detective work Dylan and Jason and Cory but Dylan I mean how
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.960]  good did it feel when you're watching all these hundreds of videos of police security people
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.600]  stuff I mean I mean just massive you know info and then boom you're able to track them down and
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.000]  have it totally confirmed and this is my only thing is I understand why he doesn't want to
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.840]  go public now because he doesn't want all the heat twice because he would get all the clamoring
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.640]  calls and heat now then he'd get it in a few months when the film comes out I totally understand
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.920]  I'm just worried about the safety issue of but as long as you guys have got the video frankly I'm
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.880]  worried about your safety but but but that will make you a little safer I guess by at least playing
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.560]  the audio and you know privately some people you can trust knowing who his name is and who he is
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.440]  and plus if people do real detective work they can track down the video clips out there and who
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.440]  this is uh but uh so so I'm not second guessing not releasing it but I know why people are doing
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.440]  that uh but but but now that I understand you know the angle of uh the enemies out there going
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.880]  after him trying to make him renege that is a real threat so maybe maybe you guys are right
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.200]  well that's what we're trying to keep this as low-key as possible and like you said the
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.280]  publicity twice would just be crushing this guy is a family man I mean he's literally just a few
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.400]  years away from retirement and like I said when people find out who this guy is it is gonna blow
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.440]  the lid off this thing there is no doubt that building seven was rigged with bombs explosions
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.560]  took place before the demolition at 5 20 and when you play the clip you'll find out this guy goes up
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.160]  to the office of emergency management on the 23rd floor where it was literally manned shortly before
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.600]  he got up there but play the clip and it'll speak for tell us as much as you can because
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.600]  jabbering to you last night while while while you're on the cell phone you know jabbering
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.080]  this morning I get things confused well Alex just let's just play the clip I mean he says
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.400]  it better than yeah it's a 90 second clip and it'll go over right up to the point of the first
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.480]  explosion and then we'll take it from there yeah because we've got two clips right yeah okay okay
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:13.280]  let's play the first clip here it is I was asked to go and uh man the uh office of emergency
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:21.120]  management at the World Trade Center 7 on the 23rd floor as I arrived there there were police
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:29.040]  all in the lobby they um they showed me the way to the elevator we got up to the 23rd floor
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.080]  we couldn't get in we had to go back down then security and police took us to the freight
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:41.200]  elevators where they took us back up and we did get in upon arriving into the OEM EOC
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.920]  we noticed that everybody was gone I saw coffee that was on the desk still the smoke was still
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:59.120]  coming off the coffee I saw I saw uh half-eaten sandwiches and after I called several individuals
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.880]  one individual told me that um to leave and leave right away
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.400]  exactly came running back in and said we're the only ones up here we got to get out of here he
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.160]  found the stairwell so we we subsequently went to the stairwell and we're going down the stairs
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.880]  when we reached the eighth or the sixth floor the landing that we were standing on gave way
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.040]  there was an explosion and the landing gave way and where I was left there hanging I had to climb
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.320]  back up and now I had to walk back up to the eighth floor after getting to the eighth floor
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:41.440]  everything was dark well I'm just confused about one thing and one thing only why World Trade Center
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.760]  7 went down in the first place I'm very confused about that I know what I heard I heard explosions
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.560]  the the uh the explanation I got was it was the fuel oil tank
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.080]  I'm an old boiler guy if it was a fuel oil tank it would have been one side of the building
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:10.720]  when I got to that lobby the lobby was totally destroyed it looked like King Kong had came
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.040]  through it and stepped on it and I it was so destroyed I didn't know where I was
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.040]  and it was so destroyed they had to take me out through a hole in the wall
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.320]  a makeshift hole that I believe the fire department made to get me out and and that's
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.160]  basically both clips right there Alex and he follows it up by saying you know they were
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.760]  stepping over bodies and the the firemen were literally telling them not to look down that
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.320]  dispels the no loss of life in building seven theory he discusses uh also with us how while
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.200]  he was trapped on those floors he was talking to firemen prior to both collapses of the World Trade
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.880]  Center towers one and two as each building collapsed they ran away from it you know as
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.960]  as everybody did you know so those explosions that he got trapped on the eighth floor happened
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.240]  before both towers fell he heard many other explosions during the whole thing the entire lobby
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.080]  was blown up there were dead bodies in building seven and none of that is a part of any official
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.320]  count of the story now let's be clear this is an explosion before tower one and two even fall
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.600]  that's what's key about this that's absolutely right now now stay there because Steve Watson's
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.000]  going to write an article about this that's why I want to debrief you about as much as you can say
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.720]  or what I can say from our private conversations I don't want to drop the ball on this Dylan
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.720]  and Jason stay with us and tonight on their show right here on GCN they're going to play even more
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.880]  of the clips I this has got my heart beating fast folks this is so big and it's dangerous

[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.800]  town
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.000]  i live back in the woods you see a woman and the kids and the dogs and me
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.240]  i got a shotgun a rifle and a four-wheel drive and a country boy can survive
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.400]  because you can't starve us out you can't make us run
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:39.040]  all right let's go back to our guest flower field all day long i can catch catfish from dust
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.840]  dylan averie you know these are young men and they live under incredible stress and you know
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:50.000]  corey is a battle hardened combat vet at two different theaters and dylan was you know what
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.680]  22 years old when he got into all this or 23 i forget and jason bermas and they're just doing
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.200]  an exemplary job and they've been real quiet the last few months you've noticed because they've
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.400]  been busy little bumblebees but i assure them they're under surveillance and they know that
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.720]  and we're under surveillance and there's no way to fully keep the secret so they have to bring
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.840]  out as much as they've had now it's really a catch-22 for safety because the type of interview
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:20.000]  they've got is the type of interview that sends men in black with silencer uh submachine guns to
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.200]  your house okay and then you hear there was a gas explosion by doing this they are a lot safer and
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.040]  so is this gentleman now i understand it's a catch-22 of release it don't release it uh we'll
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.880]  see but it's not going to be a travesty if it leaks out people are pretty smart but we'll see
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.080]  what happens we'll be careful what specifically to contain this and make sure the news gets out
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.240]  that you have it but the so it doesn't endanger this guy with the you know with the public or
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.080]  the crazies or whatever specifically what can steve watson put in the article today
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.440]  well you can basically say that we have an eyewitness that was in the uh world trade
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.120]  center building seven prior to both collapses he witnessed a explosion on the sixth floor
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.160]  literally almost died there uh he talked to the firefighters before both towers went down
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.080]  watched them run away uh walked over bodies in the lobby and uh you know was taken out by the
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.800]  fire department i mean when he also tells us that when he got out there the fire department
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.080]  told him that he needed to uh get 20 blocks up and this guy's knees were blown out at the time
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.160]  and he's like i can't walk 20 blocks and he said well you better crawl because explosions are still
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160]  happening so you know that just ties into what morrison a lot of these firefighters know there
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.360]  were secondary explosions they know they haven't been told the truth and it's just so obvious that
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.480]  you know seven was demolished in on itself now now roughly what time was he in uh the command
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.840]  center when he saw the half-eaten sandwich the smoking coffee i think that's prior to the second
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.720]  plane impact right that is prior because he was in the building out because my god guys i mean you
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.920]  know you're literally sitting on a giant stack of dynamite right now absolutely and that's why we've
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.160]  taken the precautions to secure other copies in case something does happen to the original
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.040]  and this this is going to see the light of day and that's at some point and we hope it's with
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.120]  you know the final cut of this film because like i said this guy's a family guy he was very
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.240]  gracious to us he was very aware of our work i mean we went in there very skittish alex we
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.760]  we tracked this guy down not sure exactly what he was going to say i had an idea that's what police
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.440]  that's what real police investigators do you knock on doors and you never know when somebody's
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.120]  going to spill their guts stay there man folks can you you're not going to believe who this guy is

[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.880]  seen the workings of it uh the preliminaries and and now it's much more advanced and we've
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.160]  got to hook up since i can see these interviews uh but this stuff's so secure i may have to travel
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.560]  to new york just to see it uh but uh just absolutely amazing folks someone involved
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.480]  at the highest levels being sent to the security area the bunker with a city official high level
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:04.960]  and uh all of this happening and uh just just it's off the charts gentlemen i mean you guys have got
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.600]  lightning in a bottle on this how much more will we learn about this tonight and give folks the
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.040]  show time um the show time is seven to nine central eight to ten eastern and basically
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.240]  you're just going to hear what me and dylan talked about we're probably going to play
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.760]  we're going to play the two clips that you played here and we'll probably play another
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.720]  30 to 90 second clip of his experience going through the lobby and possibly with the 9-11
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.000]  commission itself but i mean this is a 20 minute interview this guy is straight up i mean he
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.760]  literally has the key to the city alex i mean it's it's it's wild and you know this is exactly what
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.720]  the 9-11 truth movement needed there can be no doubt world trade center building seven was rigged
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.400]  with explosives prior to the plane hitting and and they exploded and and it blew up at
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.200]  520 in a controlled demolition i mean the people that try to debunk that i mean they have to say
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.840]  tricky things like up to 25 percent of the building is scooped out so really it doesn't
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.400]  have to be 25 it could be five percent or ten percent or even less than that it's not even that
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.840]  like one little corner had a little bit of damage absolutely absolutely i mean there was blast damage
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.240]  in the back of the building i suspect that's probably from this massive explosion that uh
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:20.320]  this individual uh experienced that day uh you know it coincides with the fires on the uh seventh
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.760]  and eleventh floor in the elevator when the in the elevator when it blew up absolutely not he was
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.000]  actually in the staircase because they couldn't get down the elevator basically when he came in
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.320]  world trade center building seven already had police officers all in it when they went up into
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.840]  the regular elevator he was unable to get access to the oem he went back down when they came up in
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.520]  the freight elevator the police who escorted them left with that freight elevator so that's
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.680]  the atlas of emergency management the fema command bunker that's right also known as juliani's bunker
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.280]  that's right and uh so they actually had to take the staircase and he you know he basically said
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.760]  uh because the other guy was slower he saved his life because they would have been uh either on
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.160]  the sixth floor or below when that is he took place is he scared you know i i don't know if
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.760]  he's scared but he's very concerned he's concerned he's concerned that you know how people are going
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.280]  to view this how much his life might change when this goes public but at the same time he had seen
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.760]  the second edition of our film and uh he was a fan now that's incredible you contact him and
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.440]  boom he's already awake yeah it was pretty amazing uh you know me and dylan were sitting there small
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.040]  talking with him and uh he made a couple comments about uh the film we had made and uh we said
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.360]  actually you know we're the guys that had made that film and it was pretty funny because uh
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.120]  other people would come into his office and he would be like hey this is these are the guys that
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.840]  made loose change and remember we watched that together and they were like wow you know so it
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:56.080]  was a very interesting experience i know you guys are smart but you better know this this one is
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.400]  dangerous and i don't know you better put your heads together i guess you've thought this out
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.640]  since you got this interview last week when did you get this last week uh what was it tuesday
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:12.240]  dylan tuesday yeah tuesday well just make i know you've got it all over the country in a few other
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:19.120]  spots but i would uh i would uh get that out to people like well you know what to do i mean this
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.200]  is just very explosive and uh obviously i think letting some of it leak out keeps you safer because
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.440]  guaranteed the government knows uh going fully public uh will probably be the greatest protection
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.040]  but at the same time then they could really intimidate him or threaten his family and
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.440]  try to extract some recant i don't know you'll have to really put your heads together because
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.400]  i've got a pretty good brain when it comes to this stuff and i am conflicted to say the least
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.520]  so what a responsibility with great power comes great responsibility we'll be right back

[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.960]  huge michael moore developments on 9-11 huge even dwarfing the michael moore situation building
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:54.160]  seven developments we're going to play those clips a little bit later in the show but again
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:02.560]  this is all extremely delicate all of this and we're talking to dylan avery and we're talking
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.120]  to jason bermas gentlemen anything else that needs to be added any other facets that need
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.640]  to be added about this whole bombshell development i'd just like to point out that guerrilla
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.920]  journalism has grown so much in the past few years that it's actually given us the opportunity
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.120]  to get interviews like that i would just like to encourage everybody out there to do the same thing
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.640]  we're doing i mean we are change.org student scholars for 9-11 truth your guys confronting
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.040]  michael moore we need to keep it up and we just need to keep active well when i started doing
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.400]  guerrilla journalism 12 years ago it was i'm not claiming i'm the father of it but it was literally
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.520]  unknown i mean reporters didn't go up and accost people they didn't go up and or or they didn't
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.560]  go get guerrilla interviews they didn't have a venue to put it out uh and when i started doing
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.520]  this i was editing on a reel to reel you know three-quarter inch you know hand splice deal
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.040]  and now just look at the exponential change uh i mean tony blair came out and said let's regulate
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.400]  free speech shut down the free web that they're panicking aren't they well they better panic
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.800]  because we're being we're able to get this information out at a lightning speed and it
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.440]  really does end up taking on a life of its own i mean you saw what happened when juliani was
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.240]  confronted with his prior knowledge of the building collapse and how it worked its way
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.760]  into his you know promo band lying yet again for him and actually arresting somebody for asking a
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:30.560]  question i mean these things snowball into a movement and that movement is to get an independent
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.760]  investigation into 9-11 so we can sit there and watch these war criminals be prosecuted and
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.960]  punished for their crimes dylan your comments on the i mean we say it all the time but i want
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.920]  people to really consciously realize it give me your angle on how the alternative media is just
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.000]  with you guys leading at the forefront it's just is going supernova every day
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.400]  yeah man we definitely we definitely are the new media and i think both uh both independent media
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.520]  movement has made leaps and bounds since day one and uh i don't think it's going to slow down at
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.600]  any point soon now i'm going to get back into uh the huge developments you guys have broke but uh
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.960]  but i don't want to keep you too much longer but uh we don't hear a lot from you guys because you're
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.880]  so busy getting interviews putting the film together and i've been you know honored and
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.920]  blessed to be in the position to be able to see this as it grows and develops it's just been a
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.240]  wonderful experience and i'm glad you guys are taking your time that's what i've been trying to
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.360]  as an executive producer to tell you guys take your time make the film uh that uh you want to
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.680]  make don't you know don't rush it but at the same time you know get it as quickly done as possible
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.000]  uh i mean what are we talking about late late late fall early winter something like that
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.840]  uh that's what it's looking like and like you said it is a catch-22 because we are so
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.440]  eager to get this movie out there people don't understand how we just want this movie out there
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.400]  and us to move on to the next project in our lives however we're not willing to compromise
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.880]  our quality you know if something needs to be in there and it needs another week well we've got to
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.720]  do it because this movie has to be absolutely as airtight as possible because once again if
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.800]  we can make this the number one movie in america we can make it the number one issue in america
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.680]  and we can really make change in this country and that's what we're all about
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.400]  dylan um berman said it best man i'm sorry i got a cold i don't feel too good
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.360]  i'm sorry to hear that how was uh how was tennessee it was great man it's definitely
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.640]  great yeah it was a good time with a nice little uh nice little breather i actually on another
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.280]  front got to meet tom morello of rage against the machine i handed him a copy of loose change
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.840]  second edition and i hope he watches it you know that's another thing you can do uh you know
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:41.600]  celebrities unfortunately reach more people than tia agents or physicists or you know actual
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.560]  scholars but we have to keep hitting them up as well well i mean that's why this michael
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.360]  moore thing is so important because he's such an icon for the left if he starts saying yeah
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.920]  explosions in the buildings yeah the pentagon is impossible yeah there's a cover-up i mean that
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.520]  right there that is huge and and i think the reason that he's talking about it now is because
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.640]  cindy sheehan has went public on your show and discussed the fact that you know she's lost loose
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.360]  change she thinks it looked like a controlled demolition she has her own questions about the
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.240]  norad stand down and you know she was she was a pretty big supporter of more and they've done
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.200]  some events together and met several times so you know we just keep pushing them over like dominoes
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.160]  alex well that's right their base is literally disintegrating and coming over to the side of
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:33.120]  truth just like mainline conservatives are blowing out their paradigm and just coming
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.920]  becoming freedom fighters constitutionalist freedom lovers truthers when i'm bigger than
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.760]  911 truth we're just into truth we're into what's happening and i tell you this is a david
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.200]  versus koliath story what i've been able to do what you guys have been able to do with everybody
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.600]  in the alternative media 911 truth has been able to do i mean just the story and that's why it
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.880]  really captures people's imagination of three young guys really starting with one just dylan
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.920]  being able to put out a film like loose change one and two now the final cut coming out all of
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.920]  this you know international media firestorm and now bigger and bigger interviews and the people
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.520]  you go and you reach out to high level people you find out know all about it and and and those
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.640]  bridges are there it shows we have made with god's help inroads that are just mind-blowing
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:27.120]  that's absolutely true alex it's just a testament to what one person two people three people you
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.920]  know four people five people can do it's unbelievable you got to realize ain't nobody
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.680]  ever got none who didn't raise their voice and push and that's what we're trying to do we're
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.840]  raising our voice and we're pushing the only way we know how and that's making good movies
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.240]  now how do folks support you in the interim you're not even really out there with any capital i've
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.000]  tried to support you guys and can folks go to the loose change website and buy some of the dvds
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]  well they can always get a 10 pack for 40 so they can hand them out to their friends they
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.520]  can get the hard copy in a case for 20 bucks we of course have the investigate 911 shirts
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.080]  we've got bumper stickers we've got investigate 911 stamps you know really just the gorilla
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.880]  merchandise to get out there and you know well while we were at uh at bonnaroo we were literally
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.680]  taking loose change bumper stickers and info wars bumper stickers and plastering them all over the
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.760]  urinals because you know everybody's got to go to the bathroom you know you got to be you got to
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.440]  use your mind you have to know what people are going to be and you can reach people through
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.040]  symbolism i'm touched you guys were sticking info war stickers up you know what alex somebody sent
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:36.400]  us like a 500 loose change stickers we've been sticking them in the packages we send out so some

[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.640]  the break in about three minutes and i'm going to let you go and get back to your work so i don't
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.800]  have to call dylan and you up today and have another uh you know meeting because i haven't
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.240]  really talked to you guys up on the phone last night this morning since you got back from
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.960]  tennessee and since you got back from new york but i do want to talk to you about one or two issues
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.840]  and specifically a few final questions i've got about what i can put in this article that steve
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:07.600]  watson's doing also about those clips and just to make sure i get that third clip by this evening
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.760]  so i can add it into the story to help promote the show uh the special you guys are going to
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.920]  be doing on this tonight but dylan anything else you want to add not really man i got to get back
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.520]  to work all right were you taking some cold medicine yeah i am well that's good i'll talk
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.600]  to you in just a moment my friend we'll let both of you go uh burnham is going out to break here
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:35.920]  in a minute or two uh again it's just mind-blowing to me to see that you guys got an interview this
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.480]  big and i guarantee you there's going to be more and more of this happening absolutely and it's
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.160]  just like the domino effect i talked about earlier alex as people see more prominent people going
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:51.920]  public and telling their true experience about 9-11 it will domino to people that were actually
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:57.120]  in on the war games which i believe were the operational arm of this attack you know it's
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.880]  only a matter of time till it just snowballs into you can't stop people from going public
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.240]  and i think we've already reached the snowball point i think it's the point of return was
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.960]  crossed when charlie sheen went public everybody saw his courage knew he was putting himself on
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.880]  the line and if they and i'm sure the establishment knows that almost all of hollywood's awake
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.200]  so many military officers i've talked to privately i mean retired two-star three-star generals
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:32.560]  conservatives no uh now i mean i my god this is just when do you think the total breaking point
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.320]  will be honestly i do think it'll be after the administration leaves i think it's irrelevant
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.960]  whether republicans or democrats uh take the presidency uh in 2008 i think once that happened
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.240]  and once kasinich's investigation gets off the ground this september i mean he's claiming he's
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.200]  going to do it let's see what he brings up i'm hoping at the very least he brings up cheney's
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.120]  stand down order we'll see well i agree with michael moore though uh that i mean i hope you're
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.400]  right that you know before this gets too old you know he's got fahrenheit part two coming out which
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.080]  is could be a 9-11 truth movie we're told uh before this gets too old uh that they could or
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.960]  another big terror attack god forbid happens uh which they may do just a smokescreen 9-11 truth
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.880]  but then that could backfire on them too absolutely i don't think that they'll be
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.440]  able to carry out another terror attack in this country i mean there's the possibility of you know
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.560]  south of the border or you maybe even canada uh possibly europe i don't see them attack they've
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.760]  used europe quite a few times people are getting hip to their tricks over there so i i think that
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.960]  we have a small window obviously i'm not going to be too cocky about it we're still pushing to get
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.040]  this movie done as quickly as possible but it's it's limited it's not going to take the 13 years
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.240]  it took for uh the new jfk investigation to take place and it's not going to be where no one's
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.760]  prosecuted people are going to pay for this crime alex i truly believe that well i agree that they're
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.280]  using the 40 50 year old model of propaganda it's not working they're using jfk style propaganda
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.440]  when they killed the president and just like bruce willis said the same people that killed jfk are in
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.360]  power today i mean when bruce willis wakes up who totally served them it's over for him i mean i
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.560]  mean i mean he is a real canary in the coal mine for their biggest supporters waking up absolutely
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.760]  i mean the man is literally in live free or die hard this summer which i'm sure will be a terrorist
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.680]  propaganda picture i can't imagine it being anything else i'm sure it's going to be going
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.440]  after the terrorists and you know the guy's an action hero that has served the establishment for
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.840]  so long and now he's finally speaking up against them absolutely gentlemen i'm going to talk to
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.640]  you during the break and then let you go there goes jason bermas and dylan avery of loose change
