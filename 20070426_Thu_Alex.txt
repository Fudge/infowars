[00:30.000 --> 00:38.960]  Welcome to hard hitting talk radio.
[00:38.960 --> 00:45.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:45.960 --> 00:54.760]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00.000 --> 01:19.360]  We have big 9-11 developments for you today. Also news on the war, the police state, the
[01:19.360 --> 01:28.120]  economy, weather modification, chemtrails. It's all coming up today. It feels like a
[01:28.120 --> 01:35.960]  Tuesday because I just got back yesterday. But today is Thursday, the 26th day. And we're
[01:35.960 --> 01:43.800]  very honored to have you with us in this 26th of April, 2007 edition. We will be live for
[01:43.800 --> 01:51.080]  the next two hours and 59 minutes. Well, I've now been authorized to talk fully about Rosie
[01:51.080 --> 02:00.200]  O'Donnell. I have now been authorized to tell you basically everything I know. And
[02:00.200 --> 02:06.480]  we will do that coming up in the next six or seven minutes. When I get back from break,
[02:06.480 --> 02:09.840]  we will get into that. What really happened behind the scenes, we gave you a lot of it
[02:09.840 --> 02:15.080]  yesterday but even more today. Paul Watson will be writing an article in the next hour
[02:15.080 --> 02:22.360]  on this. This is breaking news. I was just given authorization 10 minutes ago, 10 minutes
[02:22.360 --> 02:29.320]  before showtime. Always frantic right before we go on air. And so that is coming up. Also,
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.000]  we've got new North American Union clips from Lou Dobbs with Pasteur, the guy pushing all
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  this, testifying for Congress. I didn't know about that. It's horrible video. Just admitting
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.560]  the North American Union. And then he comes back on the show and denies it. I mean, you
[02:43.560 --> 02:48.280]  talk about brainwashing. Jon Stewart with a comical piece I want to analyze because
[02:48.280 --> 02:53.440]  it's not funny about Bush and his lying. Keith Hoberman really calls Giuliani out on his
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.560]  terrorism because when they use terror to get their way and get their agenda, they are
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.340]  now terrorists. Keith Hoberman tells it like it is. I will play the Rosie Trump clip back
[03:02.340 --> 03:07.560]  and forth. And again, I don't get into Anna Nicole Smith and Imus and all those diversions.
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.520]  I'm getting into this because this is an attack on free speech. I guess I did cover some Imus
[03:11.520 --> 03:15.960]  because it was, but the point is we're not talking about things like O.J. Simpson or
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.880]  the lacrosse team or all of that. Though it is an interesting phenomenon how women will
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.040]  just make stuff up if you scorn them or are rude to them. They just think it's their right
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.520]  to just lie and say you raped them or say you threatened them. That's why they always
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.400]  get shocked when they end up going to jail over lying. I probably should have talked
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.960]  about the lacrosse situation, but the point is we stay focused on the really big issues
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.640]  of the value of the dollar, the national sovereignty, the Second Amendment, the illegal
[03:43.640 --> 03:49.040]  alien invasion, government sponsored terror, foreign wars, genetic engineering, the things
[03:49.040 --> 03:56.040]  that are really hurting all of us. I don't care what color you are. Or if you put your
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.960]  pants on one leg at a time or if you have a valet doing it. The point here is this show
[04:00.960 --> 04:06.280]  is about serious issues and this is serious and they're lying about Rosie and saying this
[04:06.280 --> 04:11.120]  is a big victory for the censors and the blacklist. When in reality she took an incredible
[04:11.120 --> 04:17.640]  stand, an honorable stand of courage. I disagree with a lot of things she does. I do. And Rosie
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.080]  O'Donnell knows my politics. She knows John Connor's politics. She's talked about it on
[04:21.080 --> 04:29.280]  the show with John Connor. She's praised him. He's an anti-abortion, anti-lesbian conservative.
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.720]  And they have talked about it. Ebersole knows that. O'Donnell knows that. They still like
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.840]  him. Well, I like them too because they at least believe in what they're doing and they're
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.160]  trying to be good people. My God, look at Christ. He hung around with prostitutes and
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.280]  tax collectors. At least we know where they stand. Not these fake Christians, ladies and
[04:48.280 --> 04:52.460]  gentlemen. Most of them are devil worshipers. And I mean that when I say it. I mean a lot
[04:52.460 --> 04:58.400]  of these big time Christians are the most hardcore sadists you can imagine. And I've
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.480]  had enough of it. They make Christians like myself who try to be a Christian look bad.
[05:03.320 --> 05:05.520]  All right, I'm already digressing. I'm already getting into Rosie.
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.440]  Got a They Live clip coming up to intro this next segment. Stay with us for that. Just
[05:14.440 --> 05:20.160]  wait till I give you the news. Just wait. I am locked and loaded, ladies and gentlemen,
[05:20.160 --> 05:25.120]  loaded for bear, as they say. I'm a B-52. Absolutely can barely take off. I've got so
[05:25.120 --> 05:29.520]  many info bombs. I'm going to drop on the New World Order's head. We'll be right back.
[05:29.520 --> 05:40.520]  American for Wars. Dot com. It's here after a year introduction and traveling to distant
[05:40.520 --> 05:45.200]  lands. My new film Terror Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.760]  prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations
[05:49.760 --> 05:55.320]  as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[05:55.320 --> 05:59.760]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm
[05:59.760 --> 06:04.200]  chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate
[06:04.200 --> 06:10.360]  fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much
[06:10.360 --> 06:15.040]  more. Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[06:15.040 --> 06:19.440]  It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to
[06:19.440 --> 06:25.520]  be truly informed must see. Get your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com

[06:35.240 --> 06:40.080]  terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, hand threats,
[06:40.080 --> 06:44.840]  and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic. Alarming words for our time. But how do you
[06:44.840 --> 06:49.320]  protect your family during such a crisis? The video sheltering in place surviving acts
[06:49.320 --> 06:53.880]  of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[06:53.880 --> 06:58.880]  LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable
[06:58.880 --> 07:03.120]  diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the US government. Anyone can follow the
[07:03.120 --> 07:07.800]  simple instructions. It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step by step through the
[07:07.800 --> 07:12.080]  process of preparing your home as a shelter. If you're not the type who waits till it's
[07:12.080 --> 07:16.560]  too late, then you need the video sheltering in place. Get the critical information you

[07:35.960 --> 07:41.240]  Blood with the Genesis Radio Network and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[07:41.240 --> 07:45.520]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the
[07:45.520 --> 07:51.320]  world. If this is true, why can't we pay our bills? Why is the United States the world's
[07:51.320 --> 07:57.400]  largest debtor nation? The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's
[07:57.400 --> 08:02.900]  history. When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family? When the inevitable
[08:02.900 --> 08:15.620]  crash occurs, will you be ready? Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238. That's 1-888-892-6238

[08:22.740 --> 08:40.940]  888-8888-XANADU. Ask for George. Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an
[08:40.940 --> 08:49.540]  artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep. The poor and the underclass
[08:49.540 --> 08:57.140]  are growing. Racial justice and human rights are nonexistent. They have created a repressive
[08:57.140 --> 09:07.340]  society and we are their unwitting accomplices. They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
[09:07.340 --> 09:13.540]  More and more people are becoming poor. Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation
[09:13.540 --> 09:19.740]  of consciousness. We have been lulled into a trance. They have made us indifferent to
[09:19.740 --> 09:27.740]  ourselves, to others. We are focused only on our own gain. Please understand, they are
[09:27.740 --> 09:33.740]  safe as long as they are not discovered. That is their primary method of survival. Keep
[09:33.740 --> 09:41.740]  us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us dedicated. We are their castle. We are being bred for
[09:41.740 --> 09:43.740]  slavery.
[10:11.740 --> 10:18.740]  Go and tell that midnight rider. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter. Tell
[10:18.740 --> 10:29.740]  him that God's gonna cut him down. Tell him that God's gonna cut him down. Well, my goodness,
[10:29.740 --> 10:35.740]  crazies, let me tell you the news. My head's been wet with the midnight dew. I've been
[10:35.740 --> 10:43.740]  down on bended knee, talking to the man from Galilee. He spoke to me in a voice so sweet.
[10:43.740 --> 10:49.740]  I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet. He called my name and my heart stood still
[10:49.740 --> 10:56.740]  when he said, John, go do my will. Go tell that long-tongued liar. Go and tell that midnight
[10:56.740 --> 11:03.740]  rider. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter. Tell him that God's gonna cut him
[11:03.740 --> 11:13.740]  down. Tell him that God's gonna cut him down. You can run on for a long time. Run on for
[11:13.740 --> 11:21.740]  a long time. Run on for a long time. Soon or later God will cut you down. Soon or later
[11:21.740 --> 11:29.740]  God will cut you down. Well, you may throw your rock, hide your hand. Working in the
[11:29.740 --> 11:34.740]  dark against your fellow man. But as sure as God made black and white, what's done in
[11:34.740 --> 11:42.740]  the dark will be brought to the light. You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long
[11:42.740 --> 11:50.740]  time. Run on for a long time. Soon or later God will cut you down. Soon or later God will
[11:50.740 --> 11:58.740]  cut you down. That says it all. Go tell that long-tongued liar. Go and tell that midnight
[11:58.740 --> 12:05.740]  rider. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter. Tell him that God's gonna cut you
[12:05.740 --> 12:13.740]  down. Tell him that God's gonna cut you down. Tell him that God's gonna cut you down.
[12:13.740 --> 12:21.740]  Absolutely, it does say it all. Johnny Cash from The Grave live on the radio. You know,
[12:21.740 --> 12:27.740]  I am really debating some other things I've learned. It just gets more bizarre by the
[12:27.740 --> 12:36.740]  minute. When I was out in Hollywood, just Monday and Tuesday, learned even more about
[12:36.740 --> 12:44.740]  who's awake to 9-11. It totally blew me away. But, you know what, I wasn't told not to talk
[12:44.740 --> 12:47.740]  about it, but I think it goes without saying that I don't talk about things, so I guess
[12:47.740 --> 12:51.740]  it meant that I wasn't meant to talk about it. So I won't get into that. Having to keep
[12:51.740 --> 12:55.740]  secrets is not fun from an audience, especially when you learn about the prominent people
[12:55.740 --> 13:04.740]  that know about 9-11. Let's just say there's a popular police state TV show that we badmouth
[13:04.740 --> 13:13.740]  a lot, and I'm gonna leave it there. I'm not gonna say anything else. It just never ends,
[13:13.740 --> 13:19.740]  ladies and gentlemen. And I don't know how people can rationalize being involved with
[13:19.740 --> 13:23.740]  something like that and then go, oh, well, I know all about it. But that's probably why
[13:23.740 --> 13:27.740]  you saw a shift in the show about a year ago, where the government's planning nukes
[13:27.740 --> 13:33.740]  and things like that. I guess they, well, you know what, I'm gonna shut my mouth. I'm
[13:33.740 --> 13:43.740]  gonna stop right there. I'm gonna stop right there. I told you that everybody in Hollywood
[13:43.740 --> 13:48.740]  knows about this. Literally everyone I ever talked to, and then I asked them, well, who
[13:48.740 --> 13:53.740]  else knows? And they go A, B, C, D, E, F, G, down to Z. And they need to go public.
[13:53.740 --> 13:59.740]  They need to speak out. I didn't intend for Rick Linkletter to be on this show six months
[13:59.740 --> 14:03.740]  ago and just out of the blue start talking about 9-11 being an inside job. I mean, Rick's
[14:03.740 --> 14:07.740]  known for a couple years. He's seen Martial Law. He's seen Terror Storm. He liked him.
[14:07.740 --> 14:11.740]  He got hundreds of them from me and given them out to people. And he just starts talking
[14:11.740 --> 14:15.740]  about how it's an inside job, and his friends all know. And by the way, he gave one to Bruce
[14:15.740 --> 14:20.740]  Willis when he was here doing Fast Food Nation with him. And Bruce Willis, you know, sent
[14:20.740 --> 14:25.740]  him an email saying, yeah, now I've woken up to the truth. And don't expect Bruce Willis
[14:25.740 --> 14:31.740]  to ever go public. He got a bunch of heat. And then through the author of some book that
[14:31.740 --> 14:36.740]  supposedly went into a Bruce Willis Army movie, he said, I talked to Bruce, and Bruce says
[14:36.740 --> 14:41.740]  no comment. And that's not what he meant. Admitting that he did say it, but backing
[14:41.740 --> 14:48.740]  off, kind of like, you will deny me three times. Who was it that denied Christ three
[14:48.740 --> 14:52.740]  times? And before the cock crows, you'll deny me three times. And then when he thought he
[14:52.740 --> 14:58.740]  was going to get killed, he did. No, it wasn't Judas. He's with the 30 pieces of silver.
[14:58.740 --> 15:02.740]  Believe me, if I wasn't on air, I'd know the name. It's ridiculously easy. Then I get a
[15:02.740 --> 15:05.740]  bunch of people going, you don't remember that? Yeah, sometimes I can't remember what
[15:05.740 --> 15:09.740]  year my son was born. You know what I mean? Sometimes your memory doesn't work. Sometimes
[15:09.740 --> 15:15.740]  it works on everything. It's weird. I'd like a semi-photographic memory. Sometimes I remember
[15:15.740 --> 15:19.740]  everything, or on certain things. I remember something from 10 years ago perfectly, and
[15:19.740 --> 15:23.740]  then other times my brain wasn't in the proper mode when I'm trying to remember it. I don't
[15:23.740 --> 15:29.740]  remember, because it's not photographic. But I'm already digressing here. The point is
[15:29.740 --> 15:36.740]  they'll deny 9-11 truth when they get out in the public. And I had no intention of getting
[15:36.740 --> 15:40.740]  Linkletter to go public on 9-11 on the show. I had no intention of him to spill the beans
[15:40.740 --> 15:54.740]  on Bruce Willis. He told me that a few months before. But it's just amazing. It's amazing.
[15:54.740 --> 15:57.740]  But that's the kind of stuff, too, that we report here on this show, and it just kind
[15:57.740 --> 16:02.740]  of gets glazed over. And every week or so, we have some engineer, or some fighter pilot,
[16:02.740 --> 16:07.740]  or commercial pilot, or both, or another physicist, or another first responder, or
[16:07.740 --> 16:16.740]  another widow on. But when they come on, the media predominantly ignores it. It hardly
[16:16.740 --> 16:24.740]  gets attention when one of Bush's chief economists goes public on this show over a year ago.
[16:24.740 --> 16:33.740]  It gets attention when a Rosie O'Donnell goes public. It gets attention when a Charlie
[16:33.740 --> 16:41.740]  Sheen goes public. It gets attention, a lot of attention, when prominent people speak
[16:41.740 --> 16:49.740]  out. And that's why it's important. And it's also, they have to be commended because they
[16:49.740 --> 16:56.740]  have amazing courage. They're not stupid. They're not stupid. They're not stupid. They
[16:56.740 --> 17:00.740]  know they're going to be put through a wringer, and they're going to get death threats. And
[17:00.740 --> 17:04.740]  these are already very private people who don't particularly want to be controversial,
[17:04.740 --> 17:08.740]  but they have a conscience, and they want to speak out. They're just like everybody
[17:08.740 --> 17:14.740]  else who's speaking out. It's just they're prominent. They're stars. They're media
[17:14.740 --> 17:22.740]  phenomenons. And so they're doing it literally because they care. And they're putting their
[17:22.740 --> 17:31.740]  heads in the tiger's jaws for us. So I'll tell you about Rosie O'Donnell and the new
[17:31.740 --> 17:40.740]  developments right now. Now, I got a lot of this from Christina Ebersole, but it wasn't
[17:40.740 --> 17:44.740]  even said, hey, don't tell anybody. It was just, you know, this is kind of off the record,
[17:44.740 --> 17:47.740]  but I guess you could say some of it just, you know, basically don't say where you got
[17:47.740 --> 17:50.740]  it. And Christine goes on vacation with her. We were just on vacation with her and other
[17:50.740 --> 17:55.740]  friends in Miami a few weeks ago. Christina, obviously, I mean, we could see what was going
[17:55.740 --> 18:00.740]  on. Three or four months ago, they've got Broland on, James Broland, hundreds of movies,
[18:00.740 --> 18:05.740]  dozens of TV shows. He's on there, and he goes, hey, I went and visited this 9-11 Truth
[18:05.740 --> 18:12.740]  Site. What is it, 911weno.com? I think that's it. And he just said, that's all I want to
[18:12.740 --> 18:16.740]  say. Just check it out. And there's this knowing look from Barbara Walters, knowing look, smile
[18:16.740 --> 18:22.740]  from Rosie. Rosie uses the excuse of going, yeah, that John Connor, he gets up there.
[18:22.740 --> 18:28.740]  He's a nonconformist. He goes, 9-11's an inside job. 9-11's an inside job. That's her way.
[18:28.740 --> 18:32.740]  She was testing the waters. Then she starts blogging, putting it on her blog. And we get
[18:32.740 --> 18:37.740]  a report from People Magazine. Barbara Walters says, stop blogging. She doesn't want Rosie
[18:37.740 --> 18:41.740]  speaking outside of what, that's an admission of the censorship. You don't have to believe
[18:41.740 --> 18:46.740]  me or believe Rosie or believe Ebersol. So let me just get into this and give you all the
[18:46.740 --> 18:53.740]  basics. I don't even know where to start. I learned from Ebersol. I learned from Rodriguez.
[18:53.740 --> 18:58.740]  And now I can tell you the prominent 9-11 Truth. There's photos of him in her apartment in
[18:58.740 --> 19:06.740]  New York. Photos with Rodriguez in her. Her with Rodriguez's key. He had the key, went
[19:06.740 --> 19:11.740]  up the stairwells to let the firemen, he directed them, because they're not continuous stairwells.
[19:11.740 --> 19:19.740]  They're staggered. One of the big heroes of 9-11. And he was talking to her for months,
[19:19.740 --> 19:25.740]  me having meetings with her repeatedly. So I was being told the same things. And then
[19:25.740 --> 19:31.740]  some emails from Rosie. I was able to read some emails with her comments about 9-11 that
[19:31.740 --> 19:35.740]  Rodriguez and others quietly shared with me. And I don't think I will even release exactly
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.740]  the details of those here on air. Some of it's pretty, I mean, some of the stuff would
[19:40.740 --> 19:46.740]  be top headlines, I assure you, if anybody saw these emails. I'm pretty, classic Rosie
[19:46.740 --> 19:57.740]  type statements. I'll just say about Tom DeLay and people like that. But, you know,
[19:57.740 --> 20:01.740]  now we can talk about it. And why can we talk about it? She tried to talk about William
[20:01.740 --> 20:07.740]  Rodriguez today on the live show. It's Thursday. And we'll tell you what happened when she
[20:07.740 --> 20:15.740]  tried to talk today. And that's why we can now talk about the Rodriguez situation. And
[20:15.740 --> 20:19.740]  he's been authorized to speak at him. I talked to Rodriguez. He said, no, you just talk about
[20:19.740 --> 20:23.740]  it. I'm not going to come on. He'll probably come on later this week, maybe Friday, maybe
[20:23.740 --> 20:28.740]  tomorrow. Probably get Vito Valente on as well. One of the first responders will be
[20:28.740 --> 20:31.740]  on the show tomorrow. On The View tomorrow.

[20:40.740 --> 20:44.740]  while traveling. During outdoor sporting activities and in hospital filtration environments,
[20:44.740 --> 20:50.740]  such as local or national emergencies, the revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic
[20:50.740 --> 20:55.740]  bacteria, cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.

[21:00.740 --> 21:04.740]  nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and

[21:39.740 --> 21:44.740]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last
[21:44.740 --> 21:49.740]  year. This is a glaring testimonial of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued.
[21:49.740 --> 21:54.740]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential
[21:54.740 --> 21:59.740]  profits. Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of
[21:59.740 --> 22:05.740]  wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into. Midas Resources

[24:33.740 --> 24:47.740]  Riders on the storm Riders on the storm
[24:47.740 --> 24:56.740]  Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown
[24:56.740 --> 25:01.740]  Like a dog without a bone And pack her out on road
[25:01.740 --> 25:10.740]  Riders on the storm There's a killer on the road
[25:10.740 --> 25:20.740]  His brain is swerving like a toad Take a long holiday
[25:20.740 --> 25:27.740]  Let your children play If you give this man a ride
[25:27.740 --> 25:32.740]  Sweet mammal he will die Killer on the road
[25:32.740 --> 25:43.740]  Well said, if you give this man a ride Well, my sweet, we're gonna die
[25:43.740 --> 25:49.740]  His brain is squirming like a toad That's the killer on the road
[25:49.740 --> 25:52.740]  Take a long holiday, ladies and gentlemen Get back to basics
[25:52.740 --> 25:55.740]  Let your children play Love each other
[25:55.740 --> 25:59.740]  Stop being such greedy, back-stabbing, back-biters
[25:59.740 --> 26:04.740]  So many times what you see in others is really a reflection of yourself
[26:04.740 --> 26:08.740]  So we should all look inwardly
[26:08.740 --> 26:13.740]  Alright, here we go
[26:13.740 --> 26:16.740]  Alright, Rosie O'Donnell, let me just boil it down in a nutshell
[26:16.740 --> 26:22.740]  The way the media is lying, Fox News, John Gibson, all of them are saying she's fired
[26:22.740 --> 26:28.740]  Donald Trump, who is a complete joke, the guy is a total performer
[26:28.740 --> 26:33.740]  Everybody knows that he has been leveraged forever
[26:33.740 --> 26:41.740]  And is connected to some very seedy groups that are involved with casinos and gambling and things like that in the hotels
[26:41.740 --> 26:45.740]  I mean, I don't think you need to put two and two together to figure this out
[26:45.740 --> 26:48.740]  But fine, it's America, Donald Trump, whatever
[26:48.740 --> 26:55.740]  He's out saying she got fired and then calling her a fat pig and doing his normal thing
[26:55.740 --> 26:57.740]  And they're all celebrating and lying
[26:57.740 --> 27:00.740]  And she's classy in this respect
[27:00.740 --> 27:04.740]  She's not even countering, going, hey, I quit
[27:04.740 --> 27:08.740]  Though if you actually read what ABC said, you actually look at what happened, that's what she did
[27:08.740 --> 27:12.740]  They wanted her for three years, they wanted to roughly double her money a year
[27:12.740 --> 27:17.740]  She's already being offered other TV shows because she's what really gave that show a kick in the pants
[27:17.740 --> 27:20.740]  And Rosie is left
[27:20.740 --> 27:26.740]  Now I was told three weeks ago, almost three weeks ago, that she was going to probably leave The View
[27:26.740 --> 27:29.740]  In fact, I was told, don't tell anybody, she's leaving The View
[27:29.740 --> 27:32.740]  I was told, probably going to leave The View by one person
[27:32.740 --> 27:35.740]  And then I was told, gonna leave The View by another
[27:35.740 --> 27:39.740]  I'm not going to say names, but you notice we reported to you a couple weeks ago
[27:39.740 --> 27:44.740]  She was going to have first responders on, boom, she did the taping yesterday, and it's tomorrow
[27:44.740 --> 27:48.740]  I mean, some people even send us emails questioning what we're saying here
[27:48.740 --> 27:55.740]  Well, we're going to give you photos of her with William Rodriguez's key when she met with William Rodriguez months ago
[27:55.740 --> 28:00.740]  I don't want to get Willie on the phone and get the exact date of that, I think it was about five weeks ago
[28:00.740 --> 28:02.740]  I don't know, time flies
[28:02.740 --> 28:08.740]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're in contact with Ebersole, we're in contact with Rosie
[28:08.740 --> 28:13.740]  We're in contact with William Rodriguez, who's met with her multiple times and talked to her many times over the telephone
[28:13.740 --> 28:16.740]  And she tried, now I can talk about it
[28:16.740 --> 28:22.740]  She tried to get William Rodriguez on as a guest, she's been told by the neocon she's not allowed to do that
[28:22.740 --> 28:28.740]  Because they checked into William Rodriguez, the producer of the show, who she's openly criticized
[28:29.740 --> 28:34.740]  It turns out that she's not allowed to have William on because they found out he's a 9-11 truther
[28:34.740 --> 28:39.740]  I don't know how she wrangled it, to be able to get first responders on
[28:39.740 --> 28:43.740]  But these aren't first responders who come out and say it's an inside job, they say they have suspicions
[28:43.740 --> 28:46.740]  Let's just say they were quiet about their views
[28:46.740 --> 28:51.740]  They're more than on the fence, they're coming over to our side
[28:52.740 --> 28:59.740]  And William, by the way, was instrumental in giving the contacts for Valente and the other lady that's going on
[28:59.740 --> 29:04.740]  It's a man and woman, to Rosie, so he was behind the scenes setting that up as well
[29:06.740 --> 29:11.740]  Now the censorship started immediately within the first two weeks she was on the show
[29:11.740 --> 29:16.740]  And I was told this by William, I was told this by Ebersole, and got this in email
[29:16.740 --> 29:18.740]  I'm going to leave it at that
[29:18.740 --> 29:23.740]  That in the first two weeks she tried to mention the number of U.S. dead
[29:23.740 --> 29:27.740]  And she was told, you will not talk about dead U.S. soldiers on this show
[29:27.740 --> 29:29.740]  Now man, that is censorship
[29:29.740 --> 29:33.740]  They don't want you to see the coffins, they don't want the photographs
[29:33.740 --> 29:38.740]  The parents have to get the coffins separately, the flag draped sarcophagi
[29:38.740 --> 29:40.740]  And bring the media out
[29:40.740 --> 29:46.740]  They don't like you to see that, them coming into Maine
[29:48.740 --> 29:51.740]  They don't like you seeing that
[29:51.740 --> 29:53.740]  They're very upset about it
[29:53.740 --> 29:57.740]  And so they were censoring her out of the gates
[29:57.740 --> 30:02.740]  And letting the nitwit, the fake conservative, Hasselbeck
[30:02.740 --> 30:06.740]  Say whatever she wanted and call the Iraqis animals, that really made Rosie mad
[30:06.740 --> 30:09.740]  She wanted to leave within just a few weeks of being there
[30:09.740 --> 30:13.740]  And it's been a constant censorship, she could only get stuff out on the live show
[30:13.740 --> 30:17.740]  We'll tell you about all the censorship, we'll tell you how she met with William Rodriguez
[30:17.740 --> 30:19.740]  We'll tell you the rest of it when we get back, then get into all the other news
[30:19.740 --> 30:21.740]  Stay with me
[30:24.740 --> 30:27.740]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run

[31:35.740 --> 31:39.740]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s
[31:39.740 --> 31:44.740]  To conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[31:44.740 --> 31:50.740]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars
[31:50.740 --> 31:57.740]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[31:57.740 --> 32:02.740]  The Illuminati who are worshippers of Lucifer are now preparing for the final conflict
[32:02.740 --> 32:06.740]  The third world war to produce their one world government
[32:06.740 --> 32:09.740]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about
[32:09.740 --> 32:14.740]  By offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine

[32:33.740 --> 32:37.740]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update
[32:37.740 --> 32:42.740]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs
[32:42.740 --> 32:45.740]  It's called Protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth
[32:45.740 --> 32:50.740]  That it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions
[32:50.740 --> 32:53.740]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance
[32:54.740 --> 32:59.740]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set
[32:59.740 --> 33:01.740]  Creating maximum plant growth in minimum time
[33:01.740 --> 33:07.740]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[33:07.740 --> 33:13.740]  Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value
[33:13.740 --> 33:16.740]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can
[33:16.740 --> 33:20.740]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy
[33:20.740 --> 33:25.740]  GCN listeners who want to grow derp sheep superfood should visit the Protogrow website at growlikecrazy.com
[33:25.740 --> 33:30.740]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365
[33:30.740 --> 33:33.740]  That's 877-327-0365
[33:37.740 --> 33:40.740]  Don't worry, this show is documented
[33:40.740 --> 33:43.740]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[33:43.740 --> 33:47.740]  I fell into a burning ring of fire
[33:47.740 --> 33:51.740]  I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
[33:51.740 --> 33:54.740]  And it burns, burns, burns
[33:54.740 --> 33:59.740]  the ring of fire, the ring of fire
[33:59.740 --> 34:02.740]  And it burns, burns, burns
[34:02.740 --> 34:09.740]  the ring of fire, the ring of fire, the ring of fire
[34:10.740 --> 34:16.740]  Alright, welcome back to the ring of fire ladies and gentlemen as we fight the New World Disorder
[34:16.740 --> 34:19.740]  I'm going to take your calls in the second and third hour
[34:19.740 --> 34:22.740]  Wide open phones today
[34:22.740 --> 34:25.740]  We could have unlimited guests here on this show
[34:25.740 --> 34:27.740]  but we only choose to have guests that really matter
[34:27.740 --> 34:29.740]  or that are extremely important
[34:29.740 --> 34:32.740]  I am going to have a guest on in the next few days about the move
[34:32.740 --> 34:35.740]  to go ahead and try to pass Codex Alimentarius
[34:35.740 --> 34:40.740]  Again, to start restricting vitamins and minerals and different supplements
[34:40.740 --> 34:44.740]  All part of international regulatory agreements that have already been signed
[34:44.740 --> 34:49.740]  That's why they fight tooth and nail like a mad dragon
[34:49.740 --> 34:53.740]  to get this through
[34:53.740 --> 34:57.740]  Also, I'm going to get Pastor Ted Pycon
[34:57.740 --> 35:03.740]  My producer is out because again her family, remember her uncle has been on death's doorstep
[35:03.740 --> 35:06.740]  She is in and out to die any moment
[35:06.740 --> 35:10.740]  But again, we actually had guests today and canceled them
[35:10.740 --> 35:16.740]  Because I really feel myself going into a phase of not having as many guests on
[35:16.740 --> 35:18.740]  And I do this from time to time
[35:18.740 --> 35:22.740]  Only really important news and information and not petty distractions
[35:22.740 --> 35:28.740]  or cronyism here on this show
[35:29.740 --> 35:32.740]  Okay
[35:32.740 --> 35:38.740]  Getting back to Rosie O'Donnell
[35:38.740 --> 35:40.740]  The reason we're talking about this is
[35:40.740 --> 35:44.740]  A. She has a lot of courage and she supercharged yet again
[35:44.740 --> 35:46.740]  the exploding 9-11 truth movement
[35:46.740 --> 35:51.740]  that is the foundation, the key to bringing down the new world order
[35:51.740 --> 35:56.740]  Because if we can convince the general public that most terrorism is an inside job
[35:56.740 --> 35:59.740]  That giving up liberty will not give them security, it will give them tyranny
[35:59.740 --> 36:03.740]  Then the 9-11 attacks, the war is built on them
[36:03.740 --> 36:07.740]  The domestic police state, the surveillance state
[36:07.740 --> 36:09.740]  It's all built on that
[36:09.740 --> 36:12.740]  I mean, Alberto Gonzalez gets in trouble for crimes
[36:12.740 --> 36:16.740]  Hey, 9-11, if you go after me, the terrorist will get you
[36:16.740 --> 36:19.740]  If you don't re-elect us, the terrorist will nuke Chicago
[36:19.740 --> 36:22.740]  If you don't elect me, Al-Qaeda will hit you
[36:22.740 --> 36:24.740]  I mean, they're the terrorists
[36:24.740 --> 36:26.740]  They're saying, do what we say or bad things are going to happen
[36:26.740 --> 36:28.740]  They're the terrorists, bottom line
[36:28.740 --> 36:29.740]  They even act like it
[36:29.740 --> 36:31.740]  It's not even just the evidence that they did it
[36:31.740 --> 36:32.740]  They also act like it
[36:32.740 --> 36:35.740]  They have the motive and they act just like someone who had the motive
[36:35.740 --> 36:36.740]  who was behind it would
[36:36.740 --> 36:39.740]  Do what I say or bad stuff is going to happen
[36:39.740 --> 36:41.740]  So we've got to destroy the 9-11 myth
[36:41.740 --> 36:44.740]  She's got a lot of courage, she's a tough broad
[36:44.740 --> 36:46.740]  I was talking to Charlie Sheen and he said
[36:46.740 --> 36:49.740]  Yeah, she's a tough broad and I appreciate what she's doing
[36:49.740 --> 36:52.740]  That's a quote
[36:52.740 --> 36:54.740]  Let me get the exact quote
[36:54.740 --> 36:56.740]  Yeah, I like her
[36:56.740 --> 36:57.740]  She's got a lot of courage
[36:57.740 --> 37:00.740]  She's a tough broad
[37:09.740 --> 37:11.740]  Going back to
[37:11.740 --> 37:12.740]  Again, there's so much
[37:12.740 --> 37:15.740]  I should really write notes up on something like this before I go on air with it
[37:15.740 --> 37:17.740]  Because for months I've been keeping my mouth shut
[37:17.740 --> 37:19.740]  And when I get up here about all this
[37:19.740 --> 37:20.740]  I mean, I've covered some of it
[37:20.740 --> 37:22.740]  But just to recap, it's important though
[37:22.740 --> 37:24.740]  Because they're trying to set a precedent
[37:24.740 --> 37:25.740]  To have a chilling effect
[37:25.740 --> 37:27.740]  And oh look, they're saying
[37:27.740 --> 37:29.740]  Look, Don Imus got fired
[37:29.740 --> 37:30.740]  Oh, Rosie got fired
[37:30.740 --> 37:32.740]  Oh my gosh
[37:32.740 --> 37:34.740]  And it's kind of like a new purge
[37:34.740 --> 37:35.740]  To create fear
[37:35.740 --> 37:37.740]  I'm already seeing fear in other radio talk shows
[37:37.740 --> 37:38.740]  I know
[37:38.740 --> 37:39.740]  Not just on this network
[37:39.740 --> 37:41.740]  That people have told me about their fears
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.740]  That are totally unfounded
[37:43.740 --> 37:44.740]  There's no censorship or control here
[37:44.740 --> 37:45.740]  I know that
[37:45.740 --> 37:47.740]  Never experienced it not once
[37:47.740 --> 37:49.740]  But people in other talk radio stations
[37:49.740 --> 37:51.740]  And networks that I just talk with
[37:51.740 --> 37:53.740]  And I hear talk shows talking about it on air
[37:53.740 --> 37:54.740]  How they're scared now
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.740]  And watching what they say
[37:56.740 --> 37:58.740]  And thinking about what they're about to say
[37:58.740 --> 38:00.740]  That kills the spontaneity
[38:00.740 --> 38:02.740]  That kills the truth
[38:02.740 --> 38:03.740]  And speaking from the heart
[38:03.740 --> 38:04.740]  And speaking from the gut
[38:04.740 --> 38:06.740]  And wearing the facts on your sleeve
[38:06.740 --> 38:08.740]  I don't calculate here
[38:08.740 --> 38:09.740]  This is the real deal
[38:09.740 --> 38:10.740]  So people listen
[38:10.740 --> 38:11.740]  You can instinctively pick up on it
[38:11.740 --> 38:13.740]  It's the body language
[38:13.740 --> 38:15.740]  It's the way someone says something
[38:15.740 --> 38:18.740]  Is more important than even what they're saying
[38:19.740 --> 38:21.740]  I don't have to pre-script or think about what I'm going to say
[38:21.740 --> 38:23.740]  It just flows
[38:23.740 --> 38:25.740]  Because
[38:25.740 --> 38:27.740]  I'm just speaking my mind
[38:27.740 --> 38:29.740]  Well see they want to stop you from doing that
[38:29.740 --> 38:31.740]  They want to stop people from
[38:31.740 --> 38:32.740]  Don't talk about politics
[38:32.740 --> 38:33.740]  Don't talk about religion
[38:33.740 --> 38:35.740]  Don't bring up stuff with your neighbors
[38:35.740 --> 38:37.740]  Just talk about your favorite wrist washer
[38:37.740 --> 38:38.740]  Your favorite football team
[38:38.740 --> 38:40.740]  Your favorite basketball team
[38:40.740 --> 38:42.740]  And just everybody keep your heads down
[38:42.740 --> 38:43.740]  And shut up
[38:43.740 --> 38:45.740]  That's not what America's all about
[38:46.740 --> 38:49.740]  It's fundamentally American what Don Imus did
[38:49.740 --> 38:51.740]  I don't like Don Imus
[38:51.740 --> 38:53.740]  I've always found him just to radiate
[38:53.740 --> 38:55.740]  Unpleasantness
[38:55.740 --> 38:57.740]  And just dirtiness
[38:57.740 --> 38:59.740]  Disgustingness
[38:59.740 --> 39:00.740]  I've never liked Don Imus
[39:00.740 --> 39:01.740]  I'd see him on TV and go
[39:01.740 --> 39:02.740]  Just something about him
[39:02.740 --> 39:04.740]  He was repulsive to me
[39:04.740 --> 39:06.740]  I don't like what he said about those black women
[39:06.740 --> 39:09.740]  But I know he just meant it trying to be gangster himself
[39:09.740 --> 39:11.740]  Trying to be hip
[39:12.740 --> 39:14.740]  But it was fundamentally American to shoot your mouth off
[39:14.740 --> 39:16.740]  And just talk off the cuff
[39:17.740 --> 39:21.740]  And I do agree with what Rosie O'Donnell has been saying
[39:24.740 --> 39:27.740]  And what she has said is fundamentally American
[39:27.740 --> 39:29.740]  Not because I agree with it though
[39:29.740 --> 39:31.740]  But because she's saying what she thinks
[39:31.740 --> 39:33.740]  She's speaking her mind
[39:34.740 --> 39:35.740]  It's fundamentally
[39:35.740 --> 39:36.740]  I don't want to just monopolize it
[39:36.740 --> 39:38.740]  Just Americans have had this history
[39:38.740 --> 39:41.740]  Or that Americans are the only ones that stand up and speak out
[39:41.740 --> 39:43.740]  You know there's a lot of that across world history
[39:43.740 --> 39:45.740]  But it's certainly more of it here than any other place
[39:45.740 --> 39:48.740]  You know I guess the second place you might see it
[39:48.740 --> 39:52.740]  Is the Roman Republic
[39:52.740 --> 39:54.740]  To a certain limited degree with gentry land owners
[39:54.740 --> 39:57.740]  But that was still a limited voting system
[39:57.740 --> 39:59.740]  And then of course England
[39:59.740 --> 40:01.740]  Which really is the engine of the ideas
[40:01.740 --> 40:03.740]  That really culminated for what we have here
[40:03.740 --> 40:07.740]  Almost 48%
[40:07.740 --> 40:10.740]  47% of the parliament
[40:10.740 --> 40:11.740]  I could pull that vote up again
[40:11.740 --> 40:13.740]  But I was reading about that a few months ago again
[40:13.740 --> 40:16.740]  In a book I was reading about Captain Kidd
[40:16.740 --> 40:18.740]  Who wasn't really a pirate by the way
[40:18.740 --> 40:20.740]  Award winning book I was reading
[40:20.740 --> 40:22.740]  But it was just about the
[40:24.740 --> 40:26.740]  No it was another book I was
[40:26.740 --> 40:27.740]  That's not right
[40:27.740 --> 40:30.740]  Captain Kidd got hung in 1706 or something
[40:30.740 --> 40:33.740]  No that was another book I was reading about George Washington
[40:33.740 --> 40:34.740]  A year ago
[40:34.740 --> 40:37.740]  And I was reading the votes in parliament
[40:37.740 --> 40:40.740]  For the freedom and secession
[40:40.740 --> 40:44.740]  And what happened here in the United States
[40:44.740 --> 40:47.740]  Okay see I'm digressing ladies and gentlemen
[40:47.740 --> 40:48.740]  I apologize
[40:48.740 --> 40:50.740]  I know Paul Watson and Steve Watson are listening
[40:50.740 --> 40:52.740]  They're wanting all the meat and potatoes
[40:52.740 --> 40:54.740]  About Rosie to write an article
[40:59.740 --> 41:01.740]  So that's why this is important
[41:01.740 --> 41:03.740]  Because it's fundamentally American
[41:03.740 --> 41:06.740]  And you've got these cretins
[41:06.740 --> 41:07.740]  These actual
[41:07.740 --> 41:08.740]  And I'm here to tell you
[41:08.740 --> 41:09.740]  And we have the proof
[41:09.740 --> 41:11.740]  I went and actually pulled old news articles about this
[41:11.740 --> 41:13.740]  So I wouldn't just say this
[41:13.740 --> 41:14.740]  I would actually have them in front of me
[41:14.740 --> 41:15.740]  This morning
[41:15.740 --> 41:19.740]  That Fox News is run by Vietnam
[41:19.740 --> 41:21.740]  Of the Justice Department
[41:21.740 --> 41:24.740]  That they do get government product placement
[41:24.740 --> 41:25.740]  At higher levels
[41:25.740 --> 41:26.740]  And I call that propaganda placement
[41:26.740 --> 41:28.740]  It's the government paying for
[41:28.740 --> 41:31.740]  Commercials and ideas and buying reporters
[41:31.740 --> 41:33.740]  Roger Ailes who created Rush Limbaugh
[41:33.740 --> 41:35.740]  Is admittedly advising Hillary
[41:35.740 --> 41:37.740]  And has monthly meetings
[41:37.740 --> 41:40.740]  Murdoch has been having for at least four years
[41:40.740 --> 41:43.740]  Weekly multiple hour long dinners with Hillary
[41:43.740 --> 41:46.740]  That's why Limbaugh is saying she's gonna win
[41:46.740 --> 41:48.740]  She might even be better than other Democrats
[41:48.740 --> 41:50.740]  He's been saying at least she's for the war
[41:50.740 --> 41:53.740]  That's why Fox News gives her more attention
[41:53.740 --> 41:56.740]  Fox News is positioning Hillary Clinton
[41:56.740 --> 41:58.740]  And they're gonna suddenly be liberal
[41:58.740 --> 41:59.740]  Just watch
[41:59.740 --> 42:01.740]  They'll still be warmongering
[42:01.740 --> 42:02.740]  But just liberal in name
[42:02.740 --> 42:04.740]  And most Democrats will suddenly be for it
[42:04.740 --> 42:06.740]  Just like when Clinton used DU
[42:06.740 --> 42:08.740]  And bombed Belgrade into the Stone Age
[42:08.740 --> 42:10.740]  And bombed four other major cities
[42:10.740 --> 42:13.740]  And strafed huge crowds of refugees
[42:13.740 --> 42:14.740]  In Serbia
[42:14.740 --> 42:16.740]  Outside Pristina
[42:16.740 --> 42:19.740]  Total butchery, total mass murder
[42:19.740 --> 42:21.740]  And uh
[42:24.740 --> 42:25.740]  It doesn't matter to the Democrats
[42:25.740 --> 42:27.740]  I mean we're gonna be in a reign of terror
[42:27.740 --> 42:28.740]  Of gun control
[42:28.740 --> 42:30.740]  Of anti-terror police
[42:30.740 --> 42:31.740]  And suddenly
[42:31.740 --> 42:33.740]  The Democrats are going to love it
[42:33.740 --> 42:34.740]  We are in for
[42:34.740 --> 42:36.740]  And it wouldn't matter if it was Republicans either
[42:36.740 --> 42:37.740]  It'd be the same
[42:37.740 --> 42:38.740]  You understand?
[42:38.740 --> 42:40.740]  It's two legs on the same creature
[42:40.740 --> 42:41.740]  I know you know this
[42:41.740 --> 42:42.740]  But explain it to your dumb uncle
[42:42.740 --> 42:43.740]  Or your dumb neighbor
[42:43.740 --> 42:45.740]  Or the dumb cop that lives down the street
[42:45.740 --> 42:47.740]  Who's got his car festooned
[42:47.740 --> 42:48.740]  With support the troops
[42:48.740 --> 42:49.740]  Keep them in Iraq
[42:49.740 --> 42:50.740]  Nobody
[42:50.740 --> 42:51.740]  The troops want to come home
[42:51.740 --> 42:52.740]  Support them
[42:52.740 --> 42:53.740]  Bring them back
[42:53.740 --> 42:54.740]  You idiot
[42:54.740 --> 42:57.740]  Foreign corporations have seized the United States
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.740]  For at least 50 years
[42:58.740 --> 42:59.740]  And now they're
[42:59.740 --> 43:01.740]  Waging war on the remnants of the middle class
[43:01.740 --> 43:03.740]  Do you understand that pea brain?
[43:03.740 --> 43:05.740]  Do you understand where the best friends you've got
[43:05.740 --> 43:07.740]  All you bureaucrats and government servants
[43:07.740 --> 43:09.740]  And all you toadies
[43:09.740 --> 43:11.740]  That are on these different neo-con websites
[43:11.740 --> 43:12.740]  You make me sick
[43:12.740 --> 43:14.740]  You're little children
[43:16.740 --> 43:18.740]  I mean you're absolutely
[43:20.740 --> 43:22.740]  You're absolutely off the charts
[43:25.740 --> 43:27.740]  And I don't know what to say to you anymore
[43:27.740 --> 43:28.740]  Alright let me get back
[43:28.740 --> 43:29.740]  That's why I'm taking calls this hour
[43:29.740 --> 43:31.740]  Because I'm just taking my time discussing this
[43:32.740 --> 43:33.740]  They're lying
[43:33.740 --> 43:34.740]  Here is Fox News
[43:34.740 --> 43:36.740]  YABC asked Rosie O'Donnell
[43:37.740 --> 43:39.740]  And they go on to say she was fired
[43:39.740 --> 43:40.740]  It's a total lie
[43:40.740 --> 43:41.740]  They don't care
[43:41.740 --> 43:43.740]  This is the Pentagon
[43:43.740 --> 43:44.740]  They want to set the pre-
[43:44.740 --> 43:45.740]  When you see Fox News folks
[43:45.740 --> 43:47.740]  That is actually the Pentagon
[43:47.740 --> 43:48.740]  Okay
[43:48.740 --> 43:49.740]  Not not
[43:49.740 --> 43:50.740]  I don't mean that
[43:50.740 --> 43:51.740]  You know for a play on words
[43:51.740 --> 43:54.740]  Or or I'm being a little extreme
[43:54.740 --> 43:55.740]  Go do your research
[43:55.740 --> 43:57.740]  It's run by the government
[43:57.740 --> 43:58.740]  So is CNN by the way
[43:58.740 --> 44:00.740]  They're even on government satellites
[44:00.740 --> 44:01.740]  Came out in what
[44:01.740 --> 44:03.740]  2000 in the Washington Post
[44:03.740 --> 44:05.740]  That over 140 members of
[44:05.740 --> 44:06.740]  Of black ops
[44:06.740 --> 44:08.740]  Army psychological warfare
[44:08.740 --> 44:09.740]  Are there full time
[44:09.740 --> 44:11.740]  140
[44:11.740 --> 44:13.740]  Remember when Gore Vidal went on CNN
[44:13.740 --> 44:15.740]  And he said wow things have changed
[44:15.740 --> 44:17.740]  There isn't some colonel in a suit
[44:17.740 --> 44:21.740]  Telling us what we can talk about in this taped interview
[44:21.740 --> 44:23.740]  Do you understand ladies and gentlemen
[44:23.740 --> 44:25.740]  There are black op officers
[44:25.740 --> 44:27.740]  55 year old men
[44:27.740 --> 44:29.740]  With 165 IQ's
[44:29.740 --> 44:32.740]  Walking around in 3000 dollar suits
[44:32.740 --> 44:33.740]  At CNN and Fox
[44:33.740 --> 44:35.740]  Who've got high security
[44:35.740 --> 44:37.740]  You know delta level clearances
[44:37.740 --> 44:39.740]  You understand that isn't republican
[44:39.740 --> 44:40.740]  That isn't liberal
[44:40.740 --> 44:42.740]  That's military industrial complex
[44:42.740 --> 44:44.740]  The Pentagon runs the cameras
[44:44.740 --> 44:46.740]  That are in your town of 500 people
[44:46.740 --> 44:48.740]  We're totally controlled
[44:48.740 --> 44:50.740]  They're putting bio weapons in the vaccines
[44:50.740 --> 44:51.740]  Okay
[44:51.740 --> 44:52.740]  Do you understand
[44:52.740 --> 44:53.740]  They haven't killed me
[44:53.740 --> 44:54.740]  Because they know
[44:54.740 --> 44:56.740]  It will water the tree of liberty
[44:56.740 --> 44:58.740]  They know what Thomas Jefferson said is true
[44:58.740 --> 45:00.740]  Now when I get big enough folks
[45:00.740 --> 45:01.740]  I've studied history
[45:01.740 --> 45:03.740]  You were able to have the effect
[45:03.740 --> 45:05.740]  I know they will probably kill me
[45:05.740 --> 45:08.740]  I am literally walking into the jaws of death
[45:08.740 --> 45:10.740]  But that's not any big deal
[45:10.740 --> 45:12.740]  That's what men are supposed to do
[45:12.740 --> 45:13.740]  I am waging war
[45:13.740 --> 45:15.740]  Against enemies of the United States
[45:15.740 --> 45:16.740]  Against the republic
[45:16.740 --> 45:18.740]  That I have sworn to protect
[45:18.740 --> 45:19.740]  On the air
[45:19.740 --> 45:21.740]  And I take that oath very seriously
[45:21.740 --> 45:24.740]  I am doing this for my great grandchildren
[45:25.740 --> 45:26.740]  Ladies and gentlemen
[45:26.740 --> 45:28.740]  Who won't exist unless we beat these people
[45:28.740 --> 45:30.740]  We're talking about one child policies
[45:30.740 --> 45:32.740]  Very soon after the nuke attack
[45:32.740 --> 45:34.740]  They can radically re-engineer society
[45:34.740 --> 45:35.740]  We're being prepared
[45:35.740 --> 45:36.740]  All this stuff you see
[45:36.740 --> 45:38.740]  Is just the table setting
[45:38.740 --> 45:39.740]  For a massive feast
[45:39.740 --> 45:41.740]  On the carcass of America and the world
[45:43.740 --> 45:44.740]  Okay
[45:44.740 --> 45:45.740]  That's where this stands
[45:45.740 --> 45:46.740]  Do you understand
[45:46.740 --> 45:48.740]  Black op military officers
[45:48.740 --> 45:49.740]  Running CNN and FOX
[45:49.740 --> 45:50.740]  Ladies and gentlemen
[45:50.740 --> 45:52.740]  Is not freedom
[45:52.740 --> 45:54.740]  Is not a good thing
[45:54.740 --> 45:56.740]  That is scary
[45:56.740 --> 45:59.740]  Alright so Rosie O'Donnell slips in there
[45:59.740 --> 46:02.740]  They think she'll put out an overall fake left agenda
[46:02.740 --> 46:04.740]  She starts shooting her mouth off immediately
[46:04.740 --> 46:06.740]  They tell her she can't talk about the dead soldiers
[46:06.740 --> 46:09.740]  While the other twit on the show
[46:09.740 --> 46:15.740]  Is Hasselbeck is calling the Iraqis animals
[46:15.740 --> 46:17.740]  This is what Rosie said
[46:17.740 --> 46:19.740]  I didn't see these programs
[46:19.740 --> 46:20.740]  This is what she said
[46:20.740 --> 46:22.740]  Hasselbeck is calling them animals
[46:22.740 --> 46:24.740]  I can't bring up the number of dead U.S. troops
[46:24.740 --> 46:25.740]  They told me not to
[46:25.740 --> 46:27.740]  That started within the first two weeks
[46:27.740 --> 46:28.740]  Okay
[46:28.740 --> 46:30.740]  And then it was just continual
[46:30.740 --> 46:32.740]  And then they would edit her
[46:32.740 --> 46:35.740]  They would edit Rosie
[46:35.740 --> 46:37.740]  On the three tape shows
[46:37.740 --> 46:38.740]  Mondays
[46:38.740 --> 46:40.740]  Wednesdays
[46:40.740 --> 46:41.740]  And Fridays
[46:41.740 --> 46:42.740]  Tuesdays and Thursdays
[46:42.740 --> 46:44.740]  Were live
[46:44.740 --> 46:46.740]  75% of the time
[46:46.740 --> 46:48.740]  I was asking one of the people
[46:48.740 --> 46:50.740]  I was asking one of the people
[46:50.740 --> 46:51.740]  Involved in the show
[46:51.740 --> 46:52.740]  And they said well it's not
[46:52.740 --> 46:53.740]  You know it's usually live
[46:53.740 --> 46:54.740]  But there's some big event
[46:54.740 --> 46:56.740]  We have those in case there's live stuff
[46:56.740 --> 46:57.740]  Like the shootings
[46:57.740 --> 46:58.740]  And we can go live any day
[46:58.740 --> 47:00.740]  Everybody's on call
[47:00.740 --> 47:03.740]  So she would try to slip stuff out on there
[47:03.740 --> 47:05.740]  It was always on a Tuesday or a Thursday
[47:05.740 --> 47:06.740]  Where she'd say 9-11 is an inside job
[47:06.740 --> 47:07.740]  Or she'd say things
[47:07.740 --> 47:09.740]  Today
[47:09.740 --> 47:10.740]  By the way
[47:10.740 --> 47:13.740]  Then they installed some type of 10 second delay
[47:13.740 --> 47:14.740]  Even on the live program
[47:14.740 --> 47:17.740]  And started blurping and blipping and cutting
[47:17.740 --> 47:19.740]  That just happened the last month
[47:19.740 --> 47:20.740]  That was it for her
[47:20.740 --> 47:22.740]  They said hey we're doubling your money
[47:22.740 --> 47:24.740]  We want to give you a three year contract
[47:24.740 --> 47:25.740]  She said no
[47:25.740 --> 47:27.740]  I'm leaving
[47:27.740 --> 47:30.740]  She said I'm leaving
[47:30.740 --> 47:31.740]  And by the way
[47:31.740 --> 47:32.740]  It's not just our opinion
[47:32.740 --> 47:33.740]  Or what Rosie said to us
[47:33.740 --> 47:35.740]  Or what we learned from William Rodriguez
[47:35.740 --> 47:36.740]  Or
[47:36.740 --> 47:37.740]  Christina Ebersol
[47:37.740 --> 47:40.740]  A great lady
[47:40.740 --> 47:42.740]  Here is one from
[47:42.740 --> 47:44.740]  September 4th 2006
[47:44.740 --> 47:46.740]  Barbara doesn't want Rosie to blog
[47:46.740 --> 47:48.740]  People magazine
[47:48.740 --> 47:49.740]  See right there
[47:49.740 --> 47:52.740]  They didn't want her saying anything political outside the show
[47:52.740 --> 47:55.740]  Outside of her show
[47:55.740 --> 47:57.740]  They didn't want her
[47:57.740 --> 47:58.740]  That's a big deal
[47:58.740 --> 48:00.740]  They were telling her shut up
[48:00.740 --> 48:02.740]  Outside of her show
[48:02.740 --> 48:04.740]  So Rosie turns down
[48:04.740 --> 48:06.740]  Double the money
[48:06.740 --> 48:07.740]  A three year contract
[48:07.740 --> 48:11.740]  We're talking about tens of millions of dollars
[48:11.740 --> 48:15.740]  And she walks away
[48:15.740 --> 48:18.740]  And instead of the media going look at that courage
[48:18.740 --> 48:20.740]  Look at her stand on her principles
[48:20.740 --> 48:22.740]  And being a hero for free speech
[48:22.740 --> 48:24.740]  A pure Americana
[48:24.740 --> 48:26.740]  I mean it literally makes my heart beat faster
[48:26.740 --> 48:28.740]  Total respect
[48:28.740 --> 48:30.740]  That's the spirit
[48:30.740 --> 48:32.740]  That will save this country
[48:32.740 --> 48:34.740]  Despite all her other problems
[48:34.740 --> 48:37.740]  And the fact that I disagree with her on about 50% of the stuff she's for
[48:37.740 --> 48:39.740]  I'm with her on the war
[48:39.740 --> 48:40.740]  9-11 a lot of others
[48:40.740 --> 48:41.740]  She's wrong on some others
[48:41.740 --> 48:42.740]  But by the way she's coming along
[48:42.740 --> 48:45.740]  She's into watching anti-New World Order movies every day
[48:45.740 --> 48:47.740]  This is what she's into now
[48:47.740 --> 48:48.740]  By the way I can tell you
[48:48.740 --> 48:49.740]  Rosie again
[48:49.740 --> 48:50.740]  That was finally center over the edge
[48:50.740 --> 48:51.740]  And I was told this by two sources
[48:51.740 --> 48:53.740]  Was Terror Storm
[48:53.740 --> 48:55.740]  I'm not saying it because it's my film
[48:55.740 --> 48:56.740]  Obviously I want my film to be seen
[48:56.740 --> 48:57.740]  It's for free on Google
[48:57.740 --> 48:58.740]  But the point is
[48:58.740 --> 48:59.740]  That's center over the edge
[48:59.740 --> 49:02.740]  Last September
[49:02.740 --> 49:03.740]  That's what she talks about
[49:03.740 --> 49:04.740]  Gulpitank and Mozadek
[49:04.740 --> 49:06.740]  She's taken whole quotes out of Terror Storm
[49:06.740 --> 49:08.740]  And put it on her blog
[49:08.740 --> 49:10.740]  About false flag terror
[49:10.740 --> 49:11.740]  She's used our voice over
[49:11.740 --> 49:12.740]  She's used what we've said
[49:12.740 --> 49:13.740]  We knew that
[49:13.740 --> 49:15.740]  We couldn't tell you about it
[49:17.740 --> 49:18.740]  It's exciting
[49:22.740 --> 49:24.740]  We have to be prepared to actually win
[49:24.740 --> 49:25.740]  And take this country back
[49:25.740 --> 49:26.740]  But everybody's convinced we're all going to lose
[49:26.740 --> 49:27.740]  Because your preacher told you
[49:27.740 --> 49:29.740]  Well I don't care if we're even going to lose
[49:29.740 --> 49:30.740]  I'm not going to go down without fighting
[49:30.740 --> 49:32.740]  I'm not going to die on the ditch licking boots
[49:34.740 --> 49:35.740]  But history shows
[49:35.740 --> 49:37.740]  If you're highly motivated and take action
[49:37.740 --> 49:38.740]  And you're in the right
[49:38.740 --> 49:39.740]  You pretty much can't be beat
[49:41.740 --> 49:42.740]  Let's say they took all our guns tomorrow
[49:42.740 --> 49:43.740]  Which they can't do
[49:43.740 --> 49:44.740]  All I need is a butter knife
[49:44.740 --> 49:46.740]  I can sharpen in 20 minutes
[49:46.740 --> 49:48.740]  To go take all the guns I want
[49:48.740 --> 49:49.740]  Because I've got the will
[49:49.740 --> 49:50.740]  To protect my family
[49:52.740 --> 49:54.740]  You know what I can do with that butter knife?
[49:54.740 --> 49:56.740]  What you can do when you're protecting your family?
[49:56.740 --> 49:57.740]  Your body doesn't even turn on
[49:57.740 --> 49:59.740]  And give you power
[49:59.740 --> 50:00.740]  All these wannabe tough guy men
[50:00.740 --> 50:01.740]  Who think they're tough
[50:01.740 --> 50:03.740]  And got all the symbols of toughness
[50:03.740 --> 50:06.740]  The real power comes when you start defending people
[50:06.740 --> 50:08.740]  The real power comes when you tap in
[50:08.740 --> 50:10.740]  To that primordial strength
[50:10.740 --> 50:11.740]  Of defending your tribe
[50:12.740 --> 50:13.740]  And that's why the good guys
[50:13.740 --> 50:16.740]  Always kick the butts of the bad guys
[50:17.740 --> 50:18.740]  That's why
[50:19.740 --> 50:21.740]  The New World Order tries to convince
[50:21.740 --> 50:22.740]  When it's doing evil things
[50:22.740 --> 50:24.740]  It tries to hire and con and fool good guys
[50:24.740 --> 50:27.740]  But good guys always start waking up real quick
[50:30.740 --> 50:32.740]  So Rosie was told to shut up
[50:33.740 --> 50:34.740]  And what does hot air
[50:34.740 --> 50:36.740]  And all the big neo-con sites say
[50:36.740 --> 50:37.740]  They all trump it
[50:37.740 --> 50:38.740]  Just type in Rosie fired
[50:38.740 --> 50:39.740]  Rosie sacked
[50:39.740 --> 50:40.740]  Rosie canned into Google
[50:40.740 --> 50:41.740]  You'll get hundreds of articles
[50:41.740 --> 50:42.740]  As they celebrate
[50:42.740 --> 50:43.740]  And toast champagne
[50:44.740 --> 50:45.740]  Oh we got censorship
[50:45.740 --> 50:46.740]  She's fired
[50:46.740 --> 50:47.740]  Not even true
[50:47.740 --> 50:48.740]  She walked away and said
[50:48.740 --> 50:49.740]  You know what?
[50:49.740 --> 50:50.740]  You're not going to censor me anymore
[50:50.740 --> 50:51.740]  I made your show a big hit
[50:51.740 --> 50:52.740]  I'm leaving
[50:52.740 --> 50:54.740]  Putting her money where her mouth is
[50:54.740 --> 50:55.740]  Having courage
[50:56.740 --> 50:57.740]  Saying no to corruption
[50:57.740 --> 50:59.740]  Saying no to millions of dollars
[50:59.740 --> 51:01.740]  Walking away from it
[51:02.740 --> 51:03.740]  And what does she get?
[51:03.740 --> 51:05.740]  They even take what she did away from her
[51:05.740 --> 51:07.740]  They take it and they twist it and they lie
[51:07.740 --> 51:08.740]  The Pentagon
[51:08.740 --> 51:09.740]  The Pentagon does
[51:11.740 --> 51:14.740]  A Pentagon that the head of the Naval War College admits
[51:14.740 --> 51:15.740]  Doesn't even work for America
[51:15.740 --> 51:17.740]  It works for Wall Street
[51:17.740 --> 51:18.740]  And foreign banks
[51:18.740 --> 51:21.740]  The Pentagon is here to destroy America
[51:21.740 --> 51:23.740]  They are the enemy
[51:23.740 --> 51:24.740]  They are the enemy combatants
[51:24.740 --> 51:26.740]  I mean that when I say it
[51:26.740 --> 51:28.740]  They are literally the enemy
[51:28.740 --> 51:30.740]  This is not our government
[51:30.740 --> 51:34.740]  It's here, after a year introduction and traveling to distant lands
[51:34.740 --> 51:36.740]  My new film Terror Storm is complete
[51:36.740 --> 51:38.740]  Shocking declassified government documents prove
[51:38.740 --> 51:41.740]  That Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[51:41.740 --> 51:42.740]  Against their own populations
[51:42.740 --> 51:44.740]  As a pretext to enslave them
[51:44.740 --> 51:47.740]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[51:47.740 --> 51:48.740]  An inside job
[51:48.740 --> 51:50.740]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London
[51:50.740 --> 51:52.740]  Were carried out by British Intelligence
[51:52.740 --> 51:54.740]  Terror Storm chronicles that
[51:54.740 --> 51:56.740]  The United States and the United States
[51:56.740 --> 51:58.740]  Have been attacked by the United States
[51:59.740 --> 52:02.740]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[52:02.740 --> 52:05.740]  The White House program to disseminate fake news
[52:05.740 --> 52:06.740]  NSA spying

[52:48.740 --> 52:50.740]  And biological or chemical attacks?
[52:50.740 --> 52:51.740]  With a little know-how

[55:00.740 --> 55:02.740]  Yeah, they wrap themselves
[55:02.740 --> 55:03.740]  In the troops
[55:03.740 --> 55:04.740]  While they knowingly let them
[55:04.740 --> 55:05.740]  Breathe the DU
[55:05.740 --> 55:06.740]  And give them experimental shots
[55:06.740 --> 55:08.740]  To keep them in their five tours
[55:08.740 --> 55:09.740]  Never before been done
[55:09.740 --> 55:10.740]  And they always tell you
[55:10.740 --> 55:11.740]  How they love America
[55:11.740 --> 55:12.740]  Well, they're busy killing it
[55:12.740 --> 55:14.740]  North American Union news coming up
[55:14.740 --> 55:15.740]  So much other news

[55:23.740 --> 55:24.740]  By the way, we do have
[55:24.740 --> 55:25.740]  William Rodriguez's video
[55:25.740 --> 55:26.740]  William Rodriguez,
[55:26.740 --> 55:28.740]  What Really Happened on 9-11

[55:37.740 --> 55:38.740]  And we're going to be getting
[55:38.740 --> 55:39.740]  That man back on the show here
[55:39.740 --> 55:40.740]  Very, very soon
[55:40.740 --> 55:41.740]  If he'll come on
[55:41.740 --> 55:42.740]  I know he's very, very busy
[55:42.740 --> 55:43.740]  But please get his film
[55:43.740 --> 55:44.740]  Because that does go to support
[55:44.740 --> 55:45.740]  Him and his wife
[55:45.740 --> 55:46.740]  As they try to travel
[55:46.740 --> 55:47.740]  Around the country for free
[55:47.740 --> 55:48.740]  Trying to get the word out
[55:48.740 --> 55:49.740]  We appreciate
[55:49.740 --> 55:50.740]  Him, by the way
[55:50.740 --> 55:51.740]  Giving us the exclusive
[55:51.740 --> 55:52.740]  Letting us know
[55:52.740 --> 55:53.740]  The behind the scenes stuff
[55:53.740 --> 55:55.740]  That also meshed with our reports
[55:55.740 --> 55:56.740]  We were getting from
[55:56.740 --> 55:57.740]  Christina Ebersole
[55:57.740 --> 55:58.740]  A great lady
[55:59.740 --> 56:01.740]  And, again, bottom line
[56:01.740 --> 56:03.740]  Rosie O'Donnell
[56:03.740 --> 56:04.740]  Was not fired
[56:04.740 --> 56:05.740]  Anytime you hear that
[56:05.740 --> 56:07.740]  It is a giant, stinking lie
[56:08.740 --> 56:09.740]  Now, one site that told the truth
[56:09.740 --> 56:11.740]  Was the neocon site
[56:11.740 --> 56:12.740]  To fire Rosie
[56:13.740 --> 56:14.740]  And they said
[56:14.740 --> 56:15.740]  No, no, we've been defeated
[56:15.740 --> 56:16.740]  She actually left
[56:16.740 --> 56:17.740]  And now it looks like
[56:17.740 --> 56:18.740]  She's going to be getting
[56:18.740 --> 56:19.740]  A major TV show
[56:19.740 --> 56:20.740]  Her own
[56:20.740 --> 56:22.740]  And wouldn't be the first time
[56:23.740 --> 56:24.740]  She's still going to be
[56:24.740 --> 56:25.740]  A guest host
[56:25.740 --> 56:26.740]  And supposed to be able
[56:26.740 --> 56:27.740]  To say whatever she wants
[56:27.740 --> 56:28.740]  And ABC is saying
[56:28.740 --> 56:29.740]  How great she is
[56:29.740 --> 56:30.740]  And basically
[56:30.740 --> 56:31.740]  Begging her to stay
[56:31.740 --> 56:32.740]  What half owner
[56:32.740 --> 56:33.740]  Barbara Walters
[56:33.740 --> 56:34.740]  Was begging her to stay on air
[56:34.740 --> 56:35.740]  She wasn't fired
[56:35.740 --> 56:36.740]  Ladies and gentlemen
[56:36.740 --> 56:37.740]  We ought to get that clip
[56:37.740 --> 56:38.740]  When we have it
[56:38.740 --> 56:39.740]  We ought to put it on the story
[56:39.740 --> 56:40.740]  That Paul Watson
[56:40.740 --> 56:41.740]  Is putting together
[56:41.740 --> 56:42.740]  I mean, you've got the owner
[56:42.740 --> 56:43.740]  Of the show saying
[56:43.740 --> 56:44.740]  We don't want you to go
[56:44.740 --> 56:45.740]  ABC owns half
[56:45.740 --> 56:46.740]  Walters owns the other half
[56:47.740 --> 56:48.740]  And we've got the owner
[56:48.740 --> 56:49.740]  Saying we don't want you to go
[56:50.740 --> 56:51.740]  And we're upset about it
[56:51.740 --> 56:52.740]  Of course, because we're
[56:52.740 --> 56:53.740]  Making a lot of money off of her
[56:56.740 --> 56:57.740]  And then Fox News
[56:57.740 --> 56:58.740]  And all these other liars
[56:58.740 --> 56:59.740]  Say she was fired
[57:00.740 --> 57:01.740]  And Donald Trump says
[57:01.740 --> 57:02.740]  We've got the clips
[57:03.740 --> 57:04.740]  We'll play them in the next hour
[57:05.740 --> 57:06.740]  Now, what else
[57:06.740 --> 57:07.740]  Have I not told the public
[57:07.740 --> 57:08.740]  That I can talk about
[57:09.740 --> 57:11.740]  Well, it's just really that
[57:12.740 --> 57:13.740]  Rosie was censored
[57:13.740 --> 57:14.740]  The whole time
[57:14.740 --> 57:15.740]  They were editing her
[57:15.740 --> 57:16.740]  When it was tape shows
[57:16.740 --> 57:17.740]  They'd edit everything out
[57:17.740 --> 57:18.740]  She'd say about 9-11
[57:19.740 --> 57:20.740]  Or dead troops
[57:20.740 --> 57:22.740]  Or lying about the numbers
[57:22.740 --> 57:24.740]  Of real troops that were dead
[57:25.740 --> 57:26.740]  Or would she try to report
[57:26.740 --> 57:27.740]  How they don't count
[57:27.740 --> 57:28.740]  As a casualty
[57:28.740 --> 57:29.740]  If the person dies
[57:29.740 --> 57:30.740]  On a helicopter being
[57:30.740 --> 57:31.740]  Flown out of Iraq
[57:31.740 --> 57:32.740]  They wouldn't let her talk
[57:32.740 --> 57:34.740]  About how they make them
[57:34.740 --> 57:35.740]  Pay for their own meals
[57:35.740 --> 57:36.740]  Wouldn't let her talk
[57:36.740 --> 57:37.740]  About DU
[57:37.740 --> 57:38.740]  Nothing
[57:38.740 --> 57:39.740]  Nothing
[57:39.740 --> 57:40.740]  She couldn't talk about the war
[57:41.740 --> 57:42.740]  Well, of course not
[57:42.740 --> 57:43.740]  Big defense contractors
[57:43.740 --> 57:44.740]  Basically own that channel
[57:45.740 --> 57:47.740]  You think they want this to stop
[57:47.740 --> 57:48.740]  By the way, you keep thinking
[57:48.740 --> 57:49.740]  They want to win the war
[57:49.740 --> 57:50.740]  The government is winning the war
[57:51.740 --> 57:52.740]  Okay, do you understand
[57:52.740 --> 57:53.740]  That the war is a success
[57:53.740 --> 57:54.740]  I want to make that clear
[57:55.740 --> 57:56.740]  But it isn't a success
[57:56.740 --> 57:57.740]  In the way you thought it was
[57:57.740 --> 57:59.740]  The longer the more people die
[57:59.740 --> 58:02.740]  The more weapons platforms they sell
[58:02.740 --> 58:04.740]  And the more no-bid contracts
[58:04.740 --> 58:06.740]  You know, I was talking to Corey Rowe
[58:06.740 --> 58:07.740]  One of the guys in Loose Change
[58:07.740 --> 58:08.740]  One of the men that does that
[58:11.740 --> 58:12.740]  A few days ago
[58:12.740 --> 58:13.740]  When I was with him
[58:13.740 --> 58:15.740]  And, you know, I knew about it
[58:15.740 --> 58:16.740]  And I said, you know, I remember
[58:16.740 --> 58:17.740]  Reading in the Associated Press
[58:17.740 --> 58:19.740]  That you have to pay for your meals
[58:19.740 --> 58:21.740]  You basically ended up with nothing
[58:21.740 --> 58:22.740]  And these are hardcore
[58:22.740 --> 58:24.740]  Frontline combat troops
[58:24.740 --> 58:25.740]  In Afghanistan and Iraq
[58:25.740 --> 58:26.740]  He was in both places
[58:26.740 --> 58:27.740]  He was in big firefights
[58:27.740 --> 58:28.740]  Killed a lot of people
[58:28.740 --> 58:29.740]  He didn't like to talk about it
[58:29.740 --> 58:30.740]  But I've got him dumb in the stories
[58:30.740 --> 58:32.740]  I mean, they've just, you know
[58:32.740 --> 58:34.740]  He said that you talk about the Iraqis
[58:34.740 --> 58:35.740]  They'd be like a hundred of them
[58:35.740 --> 58:36.740]  In front of them
[58:36.740 --> 58:37.740]  All shooting at them
[58:37.740 --> 58:38.740]  And they didn't know how to shoot
[58:38.740 --> 58:39.740]  And they just mow them all down
[58:39.740 --> 58:40.740]  But just amazing stories
[58:40.740 --> 58:42.740]  But I said, let me guess
[58:42.740 --> 58:43.740]  He was driving out of there
[58:43.740 --> 58:44.740]  To pay for their food
[58:44.740 --> 58:45.740]  All of it
[58:45.740 --> 58:47.740]  And I said, also, is it true
[58:47.740 --> 58:49.740]  You had to pay like a hundred dollars
[58:49.740 --> 58:51.740]  Because they made you do dress inspections
[58:51.740 --> 58:52.740]  But then you had to pay
[58:52.740 --> 58:53.740]  To have haliburton laundry
[58:53.740 --> 58:55.740]  And it was like super expensive
[58:55.740 --> 58:57.740]  He goes, oh yeah, we had to pay for water
[58:57.740 --> 59:00.740]  They've never done this to our troops, folks
[59:00.740 --> 59:01.740]  They're raping them
[59:01.740 --> 59:03.740]  They use them like toilet paper
[59:03.740 --> 59:06.740]  And then tell them how much they care about them
[59:06.740 --> 59:08.740]  This isn't our military
[59:09.740 --> 59:11.740]  This isn't our government

[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.740]  You know, high school jock
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.740]  Friends with Dylan Avery
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.740]  He goes over to Afghanistan
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740]  He goes over to Iraq
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.740]  He's there a couple years
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.740]  And he was describing how they had to pay for their food
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.740]  They still had to get in dress uniforms every few weeks
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.740]  Living out of their tanks, by the way
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.740]  They didn't have cold weather gear
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740]  And it gets cold in Northern Iraq
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.740]  They'd be freezing in their tanks
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740]  They'd have to like
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740]  Go and pay Halliburton
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.740]  To clean their uniforms
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.740]  To do dress inspections
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.740]  They didn't do that in the past
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.740]  Breathing DU
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.740]  By the way, Corey was talking about how he coughs his lungs up every day
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.740]  And vomits
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.740]  I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about that
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.740]  He thinks it's an EU
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.740]  And all these other things that are happening
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.740]  They give him all these experimental shots
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.740]  But these are people I know
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.740]  By the way, that's the kind of people that are behind loose change
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.740]  And
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.740]  None of the troops are for it
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.740]  I mean, there's like a handful
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:22.740]  And they put them all over the news
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.740]  They all hate it
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.740]  They know it's a fraud
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.740]  They know it's a lie
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.740]  They know it's a scam
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.740]  The number is well over 12,000 dead US troops
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.740]  That's official numbers
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.740]  But see, they don't count you as a combat casualty
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.740]  If you die in Rammstein
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.740]  Or in London
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.740]  Or if you die in the United States
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.740]  You know, two weeks later
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.740]  Or an hour after you fly out of Iraq
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.740]  It was 12,000 a few months ago
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.740]  I don't know what it is now
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.740]  It's not 3,000, ladies and gentlemen
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.740]  It's
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.740]  Over 12,000 dead
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.740]  And of course, John Hopkins did their own study
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:02:59.740]  And found
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.740]  Yeah, the first three years
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.740]  Over 600,000 dead
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.740]  They found 601
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.740]  And the British said 654,000
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.740]  Now, preliminary numbers coming in
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.740]  It's well over
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:12.740]  A million
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.740]  Dead
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.740]  Really good job New World Order
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.740]  By the way, it was a good job
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.740]  They did exactly what the Pentagon said
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.740]  Break the country up
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:21.740]  Sectarian violence
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.740]  Bring it from first world to third world
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.740]  Use it as a staging ground to invade
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.740]  And project power into Iran and Syria
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.740]  Turn off the oil supply
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.740]  To then create artificial scarcity
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.740]  And jack up prices
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.740]  Total genius
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.740]  You see
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.740]  But the average person believes
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.740]  They're doing it for good reasons
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.740]  And this democracy
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.740]  And all this baloney
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.740]  They don't understand
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740]  How hardcore evil
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.740]  These people are wreckers
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.740]  And I've given this speech before
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.740]  But
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.740]  I'd read about this a few places
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.740]  But I got
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.740]  About six, seven years ago
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.740]  Into naval history
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.740]  I mean, I've been reading about
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.740]  Macedonian
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.740]  And the Greek navy
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.740]  And I've been reading about
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.740]  The Silesians
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.740]  And the Romans
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.740]  And I got up to British
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.740]  Because, you know, obviously
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.740]  I'm going to read about
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740]  British naval history
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:02.740]  Because it's in English
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740]  And isn't a translation
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.740]  I've probably read 15, 20
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.740]  It's kind of embarrassing
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.740]  I've probably read 30 or 40
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.740]  The more I think about it
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.740]  Books
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:09.740]  On British naval history
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.740]  You talk about action packed
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.740]  I mean, each book might be
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.740]  A year of engagements
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740]  And exact notes that were taken
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.740]  And it's mainly diaries
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.740]  And descriptions of all the things
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740]  And you get to read about
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.740]  The Greek Navy
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740]  And the Greek Navy
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.740]  And I've been reading about
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]  The Silesians
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740]  And the Romans
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740]  And I got up to British
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.740]  And you get to see
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.740]  Through their eyes
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.740]  What the South Pacific
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.740]  Looked like in 1720
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.740]  It's just amazing
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.740]  But why did I get off into that?
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740]  Oh yeah, wreckers
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.740]  All over the coast of France
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.740]  And Italy
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.740]  And England
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.740]  There were little villages
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.740]  Little fishing towns
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740]  That would cater to
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.740]  The merchants
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.740]  And to the pirates
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]  Which were basically
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.740]  The same thing
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.740]  And the navy
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740]  And they put out fake
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740]  Lighthouses though
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.740]  Of course the locals knew
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740]  That it was fake
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.740]  To make people wreck
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.740]  There on these shoals
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.740]  So they could go out
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:59.740]  And rob their ships
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.740]  And so they could go out
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:01.740]  And then basically
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.740]  Whatever gold the people
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.740]  Escaped off the ship with
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:04.740]  And then he survived
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.740]  They'd have to pay for that
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.740]  Just to get passage back
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.740]  To France or vice versa
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.740]  They were called wreckers
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.740]  Wrecker towns
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.740]  That's where the term
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.740]  Wrecker comes from
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.740]  And some of the most wealthy
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.740]  People in England
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.740]  Made their money as wreckers
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.740]  We literally have wreckers
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.740]  Running things
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:21.740]  That's all they do
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.740]  They get us into a wreck
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.740]  They make everything they can
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.740]  As bad as they can
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.740]  New Orleans
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.740]  9-11
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.740]  Iraq
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740]  The war on terrorism
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.740]  Will it be fought overseas
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.740]  Or will it affect us
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.740]  Here at home
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:37.740]  If you are like most folks
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.740]  You want to be prepared
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.740]  But can't afford

[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:22.740]  On the GCN Radio Network
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:53.740]  Richard, Rishi, Sue, Trent, Chris and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.740]  I said I'd play these clips.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.740]  Let's just play them.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:04.740]  Here's Rosie O'Donnell talking about why she's leaving The View and being gracious to them
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740]  that, you know, they just couldn't agree on a contract.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.740]  But ABC and Art News articles admits that she didn't agree to three years
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.740]  And, you know, double the money basically.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:17.740]  And here's the owner of the show, owns out the show, Barbara Walters, saying we're sad
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:18.740]  you're leaving.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.740]  Yeah, they're sad millions of dollars is leaving is what they're sad about.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.740]  Tens of millions.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740]  And then Rosie quit.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.740]  We know that she was planning to quit.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.740]  I knew this three weeks ago.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.740]  She wasn't going to renew her contract because she didn't want to be censored anymore
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.740]  And basically harassed by the producer.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:41.740]  She edited both in live, which was semi-live now, to control her and in the taped shows.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:42.740]  That's big news, folks.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:43.740]  ABC News censored her.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.740]  That's why she left.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.740]  Period.
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:50.740]  And then the media lies and says she was fired so they can have some attack on freedom
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.740]  an attack on free speech.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.740]  So here's Rosie first on The View yesterday making her announcement.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:59.740]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.740]  So next year I'm not going to be on The View.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.740]  However, I will be coming back and guest hosting.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.740]  I'm just not going to do the everyday thing because we couldn't.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:08.740]  You know, they want to be three years.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:09.740]  I wanted one year.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.740]  And then they were like, OK, well, what if we do that?
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.740]  I was like.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.740]  And it just didn't work.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.740]  Well, you keep saying don't be sad and we should all be upbeat.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.740]  And I am sad.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:19.740]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.740]  Because I induced you to come here.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.740]  I knew you only coming for one year.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740]  I hope that it would be more than one year.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.740]  We have had to say the least.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.740]  An interesting year.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.740]  We certainly have.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.740]  OK, you heard Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.740]  I made the decision to leave right there at the start.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.740]  She says I made the decision on the contract.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.740]  I, I, I, she quit.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.740]  Play it again.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.740]  I did and that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.740]  So next year, I'm not going to be on The View, however.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:52.740]  All right, stop again.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.740]  Play that one more time because the first got cut off.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.740]  She says I have decided I have decided listen to it.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.740]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:02.740]  Play it again.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.740]  Because I want, I want Fox News and the Pentagon.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:05.740]  And I know you know the truth.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.740]  But I want the Pentagon to know we know what Fox and CNN are.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:12.740]  We know the Pentagon has been bought out and works for foreign corporations.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:15.740]  And we understand you're here to destroy America and destroy free speech.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:16.740]  But you failed.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740]  We're going to get the word out on you and discredit you further.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.740]  Here again is Rosie saying I have decided we couldn't work out the contract.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.740]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.740]  So next year, I'm not going to be on The View.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:36.740]  Now, let's play, let's play the person who yells and screams and does profane things
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.740]  and does pro wrestling.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.740]  Donald Trump.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:49.740]  And he brings up some comedian skit that Rosie did where she said something that's really
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.740]  sophomoric and is on daytime television.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:52.740]  I'm not defending it.
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.740]  I'm not semi vulgar like this.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.740]  But this is Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.740]  She is a loose cannon.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:57.740]  That's why she's got courage.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.740]  That's why she shot her mouth off.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.740]  That's why she just turned down a bunch of money in a three-year contract with the number
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.740]  one TV show and morning television.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.740]  That's why Rosie did it.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740]  Because she is a loose cannon.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.740]  This is Donald Trump, as usual, lying about everything.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.740]  His reaction is, you know, you think he'd go off on another tangent, but he was actually
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.740]  very respectful about this whole thing.
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.740]  Here's his reaction today from CNN.
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.740]  I've been predicting this for a long time.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.740]  Rosie is a very self-destructive person.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.740]  Rosie is basically a loser.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:31.740]  I believe ABC wanted her out and they wanted her out badly and fast.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.740]  She made statements the other day at the Waldorf Astoria that were absolutely outrageous, where
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:40.740]  she grabbed her crotch and said things that were just terrible.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.740]  I mean, she's a slob.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:42.740]  Everybody knows it.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:43.740]  And they wanted her out.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.740]  And the one that wanted her out the most was Barbara Walters.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:54.740]  So that's Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:55.740]  And there you go.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.740]  They wanted her out.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740]  She's fired.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:03.740]  Fox News headline, why ABC axed Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:08.740]  Total, complete lie.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.740]  Because they can't have any more heroes.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.740]  They can't have anybody who's got the will to turn down a bunch of money.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.740]  They can't have people who won't be censored.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.740]  So they've got to lie and say, yeah, she got fired for what she said.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.740]  Ha ha, we win.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.740]  No, you lost.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.740]  You lost that battle, too, New World Order.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:30.740]  But you think you can just announce that all your cattle and all your sheeple will believe
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.740]  you're Pentagon baloney.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.740]  It doesn't work anymore.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.740]  By the way, numbers just came out.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:46.740]  In the last 10 years, newspaper circulation is down 67%.
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:47.740]  That's right.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:48.740]  They like to always give you the number yearly.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.740]  Like, we're down another 5%, we're down another 10%, we're down another 4%.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:56.740]  Now it's down on a monthly basis, and the new numbers came out, it plunged even further
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.740]  than they thought, and there's total abject panic.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.740]  It isn't just that people are using their iPods, you know, getting text messages of
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:04.740]  the news.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.740]  It isn't just the Internet that's doing this.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.740]  Okay, let me give you a news flash.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:13.740]  When people have been polled and people have been questioned, I mean, there was news 15
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:17.740]  years ago, the Austin American Statesman here in Austin had plunging readership.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:18.740]  It had already begun.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:24.740]  It was a campaign, everybody I knew was saying, because we're tired of your lies, we're tired
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.740]  of your spin, we're tired of your propaganda.
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.740]  We're tired of your liberal propaganda was the term at the time, but people have gotten
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740]  more sophisticated now.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.740]  It's establishment propaganda.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.740]  And they had to put billboards up all over town for years saying, we're not your same
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:37.740]  old statesman.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:45.740]  And they tried for a while, trying to be pro-gun a little bit, but they just couldn't do it.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.740]  They couldn't help themselves.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.740]  And so now that, you know, that newspaper is a complete joke.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.740]  I mean, literally, folks, we put ads before in the Statesman.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.740]  I mean, $400 ads for a little bitty thing in there.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.740]  But, you know, a paragraph or two.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:04.740]  And for one day, and we get one phone call by someone who can't even speak English wanting
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:05.740]  a job.
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.740]  You put an ad on Craigslist for free, you get 300, 400 responses.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.740]  They're beating down your door.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.740]  You're a joke.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.740]  You're a dinosaur.
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.740]  You're a legend in your own mind.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:26.740]  PrisonPlanet.com is rated over 45,000 places higher than Bill O'Reilly's website.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.740]  My website is now tens of thousands of places ahead of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.740]  I told you I was neck and neck last year.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.740]  He's now 10.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:35.740]  We don't do a story on that.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.740]  Tens of thousands of places behind.
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.740]  But still, the general public that isn't tuned into reality doesn't even know who I am.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:41.740]  Frankly, I don't even care.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.740]  I almost hate telling people how big we've gotten, because then all sorts of weird ninnying
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.740]  and jealousy begins.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:53.740]  Yes, it's like I'm a fighter aircraft deep behind enemy lines with all sorts of sham
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.740]  missiles, literally hundreds of them shooting at me.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.740]  Yes, it's really wonderful.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.740]  Again, I hate it.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.740]  I want to be successful to fight the enemy, but I know it puts me in more danger.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.740]  But I just go, you know what, I'm going to do it.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.740]  Literally.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.740]  I can't stand, maybe 10 years ago I liked being known.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.740]  Believe me, I hate it now.
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.740]  But I've got to get bigger.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.740]  I've got to have a bigger effect.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.740]  It's all about personality.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.740]  It's all about information.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:20.740]  And in a weird way, now, have you got to stay really big, or they certainly will kill me
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.740]  or set me up.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.740]  It's all these factors go into it.
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.740]  And then I just have to deal.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:30.740]  It's like Alec Baldwin yesterday, who I know, by the way, well, hell, let's just say Alec
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.740]  knows what's going on in the country.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.740]  And he's always getting demonized.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.740]  He's always getting attacked.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.740]  He's always getting misquoted and lied about.
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:43.740]  And he goes, yeah, my teenage daughter was being rude to me, and I called her a selfish
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.740]  little pig.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:46.740]  Folks, I mean, don't lie to anybody.
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.740]  Oh, how dare him.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.740]  How mean.
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:53.740]  You know, they call keeping track of your kids or disciplining them abuse.
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:57.740]  But then the government wants to have dogs sicced on them and machine guns pointed at
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.740]  them and cameras in the bathroom, but you're not supposed to watch what your children's
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:01.740]  doing.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.740]  And you're not supposed to tell your child when they're being a teenager, hey, stop acting
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.740]  like a pig.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:11.740]  I think I remember my mother when I was being like 14 and real rude to her.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.740]  I think I remember her calling me a pig.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.740]  You stop acting like a little pig.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740]  Oh, my God.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.740]  Oh, he's so bad.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.740]  I saw an AP article where he was quoted going, big deal.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.740]  I was mad at her not answering the phone.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.740]  I told her, quit being a selfish little self-centered pig.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:31.740]  Because, by the way, his wife, of course, keeps her away from him, and it just is frustrating.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.740]  And then the teenagers play that off against their parents.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.740]  You know how this stuff works.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.740]  Why did I get off into Alec Baldwin?
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:46.740]  Well, my point is that I don't remember what I was going to say about him.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.740]  It's just that it was good to see him go, so what?
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.740]  Yeah, I called her a selfish little pig.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:54.740]  But you're not supposed to do that.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.740]  You're supposed to just hand them over to the state so the SWAT team can slam their
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.740]  head into the concrete.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.740]  It's all about not training your children so they're a bunch of animals so they get
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.740]  caught in the system.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.740]  And then you do anything to discipline your children and they take them from you so they
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.740]  can be five times more likely to be abused, such as department's own numbers and their
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:12.740]  system.
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:16.740]  You know, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.740]  I might just go for three hours.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.740]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.740]  I want to hear from you.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.740]  I just, I got so much I want to talk about.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.740]  We're going to come back and go calls for the rest of the hour, 40 minutes of calls.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.740]  And then I'm going to continue into the third hour with nothing but news, I think, or maybe
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.740]  some calls.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.740]  I don't know.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.740]  I got it all here.
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.740]  I've got Pentagon wants to end controversial spying program in America.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.740]  And then I want to just point you to where they announce they're lying to you domestically.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.740]  That is a total lie.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.740]  The phone companies are the NSA.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.740]  Okay, whole floor is in every facility.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:49.740]  How many years did I tell you that?
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:55.740]  Then it came out with, you know, one office in, for the whole state of California in San
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.740]  Francisco AT&T, where the whole floor was a spook base.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.740]  And now it's been all over the news.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:04.740]  Okay, if I tell you something, we've got it backed up.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.740]  Okay.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.740]  So they're lying.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:10.740]  Pentagon wants to end controversial spying program.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.740]  Here's another one.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.740]  U.S. officials exclude car bombs and touting drop in Iraq violence.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.740]  This is McClatchy newspapers.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.740]  You cannot make this type of lying up.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.740]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:27.740]  And if you believe this, you believe the tooth fairy is real and brings you $10 when your
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.740]  tooth falls out.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:34.740]  Reuters, bin Laden overseeing Iraq, Afghanistan, ops and the Taliban.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.740]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:42.740]  And the last guy they tortured at Gitmo for four years, he really did kill Kennedy.
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.740]  And he actually is the tooth fairy.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:53.740]  He's actually flaps into your window at night and puts it under your bed.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.740]  So we're going to go over that.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.740]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:20:00.740]  We're going to play Keith Olbermann on Giuliani's chair of fear mongering.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.740]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:06.740]  I know I'm a kook when I have the father of weather weapons on and it's not true, but
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.740]  could global warming be halted by controlling the weather?
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:15.740]  And then China to force rain ahead of Olympics.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:19.740]  Industry caught in carbon smokescreen with the global carbon tax.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:20.740]  We told you that was a fraud.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.740]  This is Financial Times of London.
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:27.740]  There's going to be a town in China run by women where the men are beaten.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.740]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:37.740]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.740]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.740]  the water.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:43.740]  We listened.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.740]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.740]  of a counter.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.740]  We listened.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:52.740]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.740]  We listened.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:57.740]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.740]  We listened.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:03.740]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:04.740]  agents.
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.740]  Again, we listened.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:11.740]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.740]  and made in America.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:18.740]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier, only $279.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.740]  Call new millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:27.740]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.740]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.740]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:41.740]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.740]  year.
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:47.740]  This is a glaring testimonial of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued.
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:51.740]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.740]  profits.
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:57.740]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.740]  it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:06.740]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:10.740]  The Red Book is the number one bestselling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.740]  must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:30.740]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.740]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.740]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.740]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:39.740]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:44.740]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.740]  have is our freedom of speech.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:51.740]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:55.740]  stickers from humorous to serious at LibertyStickers.com.

[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.740]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:39.740]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes but always makes them worse?
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:44.740]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.740]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities but always targets
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:53.740]  non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.740]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:04.740]  our Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:58.740]  Big John. Big Bad John.
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:01.740]  Big John.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:07.740]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home. He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:15.740]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but he spoke it all. He just said hi to Big John.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:21.740]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:26.740]  and a crashy blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:31.740]  Big John. Big John.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.740]  Big John. Big Bad John.
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.740]  Big John.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:46.740]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when the timber cracked and men started crying.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:53.740]  Miners were praying and hearts beat fast. Everybody thought that they'd breathed the last, said John.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:59.740]  Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well.
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:05.740]  Grabbed a sagging timber, gave out without groaning like a giant oak tree, just stood there alone.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:10.740]  Big John. Big John.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.740]  Big John.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.740]  Big Bad John.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.740]  Big John.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:23.740]  With all his strength he gave a mighty shove, then a miner yelled out,
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:28.740]  there's a light up above and twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:33.740]  Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:38.740]  With jacks and timbers they started back down and came and rumbled way down in the ground.
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:45.740]  And the smoke and gas fell straight out of that mine, everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:51.740]  Big John. Big John.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.740]  Big Bad John.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.740]  Big John.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:03.740]  Now they never reopened that worthless pit, they just placed a marble stand in front of it.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:13.740]  These few words written on that stand, at the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.740]  Big John.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.740]  Big John.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.740]  Big John.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.740]  Big Bad John.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.740]  All right, I played the whole song.
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.740]  People have been asking me why do I play North to Alaska and that song and a few others,
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.740]  because when I was a little kid my dad bought me this little record player.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.740]  They were the little records, I forget what you call those.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:42.740]  And I guess it went with a bunch of old records he had from when he was a kid or something,
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.740]  and it was stuff like that in 1814, took a little trip, along with Colonel Jackson.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.740]  My God, I played that song a few months ago, and locals thought it was secret codes or something.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.740]  That's why I get so sick of doing what I do.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:01.740]  It's just so crazy, man.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.740]  That's why I was talking about Alec Baldwin.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.740]  He was like, I want to get out of acting.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.740]  I just don't want to interface with the stupid public anymore.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.740]  I don't even want to be involved with all this anymore.
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.740]  He was telling the Associated Press that.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:18.740]  And I know he means it, because you really do get sick of it.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:23.740]  Because people think that, and I guess this is the trap,
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:28.740]  I guess you do want people to know who you are, and you do want to be a big shot until you are,
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.740]  and then you find out it's not fun.
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.740]  Now, that's normal people.
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:41.740]  There are a lot of people who, like Bush and his controllers and all these,
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:44.740]  I mean, there's never enough power.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:48.740]  I guarantee if Hitler would have taken over the world, he would have started trying to build spaceships
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.740]  and go conquer Mars in case there were any green little men there.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:56.740]  But really what they do when Stalin had total power over Russia, he tried to take over surrounding countries,
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.740]  and when he had total domination of his own country, he started having massive purges
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.740]  and killing people because he can.
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.740]  It is what it is, as they say.
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.740]  And I just never get those people.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.740]  My dad told me, when I was decades ago, I remember him saying,
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.740]  well, to get really powerful, son, you've got to make a lot of compromises and do a lot of really bad things.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:19.740]  That's why most successful people just get to a certain level of success because you get fat and happy.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:25.740]  Then you're not willing to go scrabble and fight and scrap for, you know, just so competitive.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.740]  It's like a hyper sickness of competitiveness.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.740]  Well, these people are pure machines, man.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:35.740]  They don't care how many, you know, there's oil there, kill that whole village.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:40.740]  Just kill a thousand of them, send in troops, line them up, and blow their heads off.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.740]  These guys sleep good at night.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.740]  They just love it.
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.740]  And you think they care about you, America.
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:51.740]  You think they give one red cent for all of us put together.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:54.740]  All right, I promise when we get back, we'll go to your calls.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:30:05.740]  I am, I am, I just want to beat the new world order.
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.740]  I just want to live in some semblance of security.
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.740]  I just don't want total criminals running things.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.740]  I mean, hell, this isn't boss hog corruption.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.740]  This is hardcore evil.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:20.740]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.740]  We're on the march.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.740]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:30.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.740]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:38.740]  and million dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.740]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.740]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:51.740]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:54.740]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.740]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in,

[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:43.740]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter back with the divided kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues too.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:48.740]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:55.740]  now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m. Central.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:32:01.740]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.

[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:38.740]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.740]  There was something so pleasant about that place
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:50.740]  Even your emotions haven't echoed in so much space
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:56.740]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah, I was out of touch
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.740]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:06.740]  I just knew too much
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:10.740]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:14.740]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:19.740]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:25.740]  It's hard to believe
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:32.740]  In all that you have in the time of your life
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:36.740]  But think twice
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:41.740]  That's my only advice
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:48.740]  Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:52.740]  Bless your soul
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:56.740]  You really think you're in control?
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:01.740]  Well, I think you're crazy
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:05.740]  I think you're crazy
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:10.740]  I think you're crazy
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.740]  Just like you
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:22.740]  My heroes had the heart to lose the lives I wanted
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:30.740]  And all I remember is thinking, I wanna be like this
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:38.740]  Mm-hmm, ever since I was little, ever since I was little, it looked like fun
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:43.740]  And there's no coincidence I've come
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:48.740]  And I can die when I'm done
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:53.740]  But maybe I'm crazy
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:57.740]  Maybe you're crazy
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:01.740]  Maybe we're crazy
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:06.740]  Probably
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.740]  Mm-hmm
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:15.740]  I can feel it
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.740]  Welcome back, all right, to your calls
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:22.740]  I'll just say this, though, that my heroes have always lived life out on a limb
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:28.740]  And I remember thinking, I wanna be like them
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.740]  And that's what it all comes down to, ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:37.740]  That, all right, let's just go to your calls here
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.740]  Where is that stupid call list here?
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.740]  Stacks of articles
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.740]  Richard in Texas, you're on the air, welcome
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.740]  Hello, Alex, just wanted to comment on, you know, what you were saying a minute ago
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:54.740]  About the, you know, increasing use of power by these megalomaniacs
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:58.740]  It also seems to me that there is a sort of a fear thing at work there
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:00.740]  In which, you know, these guys have got to figure
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.740]  If they don't continue to expand their control, their power
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.740]  And raise the level of fear that they'll actually go backwards and risk being exposed
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.740]  And, of course, the opposite is happening
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:13.740]  The opposite is happening, it's actually making everybody get mad
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.740]  Which then makes them accelerated
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.740]  And they're going towards a collision like two locomotives going 100 miles an hour apiece
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.740]  Yep, two quick things I wanted to mention
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:26.740]  Last night there was an excellent thing on Countdown Keith Olbermann's show
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.740]  Where he just absolutely ripped Giuliani
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:30.740]  No, we've got it, we're going to play it
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.740]  On his 9-11 hero stuff
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:35.740]  And by also ripping the president effectively
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:38.740]  As being elevated to heroes for such failures, you know
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.740]  Of preventing the attack
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.740]  And that was pretty interesting
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.740]  I'm also curious, after Bill Moyers' show last night
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:50.740]  Where he laid out all of the, you know, manipulation of video
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:53.740]  And the lies leading up to the Iraq war
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.740]  I know Bill Moyers is somewhat compromised, obviously
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:38:00.740]  By his involvement with, you know, the PBS broadcasting system
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.740]  And all of that and their sponsors
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:07.740]  But those two men also seem to have a pretty good amount of truth working for them
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.740]  And especially Olbermann keeps expanding forward
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:13.740]  I'm curious if you have any worthwhile comments on either of those two men
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:16.740]  It would be wonderful to see them move forward on 9-11
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.740]  Sure, I hear you and I appreciate your call
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:23.740]  I guarantee you that both the individuals you mentioned are all about 9-11
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.740]  I'm just going to leave it at that
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.740]  Also, I was out in LA, got in late Sunday night
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.740]  Or not late Sunday night, Sunday afternoon
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.740]  But late Sunday night I was watching
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.740]  Some new PBS special
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:39.740]  I forget the name, it's like a big series
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:41.740]  On surveillance in the police state
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.740]  And I thought this would be a whitewash
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.740]  They were admitting the whole floors of all the phone companies were surveilling everything
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.740]  They were admitting that everything is being listened to, it's a total grid
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.740]  They were admitting
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:54.740]  And then the next part in the series is supposedly
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:58.740]  Going to be about media propaganda
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.740]  So yeah, you must be talking about the same thing
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.740]  And so, yes
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.740]  Look, this is how it works
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:11.740]  You've got maybe 2% of people in high level media
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.740]  That are actual Defense Department, CIA
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:17.740]  Or a lot of times actual contractors from Lockheed Martin
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.740]  Or General Electric who were there
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.740]  I mean, they're above government agents
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.740]  They're actual corporate controllers
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.740]  They're all CFR members
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:27.740]  And again, even though CFR members aren't in the inner circle
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:28.740]  We know what's going on
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.740]  That's got several concentric layers to it
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.740]  And they have an agenda
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.740]  And everything is about what's good for the agenda
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:41.740]  And the interlocking interest of this global elite
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.740]  But yeah, most people
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:50.740]  Powerful people in government, in media, in banking
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:54.740]  A lot of them who aren't in the absolute A-list league
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.740]  But who you would think of as absolute ultra-rich
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.740]  People worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:01.740]  Are totally freaked out
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.740]  They're buying islands out of the country
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:04.740]  They hate what's happening
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:08.740]  They're quietly giving money to groups they think are fighting the New World Order
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:15.740]  I mean, it's not everybody in the elite that likes this
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:20.740]  But it's only the most wicked, most powerful that are in the seats of power
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.740]  And they're driving the agenda
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.740]  And then all these other people who know what's going on
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:25.740]  Have been afraid to speak up
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.740]  That's why it's important for us to hit the barbed wire
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.740]  That's why when Charlie Sheen hit it first
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.740]  At his level, it was a big deal
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.740]  I mean, he hit the barbed wire
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:38.740]  And then Ebersole and so many others
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:41.740]  Rosie O'Donnell, there's been a bunch of others
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.740]  James Brolin, they climbed up over his back
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:48.740]  And now more people are doing that
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:52.740]  And you've got to respect trailblazing
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.740]  And I mean, I respect trailblazing when it's evil trailblazing
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:56.740]  I don't like it, I don't agree with it
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.740]  But I respect it
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:00.740]  Well, I absolutely love and respect
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:04.740]  And just give all the adulation I can
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:06.740]  And all the support I can
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.740]  To people that trailblaze for good
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:14.740]  At great personal sacrifice and demonization in the media
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.740]  I mean, I was talking to David Lynch
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.740]  And I was like, you agreed to come on here
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.740]  Mr. Lynch, to talk about 9-11
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.740]  A few months ago
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.740]  We told you up front what the interview was
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:28.740]  And he said, yeah, but
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.740]  Basically, I'm afraid of what
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.740]  I shouldn't say basically, he said, listen, I'm afraid
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.740]  Look what they did to Charlie Sheen
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.740]  They put him through a ringer
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.740]  They smeared him, was the exact words
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.740]  And just, you know, what
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.740]  He kind of just fell back into the mantra
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.740]  We've just got to change ourselves individually
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:47.740]  Yeah, but we've also got to change ourselves individually
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.740]  But also then put that into action in the world around us
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:55.740]  Faith without works, my brother, is absolutely dead
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:58.740]  And I'm not getting into a Catholic Protestant argument here
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.740]  I'm non-denominational
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.740]  They always make it some type of factionalized
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.740]  The point is, is that, yes, you get the faith first
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.740]  To do the right thing
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.740]  But then you don't have the faith if you're not doing the works
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:11.740]  The works do come after the faith
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:13.740]  It is saved by grace
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:15.740]  But then if you're not doing the works, man, you're not saved
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:17.740]  Do you understand that?
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:19.740]  You're not a duck if you're not quacking and got little feet
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.740]  And paddled around in the pond
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.740]  Okay, you got a little beak
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:25.740]  You know, quack, quack
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.740]  You claim you're a duck, you're not a duck
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:29.740]  I mean, I can't control myself
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:31.740]  I want to fight evil
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.740]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about this
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.740]  And I don't understand how the rest of you
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.740]  Aren't completely focused like laser beams on this
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.740]  You know, here's an example
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.740]  The Loose Change crew calls up
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.740]  Six, seven, eight months ago
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.740]  And says, we want to use your fudge
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.740]  I go, use anything you want, it's all free
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.740]  They go, you don't want money, everybody else has for money
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.740]  I go, no, just use it
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.740]  You see?
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:56.740]  But then you try to get some nickel and dime locals
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.740]  To let you put something out
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.740]  They'll freak out and blame you for everything in the book
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.740]  And that you want some type of fame or something
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:06.740]  I mean, this is the way people operate
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:08.740]  You see, this is how you reap what you sow
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:12.740]  You see, I literally didn't care and said, use whatever you want
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.740]  Use whatever you want, please use it
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.740]  In your final cut
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.740]  And then later they come back to me and want me to be a consultant
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.740]  And they come back to me and want me to work with them
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.740]  And be involved, they're my friends
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.740]  And they're real people, they're not a bunch of backstabbing scum
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:26.740]  Neither is Luke Radowski and people like that
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.740]  You see, because they're doing it for the right reasons
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.740]  All they do is fly around for free around the country
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.740]  Until they're broke
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.740]  And giving out hundreds of thousands of free DVDs
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.740]  Believe me, I know, behind the scenes
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.740]  And we're doing some stuff together, I'm not going to tell you about it until later
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:44.740]  See, that's how that works, ladies and gentlemen
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.740]  You reap what you sow
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.740]  Do you understand that I'm putting it all in God's hands
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.740]  It's all in God's hands
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.740]  We could turn the New World Order over tomorrow
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:56.740]  If you'd stop being a bunch of self-serving, self-centered scum
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.740]  And you're damn right, excuse my French, excuse me
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.740]  But I'm just being myself these days
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.740]  You're absolutely right, I don't like people like that
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:08.740]  You're absolutely right, I'll get on the telephone and tell you you're a bunch of idiots
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.740]  Because I'm seriously on the front lines here
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:16.740]  I literally, you know, very rarely, but sometimes I get so much anxiety over this stuff
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.740]  I go throw up
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:22.740]  This is real, this isn't a game
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:24.740]  I'm the one that started this
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:26.740]  And I don't ask for anything
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.740]  But maybe a little bit of respect
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.740]  Just a little bit
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.740]  But you know what, I don't expect that
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:34.740]  I'm doing what I'm doing for my family
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:36.740]  So I don't care about all the scum out there
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.740]  Just get out of my way
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:42.740]  Just get out of my way
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.740]  All of it!
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.740]  Alright, I said I'd go to calls
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:56.740]  Rishi in Louisiana, you're on the air
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.740]  Alex, you have my utmost respect, sir
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:03.740]  Now, how's my friend Ed Brown doing in New Hampshire?
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.740]  Oh my God, that's in my stack
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:06.740]  See, I said I've got the stack
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.740]  They have sinaged him and his wife
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:09.740]  And we could have another Waco
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:10.740]  And I meant to tell my producer
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:12.740]  We are going to try to get Ed Brown on the show
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:14.740]  Very nice
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:17.740]  Can I send him something?
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:19.740]  Because what he is doing is
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.740]  Evoking the spirit that America should have
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.740]  Let me try to find the article
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:25.740]  Keep talking, I'll look for it
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:28.740]  And I admire him
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:30.740]  Because he has the courage that
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.740]  Most people should have
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.740]  He is an ordinary citizen
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.740]  And yet he's captured the attention of the nation
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:38.740]  Hopefully by now
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:41.740]  And I just think that it says a lot for this character
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.740]  And I want that to be known to the people
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.740]  No, it does, we've had him on the show before
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.740]  And I've concluded any unpleasantness
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.740]  With the network that he's involved with
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:50.740]  So I can have him on the show
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.740]  And I'm going to, where is it?
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:53.740]  I had it here in my stack
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.740]  This is the problem
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.740]  I mean, I've just got
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:59.740]  I'll reprint it if I have to
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:03.740]  Absolutely, Ed Brown up in New Hampshire
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:06.740]  And they're claiming he didn't pay taxes
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:08.740]  And they came and set him up
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:09.740]  It's a whole horrible sort of story
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:12.740]  And now they've sinaged him and his wife in absentia
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.740]  And they're going to come after him
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.740]  Well, I've seen the footage
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:18.740]  And he's obviously a patriot
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:20.740]  By every standard of what
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:22.740]  Our founding fathers would want it to be
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:25.740]  And I think Americans need to start realizing
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.740]  That fact very, very soon
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.740]  Because it's coming down to that point
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.740]  Absolutely, absolutely, my brother
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.740]  Good to hear from you
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:35.740]  And thank you for reminding me of that
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:36.740]  That's the type of stuff
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.740]  I literally have like 50-something articles
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.740]  And they're all that important
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740]  And one of them is Ed Brown
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:42.740]  And we're going to watch that as it develops
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:43.740]  And we're going to get him on very soon
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:46.740]  And get him some support
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:49.740]  Or the enemy comes like a thief in the night, don't they?
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.740]  Because he counterfeits everything God does
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.740]  Who knows when they'll hit him
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:56.740]  Let's talk to Sue in PA
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:58.740]  You're on the air, go ahead
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:59.740]  Yeah, hey Alex
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.740]  It's great to finally speak to you
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:04.740]  I'm a paleoconservative, I guess
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:06.740]  Like you mentioned that you were
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:08.740]  And I got a traditional kind of background
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.740]  And I definitely know what the system does to people
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.740]  Because 20 years ago I was part of the rescue movement
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:15.740]  And you know, what the system will do to you
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:16.740]  If you stand up for truth
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:19.740]  Well they'll charge you as a mafia gangster
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.740]  For standing
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.740]  I was charged with RICO too, yeah
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:26.740]  But what I want to say about 9-11
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.740]  Is I've been with you for about three years on this
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.740]  I've known all about it
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:32.740]  I hate to admit I haven't had the courage
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:34.740]  To come out until lately
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:36.740]  Because everybody I associate with
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.740]  All my friends, it's kind of like
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.740]  Traditionally minded people
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:43.740]  Just won't open up
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.740]  To, I don't know, it's like they're being co-opted
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.740]  By Fox News or something
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:50.740]  I really can't put my finger on it
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.740]  But, um
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:53.740]  Oh no, they've been co-opted
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.740]  Why don't you get the articles about
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:57.740]  Fox News being behind Hillary for them
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:59.740]  Well, you know what
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.740]  It's really hard to
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:03.740]  It's like there has to be some kind of epiphany
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.740]  That they need to have
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:07.740]  It took a lot for me to like
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.740]  Go to like
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.740]  Save Rosie
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.740]  I mean, I find those things
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.740]  Because, you know, in a lot of ways
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.740]  I'm really the antithesis of what she's about
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.740]  Me too, me too
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:20.740]  But if they take her free speech away
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:21.740]  They're going to take ours
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:22.740]  Absolutely
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:24.740]  So I signed up for the website
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.740]  And the next time I turned on The View
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.740]  She's about gun control
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:30.740]  So I'm kind of like screwed up
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:32.740]  I'm not convincing
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:33.740]  Here's the deal
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.740]  She's silly and ignorant on a lot of issues
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.740]  But she's changing, she's coming over
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:39.740]  On a lot of issues
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.740]  She's plugging John Connor, who's, you know, anti-abortion
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:43.740]  And she knows what our views are
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:45.740]  And she still supports us
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.740]  And so, yeah, right after the shooting
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:48.740]  Rosie's saying, see, I'm right
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.740]  See, she doesn't understand everything
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:52.740]  She's not going to be perfect
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:53.740]  I disagree with her on a lot of things
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:54.740]  And I understand that
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:56.740]  But you were saying you supported her free speech right
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:58.740]  Absolutely, and I do
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:48:59.740]  But I can't
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.740]  I'm not changing hearts and minds
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:03.740]  With Rosie, with the people
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:05.740]  That I've kind of been associated with
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.740]  And my family and stuff
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:09.740]  Well, no, that's why the media kind of likes her
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:11.740]  They think it will continue vulcanizing
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.740]  That's why they ignore all the conservatives that have gone public
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:15.740]  But as long as it gets people talking
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.740]  That's the key
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.740]  Right, right
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.740]  Well, that's really the only comment I had to make
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.740]  And, you know, I think, you know, you're awesome
[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:23.740]  Well, thank you, you're awesome too
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.740]  Yeah, I mean, don't think a government that's authorized
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.740]  The abortion of 50 million children
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:29.740]  Won't kill 3,000
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:31.740]  And, again, some idiot had a website going
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.740]  Alex Jones lies
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.740]  One show he said 47 million
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.740]  Another show he said 50 million
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:39.740]  I don't know, like five years ago it was 47 million
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:41.740]  I don't know what it is
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:43.740]  I'm just guessing it's been 50 million
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.740]  That's the kind of lies you'll catch me in
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.740]  I'm guesstimating, I don't know
[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:49.740]  I mean, 10 million kids have been killed
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.740]  We know it's over 45 million
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:53.740]  Like I said, people nitpick me on that
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:55.740]  I would guess it's well over 50 million
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.740]  Now
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:49:59.740]  Regardless, I mean, Stalin killed 50
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.740]  He killed 60
[01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:03.740]  Mao killed 45 or 60
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.740]  The Chinese government says 60
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.740]  And they say what he did was good, by the way
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.740]  Now, that's official Chinese government books
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:11.740]  Put out
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.740]  On the subject
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.740]  I mean, you know, I get all these emails
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.740]  Going, you're making it up, there's no North American Union
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.740]  You're making it up, there's no
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:21.740]  I mean, I don't know how people out there are living in denial
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.740]  How can you deny it?
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:25.740]  By the way, we've got Lou Dobbs
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:27.740]  And the North American Union coming up
[01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:29.740]  We've got Jon Stewart coming up
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.740]  With that Keith Olbermann clip coming up
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:33.740]  We've done the Rosie and the They Live clip
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:35.740]  But I will play at least part of those three clips
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.740]  In the next hour
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:39.740]  When we get back, though, I'm going to talk to Trent and Chris and others
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:41.740]  And continue with your phone calls
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:43.740]  I do have the brown news
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.740]  It's up on prisonplanet.com
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.740]  I know that
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:49.740]  Look, folks, I'm getting so busy on this show now
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:51.740]  So focused on what's happening, I'm not even plugging my videos
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:53.740]  That much anymore
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.740]  And that's how we fund this whole thing
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:57.740]  I'll take 30 seconds here
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.740]  I've got a website, infowars.com
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:01.740]  It's got a secure online video and bookstore shopping cart
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:03.740]  It's got all my films and dozens and dozens
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.740]  Other films and books
[01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:07.740]  And it's great stuff, really, to inform you
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:09.740]  And you can make copies of my films
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:11.740]  Get them out to people
[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:13.740]  And that's how you support us so we can operate here
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:15.740]  And you're not going to find anybody more committed
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:17.740]  You're not going to find anybody with their hair more on fire
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:19.740]  And it's us, ladies and gentlemen
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.740]  And we'd like you to support us in the fight
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:23.740]  Infowars.com
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.740]  You missed it, I'll give you the toll free number when we get back
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:27.740]  And go back to your calls, stay with us
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:35.740]  It's here, after a year in production
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.740]  And traveling to distant lands
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:39.740]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:41.740]  Shocking declassified government documents
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.740]  Prove that western governments are orchestrating
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:45.740]  Terror attacks against their own populations
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:47.740]  As a pretext to enslave them
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:51.740]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.740]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British Intelligence
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:59.740]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.740]  A White House program to disseminate fake news
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:03.740]  NSA spying
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:05.740]  Secret police torture
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:07.740]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:11.740]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:13.740]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:17.740]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see

[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.740]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:39.740]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:41.740]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:43.740]  And others are absorbed through the skin
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:47.740]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:51.740]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:55.740]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:01.740]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:08.740]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:09.740]  What about you?
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:10.740]  What about you?

[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:29.740]  Alright, again Vito Valenti joining us coming up at the 8 after
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:32.740]  We'll go ahead and go to some of your calls from then on
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:35.740]  From this point on until we get to that point
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:38.740]  Brent in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:40.740]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call
[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:42.740]  Thanks for calling, what's on your mind?
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:47.740]  I just wanted to take the time to expose someone named Dennis Kucinich
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.740]  This individual is drafting legislation to impeach Dick Cheney
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:53.740]  Which is definitely a good thing in my opinion
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:57.740]  But hidden deep within the bowels of his profile
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:02.740]  Is the fact that he's also drafting legislation to completely ban handguns in the United States
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:11.740]  Yeah, we actually, Paul Watson last week did a big article about Kucinich, I believe the headline is Kucinich traitor to ban guns
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:17.740]  And Kucinich is right on weather control, right on 9-11, right on the war
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.740]  But no, he is an absolute complete communist
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:26.740]  And that's the thing, they're just as bad as Bush and the Trotskyite New World Order people
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.740]  He wants a total handgun ban
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:37.740]  And that is treason, I mean anybody, listen if I was president, I would call for him to be investigated and arrested
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.740]  And I'll tell you why, it's not free speech folks
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:45.740]  You start calling for abolishing, I believe Bush would be arrested for his attacks on the 4th amendment and the 1st amendment
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:49.740]  And all of it, and I'm telling you that's what you, because here's the deal, he's in government
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:55.740]  A citizen could call for gun bans, that piece of filth, and I'm not attacking Kucinich right now on air
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:58:02.740]  Kucinich is a congressman who swore an oath, he now represents the people and it's high treason, go ahead
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:09.740]  Well he just says how he's protecting the constitution, but I mean he really is just lying because he's trying to tear it apart
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:14.740]  I think he should be arrested and tried on treason charges
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:17.740]  It's just amazing like what angles they're hitting us from
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:20.740]  And it's hard because the average people, I don't know if they're doing their education
[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:24.740]  Hey look, it's simple, it's simple, you come right out and say abolish one of the 10 amendments
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:31.740]  And you are a high level federal official, you get indicted for treason, it's real simple
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:39.740]  Believe me folks, if somebody in government in say 1805 called for gun bans, they would be arrested
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:45.740]  Exactly, I don't know what happened to real Americans and that's really my only comment
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:47.740]  So watch out for Dennis Kucinich, that guy's evil
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:51.740]  Oh watch out for all of them, Hillary, that whole crowd of scum
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:56.740]  Let me just tell all the fake liberals out there and the fake conservatives, I hate all of you, okay
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:00.740]  I hate you, because you're ignorant fools, okay
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:06.740]  You all work for the same people, either become patriots and come in for the big win or get out of my way

[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:36.740]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups

[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:12.740]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number 3
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:17.740]  Did Trent ever finish? He brought up a point after rambling, is Trent still there or is he gone?
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:19.740]  He's gone, okay, thank you Trent
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:21.740]  Chris, where are you calling us from today?
[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:27.740]  Sounds like an exciting place, Chris
[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:30.740]  Who's up next after Chris?
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:32.740]  Stuart, New York, you're on the air, welcome
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:36.740]  Hi Alex, getting back to Rosie and her gun issue
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:43.740]  Is it possible that when you talk to her, you can make her realize that the same people who pulled off 9-11
[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:48.740]  Are the same people who are looking to take away the guns, it's a very close nexus
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:55.740]  And in doing that, do you think that would alienate her from those people who are supporting her?
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:00.740]  Well look, Rosie isn't perfect, but I've analyzed what she's doing, I've talked to people that know her well
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:06.740]  I've had a few communications, and the bottom line is, Rosie O'Donnell is learning the truth
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.740]  She's waking up, she's never called for a total gun ban, just all this registration bull
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:15.740]  And so I don't say she's a traitor because she's ignorant
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:21.740]  Because she knows exactly what he's doing and he called for a total gun ban, a ban
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:27.740]  And yes, I don't like her on the second amendment, I don't like her on a bunch of issues
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.740]  But I'm telling you, she is waking up to the bigger world right now
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:35.740]  Well I certainly hope she makes the jump to the pro-gun issue
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:41.740]  She may never because of the incredible peer pressure, and past fights, but she could
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:46.740]  I mean look, Hanalei Jane came out and said she was a born-again Christian, remember that?
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:48.740]  Oh, very well
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:51.740]  And then of course the neo-cons still scorned her because they, you know
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:56.740]  They don't like people repenting or saying they were wrong, they don't like that, they know
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:03:03.740]  The logical choice for her would be to come over to the pro-gun side only because
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:08.740]  Who are you going to turn to if the new world order is doing what they're doing?
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:11.740]  Well see, all the liberals I know aren't mainline liberals anymore, they figured that out
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:15.740]  They're out buying guns, they're at the shooting range, and they go
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:18.740]  And they say, I understand now, this is about security
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:23.740]  I understand we're going into a fascist dictatorship, now I understand what you always talk about
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.740]  Believe me man, there's a major change happening
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:31.740]  The main problem is these fake conservatives, they're almost impossible to reach
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:37.740]  Well I certainly hope that when you do get her on your show, you can put a bug in her regarding that
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:41.740]  Ah, we'll see, it's really hard to get her on programs, I found out she doesn't do a lot of interviews, so
[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:44.740]  Okay, thank you for everything you do Alex
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:47.740]  Thank you, thank you, I really appreciate you
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:54.740]  Um, let's go ahead and take another call here, who's after the last caller?
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.740]  Kenny and KC, go ahead Kenny
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:04.740]  I don't know what's going on, but we'll take your call Kenny if you're ready
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:08.740]  You know what, it's too close to break, when it rains it pours and the callers are all
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:11.740]  Off playing hopscotch or tiddlywinks so
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:16.740]  We will just go to our guest after this quick break
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:21.740]  Vito Valente, one of the first responders
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:27.740]  And we will be going over that with him when he joins us coming up in the next segment
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:31.740]  Honored to have him, and he's going to be on The View tomorrow
[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:34.740]  It was going to be last week, but the shooting happened, so they got cancelled
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:39.740]  So they taped it Wednesday, they were live today
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:45.740]  Oh, that was the point that has to be added to the Paul Watson article
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:48.740]  I kept knowing there was something I was forgetting, it was the key to the whole deal
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:52.740]  I got a call from Paul Watson, I know he just wrote an article about Rosie
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:54.740]  And put the key in it about William Rodriguez
[02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:56.740]  It's that she tried to talk about William Rodriguez today
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:02.740]  When it was live, and all of them jumped on her and wouldn't let her say his name
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:06.740]  Literally talked over her and there may have been some on the fly editing
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:08.740]  As they delay it by ten seconds, now that was the key
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.740]  She tried to talk about Rodriguez and we can now talk about that
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:16.740]  About how she's been wanting to have him on the show and was blocked by the sniveling neocon
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:18.740]  So there was the big development there
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:21.740]  We're going to talk to Vito Valente on the other side, stay with me
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:34.740]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:36.740]  My new film Terror Storm is complete
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:41.740]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:44.740]  Against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them

[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.740]  I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:36.740]  If your nails look dark or discolored
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:38.740]  Now there's a solution besides hiding them
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:41.740]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X

[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:58.740]  We are now about eight and a half minutes into this third hour
[02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:02.740]  I want to get him and other first responders and survivors on
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:06.740]  For a full hour sometime and have two or three of these great Americans on with us
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.740]  But we just got him for this segment, very, very busy
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:13.740]  And he's Vito Valente
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:16.740]  I hope I was mispronouncing his Valente
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:18.740]  And I got a CBS News article here
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:21.740]  11 first responders were dead men walking years after attacks
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:24.740]  Many face reality, death may be near
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:26.740]  He has to be on a breathing machine
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:28.740]  I've interviewed in New York in person these guys
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:30.740]  Where I've seen them coughing up blood, folks
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:32.740]  I mean blood pouring out of them
[02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:33.740]  I don't mean to get into details here
[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:36.740]  But where they're coughing and you see the handkerchief
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:39.740]  Literally covered with gobs of blood
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:41.740]  I mean, this is real, folks
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.740]  When they can't hardly walk upstairs
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.740]  They've got breathing machines, oxygen machines
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:47.740]  They're literally coughing their lungs up
[02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:49.740]  And I'm talking to Corey Rove
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:50.740]  I don't even know if I'm supposed to talk about this
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:52.740]  Who made a loose change
[02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:54.740]  He's coughing up blood almost every day
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:57.740]  Friends, do you folks, he knows what it is
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:00.740]  This is your stinking, this is the stinking people
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:03.740]  That run this country
[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:06.740]  They are absolute scum
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:10.740]  And we need to financially help Vito Valente
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:12.740]  And all of these people
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:16.740]  CBS2 spoke to many who now say they are dead men walking
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:19.740]  First responders charged towards ground zero
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:20.740]  On the morning of 9-11
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:21.740]  United in their mission
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:22.740]  I saw the second plane hit
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:23.740]  Both towers come down
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:24.740]  Vito Valente said
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:27.740]  I went from day to day, day to night
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:28.740]  When things are at their very worst
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:30.740]  It's when you are at your very best
[02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:32.740]  Said Mike McCormick, we've interviewed many times
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.740]  Said it subsequently changed my life forever
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:37.740]  And joining us is Vito Valente
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.740]  Valente who's going to be on The View tomorrow
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:40.740]  He taped it yesterday
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:41.740]  Unless they edited it out
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:42.740]  As they really had to leave
[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:43.740]  Because they've been editing everything
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:44.740]  Vito, thanks for coming on
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:46.740]  Thank you so much
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:48.740]  Tell us in a nutshell what you did
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.740]  How you responded
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:50.740]  And what's happened to you
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:53.740]  Well, I was down there at 9-11
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:56.740]  I was down there, I was at 125 Barkley
[02:10:56.740 --> 02:10:58.740]  And I was in my office
[02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:02.740]  I was a grievance rep for the Board of Education
[02:11:02.740 --> 02:11:04.740]  Local 372, District Council 37
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:07.740]  And basically, I was down there that morning
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:10.740]  I seen the second plane hit
[02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:12.740]  Both towers came down
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:15.740]  I got hit with that toxic cloud
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:17.740]  I did search and rescue
[02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:19.740]  I volunteered
[02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:21.740]  I did search and rescue
[02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:23.740]  Did the bucket brigade
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.740]  Helped with medical equipment
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:28.740]  The whole thing
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:31.740]  I've seen all these bodies
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:33.740]  The bodies falling
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:35.740]  Body parts
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:37.740]  I removed body parts
[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:39.740]  Picked up body parts
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.740]  Picked up body parts
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:43.740]  Did everything
[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:46.740]  I was down there for two days
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:50.740]  Inhaled all those toxic fumes
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:55.740]  And now, later on, I'm diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:58.740]  What Officer Cesar Borgia died of
[02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:00.740]  I need a double lung transplant
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:04.740]  I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:06.740]  I have lesions on my leg
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.740]  Gird restricted airway
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:10.740]  I'm not able to sleep at night
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:13.740]  Now see, as soon as these problems came up six months after
[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:15.740]  Turns out, of course, they knew and covered it up
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.740]  They should have immediately given first dibs
[02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:19.740]  Thousands of people die a week
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:22.740]  Lungs, a lot of time to get thrown in the trash
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:25.740]  And you guys could have all gotten new lungs
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:26.740]  And it could have been paid for
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:27.740]  That's right, yeah
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:28.740]  I mean, when we were down there
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:31.740]  We didn't have no
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:33.740]  They didn't give us no respirators
[02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:34.740]  They didn't give us nothing at all
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:37.740]  I mean, all I had was an orange vest
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:39.740]  That they gave us, a little mesh vest
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.740]  That's all they gave us
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.740]  And, you know, I mean
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:46.740]  Now I'm really suffering
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:48.740]  You know, I haven't been able to sleep
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.740]  I'm on oxygen
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:53.740]  I take like 23, 24 pills a day
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:54.740]  Every day
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:56.740]  I haven't been able to lay down in a bed
[02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:58.740]  Laying down for almost four years now
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:02.740]  I sleep in a chair in the living room sleeping up
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:04.740]  Because I can't lay down
[02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:06.740]  I have lesions on my leg
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:08.740]  My leg is completely swollen
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:10.740]  My heart's enlarged now
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:13.740]  And I'm not even on a transplant list yet
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:19.740]  Also, you know, I'm the secretary for the Feel Good Foundation
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:21.740]  It's a foundation that helps
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:25.740]  We help and assist 9-11 responders that are sick
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.740]  And, you know, while I'm battling my illness
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:30.740]  I'm out, you know, I'm concentrating
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.740]  There's no more about me now
[02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:34.740]  I want to help other responders
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.740]  And, of course, that's named after John Feel, another first responder
[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:37.740]  John Feel, yes
[02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:38.740]  John Feel is the president
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:40.740]  I'm the secretary of the foundation
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:42.740]  And, you know, John
[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:45.740]  When everybody else wasn't there for me
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:49.740]  This foundation, the Feel Good Foundation
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:52.740]  They were the only ones that were there for me
[02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:54.740]  And they came to my house
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.740]  I wrote to everybody for help
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:59.740]  And my own job, Local 372, abandoned me
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:01.740]  They haven't called me even till this day
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:05.740]  My job, we represented the board of education
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:08.740]  The city of New York, school aides, cafeteria workers
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:09.740]  They didn't bother
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:12.740]  The only ones that really helped me was my colleagues
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:14.740]  All the president and all the vice-presidents
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:16.740]  And I worked with the vice-president down there
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.740]  We did it together, ground zero
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:20.740]  And they didn't even bother
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:21.740]  He was standing by me
[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:23.740]  And when I was down and out
[02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:25.740]  The Feel Good Foundation was the only ones that were there
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:28.740]  And they came, they helped me with food
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:30.740]  They helped me and my family
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:31.740]  Well, there's plenty of lungs
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:34.740]  And they could easily get the thousand or so people
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:35.740]  That have really bad damage
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:37.740]  Oh, yes, but without a doubt
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:38.740]  They don't want to pay for it
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:39.740]  They just don't care
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:40.740]  They don't care
[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:42.740]  The government needs to do
[02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:45.740]  We know the government is not doing nothing
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.740]  There's a lot of firemen
[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:49.740]  There's a lot of police officers
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:51.740]  That are coming down with cancer
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:52.740]  Different cancers
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:53.740]  That they're not getting the treatment
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:55.740]  And they also, sure
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:58.740]  I mean, they know that this was happening
[02:14:58.740 --> 02:14:59.740]  They knew this was happening
[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:01.740]  Why do you think that the government
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:03.740]  Ordered Christina Todd Whitman to cover up
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:04.740]  How deadly that dust was?
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:06.740]  I don't, I really don't know
[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:07.740]  I really don't know
[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:09.740]  But all I can tell you is
[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:12.740]  Is that we need the responders out there
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:13.740]  Including myself
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:15.740]  There's too many lives that have been lost
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:18.740]  And like I said yesterday on The View
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:19.740]  I taped The View
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:21.740]  And it's going to be here tomorrow
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.740]  You know, like I told Rosie and Joy
[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:24.740]  I said, you know what, enough is enough
[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:26.740]  We need to, we need to stand up
[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:28.740]  And let the government know
[02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:30.740]  You know, the government's spending
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:32.740]  Too much money on nonsense things
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:34.740]  I mean, the president is spending
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:36.740]  So much money on this war
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:39.740]  I mean, they should be concentrating on us
[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:40.740]  Worry about what's in our role
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:43.740]  Well, I will add one more point
[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:44.740]  I did tell Rosie
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:46.740]  And this was three, four weeks ago
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:47.740]  Through Ebersol
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:48.740]  When they were on vacation together in Miami
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:49.740]  I said, tell her tonight
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:50.740]  When you meet with her
[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:52.740]  Tell her, have first responders on
[02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:54.740]  Expose that
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:55.740]  Because you know Rosie was being attacked
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:56.740]  For her other statements
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:57.740]  Oh yeah, well
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:58.740]  And see if they can attack you
[02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:00.740]  For defending the first responders
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:01.740]  Exactly
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:02.740]  Well, that's what she did
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:03.740]  And I tell you when
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:05.740]  I was on The View yesterday
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:07.740]  And I was telling my story
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:09.740]  And I was on, also on with Bonnie Giffried
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:11.740]  She's another, she was an EMS worker
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:12.740]  She was there with me
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:16.740]  And also in the audience was Alex Sanchez
[02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:19.740]  And Dr. Jacqueline Moline from Mount Sinai
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:21.740]  When I was telling my story to her
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.740]  She came out and Rosie says
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:25.740]  And I also hear something is wrong with your leg
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:27.740]  So when I picked up my leg
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:28.740]  And I showed her how swollen
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.740]  I mean, the whole audience just was
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:33.740]  They gasped with frustration
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:34.740]  My leg was so swollen
[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:35.740]  And Rosie says, my God
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:37.740]  And she actually started crying
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:40.740]  I mean, she started, tears started coming out
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:41.740]  She just hugged me
[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:42.740]  And she told the audience
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:43.740]  She said, you see
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.740]  This is what the government is doing
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:47.740]  They're not doing nothing for these responders
[02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:48.740]  They were here for us
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:50.740]  Now we have to be here for them
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:52.740]  You know, we're like the Vietnam veterans
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:54.740]  We're like the forgotten people
[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:55.740]  And enough is enough
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:57.740]  You know, how many more lives have to be lost
[02:16:57.740 --> 02:17:00.740]  What is it like, what is it like for you, sir
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:02.740]  To, well, I mean, let me ask you this
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:04.740]  What is it like for you, Vito
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:08.740]  To see the President and the Democrats as well
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.740]  Giuliani, all of them
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:12.740]  Wrap themselves in the American flag
[02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:13.740]  And use your names every day
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:15.740]  To call themselves heroes
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:16.740]  It's a disgrace
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:17.740]  It's a disgrace
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.740]  It's a disgrace
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:19.740]  It's a disgrace
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:20.740]  It's a disgrace
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:23.740]  How this government is treating us
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:24.740]  And how the President
[02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:26.740]  The President hasn't done nothing
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.740]  I mean, hasn't done nothing for us
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:29.740]  What has Giuliani done?
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:31.740]  Giuliani has not done nothing
[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:34.740]  And he's using his name
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:37.740]  And his run for the President
[02:17:37.740 --> 02:17:39.740]  You know, he's using 9-11
[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:40.740]  As, oh yeah, I was the mayor
[02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:41.740]  And I was down there
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:43.740]  What is he doing for us?
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.740]  He hasn't done nothing for us
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:46.740]  I mean, the government
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:47.740]  The President
[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:48.740]  The President shows up
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:50.740]  What's the President done?
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:52.740]  We've written so many letters
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:54.740]  To have the President meet with all of us
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:56.740]  He still hasn't met with us
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:57.740]  He's done
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:58.740]  He's already used your name
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:17:59.740]  He's already got your name
[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:00.740]  Yeah
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:01.740]  I mean, you know, he's
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.740]  I mean, myself
[02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:05.740]  Using myself as an example
[02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:07.740]  My condition is
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:08.740]  I have pulmonary fibrosis
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:10.740]  The life expectancy
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.740]  Is no more than five
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:13.740]  Maybe five and a half years
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:15.740]  And that was from my doctor coming
[02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:17.740]  On national TV and saying this
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:18.740]  And I was already
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:21.740]  Well, they've already had all these big top institutes
[02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:22.740]  And top hospitals
[02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:23.740]  Three years ago
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:24.740]  Do the scans in your lungs
[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:25.740]  Exactly
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:26.740]  Are full of glass and concrete
[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:27.740]  And asbestos
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:29.740]  I tell you, when that cloud hit me
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:31.740]  You know, we had crushed concrete
[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:33.740]  Glass, body parts, jet fuel
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:36.740]  Asbestos, lead, zinc
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:38.740]  All these different toxins
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:39.740]  Mercury
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:40.740]  Mercury
[02:18:40.740 --> 02:18:41.740]  Mercury
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:42.740]  That's in all the thermostats
[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:43.740]  Exactly
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:44.740]  And then, you know, you get
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:45.740]  You know, Chrissy Todd-Whitman
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:46.740]  To turn around and say
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:48.740]  Oh, the air quality was good
[02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:49.740]  You know, it's all right
[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:50.740]  Come on back
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:52.740]  Well, how can the air quality be good?
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:53.740]  It couldn't have been
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:54.740]  That toxic cloud didn't just
[02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:55.740]  Hang over ground zero
[02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:56.740]  It traveled
[02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:57.740]  Well, we know
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:18:58.740]  It went
[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:00.740]  It even blew across the river
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:01.740]  To the others
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:02.740]  Exactly
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:03.740]  It went to Jersey
[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:04.740]  Brooklyn
[02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:05.740]  Queens
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:06.740]  I mean, it's
[02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:08.740]  You know, and a lot of people are suffering
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:10.740]  You know, I get calls every day
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:11.740]  You know, I get
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:13.740]  I got a call from a responder
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:14.740]  Out in Florida
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:17.740]  He was the property manager
[02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:18.740]  He was the property manager
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:20.740]  For World Trade Centers
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:22.740]  And they're not even doing none for him
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:24.740]  But my foundation
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:25.740]  We helped him
[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:26.740]  And we're helping him
[02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:28.740]  We're helping him through medical care
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:31.740]  I mean, we had him flown up here
[02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:33.740]  To register with Mount Sinai
[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:35.740]  I even put him up at my house
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:36.740]  How's Mike McCormick doing?
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:37.740]  I know he's really sick
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:38.740]  Mike is doing good
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:39.740]  Mike is, you know
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:40.740]  He's hanging in there
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:42.740]  You know, I mean
[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:43.740]  We're all
[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:44.740]  We're all a team
[02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:45.740]  We know we're all hanging in there
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.740]  We're trying to do the best we can
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:49.740]  John, with his illness
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:52.740]  Now, of course, you know about all the police harassment
[02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:53.740]  And he was a big hero
[02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:54.740]  Found the American flag
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:55.740]  Was up there with the boys
[02:19:55.740 --> 02:19:56.740]  As soon as we spoke out
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:58.740]  Boy, the cops started coming after him
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:19:59.740]  Well, you know what?
[02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:01.740]  Because they don't want to hear the truth
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:03.740]  You know, I mean, to me, he's a hero
[02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:05.740]  He found the American
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:07.740]  He's the one that found the American flag
[02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:09.740]  But see, they like their bosses
[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:10.740]  Who poison them
[02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:11.740]  And then they'll help them
[02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:13.740]  I mean, that's like a dog
[02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:14.740]  You beat in the head
[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:15.740]  And it still loves you
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:16.740]  It's like a dog you beat every day
[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:17.740]  For no reason
[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:18.740]  And it still loves you
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:19.740]  I mean, that is pathetic
[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:20.740]  Stay there, one more segment
[02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:21.740]  I want to talk about
[02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:22.740]  How people can support you
[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:24.740]  And help other first responders, Vito
[02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:29.740]  The Berkey Security Pack
[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:31.740]  Is your one-stop solution

[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.740]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources
[02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:31.740]  Are you tired of watching
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:33.740]  Your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:35.740]  As government spending is out of hand
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:36.740]  And the Federal Reserve is creating
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:39.740]  In excess of $20 billion a week?
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:40.740]  Are you tired of stockbrokers
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:42.740]  Gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:43.740]  Is this market a setup
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:45.740]  For a crash greater than 1987?
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:47.740]  Too many of today's policies
[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:48.740]  Resemble those that led
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:50.740]  To the collapse of 1929
[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:52.740]  How much are you willing to lose?

[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:00.740]  A financial catastrophe
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:02.740]  Of biblical proportion
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:03.740]  Over recent decades
[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:04.740]  Numerous economic systems
[02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:05.740]  Have failed
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:06.740]  Current Federal Reserve policy
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:08.740]  And uncontrolled government spending
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:09.740]  Have set the stage
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:10.740]  For the United States
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:12.740]  To be the next target
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:13.740]  Secure your assets today
[02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:18.740]  By calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129
[02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:20.740]  Do this or paper can still buy gold
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:21.740]  Call me, John Huebner
[02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:26.740]  At 1-800-686-2237 extension 129
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:30.740]  Did you ever wonder
[02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:31.740]  How an opera singer
[02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:32.740]  That hits a high note
[02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:33.740]  Is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:34.740]  Well, the glass has
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:35.740]  A natural resonance
[02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:36.740]  If the resonant frequency force
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:37.740]  Making the glass vibrate
[02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:38.740]  Is big enough
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:39.740]  The size of the vibration
[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:40.740]  Will become so large
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:41.740]  That the glass shatters
[02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:42.740]  Using a similar principle
[02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:44.740]  Royal Raymond Rife discovered
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:45.740]  That disease organisms
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:46.740]  Can be destroyed
[02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:48.740]  Using different resonant frequencies
[02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:50.740]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.740]  Uses the same technology
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:53.740]  For relief for elimination
[02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:54.740]  Of pain and disease conditions

[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:47.740]  And I thought about this
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:48.740]  And I remember exactly who said it
[02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:49.740]  Mark Quarantine
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:51.740]  Was on this network at the time
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:52.740]  And Mark said
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:54.740]  Listen, that dust is highly toxic
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:57.740]  Full of all this asbestos and chemicals
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:00.740]  Don't send money, don't send food

[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:08.740]  And I had the biggest show on the network then
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:09.740]  Still do
[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:10.740]  So we sent
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:12.740]  I know, just a mass load
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:13.740]  To some of the local churches
[02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:14.740]  That were smart enough
[02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:15.740]  So within a week
[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:16.740]  We had stuff going
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:17.740]  To the first responders
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:18.740]  And for days
[02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:19.740]  They were just like
[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:20.740]  Oh the air is safe
[02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:21.740]  Breathe it, it's fun
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:22.740]  It's fun
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:24.740]  But I mean even people on this network knew
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:25.740]  It was deadly
[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:26.740]  Exactly
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:27.740]  I mean
[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:28.740]  I mean
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:29.740]  It's
[02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:30.740]  You know
[02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:32.740]  You had to be there
[02:27:32.740 --> 02:27:33.740]  You know what the news
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:36.740]  And what everybody said on TV and the papers
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:38.740]  It's nothing like you can't compare
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:39.740]  To what you
[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:40.740]  What I've seen
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.740]  Now by the way
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:42.740]  Giuliani was down there within hours
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:43.740]  And he was wearing a mask
[02:27:43.740 --> 02:27:44.740]  Oh yeah
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:45.740]  He was wearing a mask
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:46.740]  Exactly
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:47.740]  And you know
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:49.740]  And they didn't give us nothing
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:50.740]  And you know
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:51.740]  And his own
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:52.740]  His own guy
[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:53.740]  His own
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:54.740]  One of his own people
[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:55.740]  Washington
[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:56.740]  The guy I believe
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:27:57.740]  His name is John
[02:27:57.740 --> 02:27:58.740]  Washington
[02:27:58.740 --> 02:27:59.740]  He came down
[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:00.740]  He's sick now
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:01.740]  Well the EPA
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:02.740]  The EPA literally
[02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:03.740]  Came down though
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:04.740]  Within a day
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:05.740]  In space suits
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:06.740]  Oh yeah
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:07.740]  I mean
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:08.740]  They were in full body suits
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:09.740]  Did you see those
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:10.740]  Ever seen phones
[02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:11.740]  Yeah
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:12.740]  I mean
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:13.740]  They came down
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:14.740]  I mean
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:15.740]  The whole scene
[02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:16.740]  They were
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:17.740]  I mean
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:18.740]  All the government officials
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:19.740]  That were there
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:20.740]  They didn't give us
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:21.740]  They didn't give us
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:22.740]  But meanwhile
[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:23.740]  They're telling you
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:24.740]  Everything's fine
[02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:25.740]  But everything
[02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:26.740]  Yeah exactly
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:27.740]  And open up schools
[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:28.740]  200 yards away
[02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:29.740]  Everything's fine
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:30.740]  Well
[02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:31.740]  Stuyvesant High School
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:32.740]  That was right there
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:33.740]  Instead of evacuating
[02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:34.740]  The children
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:35.740]  They told everybody
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:36.740]  Come on back
[02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:37.740]  Into the school
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:38.740]  The principal says
[02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:39.740]  Every time
[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:40.740]  While they're
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:41.740]  While they're wearing
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:42.740]  Space suits
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:43.740]  Again this just proves it
[02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:44.740]  Exactly
[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:45.740]  Now any other tidbits
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:46.740]  Of what we're gonna see
[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:47.740]  Tomorrow
[02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:48.740]  Any fireworks
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:49.740]  No
[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:50.740]  You're gonna see
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:51.740]  Myself
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:52.740]  And Bonnie
[02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:53.740]  She's an EMS worker
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:54.740]  She was there
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:55.740]  On stage with us
[02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:56.740]  It was me and her
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:57.740]  With Joy
[02:28:57.740 --> 02:28:58.740]  And Rosie
[02:28:58.740 --> 02:28:59.740]  And in the audience
[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:02.740]  We had another responder
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:04.740]  Alex Sanchez
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:05.740]  And Dr.
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:06.740]  What about
[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:07.740]  What about the question
[02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:08.740]  Of the government
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:10.740]  Letting 9-11 happen
[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:11.740]  Or government involvement
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:12.740]  Or how building 7
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:13.740]  Fell down
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:14.740]  Did you guys have any
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:15.740]  Questions when that happened
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:16.740]  How 7 fell
[02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:17.740]  No
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:18.740]  Do you now
[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:19.740]  Have any questions
[02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:20.740]  No
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:21.740]  No
[02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:22.740]  Nothing
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:23.740]  I have nothing
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:24.740]  Nothing really to say
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:25.740]  On that
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:26.740]  I know but I'm sure
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:27.740]  You've heard people
[02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:28.740]  Have questions
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:29.740]  Yeah they
[02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:30.740]  I mean everybody
[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:31.740]  Has their opinion
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:32.740]  And you know
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:33.740]  Everybody has their
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:34.740]  Difference in opinion
[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:35.740]  And to me
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:36.740]  My main goal right now
[02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:37.740]  Is to help the 9-11
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:38.740]  Responders
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:39.740]  That are ill
[02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:40.740]  What do you think about
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:41.740]  I mean do you
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:42.740]  Support Rosie's
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:43.740]  Free speech
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:44.740]  When she was questioning
[02:29:44.740 --> 02:29:45.740]  The official story
[02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:46.740]  I can't really
[02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:47.740]  Hear Rosie
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:48.740]  Say that
[02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:49.740]  I understand
[02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:50.740]  But certainly
[02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:51.740]  The government knew
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:52.740]  What they were doing
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:53.740]  And left you guys
[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:54.740]  Out to dry
[02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:55.740]  But you
[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:56.740]  I mean
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:57.740]  All I can say
[02:29:57.740 --> 02:29:58.740]  Is that the government
[02:29:58.740 --> 02:29:59.740]  Hasn't
[02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:00.740]  Is not doing enough
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:01.740]  For us
[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:02.740]  To 9-11 responders
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:03.740]  I understand
[02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:04.740]  Vito Valente
[02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:05.740]  Vito we're out of time
[02:30:05.740 --> 02:30:06.740]  I want to thank you
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:07.740]  For coming on with us
[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:08.740]  Thank you so much
[02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:09.740]  You bet
[02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:10.740]  God bless you
[02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:11.740]  We'll talk to you again soon
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:12.740]  Thank you so much
[02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:13.740]  For all you guys
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:14.740]  That are helping us
[02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:15.740]  Well we
[02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:16.740]  Thank you sir
[02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:19.740]  We're on the march
[02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:21.740]  The empire's on the run
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:25.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:28.740 --> 02:30:29.740]  Summer is once again
[02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:30.740]  Just around the corner
[02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:31.740]  And as usual
[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:33.740]  So are higher gas prices
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:35.740]  This year stop taking it on the chin
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:36.740]  And start fighting back
[02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:37.740]  Ethos FR
[02:30:37.740 --> 02:30:39.740]  A product tested and found worthy
[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:41.740]  By NBC and Fox News
[02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:43.740]  Can save you up to 19% on fuel
[02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:44.740]  And reduce emissions
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:45.740]  By up to 30%
[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:47.740]  Unlike other products and gadgets
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:48.740]  You've seen advertised
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:51.740]  Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem
[02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:52.740]  Unburned fuel
[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:53.740]  You see
[02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:55.740]  Exhaust is essentially unburned fuel
[02:30:55.740 --> 02:30:57.740]  That's expelled from your tailpipe
[02:30:57.740 --> 02:30:58.740]  That equates to toxins being released
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:30:59.740]  Into the environment
[02:30:59.740 --> 02:31:00.740]  And dollars being released
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.740]  From your wallet
[02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:03.740]  But with Ethos FR
[02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:05.740]  Fuel burns more completely
[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:06.740]  Helping your engine to deliver

[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:32.740]  For over five years
[02:32:32.740 --> 02:32:33.740]  Cardivite has proven itself
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:35.740]  Time tested
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:36.740]  Here's Dr. Mattson
[02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:37.740]  A naturopathic doctor's
[02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:38.740]  Thoughts on Cardivite
[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:39.740]  In our mind
[02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:40.740]  There isn't such
[02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:41.740]  A great big mystery
[02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:42.740]  To disease anymore
[02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:43.740]  This basic tenet of yeast
[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:44.740]  In the gut and metals
[02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:45.740]  In the liver
[02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:46.740]  Covers at least
[02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:47.740]  70-80% of the diseases
[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:48.740]  That we see
[02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:49.740]  When we do our program
[02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:50.740]  You know, in herbal formulas
[02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:51.740]  Like Cardivite
[02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:52.740]  And you see someone
[02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:53.740]  Who could barely walk up a hill
[02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:55.740]  Now going for a regular jog
[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:56.740]  A few months later
[02:32:56.740 --> 02:32:57.740]  We know we're doing
[02:32:57.740 --> 02:32:58.740]  Something right
[02:32:58.740 --> 02:32:59.740]  It's a well thought out formula
[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:00.740]  I mean, the idea of it
[02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:01.740]  Working on yeast and metals
[02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:02.740]  Both at the same time
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:03.740]  And liver function
[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:04.740]  Is dead on
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:05.740]  You'll find, I think
[02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:06.740]  That it'll work more
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:07.740]  Than just on heart problems
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.740]  And circulation problems
[02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:09.740]  It'll work on
[02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:10.740]  Other problems as well
[02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:11.740]  For more information

[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:38.740]  Let's go ahead
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:39.740]  Since we were just talking
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:41.740]  About Rudolph Giuliani
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:42.740]  And play part of this
[02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:43.740]  8 minute Keith Uberman
[02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:44.740]  Piece to analyze it
[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:45.740]  And break it down
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:48.740]  Until we play these clips
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:49.740]  The whole thing's up
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:50.740]  On prisonplanet.com
[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:52.740]  And infowars.com right now
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:54.740]  But right now here is Keith Uberman
[02:33:54.740 --> 02:33:55.740]  Talking about Giuliani
[02:33:55.740 --> 02:33:58.740]  Milking the 9-11 fear
[02:33:58.740 --> 02:33:59.740]  Milking, basically
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:00.740]  Engaging in terrorism
[02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:01.740]  You know, vote for me
[02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:02.740]  Or the terrorists
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:03.740]  Will get you
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:06.740]  And yeah, bottom line
[02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:07.740]  They failed us
[02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:08.740]  The defenses stood down
[02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:09.740]  Like never before
[02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:10.740]  They did a heartable job
[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:11.740]  On 9-11
[02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:12.740]  How are they heroes?
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:14.740]  Now Uberman at least goes that far
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:15.740]  Which I've been pointing out
[02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:16.740]  Since day one
[02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:17.740]  And not only did they fail us
[02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:18.740]  They ran the whole thing
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:19.740]  But here's Keith Uberman
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:20.740]  A special comment about
[02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:22.740]  Rudolph Giuliani's remarks
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:23.740]  At a Lincoln Day dinner
[02:34:23.740 --> 02:34:24.740]  In New Hampshire last night
[02:34:24.740 --> 02:34:26.740]  Since some indeterminable hour
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:27.740]  Between the final dousing
[02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:29.740]  Of the pyre at the World Trade Center
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:30.740]  And the breaking of what
[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:31.740]  Senator Obama has aptly termed
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:33.740]  9-11 fever
[02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:34.740]  It has been profoundly
[02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:35.740]  And disturbingly evident
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:36.740]  That we are at the center
[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:38.740]  Of one of history's great ironies
[02:34:38.740 --> 02:34:39.740]  Only in this America
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:40.740]  Of the early 21st century
[02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:42.740]  Could it be true
[02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:43.740]  That the man who was president
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:44.740]  During the worst attack
[02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:45.740]  On our nation
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:46.740]  And the man who was the mayor
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:47.740]  Of the city in which that attack
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:48.740]  Principally unfolded
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.740]  Would not only be absolved
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:51.740]  Of any and all blame
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:52.740]  For the unreadiness
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:53.740]  Of their own governments
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.740]  But moreover
[02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:55.740]  Would thereafter be branded
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:57.740]  Heroes of those attacks
[02:34:57.740 --> 02:34:58.740]  And now that mayor
[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:00.740]  Whose most profound municipal act
[02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:01.740]  In the wake of that nightmare
[02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:02.740]  Was to suggest
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:03.740]  The postponement
[02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:04.740]  Of the election
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:05.740]  To choose his own successor
[02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:07.740]  Has gone even a step beyond
[02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:08.740]  These M.C. Escher
[02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:09.740]  Constructions of history
[02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:11.740]  If any republican
[02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:12.740]  Is elected president
[02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:13.740]  And I think obviously
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:14.740]  I would be best at this
[02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:16.740]  We will remain on offense
[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:17.740]  And we will anticipate
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:19.740]  What the terrorists will do
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:20.740]  And try to stop them
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:21.740]  Before they do it
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.740]  Insisting that the election
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:23.740]  Of any democrat
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:24.740]  Would mean the country
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:26.740]  Was back on defense
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:27.740]  Mr. Giuliani continued
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:28.740]  Last night
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.740]  But the question is
[02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:30.740]  How long will it take
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:31.740]  And how many casualties
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:32.740]  Will we have
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:34.740]  If we are on defense
[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:36.740]  We will have more losses
[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:38.740]  And it will go on longer
[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:39.740]  He said this with no sense
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:40.740]  Of irony
[02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:41.740]  No sense of any personal
[02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:42.740]  Shortcomings
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:44.740]  No sense whatsoever
[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:45.740]  And if you somehow missed
[02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:46.740]  What he was really saying
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:47.740]  Somehow did not hear
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.740]  The none too subtle subtext
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:51.740]  Of vote democratic and die
[02:35:51.740 --> 02:35:52.740]  Mr. Giuliani then stripped away
[02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:54.740]  Any barrier of courtesy
[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:55.740]  Telling Roger Simon
[02:35:55.740 --> 02:35:57.740]  Of politico.com quote
[02:35:57.740 --> 02:35:59.740]  America will be safer
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:02.740]  With a republican president
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:03.740]  At least that republican
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:04.740]  President on which we have
[02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:05.740]  Not been safer
[02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:07.740]  Has even at his worst
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:08.740]  Maintained some microscopic
[02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:10.740]  Distance between himself
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:12.740]  And a campaign platform
[02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:13.740]  That blithely threatened
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:14.740]  The american people
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:16.740]  With casualties
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:17.740]  If they next year
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:19.740]  Elect a democratic president
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:20.740]  Or inferring from
[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:21.740]  Mr. Giuliani's flights
[02:36:21.740 --> 02:36:22.740]  Of grandeur in New Hampshire
[02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:23.740]  Last night
[02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:24.740]  Even if they elect
[02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:25.740]  A different republican
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:27.740]  How dare you sir
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:28.740]  How many casualties
[02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:29.740]  Will we have
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:30.740]  This is the language
[02:36:30.740 --> 02:36:32.740]  Of bin Laden
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:33.740]  Yours Mr. Giuliani
[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:34.740]  Is the same chilling
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:36.740]  Nonchalance of the madman
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:37.740]  Of the proselytizer
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:38.740]  Who has moved from even
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:39.740]  Some crude framework
[02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:41.740]  Of politics and society
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:42.740]  Into a virtual Roman
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:44.740]  Colosseum of carnage
[02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:45.740]  And a conceit
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:46.740]  Over your own ability
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:47.740]  And worthiness
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:48.740]  To decide
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:49.740]  Who therein lives
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:51.740]  And who dies
[02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:52.740]  Rather than a reasoned
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:53.740]  Discussion
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:54.740]  Rather than a political
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:55.740]  Campaign advocating
[02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:56.740]  Your own causes
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.740]  And extolling
[02:36:57.740 --> 02:36:59.740]  Your own qualifications
[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:00.740]  You have bypassed
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:01.740]  All the intermediate steps
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:03.740]  And moved directly
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:04.740]  To trying to terrorize
[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:05.740]  The electorate
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:06.740]  Into viewing a vote
[02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:07.740]  For a democrat
[02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:08.740]  Not as a reasonable
[02:37:08.740 --> 02:37:09.740]  Alternative
[02:37:09.740 --> 02:37:11.740]  And an inalienable right
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:14.740]  But as an act of suicide
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:15.740]  This is not the mere politicizing
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:17.740]  Of the war in Iraq
[02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:18.740]  Nor the vague mumbled
[02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:19.740]  Epithets about democratic
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:21.740]  Softness from a delusional
[02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:22.740]  Vice president
[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:23.740]  This is casualties
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:25.740]  On a partisan basis
[02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:26.740]  Of the naked assertion
[02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:28.740]  That Mr. Giuliani's party
[02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:29.740]  Knows all
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:30.740]  And will save those
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:31.740]  Who have voted for it
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:33.740]  And to hell with everybody else
[02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:34.740]  And that he
[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:35.740]  With no foreign policy
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:37.740]  Experience whatsoever
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:38.740]  Is somehow the messiah
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:40.740]  Of the moment
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:42.740]  Even to grant that that formula
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:43.740]  Whether posed by republican
[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:44.740]  Or democrat
[02:37:44.740 --> 02:37:46.740]  Is somehow not the most base
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:47.740]  The most indefensible
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:48.740]  The most un-American
[02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:50.740]  Electioneering in our history
[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:51.740]  Even if it is somehow
[02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:52.740]  Acceptable to assign
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:54.740]  Casualties to one party
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:56.740]  And safety to the other
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:57.740]  Even if we have become so
[02:37:57.740 --> 02:37:59.740]  Profane in our thinking
[02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:00.740]  That it is part of our
[02:38:00.740 --> 02:38:02.740]  Political vocabulary
[02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:03.740]  To view counter-terror
[02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:05.740]  As one party's property
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:07.740]  And the other's liability
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:09.740]  On what imaginary track record
[02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:10.740]  Does Mr. Giuliani
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:12.740]  Base his boast?
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:13.740]  Which party held the presidency
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:15.740]  On September 11, 2001,
[02:38:15.740 --> 02:38:16.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:17.740]  Which party held the mayoralty
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:18.740]  Of New York on that date,
[02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:19.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:21.740]  Which party assured New Yorkers
[02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:22.740]  That the air was safe
[02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:23.740]  And the remains of the dead
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:25.740]  Recovered and not being used
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:26.740]  To fill potholes,
[02:38:26.740 --> 02:38:27.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:28.740]  Which party wanted
[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:30.740]  What the terrorists wanted,
[02:38:30.740 --> 02:38:31.740]  The postponement of our
[02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:32.740]  Elections?
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:33.740]  And to whose personal advantage
[02:38:33.740 --> 02:38:34.740]  Would that have redounded,
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:36.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:37.740]  Which mayor of New York
[02:38:37.740 --> 02:38:38.740]  Was elected eight months
[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:39.740]  After the first attack
[02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:41.740]  On the World Trade Center,
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:42.740]  Yet did not emphasize
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.740]  Counter-terror
[02:38:43.740 --> 02:38:45.740]  In that same city
[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:46.740]  For the next eight years,
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:48.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:49.740]  Which party had proposed
[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:50.740]  To turn over the Department
[02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:51.740]  Of Homeland Security
[02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:52.740]  To Bernard Kerrick,
[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:53.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:54.740]  Who wanted to ignore
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:55.740]  And hide Kerrick's
[02:38:55.740 --> 02:38:57.740]  Organized crime allegations,
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:38:58.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:38:59.740]  Who personally argued
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:00.740]  To the White House
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:01.740]  That Kerrick
[02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:02.740]  Need not be vetted,
[02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:04.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:05.740]  Which party rode roughshod
[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:06.740]  Over Americans' rights
[02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:07.740]  While braying
[02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:08.740]  That it was actually
[02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:09.740]  Protecting them,
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:10.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:10.740 --> 02:39:11.740]  Which party took this country
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:12.740]  Into the most
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:13.740]  Utterly backwards,
[02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:14.740]  Utterly counterproductive,
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:15.740]  Utterly ruinous war
[02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:16.740]  In our history,
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:17.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:19.740]  Which party has been in office
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:21.740]  As more Americans were killed
[02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:22.740]  In the pointless fields
[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:24.740]  Of Iraq than were killed
[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:25.740]  In the consuming nightmare
[02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:26.740]  Of 9-11,
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:28.740]  Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:29.740]  Drop this argument,
[02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:33.740]  Sir, you will lose it.
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:34.740]  The Democrats do not understand
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:35.740]  The full nature and scope
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:36.740]  Of the terrorist war
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:37.740]  Against us,
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:39.740]  Mr. Giuliani continued
[02:39:39.740 --> 02:39:40.740]  To the Rockingham County
[02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:42.740]  Lincoln Day dinner last night.
[02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:44.740]  Never, ever again will this country
[02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:45.740]  Be on defense,
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:48.740]  Waiting for terrorists to attack us.
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:49.740]  If I have any
[02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:50.740]  We don't have time to play
[02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:51.740]  The last three minutes of it,
[02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:52.740]  Go to prisonplanet.com,
[02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:53.740]  You can watch it right now
[02:39:53.740 --> 02:39:54.740]  If you want.
[02:39:54.740 --> 02:39:56.740]  It gets even better, frankly.
[02:39:56.740 --> 02:39:58.740]  Sorry, Keith Hoberman,
[02:39:58.740 --> 02:39:59.740]  You're just,
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:00.740]  I'm sorry, most people don't know
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:02.740]  What an M.C. Escher history is,
[02:40:02.740 --> 02:40:04.740]  But people might have seen the art,
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:06.740]  It's all three and four dimensional,
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:09.740]  Bizarre architectural structures
[02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:10.740]  That are like mirrors.
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:12.740]  One of my favorite artists growing up,
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:13.740]  I mean, it's a popular artist,
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:14.740]  Some of you may know,
[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:15.740]  Most people don't.
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:16.740]  Most people don't know
[02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:17.740]  How many continents there are,
[02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:18.740]  Where Iraq is,
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:19.740]  Not my listeners,
[02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:20.740]  The general public,
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:22.740]  But I don't think your MSNBC audience
[02:40:22.740 --> 02:40:25.740]  Got that Mr. Hoberman there.
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:27.740]  Here's the problem, though.
[02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:28.740]  See, Democrats are going to save us,
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:29.740]  It's always the Democrats,
[02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:31.740]  The Democrats.
[02:40:31.740 --> 02:40:32.740]  When I start hearing him
[02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:34.740]  Attack Hillary and Chuck Schumer
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:35.740]  And Lieberman and all these
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:36.740]  Warmongers,
[02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:38.740]  Then I'll really fall down
[02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:39.740]  At the feet of Hoberman,
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:40.740]  But obviously a genius,
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:42.740]  He's also great at calling baseball.
[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:46.740]  Back when I had time to watch such things,
[02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:48.740]  That's like 12 years ago.
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:51.740]  But he's even better on sports.
[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:53.740]  I mean, I'm sorry, Hoberman.
[02:40:53.740 --> 02:40:56.740]  I'm sorry, but it's dangerous.
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:40:57.740]  See, it makes you think
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:40:59.740]  The solution is the Democrats.
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:01.740]  Everything he said is true.
[02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:02.740]  Now, here it is in a laughing way
[02:41:02.740 --> 02:41:04.740]  From Jon Stewart.
[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:05.740]  And don't forget to cut
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:06.740]  The little profanity comment
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:07.740]  At the end out,
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:08.740]  But here's Jon Stewart
[02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:09.740]  Last night laying out
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:10.740]  In one of these debates
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:12.740]  With Bush against Bush.
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:13.740]  Here it is.
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:15.740]  So the battle lines are drawn.
[02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:16.740]  The Democrats are demanding
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:17.740]  A hard deadline
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:18.740]  For bringing our troops home.
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:20.740]  But have yet to move the president.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:21.740]  And clearly their leadership
[02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:22.740]  Might not be up to the task
[02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:24.740]  Of convincing this president.
[02:41:24.740 --> 02:41:25.740]  But perhaps tonight,
[02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:26.740]  We have a gentleman
[02:41:26.740 --> 02:41:27.740]  Who can face off
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:28.740]  With President Bush
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:29.740]  In a spirited debate.
[02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:30.740]  So first, we'd like to welcome
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:31.740]  To the program
[02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:32.740]  The President of the United States,
[02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:33.740]  George W. Bush.
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:34.740]  Sir?
[02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:35.740]  Thanks for the warm welcome.
[02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:36.740]  It's good to be here.
[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:40.740]  Sir, nobody actually clapped.
[02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:42.740]  But...
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:44.740]  And to debate President Bush
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:46.740]  A much more popular figure,
[02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:49.740]  First term President George W. Bush.
[02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:50.740]  Good evening.
[02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:51.740]  I'm pleased to take
[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:52.740]  Your questions tonight.
[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:53.740]  Wonderful news.
[02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:56.740]  Now, Mr. Current President,
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:57.740]  Let's start with you.
[02:41:57.740 --> 02:41:58.740]  More and more,
[02:41:58.740 --> 02:41:59.740]  People are saying
[02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:00.740]  You don't have the answers
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:01.740]  In Iraq.
[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:02.740]  For four years,
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:03.740]  You've talked about
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:04.740]  Progress that we're making.
[02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:05.740]  You continue to say that.
[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:06.740]  When the Iraqis stand up,
[02:42:06.740 --> 02:42:07.740]  We will stand down.
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:08.740]  When are the troops
[02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:10.740]  Coming home?
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:11.740]  Our country is pursuing
[02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:12.740]  A new strategy in Iraq,
[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:13.740]  And I ask you to give it
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:15.740]  A chance to work.
[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:16.740]  First term Bush,
[02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:17.740]  Your response?
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:18.740]  This business about,
[02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:20.740]  You know, more time.
[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:21.740]  You know, how much time
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:22.740]  Do we need?
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:24.740]  We have to be patient here.
[02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:25.740]  Well, no, actually,
[02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:27.740]  Maybe President Bush
[02:42:27.740 --> 02:42:29.740]  Has a point.
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:31.740]  Maybe we do need patience.
[02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:32.740]  First term Bush
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:33.740]  You were asked to have patience
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:34.740]  To give the inspections
[02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:35.740]  Of diplomacy
[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:36.740]  Time to work
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:37.740]  In Iraq
[02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:39.740]  Before war.
[02:42:39.740 --> 02:42:41.740]  How did you respond?
[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:43.740]  Saddam Hussein and his sons
[02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:44.740]  Must leave Iraq
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:47.740]  Within 48 hours.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:48.740]  Wow.
[02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:49.740]  Deadlines.
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:50.740]  Tough talk,
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:51.740]  Mr. Second-term President.
[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:52.740]  It doesn't make any sense
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:54.740]  To have a timetable.
[02:42:54.740 --> 02:42:55.740]  So you don't think
[02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:56.740]  That the United States
[02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:59.740]  Is going to have a timetable?
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:04.740]  So you don't think, um,
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:06.740]  You really, uh,
[02:43:06.740 --> 02:43:07.740]  Second-term Bush,
[02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:08.740]  You don't think a hard
[02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:09.740]  And fast deadline, uh,
[02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:10.740]  We just need to give them
[02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:11.740]  Some breathing space
[02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:12.740]  So they can gain
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:13.740]  Their confidence
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:14.740]  And have the capabilities
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:15.740]  Necessary to protect.
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:16.740]  Surely we have learned
[02:43:16.740 --> 02:43:17.740]  How this man deceives
[02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:19.740]  And delays.
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:21.740]  I mean, he's, he's,
[02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:22.740]  He's given people
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:23.740]  The runaround.
[02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:24.740]  Now, now, sir,
[02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:26.740]  I don't know if that's fair.
[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:28.740]  First-term Bush,
[02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:29.740]  Why are you such a fan
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:31.740]  Of these deadlines?
[02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:32.740]  The commitments we make
[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:33.740]  Must have meaning.
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:34.740]  When we say
[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:35.740]  Serious consequences
[02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:37.740]  For the sake of peace,
[02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:38.740]  There must be
[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:40.740]  Serious consequences.
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:42.740]  Uh, all right, look,
[02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:44.740]  We're not getting anywhere here.
[02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:45.740]  Let's back up.
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:47.740]  First-term President Bush,
[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:48.740]  Why did we invade Iraq
[02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:50.740]  In the first place?
[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:51.740]  The terrorist threat
[02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:52.740]  To America and the world
[02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:53.740]  Will be diminished
[02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:54.740]  The Bush administration
[02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:56.740]  The world will be diminished
[02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:57.740]  The moment that
[02:43:57.740 --> 02:43:59.740]  Saddam Hussein is disarmed.
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:00.740]  I see.
[02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:01.740]  So you wanted to protect
[02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:03.740]  America from the terrorist threat.
[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:04.740]  Uh, current President Bush,
[02:44:04.740 --> 02:44:06.740]  Why can't we leave Iraq?
[02:44:06.740 --> 02:44:07.740]  Our enemies would have
[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:08.740]  A safe haven from which
[02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:09.740]  To plan and launch attacks
[02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:11.740]  On the American people.
[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:15.740]  So let me see if I have this straight.
[02:44:15.740 --> 02:44:17.740]  Basically, first-term President Bush,
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:18.740]  You invaded to remove
[02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:20.740]  The threat of Saddam Hussein,
[02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:22.740]  And you, current President Bush,
[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:23.740]  Are there to battle the threat
[02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:26.740]  Created by the lack of Saddam Hussein?
[02:44:28.740 --> 02:44:29.740]  Okay.
[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:30.740]  Well, that's...
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:32.740]  That's interesting.
[02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:35.740]  Some...
[02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:37.740]  Basically, second-term President Bush
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:40.740]  Has to undo the damage, uh,
[02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:42.740]  Created by first-term President Bush.
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:43.740]  First-term President Bush,
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:44.740]  Any thoughts as you watch
[02:44:44.740 --> 02:44:46.740]  Your future self prosecute
[02:44:46.740 --> 02:44:48.740]  This second part of the war?
[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:50.740]  This looks like a rerun of a bad movie,
[02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:52.740]  And I'm not interested in watching it.
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:53.740]  Five words.
[02:44:53.740 --> 02:44:54.740]  Now, uh...
[02:44:57.740 --> 02:44:58.740]  And then he goes in and talks about
[02:44:58.740 --> 02:44:59.740]  How al-Qaeda doesn't know
[02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:01.740]  The beauty and the fun of Hanukkah,
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:04.740]  And then, uh, he makes a joke about that.
[02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:05.740]  You can see the rest of it
[02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:07.740]  Uncensored, I guess, up on
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:09.740]  PrisonPanda.com as well.
[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:11.740]  But here's the problem.
[02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:13.740]  This is not funny.
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:17.740]  We have the U.S. and British studies,
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:20.740]  600-plus-thou dead, Iraqis.
[02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:22.740]  Now, that's the first three years.
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:24.740]  We're over four years in a month now,
[02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:26.740]  So the studies are starting to come in preliminary.
[02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:28.740]  It looks like it's over a mil now.
[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:30.740]  Okay, that's not funny.
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:32.740]  But, see, this is a comedy show,
[02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:33.740]  So the only place you can have
[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:35.740]  Serious information to point out lies
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:36.740]  And distortions and double-think
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:38.740]  And double-speak is on a comedy
[02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:39.740]  Or then on Keith Olbermann,
[02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:40.740]  Where it's all the Democrats
[02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:42.740]  Are gonna save us.
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:46.740]  That's the problem with all of this.
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:48.740]  No. Hillary is gonna come in.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.740]  She is a huge warmonger.
[02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:52.740]  So is the entire Democratic Party
[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:53.740]  Except for just a couple senators
[02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:55.740]  And House members.
[02:45:55.740 --> 02:45:56.740]  And those were saying
[02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:57.740]  They want to ban all the guns
[02:45:57.740 --> 02:45:58.740]  And, you know, basically have
[02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:00.740]  Socialism and red stars everywhere.
[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:02.740]  Literally.
[02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:04.740]  Which either, they're either
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:05.740]  On the inside track
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:06.740]  Or they're bleeding-heart fools
[02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:07.740]  Who don't know the banks
[02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:08.740]  Finance the whole thing
[02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:10.740]  To consolidate power.
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:12.740]  We better have a crash course
[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:13.740]  And grow up here
[02:46:13.740 --> 02:46:14.740]  Or things are gonna get
[02:46:14.740 --> 02:46:15.740]  Progressively worse.
[02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:16.740]  Now, I played those clips today
[02:46:16.740 --> 02:46:17.740]  Because I was listening to talk
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:18.740]  Radio this morning
[02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:19.740]  Monitoring enemy transmissions
[02:46:19.740 --> 02:46:21.740]  Of the fake neo-cons.
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:22.740]  And then I heard Bortz later
[02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:23.740]  Driving over to the office
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:24.740]  And it was all the same
[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:25.740]  Talking point.
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:27.740]  The front line in the battle
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:28.740]  Against al-Qaeda is Iraq.
[02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:30.740]  We've got to fight them there.
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:31.740]  They'll fight us over here.
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:33.740]  Excuse me, and, excuse me,
[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:37.740]  Saddam was anti-al-Qaeda.
[02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:40.740]  But, you see, Bortz kept saying
[02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:44.740]  That, you know, al-Qaeda
[02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:45.740]  You should have heard all of it.
[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:48.740]  It was just such bull, folks.
[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.740]  There was no al-Qaeda in Iraq,
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:51.740]  And Bush said there was,
[02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:52.740]  And now that's admitted
[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:53.740]  To be a lie.
[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:55.740]  And anyone fighting back,
[02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:56.740]  Anyone resisting of any
[02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.740]  Of the factions,
[02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:00.740]  They then say is al-Qaeda.
[02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:01.740]  I mean, basically,
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.740]  If the cops pull you over,
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:03.740]  You don't have an inspection
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:04.740]  Sticker, it's gonna be al-Qaeda
[02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:05.740]  Soon.
[02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:06.740]  You slip on a banana peel,
[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:07.740]  It's al-Qaeda.
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:08.740]  You got a stomachache,
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:09.740]  I must have eaten
[02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:10.740]  Some bad al-Qaeda.
[02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:11.740]  And I'm not even trying
[02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:12.740]  To be joking about this.
[02:47:12.740 --> 02:47:13.740]  It's like the overhanging
[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:14.740]  Everything.
[02:47:14.740 --> 02:47:15.740]  Meanwhile, tiny four-way stops
[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:17.740]  In the middle of the countryside
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:18.740]  Have cameras.
[02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:20.740]  Tiny towns have cameras.
[02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:22.740]  And I was on Mancow this morning.
[02:47:22.740 --> 02:47:23.740]  I don't agree with
[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:24.740]  On many things, syndicated show.
[02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:25.740]  But he did say,
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:26.740]  Well, I guess I agree
[02:47:26.740 --> 02:47:27.740]  With you on the police state.
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:28.740]  He goes, you know,
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:29.740]  I drive through
[02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:30.740]  A really big industrial area.
[02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:31.740]  I see illegal aliens everywhere
[02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:33.740]  Working at this big scrap factory.
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:34.740]  But there's cameras
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:35.740]  They put up now,
[02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:36.740]  And they make
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:37.740]  $100,000 a week off of it
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:38.740]  At the red light camera.
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:40.740]  You can't turn left on,
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:41.740]  I mean, excuse me,
[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:43.740]  Right on red.
[02:47:43.740 --> 02:47:45.740]  And, like you could in the past,
[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:46.740]  And I know they're making
[02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:48.740]  Millions of dollars off of this.
[02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:49.740]  But then the illegal aliens,
[02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:50.740]  They won't stop,
[02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:51.740]  And they're allowed to have
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:52.740]  Bank accounts without ID cards.
[02:47:52.740 --> 02:47:53.740]  Exactly.
[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:54.740]  Because we're the schmoes
[02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:55.740]  That will pay it.
[02:47:55.740 --> 02:47:57.740]  We're the dumb, dumb Americans.
[02:47:57.740 --> 02:47:58.740]  We really have to admit
[02:47:58.740 --> 02:47:59.740]  We're dumb.
[02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:00.740]  I mean, I've been ripped off
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:01.740]  And scammed before,
[02:48:01.740 --> 02:48:02.740]  And I don't get mad
[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:03.740]  At the people that even did it.
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:05.740]  I get mad at myself.
[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:06.740]  Because then it won't happen again.
[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:07.740]  Or at least I'll have a better chance
[02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:09.740]  Of it not happening again.
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:10.740]  But not here.
[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:11.740]  No, man.
[02:48:11.740 --> 02:48:12.740]  We just sit here,
[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:13.740]  And take it.
[02:48:13.740 --> 02:48:14.740]  21 state police,
[02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:15.740]  Last week I went to the beach.
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:17.740]  21 state police.
[02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:19.740]  Folks, I've gone five miles
[02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:21.740]  Over the speed limit two times,
[02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:22.740]  And the state police have
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:24.740]  Instantly pulled me over.
[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:25.740]  Instantly.
[02:48:25.740 --> 02:48:27.740]  I mean, I got a ticket driving down there,
[02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:28.740]  And I'm going a few miles
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:29.740]  Over the speed limit,
[02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:30.740]  And I'm like,
[02:48:30.740 --> 02:48:31.740]  You give him for just a few miles over?
[02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:32.740]  And he's like,
[02:48:32.740 --> 02:48:33.740]  Yep, things have changed.
[02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:34.740]  You know, these yellow teeth,
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:35.740]  I was just looking at him,
[02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:36.740]  It was totally,
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:38.740]  He literally stunk through the window.
[02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:40.740]  And, I mean, I'm sorry,
[02:48:40.740 --> 02:48:41.740]  You stink,
[02:48:41.740 --> 02:48:43.740]  And this whole thing you're doing stinks.
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:45.740]  Well, there's illegal aliens all around me,
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:46.740]  Driving 90 miles an hour passes.
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:48.740]  I actually witnessed that.
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:50.740]  Another state police pulled me over,
[02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:52.740]  They started talking about grabbing our kids,
[02:48:52.740 --> 02:48:53.740]  And looking at our safety seats,
[02:48:53.740 --> 02:48:54.740]  And asking, and I just said,
[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:55.740]  Look, I'm a talk show host,
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:56.740]  I'm going to go after you,
[02:48:56.740 --> 02:48:57.740]  Leave me alone, stop now.
[02:48:57.740 --> 02:48:59.740]  When they wanted to search the car,
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:01.740]  And they kind of got the message and left.
[02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:02.740]  Plus, I turned up coast to coast AM,
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:03.740]  It was a rebroadcast,
[02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:04.740]  It was like 10 o'clock at night,
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:06.740]  From me on the night before.
[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:07.740]  And I go,
[02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:08.740]  You hear that?
[02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:09.740]  That's me, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:49:09.740 --> 02:49:10.740]  I mean, that's the only time
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:12.740]  My fingers chopped off,
[02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:14.740]  The illegal aliens are all going in front of me.
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:15.740]  I start yelling,
[02:49:15.740 --> 02:49:16.740]  Attach my finger,
[02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:18.740]  Or I'm about to be harassed,
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:19.740]  I will say,
[02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:21.740]  Look, you can beat the rap,
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:22.740]  But you can't beat the ride.
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.740]  I've told cops that.
[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:25.740]  I said, I assure you,
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.740]  I'm going to legally hammer you.
[02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:30.740]  And I'm not a litigious person.
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:32.740]  Somebody starts stalking my sister 10 years ago,
[02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:34.740]  I shoot them in one.
[02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:35.740]  Somebody stalked me,
[02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:36.740]  I shoot them in one.
[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:37.740]  They tried to shut down Access TV,
[02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:38.740]  I shoot them in one,
[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:39.740]  And in the process,
[02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:41.740]  The director went to prison, folks.
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:43.740]  He was caught stealing money.
[02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:44.740]  People slander me locally,
[02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:45.740]  I go into court,
[02:49:45.740 --> 02:49:47.740]  They want to settle and stop.
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:48.740]  Everything's fine.
[02:49:48.740 --> 02:49:51.740]  Some other locals want to snoop around into stuff,
[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:53.740]  And make up lies,
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:56.740]  And want to claim and call people that I work for.
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:57.740]  Man, that's fine.
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:49:59.740]  That's how you get sued.
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:00.740]  I mean, I don't understand it.
[02:50:00.740 --> 02:50:02.740]  It's not like I have a history
[02:50:02.740 --> 02:50:04.740]  Of not doing what I say I'll do.
[02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:05.740]  I wasn't going to do it,
[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:06.740]  That's it,
[02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:07.740]  It's being filed.
[02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:11.740]  I just can't take it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:14.740]  I've already digressed and gotten off into myself.
[02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:25.740]  I'm just mad.
[02:50:25.740 --> 02:50:27.740]  Because I do everything I do out of a pure heart,
[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:31.740]  And I just see the whole society degenerating.
[02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:35.740]  Do you think I like spending ten, fifteen thousand dollars
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:37.740]  To sue somebody?
[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:41.740]  Do you think I'm even glad the director of AXIS TV went to prison?
[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:43.740]  Do you think I like that?
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:45.740]  I want to do, I want to make films,
[02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:46.740]  I want to have an effect,
[02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:47.740]  I want to do good.
[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:48.740]  I want to have enough time
[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:50.740]  To go help people at a soup kitchen.
[02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:51.740]  I like it.
[02:50:52.740 --> 02:50:54.740]  That's who I am, you scum!
[02:50:56.740 --> 02:50:58.740]  But I can't do that.
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:00.740]  I've got to defend myself.
[02:51:02.740 --> 02:51:04.740]  I want to go in the park and have a picnic.
[02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:05.740]  But I can't.
[02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:08.740]  I've got to sit here and watch this country
[02:51:08.740 --> 02:51:10.740]  Completely unravel around me.
[02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:13.740]  Alright.
[02:51:16.740 --> 02:51:17.740]  Let me, uh,
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:20.740]  I know we've got a lot of phone lines,
[02:51:20.740 --> 02:51:22.740]  I could try to jam you in or I could cover all this news.
[02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:25.740]  Oh God, we'll be back.
[02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:29.740]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:31.740]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:33.740]  Shocking declassified government documents prove
[02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:36.740]  That Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:37.740]  Against their own populations
[02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:39.740]  As a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:39.740 --> 02:51:43.740]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[02:51:43.740 --> 02:51:47.740]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British Intelligence.
[02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:50.740]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iowa
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:53.740]  And the lies that took us to the United States.
[02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:56.740]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[02:51:56.740 --> 02:51:59.740]  A White House program to disseminate fake news,
[02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:02.740]  NSA spying, secret police torture,
[02:52:02.740 --> 02:52:05.740]  The latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:09.740]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:11.740]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:15.740]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:40.740]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more
[02:53:40.740 --> 02:53:42.740]  All in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:47.740]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:51.740]  Every time you walk away from your computer leaving your internet connection on
[02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:56.740]  You are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and big brother to access your personal information.

[02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:27.740]  And start protecting yourself today.
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:55:07.740]  I've sworn to stay the course
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:13.740]  To ram the New World Order of Midships
[02:55:13.740 --> 02:55:17.740]  And I am doing it
[02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:22.740]  And I ask you to join me in this fight against the New World Order
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:24.740]  And to never surrender
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:28.740]  Never give one inch
[02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:35.740]  Give them the cold steel of the info war
[02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:39.740]  All right, we're not going to go to call until I've got to cover all this.
[02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:41.740]  I can't get to the Lou Dobbs either.
[02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:45.740]  Big clips up on PrisonPlanet.com of Lou Dobbs
[02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:49.740]  With Pastor, the head CFR member who wrote up the plan for North America
[02:55:49.740 --> 02:55:52.740]  That Bush signed into law two years ago as we're integrated
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:56.740]  Saying, oh we're going to get rid of all the borders and have a continental security zone
[02:55:56.740 --> 02:56:00.740]  Exactly what the UN Chief McKenzie, head of UN Peacekeeping said
[02:56:00.740 --> 02:56:03.740]  The Wednesday after, a week plus after 9-11.
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:06.740]  But I keep telling you about continental security zone
[02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:10.740]  We've got to have the North American Union for your security or Al Qaeda will get you
[02:56:10.740 --> 02:56:13.740]  You know what, play that clip, it's in the first minute
[02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:17.740]  Just start playing, there's more of it later, but start playing the Dobbs.
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:24.740]  Border security is arguably the critical issue in this country's fight against radical Islamist terrorism
[02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:30.740]  But our borders remain porous, so porous that 3 million illegal aliens entered this country last year
[02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:32.740]  Nearly all of them from Mexico
[02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:36.740]  Now, incredibly, a panel sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:40.740]  Wants the United States to focus not on the defense of our own borders
[02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:46.740]  But rather create what effectively would be a common border that includes Mexico and Canada
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:48.740]  Christine Romans has the report
[02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:55.740]  On Capitol Hill, testimony calling for Americans to start thinking like citizens of North America
[02:56:55.740 --> 02:56:59.740]  And treat the US, Mexico and Canada like one big country
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:05.740]  The best way to secure the United States today is not at our two borders with Mexico and Canada
[02:57:05.740 --> 02:57:08.740]  But at the borders of North America as a whole
[02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:11.740]  That's the view in a report called Building a North American Union
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:13.740]  It just goes on and on
[02:57:13.740 --> 02:57:16.740]  But no, there's no North American Union
[02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:19.740]  I've got all these neocon sites saying I'm a big liar
[02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:21.740]  I mean, I just can't believe it
[02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:25.740]  Watch, they're going to say gun control is conservative and O'Reilly is calling for it
[02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:29.740]  And I tell you, I told you it happened, now we're evil because we don't want to end our guns in
[02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:34.740]  Folks, they can tell them putting red hammer and sickles on their armband is conservative
[02:57:34.740 --> 02:57:36.740]  And these so-called conservatives will do it, ok?
[02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:38.740]  Do you understand how bad they are?
[02:57:38.740 --> 02:57:40.740]  Absolute trash
[02:57:40.740 --> 02:57:42.740]  And here's all the other news we didn't get to
[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:46.740]  Fellow ranger ordered a concealed truth about Tillman's death
[02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:48.740]  I just thought I'd mention that Associated Press
[02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:53.740]  Another one about Jessica Lynch went public saying in a testimony it was all lies and propaganda
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:54.740]  And she was told a lie
[02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:58.740]  And then that integrates in with Pentagon wants to end controversial spying program
[02:57:58.740 --> 02:58:02.740]  It's been in place forever, for 50 years, it's not going away
[02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:04.740]  That's Pentagon lies, ok?
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:05.740]  Just want you to know they're pure liars
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:08.740]  And by the way, all the evidence shows they killed Pat Tillman on purpose
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:10.740]  Because he was about to come out against the war
[02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:15.740]  U.S. officials exclude car bombs touting drop in Iraq violence
[02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:19.740]  So they cut out all the truck bombs and don't count that until deaths have gone down
[02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:21.740]  Total lies
[02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:23.740]  McClatchy newspapers
[02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:27.740]  Bin Laden overseeing Iraq, Afghanistan, Ops, and the Taliban
[02:58:27.740 --> 02:58:29.740]  I mean this guy basically runs everything
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.740]  We're out of time here
[02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:36.740]  This is the Wall Street Journal about how the government could control the weather
[02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:37.740]  And stop global warming
[02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:39.740]  Folks, they've been doing it since the 60s
[02:58:39.740 --> 02:58:42.740]  We've had the Father of Weather Weapons on, big article on Prison Planet
[02:58:42.740 --> 02:58:44.740]  And Info Wars coming up later today
[02:58:44.740 --> 02:58:47.740]  China to force rain ahead of Olympics, that's Associated Press
[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:50.740]  Industry caught with the global tax for carbon as a fraud
[02:58:50.740 --> 02:58:52.740]  Nothing to do with stopping global warming, folks
[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:53.740]  Even if you believe it's man-made
[02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:55.740]  It does nothing, you understood that
[02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:56.740]  Compute that
[02:58:56.740 --> 02:58:58.740]  And please get the Rosie O'Donnell scoop
[02:58:58.740 --> 02:59:00.740]  Major breaking, all the behind the scenes
[02:59:00.740 --> 02:59:02.740]  How she was censored, why she left
[02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:04.740]  Up on prisonplanet.com
[02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:06.740]  God bless you all, gotta go file a lawsuit
[02:59:07.740 --> 02:59:11.740]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com
[02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:15.740]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645
[02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:19.740]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available
[02:59:19.740 --> 02:59:22.740]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet
[02:59:22.740 --> 02:59:23.740]  Most would bounce off
[02:59:23.740 --> 02:59:26.740]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick
[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:28.740]  The same principle applies in water filtration
[02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:33.740]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI
[02:59:33.740 --> 02:59:37.740]  Causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second
[02:59:37.740 --> 02:59:38.740]  The Berkey Light is different
[02:59:38.740 --> 02:59:43.740]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:59:43.740 --> 02:59:45.740]  Of the self-sterilizing filters
[02:59:45.740 --> 02:59:47.740]  This allows the proprietary media formulation
