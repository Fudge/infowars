[00:19.040 --> 00:40.640]  Texas Alex Jones I really want to drill down into the news today and cover just
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.760]  a wide range of important stories and developments on our planet and inside
[00:45.760 --> 00:54.080]  our country here in the United States in the third hour today I have the
[00:54.080 --> 01:00.720]  operator and owner of the Texas gun show joining us with huge horrible
[01:00.720 --> 01:07.640]  developments part two of what developed over the weekend and yesterday with the
[01:07.640 --> 01:12.200]  BAT FE the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives people keep
[01:12.200 --> 01:17.440]  emailing me saying I thought it's the ATF it's known as the ATF they changed
[01:17.440 --> 01:21.320]  their name what five six years ago to Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and
[01:21.320 --> 01:29.240]  explosives but yes the same group the ATF the Waco Killers they just came into
[01:29.240 --> 01:36.960]  Austin no law no regulation no statutory authority and told the gun show
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.880]  operator you will not allow private sales of firearms and said this is a
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.320]  good notice for you to post and hand out the Austin Police Department was
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.960]  involved as well and we've written three or four very important extremely
[01:52.960 --> 01:57.000]  detailed reports up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com about it
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.920]  because it's precedent setting around the nation and now we have the prison
[02:01.920 --> 02:05.800]  planet dot com headline Tennessee follows Texas and banning private gun
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.640]  shows but at least Tennessee's attempting to pass a law to violate the
[02:10.640 --> 02:17.680]  Constitution this is complete tyranny in Austin well he got a call yesterday
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.280]  after the show and I asked was it because of the show and he said no this
[02:22.280 --> 02:28.560]  decision had been made over the weekend that the gun shows just completely banned
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.000]  now there will never be a gun show in the Crockett Center again the owners were
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.280]  saying because of police threats and I realized it really hit me this morning
[02:40.280 --> 02:45.360]  that this is living in Chicago the entire country is going under Chicago
[02:45.360 --> 02:50.200]  mafia style rule where the police work for the mafia which is the government
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.440]  and if you don't pay them off they just burn your nightclub down that's how
[02:56.440 --> 03:02.440]  Chicago works Aaron Russo talks about that and reflections and warnings or they
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.600]  just use regulations or they just come and beat you up there or they just
[03:06.600 --> 03:13.840]  threaten your landlord and it's just mafia just total law of the jungle the
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.840]  police in the town I live I guess are the opposite of law men they are there
[03:18.840 --> 03:22.040]  to violate the law they are there to trample on it they're there to take
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.600]  blood without warrants they're there to just do whatever they want
[03:24.600 --> 03:33.760]  bunch of federal minions and the Texas gun show doesn't have a lot of money but
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.280]  they certainly have lawsuits civil rights violations torturous interference
[03:38.280 --> 03:46.600]  batf violating the commerce clause I mean what jurisdiction do they have here
[03:46.600 --> 03:52.560]  without federal or even state law just in the town where I live saying hey we
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.520]  checked into it for 20 years they've had a gun show there they ran the last gun

[04:14.440 --> 04:21.200]  with crossbows stuff like that just to go target shooting with I never shot a
[04:21.200 --> 04:29.160]  deer with a crossbow shot some deer with bows compound bows but it's over you

[08:01.120 --> 08:06.240]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[08:06.240 --> 08:10.040]  there's a war on for your mind
[08:18.440 --> 08:28.960]  why Cliff John is a prolific multi-platinum musician and he has given
[08:28.960 --> 08:36.400]  millions of dollars of his own money over the last decade to Haiti where he's
[08:36.400 --> 08:41.240]  from and he goes and produces videos where he's on the street handing money
[08:41.240 --> 08:47.600]  out and I remember over the weekend hearing ABC News on the radio reading the
[08:47.600 --> 08:54.840]  articles saying you know charity watch groups question why Cliff John's charity
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.880]  and then I dug and dug and dug in articles and did find an ABC News where
[08:59.880 --> 09:08.520]  it said oh his income tax records show that in 2007 he only collected seventy
[09:08.520 --> 09:16.200]  nine thousand dollars in donations and gave four hundred and eleven thousand of
[09:16.200 --> 09:22.280]  his own money and so it looks like this this charity doesn't you know isn't very
[09:22.280 --> 09:27.880]  effective at collecting money and so with that they ran news headlines all
[09:27.880 --> 09:35.120]  over the country saying don't give money to why Cliff John and I actually spent
[09:35.120 --> 09:37.920]  the time to go look it up because as soon as I heard them attacking and I
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.120]  said this must be a real charity and of course I went and looked it up he's
[09:44.120 --> 09:50.520]  given millions and millions and millions of dollars building aid centers giving
[09:50.520 --> 09:58.320]  them food education shoes clothing and because of that that's why he's bad I
[09:58.320 --> 10:04.920]  mean that's like saying this man may not be eligible to be a father the CPS may
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.720]  need to take his children because his children all are straight-A students and
[10:09.720 --> 10:17.160]  have never been sick or in trouble and so we have to take your children I mean
[10:17.160 --> 10:21.600]  in fact I printed it off Sunday night and I'm looking around for it at my
[10:21.600 --> 10:27.160]  stack as I highlighted it and we're gonna dig it out for ABC News because it's
[10:27.160 --> 10:31.480]  Orwellian it doesn't make sense you read the headline saying that people are
[10:31.480 --> 10:38.160]  questioning why Cliff's charity and they say well looking at his tax returns he
[10:38.160 --> 10:44.960]  donates more to it himself than is even collected and so people wonder if it's
[10:44.960 --> 10:50.640]  an effective charity so they just put the word out don't give to him no give to
[10:50.640 --> 10:57.520]  United Way that's what Bill Clinton and George W. Bush say and give to the
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.080]  American Red Cross who on record at every major disaster keep more than half
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.520]  the money for themselves lie to the public and say it's all going to the
[11:06.520 --> 11:12.040]  people that are in trouble and then give the money to anti-gun groups and pro
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.280]  big government groups and land grabbing fake environmental groups I mean
[11:16.280 --> 11:27.760]  that's on record and so it's a swindle oh no don't give to local church groups in
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.680]  the country don't give to real charities don't give to small organizations no go
[11:32.680 --> 11:41.360]  to the big charity watchdog groups and give to them and they list a bunch of
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.040]  crooks I was driving into work this morning scanning through talk radio and
[11:46.040 --> 11:51.320]  every station was this station would like you to give to the United Way and
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.960]  the American Red Cross this station would like you to give to the two known
[11:55.960 --> 12:02.040]  criminal groups but not why cliff because people question whether that's
[12:02.040 --> 12:04.960]  what the article said they said well since the charities mainly him giving
[12:04.960 --> 12:08.880]  most of his money away you know the question is can he handle the five
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.440]  million dollars he raised in three days you know very jealous of because this was
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.200]  a small charity mainly why cliff John giving most of his money and so because
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.120]  he's giving most of his money and it's only you know a half million dollars a
[12:24.120 --> 12:29.120]  year or so total it's a small charity he can't afford it I mean you know he
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.160]  obviously doesn't know how to distribute five million so don't give to him he's
[12:33.160 --> 12:43.280]  bad here's USA today why cliff John Haiti charity comes under fire donations
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.240]  continue to roll in to Grammy Award-winning musician why cliff John's
[12:46.240 --> 12:52.720]  Haiti galee Haiti an organization that works to raise awareness and support for
[12:52.720 --> 13:00.840]  Haiti since its founding in 2005 indeed was just a few days of catastrophic
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.200]  earthquake in Haiti the organization received more than two million now
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.880]  the reporting it's up to five million in donations via five dollar text messages
[13:08.880 --> 13:12.800]  from concerned supporters but the organization's questionable financial
[13:12.800 --> 13:16.360]  health is causing some charitable watchdogs to step forward with their
[13:16.360 --> 13:23.520]  concerns for instance the foundation spending exceeded its revenues by
[13:23.520 --> 13:30.960]  four hundred and eleven thousand dollars with a large percent of its expenses
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.400]  benefiting several of John's for-profit businesses ABC news reports and then
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.440]  that's the one I want guys oh you did print it here it is groups raised
[13:40.440 --> 13:47.200]  doubts and when you go to ABC see how USA today spun that to some man he and then
[13:47.200 --> 13:54.440]  you find out that no he gave four hundred eleven thousand and seventy nine thousand was donated now
[13:54.440 --> 14:00.200]  that is spin ladies and gentlemen because the way this USA today article is
[14:00.200 --> 14:06.880]  written you think he's running a scam then they go on to say my concern is
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.240]  this is Sandra Menon into vice president of marketing for the watchdog charity
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.520]  navigator tells ABC news that the organization may not be expected and
[14:17.520 --> 14:21.840]  experienced enough to handle the extreme level of damage and devastation of
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.120]  Haiti well yeah that's why everybody works together but you're better to send
[14:25.120 --> 14:28.760]  as Ron Paul has said lots of little charities in but instead the US
[14:28.760 --> 14:32.840]  military is there they've locked it down the French governments even said and
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.280]  won't let people get aid in see just like New Orleans they're gonna lock it
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.200]  down not let the aid get in and then they're gonna ship the Haitians to the
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.840]  US and they're gonna end up being your cops that that's how it works they
[14:45.840 --> 14:48.840]  bring in the minority groups get them on welfare and make them your rulers
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.000]  that's what Minnesota is now people are ruled by the foreigners they brought in
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.200]  Minneapolis St. Paul you drive around and half the cops are foreigners came
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.480]  speak English and they'll do what they're told and so the Haitians will be
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.640]  shipped here and be made our rulers and of course why Cliff John he won't be
[15:06.640 --> 15:10.480]  allowed to bring anything to him so won't be allowed to actually save them large
[15:10.480 --> 15:14.320]  portions will just die and then they'll bring I'm you know half million Haitians
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.040]  here to be put on welfare and then ten years later be given sub machine guns to
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.080]  rule over us I mean that's the quote liberal model that's how this works
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.720]  they're making the illegal aliens cops and military now that's associated press
[15:25.720 --> 15:31.400]  the number one recruiting center in the world's Mexico City for the Army that's
[15:31.400 --> 15:37.920]  how you get foreign troops you just make your military out of foreign troops so
[15:37.920 --> 15:41.840]  you you know you read that and it says who 411,000 with large percent of its
[15:41.840 --> 15:46.720]  expenses benefiting several of John's for-profit businesses then you actually
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.600]  read the ABC News they linked to and it says in 2007 this is ABC News the
[15:52.600 --> 15:59.480]  foundation spending exceeded its revenue by 411,000 it brought in just 79,000
[15:59.480 --> 16:05.240]  that year and it goes on to say he gave 411,000 from his for-profit businesses
[16:05.240 --> 16:14.360]  to the Haitians but USA today like devils man I tell we ought to write an
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.080]  article about this I mean this is mainstream media fraud this is what's
[16:18.080 --> 16:24.200]  so disgusting about these people how they can take something good and turn it
[16:24.200 --> 16:32.080]  in to something bad and ladies and gentlemen I have literally 2030 I don't
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.360]  know more articles that make me just as angry that are just as important and I've
[16:36.360 --> 16:41.640]  just spent basically eight nine minutes on this and I've got to move on but here
[16:41.640 --> 16:47.600]  are the articles to go read it for yourself USA today Wycliffe John's
[16:47.600 --> 16:52.600]  Yelly Haiti charity comes under fire and then it just totally distorts yellow
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.080]  journalism and says he made four hundred and eleven thousand dollars off this
[16:56.080 --> 17:00.440]  for himself and then you read the actual ABC News report that they just stole
[17:00.440 --> 17:04.480]  from and twisted from and it's still deceptive with groups raised doubts
[17:04.480 --> 17:12.120]  about Wycliffe John's charity and then it goes on to admit well he only raised
[17:12.120 --> 17:17.080]  from other people donating seventy nine thousand in 2007 but he gave four hundred
[17:17.080 --> 17:24.640]  eleven thousand dollars from his own business that is true charity that is
[17:24.640 --> 17:30.160]  admirable by the way Wycliffe John we play one of his songs here on air the
[17:30.160 --> 17:35.520]  his rendition of get the title of the song you know they point they can and
[17:35.520 --> 17:39.680]  at you fortunate son that can you cue that up John maybe we can go out to break
[17:39.680 --> 17:43.280]  with it if you can find it if not we'll play it later but I'm done talking about
[17:43.280 --> 17:46.960]  this I haven't even gotten into Haiti yet yes they plan to ship the Haitians here
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.600]  holy mackerel as if we're not already bankrupt enough with 30 plus million
[17:51.600 --> 17:56.880]  illegal aliens running all over us and just the state's all going bankrupt and
[17:56.880 --> 18:00.720]  the crime and everything else they're not going to help the Haitians in Haiti
[18:00.720 --> 18:08.520]  the army's there locking down deciding who can come in with charity as they

[24:47.080 --> 24:51.440]  that's why Cliff John actually giving money for years to Haiti his own money so
[24:51.440 --> 24:58.240]  he's bad man I want to get him on but he's actually in Haiti right now risking
[24:58.240 --> 25:03.720]  his life if you got to give money to a big charity I've done the research over
[25:03.720 --> 25:09.440]  the years the Salvation Army has the highest rating I've seen of a big
[25:09.440 --> 25:16.040]  charity 90% of the money you give actually gets given to someone as food or
[25:16.040 --> 25:23.840]  blankets or cots or church services clothing and that's who when I was
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.720]  growing up in Dallas every Christmas every holiday we would go spend three
[25:29.720 --> 25:35.280]  or four hours several times down there donating and serving soup to people so
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.800]  that my parents would realize how well off I was you know being middle class
[25:39.800 --> 25:43.520]  could destroy your children unless you show them people on the other side of
[25:43.520 --> 25:50.400]  the tracks and I have yet I've taken my children to give it charities and you
[25:50.400 --> 25:55.760]  know to deliver clothes and food and to go give shoes and clothes to a local
[25:55.760 --> 26:01.120]  charity for Haiti but that's not enough I've got a even though I'm very busy I've
[26:01.120 --> 26:05.360]  got to get around to taking them down to really really see the homeless really
[26:05.360 --> 26:09.800]  witness it really witness people that are down and out it's very important for
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.720]  their education and I mean I'm not up here telling parents what to do with
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.440]  their children but it certainly was instrumental in my upbringing that at
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.400]  least be done a few times a year my cousin Buckley Hammond does a great
[26:23.400 --> 26:29.040]  job he was dating this girl he really liked and she was always going to a
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.560]  Methodist church that runs a soup kitchen what five days a week and now he
[26:33.560 --> 26:37.400]  does that pretty much full-time and it's spare time and loves it and it's
[26:37.400 --> 26:43.120]  it's it's it is better to give than to receive the problem is the globalist
[26:43.120 --> 26:50.040]  are masters at taking your donations your good will and using it towards evil
[26:50.040 --> 26:56.960]  that's why the best way to be involved in charities is at point blank range and
[26:56.960 --> 27:00.640]  charity starts in your own community and it starts it's a charity to the
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.440]  community to go speak out against gun control at your city council or against
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.640]  land grabbing you know helping people who are having their land stolen without
[27:09.640 --> 27:14.160]  just compensation all over the country by the environmentalist I mean do you
[27:14.160 --> 27:20.240]  know the type of looting and financial raping going on I mean do you know the
[27:20.240 --> 27:25.160]  CPS grabs over a million children a year without due process and they're five to
[27:25.160 --> 27:29.200]  seven times depending on what federal statistic more likely to abuse children
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.960]  than the other group that's charity real charity means defending people from
[27:33.960 --> 27:39.240]  criminals in government and so everything we do here is a defense of the
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.240]  innocent there are 9.88 million people as of a census a few years ago in Haiti
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.240]  it's well over 10 million now their population increases according to the
[27:49.240 --> 27:55.080]  World Parasite Bank World Bank by 1.44% a year and so this is a three-year-old
[27:55.080 --> 28:05.960]  census so I guess that must mean that's ranked 80 second largest population in
[28:05.960 --> 28:09.960]  the world so it's well over 10 million right now I guess that would make it
[28:09.960 --> 28:18.120]  about 12 million 13 million that are now in Haiti going off this older
[28:18.120 --> 28:25.360]  population number the language is Haitian Creole French and French 95% black
[28:25.360 --> 28:35.920]  5% white and mixed religion 95% Christianity 2.7% spiritualism that's
[28:35.920 --> 28:42.040]  the voodoo 95% Christian and people are saying oh because they got some voodoo
[28:42.040 --> 28:47.640]  down there they all deserve to die and it's judgment of God a lot of people
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.800]  been asking me is this an earthquake weapon I don't know Secretary of
[28:51.800 --> 29:00.360]  Defense in 1997 in a press conference with the Army Times April 28th 1997 said
[29:00.360 --> 29:06.960]  that we have earthquake weapons weather weapons and tectonic volcanic weapons
[29:06.960 --> 29:13.480]  the government said that I don't know that's true I know they've got systems
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.240]  since the 60s declassified five years ago that can create hurricanes and
[29:17.240 --> 29:20.960]  control them I know we've interviewed a lot of top meteorologists saying that
[29:20.960 --> 29:27.880]  Katrina was clearly unnatural I don't know but I sure know they're gonna use

[34:40.560 --> 34:48.000]  on this front so that is coming up i want to
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.120]  well i just have huge stacks of important news here i also want to open the
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.120]  phones up throughout the full broadcast today on any issue
[34:55.120 --> 34:59.760]  any news item any news story you wish to discuss with us
[34:59.760 --> 35:12.400]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 i want to blitz through some news
[35:12.400 --> 35:16.880]  here in a moment after i give you the latest on what's happening with the
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.600]  Haiti situation and my big concerns here
[35:21.600 --> 35:26.320]  but then we're going to go to your your phone calls i almost have a fear of
[35:26.320 --> 35:29.280]  going to the calls because every time i go to calls
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.200]  callers call in with breaking huge news that we then
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.200]  ferret out and confirm and it's always some new horrible
[35:37.200 --> 35:41.200]  violation of rights and freedoms going on covertly and illegally by the federal
[35:41.200 --> 35:46.400]  government at the local level but nevertheless we aren't going
[35:46.400 --> 35:52.320]  to your phone calls i mean i'm not here on this radio show
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.760]  trying to find evidence of government corruption
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.800]  there's so much of it i'm exhausted mentally psychologically spiritually
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.320]  i don't even want to learn more i don't even want to know more i'm like the
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.000]  general public i'm so deep down this rat hole
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.800]  this allison wonderland system that i can't believe it i can't believe the
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.040]  bold corruption now they're saying a new banker bailout
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.120]  trillions more robbing everything i mean i
[36:23.120 --> 36:27.680]  and then i see fake revolutions that are controlled by the government
[36:27.680 --> 36:32.080]  i mean this thing in massachusetts is wonderful on the surface
[36:32.080 --> 36:37.120]  i mean you've got a democrat controlled seat that's never been republican
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.480]  uh and it looks like the republicans going to win
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.280]  taking ted kennedy's seat and that shows that the ultra
[36:45.280 --> 36:50.480]  liberal brainwash collectivist in massachusetts have finally had enough
[36:50.480 --> 36:53.520]  and know that obama completely betrayed them
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.240]  and so they're hoping republicans won't betray them
[36:58.240 --> 37:01.680]  but the democrats don't care they say we don't care if it destroys our party
[37:01.680 --> 37:04.960]  we're going to pass government takeover of health care
[37:04.960 --> 37:08.800]  because they're bought and paid for by big banks and they're going to get
[37:08.800 --> 37:12.240]  multi-million-dollar jobs in the private sector as part of their payoffs and
[37:12.240 --> 37:16.320]  they don't care they're bank robbers they don't care if you don't like them
[37:16.320 --> 37:19.760]  and the republicans are going to betray you as they take over the house and
[37:19.760 --> 37:23.360]  send it in the next two to three years probably this year
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.680]  and then you watch just like when the democrats got in 2006 and the wars
[37:27.680 --> 37:33.040]  expanded obama gets in so we've got to ask ourselves
[37:33.040 --> 37:37.920]  how do we fix this when both parties whatever parties out of power poses as
[37:37.920 --> 37:41.440]  if they're patriots the republican party sounds like alex jones
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.040]  i mean dick army's talking about world government world so socialism new world
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.760]  order glenn beck is but what is glenn beck solution
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.160]  an excise tax and a sales tax i drove in the work this morning and tuned in to
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.320]  him i tuned in for five minutes spot checking
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.920]  different shows and he was saying we've got to have new taxes
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.120]  he had kramer on from cnbc oh we need new taxes
[38:07.120 --> 38:10.960]  oh it's so conservative to pay off this debt it's an illegal debt
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.680]  to foreign banks we don't need to pay it
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.520]  when they've got the supposed patriots pushing for new taxes ladies and
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.160]  gentlemen
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.840]  do you need me to explain to you that that's why he's benedict arnold
[38:25.840 --> 38:30.800]  i love napolitano i'm not going after beck because he's got the number one
[38:30.800 --> 38:35.280]  tv show on cable news i would love it if he was a real
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.360]  deal he's not they've got a little bit of napolitano
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.600]  they spice up here and there because he's for real and then
[38:43.600 --> 38:46.560]  they can get the whole libertarian ron paul audience with it
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.760]  and we need to put pressure on beck to knock it off
[38:49.760 --> 38:53.120]  he's got all these conservative zombies out there now chanting
[38:53.120 --> 39:00.720]  we need tax raise we need new taxes no no no no no
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.080]  that is not conservative every time i tune into the tv show or the radio show
[39:06.080 --> 39:11.200]  he's calling for taxes he must be doing this every five minutes
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.480]  i literally watch youtube clips of him two or three times a week of select
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.720]  things he does and a lot of times they we have multiple tv's on
[39:18.720 --> 39:22.720]  so we people can just monitor we have two tv's in the studio tv
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.400]  in the coffee room tv's back in the hallways
[39:26.400 --> 39:29.840]  on different c span different news channels and i'll be in there getting
[39:29.840 --> 39:32.080]  coffee at ten o'clock at night or something and
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.440]  they'll be rearing beck or it'll be five o'clock and i'm up here and they got
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.760]  him on and i'll be sitting there and it's just every time i see the deception
[39:39.760 --> 39:43.120]  i see the sucker punch i see the benedict arnold
[39:43.120 --> 39:48.720]  i mean and i don't want to be enemies with beck
[39:48.720 --> 39:52.560]  it's not good for my radio show it's not good
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.320]  for the success of what i do but it is good for the country and so i'm gonna
[39:56.320 --> 39:59.280]  ram him i'm gonna ram him politically just like you
[39:59.280 --> 40:02.640]  think it was popular to come out day one when they stage 9 11 and
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.160]  document how it was an inside job lost more than half my stations
[40:09.040 --> 40:14.480]  you think it was uh good to attack obama when he had an 85 86 87 depending on
[40:14.480 --> 40:19.200]  the poll approval rating i rammed him i rammed him the day he got elected as a
[40:19.200 --> 40:23.040]  trader i rammed him as soon as he got in
[40:23.040 --> 40:26.560]  office you think it was popular to come out day
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.120]  one with the obama deception and say he was a complete liar and betrayer
[40:31.120 --> 40:35.040]  now six eight months later i'm looking good aren't i
[40:35.040 --> 40:40.320]  because i told the truth i was right again and i told you obama's bad and i
[40:40.320 --> 40:43.360]  told you george bush was bad and i'm telling you glenn beck
[40:43.360 --> 40:51.600]  is bona fide evil all right i'm gonna shut up
[40:51.600 --> 40:58.640]  just a word to the wise is sufficient he called for the banker bailout and
[40:58.640 --> 41:02.320]  every time i mention that i get emails saying i'm a liar
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.080]  oh really just go to youtube and type in glenn beck supports bailout or go to
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.640]  the video clip glenn beck neocon not libertarian it has the clips of him
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.040]  calling ron paul a kook a nut saying arrest ron paul supporters
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.320]  they've got new clips of him a few months ago doing and he is a double
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.400]  talking piece of trash look i hate christ matthews
[41:22.400 --> 41:29.600]  i i can't stand him he makes me sick i he is an absolute piece of trash
[41:29.600 --> 41:33.760]  a race baiting person injecting racial division
[41:33.760 --> 41:37.520]  you know if you think obama's a socialist that's code word for the n word
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.520]  you know really evil stuff but at least he's evil and out in the open
[41:41.520 --> 41:46.000]  as an american hating piece of trash all right i said i was gonna cover
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.720]  hating get to other news and take your calls it's just
[41:50.720 --> 41:54.960]  i can't stand phoniness
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.640]  and i can't stand watching people getting conned i cannot
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.880]  abide it hey you want to get betrayed though go ahead just like you moron
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.880]  democrats you you are so stupid of course obama
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.200]  was a shell of course he was a con man of course he
[42:17.200 --> 42:22.720]  betrayed everything he said he'd do look at his donors look at who he appointed
[42:22.720 --> 42:26.080]  a year out during the election he was saying he'd end the war immediately
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.360]  in wiretapping in secret arrest in torture in end all the wars not hiring
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.080]  lobbyists and i said on air i said if this guy's for real
[42:36.080 --> 42:40.240]  they will assassinate him and there were stories about the secret
[42:40.240 --> 42:43.280]  service not protecting him in dallas and i said man this looks bad
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.360]  but i said because he's got rama manual behind him because he who's the guy
[42:47.360 --> 42:50.560]  that stopped the democrats from ending the war in 2006
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.960]  han showed that because he's got axl rod because of the people around him
[42:54.960 --> 42:58.080]  because of the fact he's gotten three to five times depending on the donor on
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.280]  average it's four times the wall street money mccain's got
[43:01.280 --> 43:07.280]  i said 98 chance this is a scam and then we knew it was a scam four
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.480]  months before he got elected in november of 2008
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.320]  because he immediately said i never said we were going to get out of iraq
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.400]  immediately 16 months by the time he got elected it
[43:18.400 --> 43:21.200]  was 20 months well i never said to get rid of the
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.160]  patriot act well i never said i wouldn't hire lobbyists well i never said i
[43:24.160 --> 43:26.880]  wouldn't have signing statements well and i said
[43:26.880 --> 43:30.240]  i said that said i've been recording everything he did been doing i they're
[43:30.240 --> 43:34.400]  building him up as this messianic leader he does have all these admitted
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.760]  authoritarians in his administration we declare war on obama in the info war
[43:39.760 --> 43:44.640]  and i began making the obama deception on election night
[43:44.640 --> 43:47.920]  i'd already quietly told my team three months before he's going to be the
[43:47.920 --> 43:51.600]  president he's going to betray we're going to make a film called the obama
[43:51.600 --> 43:54.640]  deception on him
[43:55.760 --> 43:59.280]  and we went into gear and the media said how did alex jones only a month and a
[43:59.280 --> 44:02.560]  half after he got in office already have a film out
[44:02.560 --> 44:06.480]  thing you know and and that was the that was the line on the george soros
[44:06.480 --> 44:11.040]  news websites was mr jones does a hate piece before obama's even had time to
[44:11.040 --> 44:14.000]  do anything making up all these lies
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.960]  meh meh meh you watch that film it is evergreen people watch it and they go
[44:18.960 --> 44:22.960]  how did this guy make this when obama had just been elected
[44:22.960 --> 44:26.960]  how did he know all this would happen because i can read all the white papers
[44:26.960 --> 44:30.320]  of every one of his cars i know what they think
[44:30.320 --> 44:33.520]  i stay up till three four in the morning reading what they say
[44:33.520 --> 44:36.640]  and then i get up here and i've got so much knowledge and information
[44:36.640 --> 44:41.040]  i can't even dump it all on you there's too much of it
[44:43.840 --> 44:48.800]  and guaranteed the republicans are going to get in and betray you and stage
[44:48.800 --> 44:53.680]  terror attacks and launch new wars and you know what i'm not saying vote for
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.080]  the democrats either i'm saying what do we do this is a scam
[44:58.080 --> 45:01.440]  it's like i'm at a don king boxing match and people are saying who you're gonna
[45:01.440 --> 45:04.320]  bet on alex who you're gonna bet on and i'm like i don't know i don't know who
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.560]  don kings has has rigged this for he owns both the fighters
[45:08.560 --> 45:11.520]  they're like but don't you like the boxing match alex don't you don't you
[45:11.520 --> 45:15.280]  think this guy's got you know better punching power and more stamina it
[45:15.280 --> 45:18.880]  doesn't matter it's rigged don't you people get it
[45:18.880 --> 45:25.200]  i don't know what we do but i can't just play along with this phony
[45:25.200 --> 45:30.560]  baloney narrative you know i do know what we do but it's a wide range of things
[45:30.560 --> 45:34.400]  we get libertarians and republicans
[45:34.400 --> 45:40.320]  elected who have the bona fides who have the facts who have the pedigree
[45:40.320 --> 45:43.920]  like ron paul like deborah medina people like that we
[45:43.920 --> 45:47.280]  you you you run for office for whether it's dog catcher
[45:47.280 --> 45:52.160]  or or the school board or mayor or whatever it is or the water district
[45:52.160 --> 45:55.600]  believe me there's corruption going on everywhere one good person in one of
[45:55.600 --> 45:59.840]  those bodies can sabotage the corruption
[45:59.840 --> 46:03.040]  you just get up and start fighting doesn't mean you got all the answers
[46:03.040 --> 46:09.040]  doesn't mean you land every punch but i mean just get it going folks
[46:09.040 --> 46:11.920]  i'm sure a lot of you have been in a fist fight
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.080]  with some bully i mean you don't sit there and calculate it all you just
[46:16.080 --> 46:20.880]  you stop somebody just start stomping
[46:20.880 --> 46:26.480]  open up a can of resistance it's like cleaning your garage you know you hadn't
[46:26.480 --> 46:30.400]  cleaned it in three four years it's full of crud just jam packed full of spider
[46:30.400 --> 46:33.600]  webs and garbage and christmas ornaments and
[46:33.600 --> 46:37.520]  everything else and old clothes and you if you sit there and eat around the
[46:37.520 --> 46:42.320]  edges of it and fiddle prattle with it you'll never get it done
[46:42.320 --> 46:45.840]  you just got to get going does it mean you're going to get it all done right
[46:45.840 --> 46:49.360]  does it mean you're going to get it all done that day no but you just start
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.920]  getting aggressive and taking action
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.640]  that's what you do and you get your states
[46:58.640 --> 47:02.720]  which are on the verge of of revolting
[47:02.720 --> 47:05.920]  under the constitution it's already happening you get them to say no to the
[47:05.920 --> 47:10.000]  feds you discredit the government you discredit both parties you expose

[56:21.680 --> 56:27.040]  on the haiti situation plan to bring Haitians to central florida
[56:27.040 --> 56:31.280]  not set in stone wftv that's because there's opposition they'll tell you it's
[56:31.280 --> 56:35.440]  not set in stone so you'll stand down so they can ship them all in
[56:35.440 --> 56:38.480]  who knows how many of the 10 million Haitians they'll ship in so they're just
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.760]  helping them in their country the american red cross says they plan to bring
[56:41.760 --> 56:44.800]  45 000 evacuees from haiti to florida
[56:44.800 --> 56:47.760]  and 4 000 of those to orange county is not set in stone
[56:47.760 --> 56:52.000]  the red cross clarified friday who could be involved in the plan
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.960]  to move people out of haiti the red cross is preparing for two things the
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.160]  re-patriation of americans living in haiti and the possibility of a mass
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.600]  migration of Haitian nationals
[57:04.160 --> 57:08.480]  american red cross has seen massive migration to us from areas like kosovo
[57:08.480 --> 57:12.080]  bosnia in the past so we're so we're setting the precedent that every time
[57:12.080 --> 57:15.520]  there's a tsunami or an earthquake or a fire
[57:15.520 --> 57:21.200]  of the six plus billion people living outside the us what is it six billion
[57:21.200 --> 57:24.640]  500 million because there's close to seven billion people in the world now
[57:24.640 --> 57:30.000]  what is there six billion nine hundred million conservatively
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.160]  and 300 million are in the us so i guess you know over six billion get to come
[57:34.160 --> 57:37.200]  here and then we can have a big government welfare system and give them
[57:37.200 --> 57:40.320]  all money and goodies you go to big cities and
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.440]  it's seems like all they hire on the police force is foreigners that can't
[57:43.440 --> 57:46.640]  speak english and they walk over and say

[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:49.120]  hi alex um i just wanted to tell you um i'm i'm evasion uh descent like both my
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:53.440]  parents are asian and i was born in uh montreal and then i moved to toronto
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:59.600]  like a few years after that um i i i wanted to i'm very proud to be asian
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:03.120]  like i love it it's a beautiful place when i was from
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.600]  three to five i was there also and i also understand that it's like it's a very
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.040]  complicated complicated question the asian question
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:14.560]  because um it was the first one to get a it's it's
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:19.040]  independence by force um yeah it was the Haitians beating the
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:23.360]  french that that that that that made napoleon sell
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:27.680]  13 states and the lusiana purchase and uh
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:30.720]  haiti led the charge in latin america and the caribbean
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:34.160]  to throw out the spanish the french and the empire
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:37.360]  and so haiti has always been basically embargoed
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:42.000]  and maneuvered into the position it's in that's right that's right and see i was
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.040]  involved in on and on and on with all the
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:48.320]  the puppet uh and that's why they don't want
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:51.920]  that's why they don't want real uh charities
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:56.160]  to be able to give money to the people of haiti that's why they're demonizing
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:01.440]  people that's right now my my my me question to you um
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.360]  when it when it came to the actual uh earthquake
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:09.760]  because the first thing that came into my mind when it happened and everything
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:14.480]  was so coordinated i said this is a hard weapon
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:19.680]  um uh operation uh tautonic weapon operation as a first thing that came
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:23.360]  into my mind well the the the the white house um
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:33.360]  the secretary of defense uh in 1997 uh said that they have these weapons so
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:39.840]  that what do you think you know i i rarely speculate and i don't know
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:44.160]  um we know bill clinton was made the envoy what a year ago
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.280]  we know that was already prepositioning going on we know that in
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:51.600]  the first big flood in new orleans in the 20s it's not a conspiracy theory i
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:55.760]  have a Pulitzer prize winning book on it they blew up the levees to flood the
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:58.320]  poor areas that that's a fact that's why people
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:04.400]  when it happened years later uh with Katrina and there were reports of
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:08.800]  explosions thought they blew up the levees because it was done before we
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:13.040]  know they can control hurricanes uh and again secretary
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:17.120]  defense cohen said that as well we know they have these systems
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:21.600]  and so again i can't come out and say that they did it
[1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:26.000]  uh because you do have natural earthquakes uh in that area though you
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.200]  don't have a lot of earthquakes in that area of the caribbean
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:33.600]  and the whole thing is very very suspicious uh but i don't know
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:37.120]  that that that's that's what i i was thinking like when it
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:40.160]  is the first thing that happened i just said to me it just seems to
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:44.000]  coordinated like clinton it is like theater you know uh
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.640]  clinton coming out and she's saying oh my god i'm canceling my trip
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:52.880]  i just as like i don't believe this uh it's well i don't believe it either
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:56.880]  so so 10 million people in Haiti have you talked any family there i mean how
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:01.920]  hellish is it really well okay this is how serious it is um
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:06.240]  my mom okay i have a friend who's a dentist he went down to do a week of
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:11.360]  charity work the two hours before the the earthquake hit
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:14.560]  he left now my mom was still there because she
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.240]  used to help him also with that but she is down there also to open up a school
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:21.760]  to do charity work also herself because she's an artist she's a singer
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:26.160]  so she was there for three days we were just going
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:29.360]  nuts because we didn't hear from her the communication was cut
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:32.960]  we you know we were crying we're just we don't know what's going on
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:36.320]  finally we've got we got a hold of her they're flying her
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:42.320]  back in today um stay there stay there riko i want to come back to you and
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:45.920]  uh through your mother get reports of what she said is going on and
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:49.360]  you know you've got skin in the game and and and so to get your view on that
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.440]  also researching the amazing racism in the caravan you think there's racism in
[1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:57.280]  the united states or canada against Haitians uh by the
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:00.400]  dominican republic i want to get your take on that stay with us
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:03.600]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:07.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:11.360]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.200]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:27.280]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:31.200]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.320]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:38.240]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:41.120]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:44.240]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.960]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:35.520]  remember danie glubber's ridiculous statement that global warming
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.680]  is what caused what happened in Haiti the atmosphere has nothing to do

[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:49.040]  calls finishing up with rico in toronto he's a
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:54.080]  canadian of hasian descent his mother was down there doing charity work hasians
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:58.080]  really try to give back statistically and go back to their
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:01.760]  original home country to help the people there
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:05.680]  and his mother is is still there rico finish up with what she told you she
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:09.600]  saw she said that poor prince is just
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:13.920]  basically just dead bodies just that's all it was she was staying
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:17.280]  away from there because it is just it you know they
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:20.480]  also have nothing to live on right because it's a city so everything in
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:22.720]  the city needs to come in it's not like the country
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:26.400]  where you can you know pick a mango or you know fish or something like that
[1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:30.960]  like it's just just dead bodies and just like
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:34.480]  pain and then just people dead you know what i mean
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:39.760]  just um a trail a trail of them so she she was a machine called us
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.480]  she was saying that she was actually staying away from there
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:48.000]  and um did she thank and god we're lucky she's she's coming back today
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.520]  so they flew her out um because she does have a citizenship
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:55.280]  and stuff she so she was in a smaller town or city
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:59.360]  uh when it hit she said she was
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:03.840]  uh in a bathroom she was in Port-au-Prince and she said she
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:08.240]  she was she was going to go to the bathroom and uh it she said everything
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:13.600]  started shaking and lucky for her the door uh to the bathroom was very close
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:17.440]  to the door to go outside so she just ran outside and
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:21.120]  she said uh that's when everything started falling and and stuff like that
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:24.640]  but she was she was really lucky and she she just said after that it was just
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:28.160]  like it's bad and what i'm seeing is just that making it worse
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:32.000]  you know but not the same thing as Katrina like the same pattern
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.440]  the same pattern it's like that's right the military's gone in the french
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:38.080]  government saying the u.s. military is locking it down
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:41.440]  and not letting aid in because they've got a control freak it
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  and and quote have a security perimeter and so it's clearly making it a lot
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.360]  worse that's what government always does
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:54.320]  yeah i that that i know you know by just looking at history yep
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:11:01.120]  so uh but uh we're lucky we're one of the lucky ones um you know the the
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:05.360]  her story so whatever fent fantastic or one of the fantastic stories
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:08.800]  that the news media is meeting us at the airport today when we go pick her up
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.080]  because she's coming in at uh 3 30 eastern standard time
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:14.880]  so we'll be go picking her up and at Pearson
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:18.480]  and um they're gonna be coming to cover also
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:25.120]  well riko before you leave google secretary of defense william cohen
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.720]  uh earthquake and weather weapons and you'll get army times
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:35.440]  april 27th or 28th i think it's 28th 1997 and you can hold it up to the news
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:39.120]  camera and say secretary of defense cohen said they
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.880]  have earthquake weapons this needs to be investigated if they say you're a
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:46.320]  kook say hey army times i mean we're only asking the
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:49.360]  question but there are natural earthquakes there are natural
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:53.120]  tsunamis i mean for americans many geologists we've
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:57.120]  had on say there's a real danger of the mega caldera the mega
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:00.320]  supervolcano that covers part of four states
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:04.160]  centering in and around yellowstone could explode
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:09.040]  uh in the next uh few decades and if that sucker goes off
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:12.960]  i mean again they're talking about man destroying the earth
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:16.720]  carbon dioxide hurting the planet this is a planet
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:21.120]  with floating continents on top of lava
[1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:24.160]  thousands and thousands and thousands of degrees
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.160]  floating around on lava huge asteroids comets hit us we're
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:33.200]  we're we're we're beamed and energized by high powered radiation from a huge
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:35.840]  sun i mean it's just in fact he just pulled up the
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:43.040]  article cohen addresses 428 uh at conference on terrorism
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:46.800]  and so again let me see january February march April yeah 428 i was
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:50.080]  right my memory terrorism's weapons of mass destruction
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.040]  and the u.s strategy uh at the nun policy forum
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:58.880]  april 28th 97 university of georgia athens georgia
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:02.400]  uh you actually found the transcript itself go ahead and print that for me
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.080]  but army times also reported his quotes about the
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:11.120]  earthquake and weather weapons but there it is i'm only reporting what's real
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.680]  and by 1967 the u.s government had certified that they had
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:19.040]  weather weapons they'd already used them all over the world
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:21.760]  but they certified that they had control of the weather then
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:25.600]  they're just now introducing that to the public well riko do you have any
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:29.600]  ideas of good charities that we can give to i mean clearly they're
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:33.840]  demonizing uh why cliff john's charity because he gave 411
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:38.000]  thousand dollars more of his own money than what even came in that they say
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.680]  that's bad uh so that's a that's a very good question
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.360]  and since i'm i'm actually getting the chance to speak to such a large audience
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:49.200]  let me ask my sister because she's involved with that in uh miracle
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:56.320]  what do you what sorry what sorry what what sorry what what charities would be
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:01.680]  good because i was going to ask me to give
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:12.000]  okay there's no other ones okay okay the problem is the red cross
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:15.600]  usually steals half the money but uh but i guess she's saying they're the big
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:18.560]  force on the ground so even if they steal half of it is she's saying give it to
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:21.440]  them because i guess at least something don't get there
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:24.160]  well that's what she's saying she's saying that the only ones right now
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.880]  they don't want to we're bringing my mom back and it's
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:31.280]  but see that's why the Pentagon is only letting them in do you see that
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:39.120]  yes that's because they approved the sanctions you know um and it's it's too
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:43.440]  bad it's oh that's right they were already sanctions on Haiti
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:48.320]  yes yes there was
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:50.320]  your world
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:56.960]  okay she was saying that uh on cnc and impact
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:01.600]  the the like their webpage uh impact the world there's there's a list
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.040]  of smaller ones who are not like red cross associated
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:09.360]  who might be a little more effective well hold on hold on uh riko tell me
[1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:12.640]  about has i forgotten about the sanctions on them
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:17.600]  um they're still having they're still have sanctions on them even during this
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.960]  uh that i know of no but i mean you you just look at it like the the the
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:26.240]  government is is ineffective it's always been like that
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:29.520]  like i'm the asian you know that when you go it's just like
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:32.960]  they don't they don't they just come there to make money you get politics in
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.200]  the 80s because you want to make money you you you basically you want to
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:41.440]  scan you want to steal you know what i mean you want a big armor compound
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:45.280]  you want bodyguards like you want that it's just there to make money
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:49.120]  like it's always been the same thing it's not it doesn't have the leaders
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:53.680]  of um like that it's good like canada united states even though they do the
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:57.760]  same thing you know what i mean this this government's always do this
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:00.880]  like that's what they do what about habitat for humanity uh they're they're
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:04.480]  pretty good yes yes i would i would say that they're better
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:09.200]  because um like the red cross uh i remember even seeing an interview when
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:12.240]  even when the hand of that that happened and they were saying that the woman
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:15.680]  it was vp there was making $250,000 a year
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:18.880]  well it's not just that they they kept like two billion of it and just
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:22.560]  gave it to themselves well listen rico keep calling in to give us updates god
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:25.280]  bless you and call us back tomorrow to give us an update once
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:28.240]  once your mother's home today okay thank you alex
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:31.120]  thank you rico well that's good news his mom's getting back maybe we can have
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:35.760]  her on rico very interesting uh let's go ahead and talk to greg and
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:38.480]  wisconsin greg thanks for holding her on the air
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:42.080]  hey alex how you doing i'm doing all right first off
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:45.520]  first off uh i don't think the idea of controlled earthquakes is
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:50.080]  too far fetched at all i mean every time they need a distraction
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:54.000]  uh what happens you know they admit they have it there needs to be an
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:57.920]  investigation of that but i i can't say that we know that's what
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:00.640]  happened yeah i can't say it either i mean it's
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:05.200]  ironic the night before the earthquake me and my fiance were watching 2012 we
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:09.760]  wake up the next day and an earthquake hit i'm like damn
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:15.120]  yeah what do you think of jessie ventura's last show in the uh season
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:19.280]  what are you talking about the 2012 oh you're about 2012 the movie uh i i thought
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:22.240]  you were talking about 2012 jessie ventura's tv show
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:26.240]  nope i have not seen that but i do like jessie ventura and i i listen to him
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:31.200]  when you have him on the air i did i was just watching cnn a 5.8
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:34.800]  earthquake just hit the caiman island about an hour and a half ago
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:39.840]  two hours ago um well don't worry algore will save us if we just pay him some
[1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:43.120]  tax money he'll make he'll wave him magic wine
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:46.480]  i mean literally every time there's any type of weather or an earthquake they
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:50.160]  say it's global warming it's not i mean next they're going to say if you slip
[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:54.240]  and fall in a banana peel just pay algore attacks that'll fix it
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:58.560]  yeah exactly but uh the the reason i was calling and i was watching cnn
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:02.400]  Friday night larry king live and i caught a clip
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:07.040]  and i mean it's stage media all the way uh this guy he's getting interviewed and
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:10.080]  you can tell the whole time that he's talking
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:13.360]  uh he's being told what to say he doesn't even know what he's saying he was
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:17.040]  supposedly in the earthquake and i mean if i could play it over the
[1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:21.040]  air for you i'd love for you guys to hear it i i i need people to hear this
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:23.840]  put your phone right up put your phone right up to the speaker go ahead and

[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:47.040]  thanks for holding her on the air hi alex i welcome six hundred dollars to
[1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:50.800]  the red cross in july 2008 because of the floods in
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:54.560]  iowa and i guess three hundred dollars that went to
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:58.800]  anti-gun groups well roughly yes they always say they're
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:02.000]  spending all the money on aid and they keep more than half
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.600]  generally and then yes that's mainstream news
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:11.040]  oklahoma city 9 11 every other major event they just pocket it and then the
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:14.400]  government lets them do it because they then give it to non-governmental
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.800]  land grabbers gun grabbers absolutely well i had a
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:23.280]  a better business bureau donation guide and
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:27.920]  they they gave a red cross their highest rating
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:32.160]  so that's how the system sir don't believe me just google red cross caught
[1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:36.000]  stealing money oklahoma city red cross in trouble for keeping the money
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.960]  you i mean you didn't hear about that huge national scandal with united way and
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:42.320]  red cross what they raised six billion and kept over three billion for
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:45.520]  themselves i know about united way they give to a
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:49.440]  planned parenthood so i never give you know that's all the same red cross
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:53.360]  united way is probably worse all right so is there a
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:57.120]  like a website organization that i can contact they can
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:01.360]  you know give me uh better information than the better business bureau about
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:04.480]  these charities you know whether or not they give to these
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:09.040]  you know pro-abortion anti-gun groups etc well i'm looking at seeing an end's
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:14.320]  list and i see world vision in there that's an admitted cia front
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:19.600]  see they love reporters they love uh missionaries aid groups
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:22.320]  to take them over because they're a perfect cover
[1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:25.600]  and world vision is one of their biggest covers i mean i i wouldn't give to
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:29.440]  anybody i i mean do they even link salvation army of
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:33.040]  these hundred or so things on cnn guys do a control
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:39.280]  f and see if salvation army look under s uh is salvation army even on there
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:42.960]  okay salvation armies on there so we know cnn's got one good group
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:47.040]  and that doesn't mean salvation army's perfect but i mean that they
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:50.240]  i've researched myself and that's that's one of the better big ones
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:53.920]  and they are in Haiti so i would give the salvation army
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:57.440]  because it's more of a libertarian slash conservative group that i know they
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:00.560]  don't give money to the gun grabbers or land grabbers
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.520]  and i know that they have one of the highest ratios of
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:08.640]  what 90 percent or more of the money you give to them goes directly to aid
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:13.200]  directly to helping people so what about if i want to check into
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:18.160]  another charity how would i do that uh to you know get all the
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:23.680]  information about you know another charity besides the salvation army
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:26.560]  any group you think about giving to go do cross
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:29.760]  web searches start page dot com searches whatever google
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:33.920]  do do cross searches for groups they're supporting and working with
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:37.680]  and i've got to tell you most of them are that's how the globalists take over
[1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:40.880]  they they get us who mean well to give money and then
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.600]  they use it against us uh but i mean again i'm no super mega
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:50.880]  expert on charities i just know red cross united way
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:57.120]  have been caught in every case swindling and that's just a fact
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:00.800]  people weren't as aware of this back in 2001 i went on air and said don't give
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:03.280]  money to them they're gonna they're gonna steal most of it and then
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:06.480]  people got really mad but then a month later i got all these apologies going
[1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:10.800]  how did you know that well i mean sir in oklahoma city the government made the
[1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:13.760]  red cross the head group that was able to take all the
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:18.080]  mail coming into the post of postal service and they would take large checks
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:21.520]  given to people by name that they saw on television and they would
[1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:26.160]  endorse it over to themselves that's daily oklahoma i mean i mean you talk
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:31.120]  about hard core evil um that doesn't mean the average
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:34.960]  volunteer for red crosses bad and red cross does do some good
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:38.640]  uh the average person out there giving people gatorade blankets they're good
[1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:42.480]  people uh it's just that when you give them money
[1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:45.360]  they give it to handgun control incorporated in the violence policy
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:48.640]  center and they come after your guns

[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:27.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:31.200]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a

[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:38.800]  that yeah what i said is i have seen the video i've
[1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:45.120]  got it somewhere around here in 1968 charleston heston did tv ads
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:49.200]  pushing for the passage of the 1968 gun control act
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:51.760]  like i'll just get larry pratt to tell you about it the head of governors of
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:54.720]  america i've interviewed heston he later
[1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:57.760]  apologized about it there were riots all over the country
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:00.800]  the nra was set up by the federal government because the northerners couldn't
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:04.400]  shoot as good as the southerners it was set up to get people ready to shoot
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:10.640]  better for war uh it's always been like that uh the nra
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:13.520]  called me an extremist when i was trying to beat
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:17.040]  the bill they had in 2000 in texas and the dallas morning news they called me
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:20.160]  an extremist that you know they said oh we don't have an opinion
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:24.560]  on this gun show loophole bill and a bill to ban jr shooting sports
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:28.160]  and that's when i found out and all these pro gun experts said you didn't know
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:32.480]  they're a shill organization i mean look they got what is it 10 million
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:35.360]  members or something and they can't ever seem to stop anything or turn anything
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:38.560]  back uh and and and they argued in the federal
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:42.000]  case in dc that oh we agree with some gun control
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  just not that you can totally be banned and so they're
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.600]  you know they kind of play the middle of the road which then makes us go ahead
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:53.440]  and capitulate and uh you got great nra members
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:56.720]  a lot of their own board members have gone public and criticized them
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:59.600]  uh in fact i'll bring that up to larry pratt when he's on with us so he can
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:02.960]  we've we've got a whole show of them where he reads the quotes from them and
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:07.680]  the uh things they've done yes the nr a uh you know as much as they wave
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:11.680]  muskets around in the air is a mega compromise
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:15.920]  organization isn't it a lobbyist group basically
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:19.440]  yes so we should stop giving our money to them i mean hell
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:24.080]  it's set it's set there in the second amendment right to bare arms so i mean
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:27.280]  you know why do we have to have somebody
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:31.360]  bribing our politicians to keep our gun rights that's all i wanted to say
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:35.200]  take it easy virtual i appreciate it well you do need gun owners of america
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:39.840]  and the nr a and your local state organizations like
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:43.680]  texas rifle association if we didn't have them it'd be over
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:48.000]  the problem is the nr a always kicks good people off their board
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:54.320]  and if we had a real nr a our problems would be over very very quickly
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:59.200]  okay let's go ahead and talk to step in texas step
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:03.280]  you're on the air thank you for taking my call sir um
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:07.440]  was kind of listened to your show for the last couple of days and uh
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:14.160]  really kind of considering the um attitude of law enforcement towards us
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:20.960]  and this is the thing that i find most uh shocking how did they develop a
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.720]  attitude to hate their neighbor i don't get that
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:28.880]  i just well that's not all the police but big cities
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:33.760]  have hired people with under hundred iqs as official policy that's in msnbc
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:36.160]  saying how great it is people never believe that when i say it
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:39.600]  that has been going on for over 15 years that i know of
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:44.080]  um they then tell them everybody hates you everybody's out to get you you've
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.960]  got to stick together uh they teach them in this
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:51.120]  threat continuum a force that you've got to be in control of the situation that
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:53.680]  if someone argues with you go ahead and taser them
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:57.360]  that you can have pain compliance or torture people they've been taught to
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:01.120]  torture but it's not a big issue unless you torture somebody in abu graib
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:07.360]  if you do it here it's okay uh they have um really gotten the police i mean look
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:11.680]  they hire a bunch of people from big cities who've never had parents that
[1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:14.080]  taught them how to shoot they don't come from a true
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:18.080]  conservative culture and they're just really scared to death i mean i see cops
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:21.360]  pulling over old ladies who were scared when the cops walking up they're
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:24.080]  shaking they think everybody's out to kill them everybody's
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:29.040]  out to shoot them they hire a lot of wimps who are just so scared
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:32.720]  that they're trigger happy and so they just go into this bullying
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:37.200]  and i've and they also train cops that you know it's up to them to do whatever
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:40.400]  they want i mean i've had cops all over the country
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:44.800]  in dc and new york and austin and you walk up and say you can't videotape on
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:48.080]  the street you can't be here and i go first amendment pal
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:50.400]  when they say i'm gonna arrest you and start grabbing their handcuffs and
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:53.680]  they're gone and i go go ahead i'm gonna sue you you know what you're doing is
[1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:56.480]  illegal and they back off the average people actually
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:01.200]  have been arrested a few times for that the average person doesn't back off
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:04.880]  i mean the average person does back off and so the police don't back off i mean
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:07.920]  you gotta let them know that when they get outside the constitution bill of
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:12.160]  rights they're engaging in crime and the constitution says punish them
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:14.720]  particularly bad when they violate their oath of
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:17.120]  office i mean they're at a higher standard
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:20.480]  not at a lower standard but all the culture the movies
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:25.280]  you know glorify this tough guy fake tough guy attitude
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:29.600]  you know kicking butt taking names and and and that's how they've
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:35.200]  turned the police more and more into an agent of tyranny
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:38.400]  uh... i was doing a bunch of people uh...
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:42.640]  uh... work for myself last week and i was doing some research on
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:45.440]  on the you should see tonight and i had to get me
[1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:50.080]  just kind of stumbled into the uh... national law law enforcement
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:54.640]  uh... community website called police link run by monster
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.360]  uh... and on that website uh... you have cops from from all over the
[1:38:59.360 --> 1:39:04.000]  country uh... and what they had to say in their
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:07.600]  little forums i encourage everyone to go to that form and look at what
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:10.560]  they're saying uh... they don't care about the law
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:13.680]  they don't care about the cops the constitution
[1:39:13.680 --> 1:39:17.600]  they don't care about what courts say they actually accused me
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.320]  of inventing the ucc they they're actually going out there
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:26.880]  and saying that i invented a quote oh no no no listen listen
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:32.000]  they now say the second amendment government does as a conspiracy theory
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.960]  they say that there was a Copenhagen summit calling for world government
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.480]  doesn't exist they say all law doesn't exist and
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:42.960]  that's the attitude they laugh uh... i mean i've had austin cops laugh
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:45.680]  at me when i tell them things and they make jokes out of it
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:50.400]  and yes i've been on police forums and and it is scary
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:56.240]  and and i suggest that you write an article and and pull out quotes and
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:00.240]  then links to what page it's on and just point out what they're saying and
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.480]  send it to writers at info wars dot com and if it's a balanced
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:07.520]  you know article that has that proves what it says will post it
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:10.800]  send it to writers at info wars dot com a lot of great articles
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:13.760]  that listeners are writing that we're posting we post most of most of stuff
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:17.440]  you write is really informative kurt goes over it paul goes over it
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:20.880]  and we end up posting it but i we don't have the time or energy that you know
[1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:26.800]  i've seen that that's a great issue go into the police message boards
[1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:31.280]  uh... like police link and i've i've been on there and i i can't even read it
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:33.840]  i mean they talk about us like we are the enemy
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:38.160]  now again you go to other more conservative or libertarian police sites
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:43.680]  they are very well-spoken i mean you hear the police that call into this show
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:49.200]  they don't stutter they's very smooth
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:53.280]  very well-spoken every cop that's a fan of the show that's ever called
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:56.880]  sounds like they ought to be a corporate executive now you listen to these
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:00.080]  thugs on videotapes and things bragging about what they do to people
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:05.120]  it's like oh yeah dude i mean that's who they want
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:08.720]  and so cops that think it's funny to violate the bill rights constitution
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:12.800]  are literally morons just like the general public they're drawing from the
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:16.400]  general public they take these weak people who are bullies
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:20.960]  or who want to be tough who want some petty power
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:24.640]  i mean i mean before they tried to hire the quiet focused
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.160]  it's really strong people that wanted to be guardians
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:31.440]  uh... peacekeepers that's what police were
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:36.960]  uh... and uh... then the new york chicago mafia model of police
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:41.840]  became the national template and notice big cities never hire never
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:45.360]  higher in in the department from somebody whose family's been there for
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:50.000]  a hundred years or fifty years they always hire from new york chicago
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.600]  or los angeles they always hire
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.280]  i mean the cia openly runs the la pd and the
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:01.280]  highway patrol in california and if you notice
[1:42:01.280 --> 1:42:04.960]  austin's police chiefs from the highway patrol they're now with the marines
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:08.720]  running checkpoints in california i mean that's who they hire they hire them
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:11.200]  they bring them in they put in the culture
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:14.560]  and uh... i watch these police videos where
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:17.680]  they're beating people up in the jail cells laughing
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:20.720]  and then you'll see them do news interviews later and they can't even talk
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:23.920]  there's like
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:28.000]  and i mean you look you give a low-grade moron
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.600]  a gun and power and you say hey the bill of rights constitution
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:35.440]  that don't exist compare with detail
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:40.320]  the funny man black helicopter gonna get to me
[1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:44.400]  and uh... i mean that's what tyranny is is a bunch of
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:47.840]  i mean you watch clockwork orange of a futuristic nightmare police state
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:52.560]  they hire a couple former street gang thugs who've got iqs of about 80 points
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:56.640]  and they're like it's no longer officer demoskey
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:00.000]  it's no longer dim it's officer demoskey
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.680]  oh now i'm gonna torture you

[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:27.600]  everyone thinks we're crazy really ninety eight percent were against the
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:31.360]  banker bailout and gallup poll ninety one percent gallup poll are against
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:35.200]  open borders upwards of eighty percent are against new gun laws and are pro
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:39.280]  gun and major polls uh... the public
[1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:43.280]  hates both parties now open world governments now being admitted people
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:44.880]  are starting to really wake up
[1:44:44.880 --> 1:44:47.920]  but what i found is and and good salesmen will tell you this
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:51.360]  you can never sell products even if they're great products to your friends
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:54.960]  your family your neighbors people you don't know
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:58.880]  uh... have a tendency to listen to you because people that know you have some
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:02.880]  type of weird psychological contempt for their peers
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:06.400]  they think you're showing off to them like like i was talking about you know
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:09.920]  officer demoskey like you know how to talk
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:14.080]  are you showing off to me uh... brian
[1:45:14.080 --> 1:45:17.600]  uh... and so just move on i mean let me guess you're trying to talk to your
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:21.280]  co-workers and people and they like to sit there a little feel good clicks and
[1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:24.080]  you know they're you know the economy's not falling apart of
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:28.560]  uh... the the jobless rate isn't twenty percent
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:32.160]  uh... everything's wonderful well good we don't need those tv heads
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:35.920]  that only know the football scores move on get involved in organizations and
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:39.520]  groups are found one locally and find people that do want to take action
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:44.320]  wear a patriot t-shirt walk around the street walk into stores and businesses
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:48.080]  and bars you'll find fellow minded people and take action
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:51.680]  and big things start small i mean so you make the announcement here
[1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:54.800]  brian nobody listens to you what does that mean
[1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:59.120]  well you know i'm almost done with people now but uh...
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:02.640]  let me guess are they i mean i mean i mean are they your friends your family
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:06.640]  co-workers everybody my family i have uh...
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:10.640]  alienated many many friends but uh... now
[1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:13.920]  well i mean maybe it's your approach i mean because i've woken up tens of
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:17.600]  millions of people uh... you gotta be authoritative you gotta be focused you
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:20.240]  gotta have the facts i mean have you ever tried the approach of hey tell me
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:23.200]  what you think of this film you ever given him a fall the republic
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:28.080]  oh yeah oh yeah some people won't even bother to watch it at all
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:32.160]  so you've never had any success just just nothing zero
[1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:37.760]  slowly i am slowly i am but it's so you are having some success
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:41.840]  yes i am yes i am well because you said they all
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:47.360]  they all most people um what i wanted to talk to you about is i'm a senior in
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:54.080]  electrical engineering student and uh... my hero is nicole tesla
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:56.960]  and they don't want you to know about this guy at all
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:00.400]  yeah the fb i read him took everything he had but but but going back to the
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:03.920]  school you got a bunch of stupid yuppie kids
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:08.080]  in there who who all they know about is this tv show lost
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:12.320]  or dancing with the stars of the nfl and they are intimidated when you talk
[1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:15.120]  about things see so that's what that giggling and
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:19.040]  laughing is because there's nothing between their ears brother
[1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:23.360]  yeah well nobody knows really anything point is i wanted to make that's why
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:25.520]  the government's gonna gang rape him real good
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:31.520]  i'm sorry go ahead yeah um nicole tesla like some sometime in the 20s or
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:35.200]  something like that and then an earthquake machine
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:41.040]  yes we did um so that was in the 20s everything in the universe
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:44.960]  of is vibrating everything has a resonant frequency
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:48.000]  and if you tap the earth at its resonant frequency
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:52.720]  it starts uh vibrating stronger and stronger and stronger yeah i mean see i
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:56.240]  don't even go off that i just have the secretary of defense army times saying
[1:47:56.240 --> 1:47:59.760]  we have the earthquake weapons i mean i i just bypassed directly to them saying
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:01.600]  it and that's how you wake people up you say
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:06.480]  oh here's the government admitting it so i mean and and then the debate's over
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:10.800]  oh here's the government admitting this gmo corn causes liver failure
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:14.240]  i mean it's just boom boom point blank range with the info
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:18.640]  but yes he did work on seismic tectonic uh vibration systems
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:22.560]  the problem is there's a lot of kooks that then will sell a glass jar with some
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:25.040]  christmas tree lights in it and say it'll cure cancer
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:28.960]  and it's not a true tesla wave system and they've never really studied it
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:32.320]  enough so you have quacks claiming we understand the technology
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:37.040]  and really only nicola and nicola tesla did
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:40.880]  so that was in the 20s like so what do you think they have now you know
[1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:45.440]  another we know what they have now sir they have uh earthquake weapons seismic
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:51.440]  systems using tesla uh coil um systems they have uh
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:55.280]  patented nuke systems where they drill down on the ocean floor
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:58.400]  generally off an ocean island to cause a tsunami weapon
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:02.800]  or an earthquake weapon that was declassified 1954
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:06.720]  uh source of that is sydney mourning herald associated press that came out
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:10.640]  what eight years ago uh the secretary of defense admits they
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:13.920]  have tectonic volcanic weapons uh i've had been
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:17.120]  livings in the father of weather weapons stanford research institute
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:22.080]  certified 1967 uh with uh hurricane weapon systems they
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:25.840]  can do it with eight aircraft i mean just on and on but no one ever
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:28.640]  talks about the white house admitting chemtrails all admitted they're
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:31.760]  spraying us everyone just speculates and only talks
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:35.360]  about rumors when it's all out in the open hitting us hitting us hard but i
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:39.200]  don't know if this particular operation was an earthquake weapon
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:42.560]  one other thing i want to talk about is this smart grid
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:46.880]  now i just took a class last semester and we learned all about it
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:49.760]  and yes everything will have rfid dust in it
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:54.560]  everything will be face scanned google is all nsa admittedly run
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:57.200]  everything in real time will be scanned and tracked
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:00.960]  and so instead of the web just tracking the web it will track everything
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:04.800]  uh on the surface of the earth uh in real time
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:08.480]  the thing is that without any power station
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:12.320]  if the demand for power is becoming exponential we've been doing this on
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:16.080]  purpose so we won't so we'll have to accept the smart grid
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:18.960]  because they can't rebuild the transmission line
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:22.960]  i mean sir the smart grid is wireless internet and all the government and
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:26.080]  private groups that cover most the country now
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:30.880]  so your heater your water heater and all that stuff will have all it's all
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:34.400]  going in in california it's a big stink that they're tracking everything i
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:37.040]  want to and the government will control your thermostat and
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:39.920]  awesome they just come and put it in they don't even tell you and then you try
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:42.640]  to tell the public they start drooling and laughing but a lot of them are
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:46.480]  listening they go you mean government control thermostat
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.640]  they're not the thing of thermostat they're not thermostat
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:55.040]  that's a comparability theory of electricity the comparability theory
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:51:01.840]  i take my mercury the new said mercury good for me

[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:08.240]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic circle did you
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:11.760]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:14.480]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:17.760]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:20.720]  again so our friends at solutions from science have
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:23.680]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:27.200]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:10.480]  once Madison Avenue makes people feel insecure
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:14.880]  from a young age with their advertisements and cultures
[1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:18.480]  they can then sell you whatever they want to feel secure
[1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:23.680]  and so people have been taught all their archetypal role models
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:27.440]  are idiots and so people think it's cute to be morons
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:31.360]  no when you become morons you go into bondage
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:35.600]  and again anytime you talk to a police officer who's well-spoken and
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:38.080]  intelligent they're a patriot they know what's going on
[1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:41.360]  but then you talk to another one and they just start laughing at you and
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:45.520]  you really have a conversation with them they can't even really talk
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:50.400]  and they're just like the public i mean only a moron would know that we're not
[1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:54.400]  in serious trouble only an idiot would be in denial about this
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:58.960]  mark in michigan you're on the air go ahead yeah looks first time calling here
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:02.960]  some a little nervous so welcome sir i'm
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:06.640]  are you familiar with the article from nextgov.com
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:12.640]  titled defense launches online system to coordinate 80 relief efforts
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:15.600]  no but i know the pentagon's already in the last three years taken over the
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:18.080]  entire internet are putting in the hubs to shut it down
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:21.520]  according to the white house press releases so they are uh
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:24.960]  they're unbelievable what they're doing well here's a
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:28.480]  excerpt from that on monday jean demay
[1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:32.560]  these says technical manager for the agency's transnational information
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:36.480]  sharing cooperation project happened to be at the headquarters
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:41.680]  of the u.s. southern command in miami preparing for a test of the system
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:45.360]  and a scenario that involved providing relief to haiti
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:49.920]  in the wake of a hurricane after the earthquake hit on tuesday demay
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.080]  demay said self-com decided to go live with the system
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:59.520]  so they just so happened to be doing a drill of haiti being hit by a disaster
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:04.320]  and they always they were running drills with the exact same bus exact same trains
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:08.400]  exact same locations being bombed the exact same time bbc
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:11.440]  for the seven seven bombings that were running drills with the exact same
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:15.760]  targets the exact same time being hit uh on 9 11
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:19.600]  and that is very suspicious i will you send that
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:22.640]  uh to us well i mean give me the headline right now
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:26.320]  it's called the defense launches online system
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:32.560]  to coordinate haiti relief efforts and it's from nextgov.com
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:40.080]  nextgov yes all right nextgov dot dot gov and and and the other guys are all
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:44.800]  on the telephone so let me write that down myself uh tell me the headline again

[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:36.320]  under color of law ran out the sacks that gunna knife show that had been here
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:40.160]  since i was in college we're talking 16 years ago at least
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:43.040]  out of the crocket center but debbie crockets evil so they've
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:48.720]  rechanged its name to the market center uh and it's an old walmart building
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:52.960]  walmart owns it h e b has the general lease on it big
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:56.320]  grocery store chain here in texas
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:00.400]  they called him last week doing his first show here in austin taking over
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:04.320]  from the saxet they'd run out didn't tell him that
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:07.600]  called him as if he was the saxet and said look we got all this
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:10.480]  dirt on you know things that have gone on in your show
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:15.040]  uh and uh we're going to uh shut you down if you don't tell people there's no
[2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:17.840]  private sale of guns which is legal and lawful in most states
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:23.600]  just like at a garage show or anything else and uh he said uh well i'm not the
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:27.760]  saxet and they didn't even know that the batf and the austin police
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:30.640]  and they said well and they have the h e b people there and they said look we're
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:33.760]  just going to shut this down if you don't tell your tenant to do this
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.000]  color of law completely illegal h e b buckled h e b is already getting a lot
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:41.920]  of protest calls they think we've given their number out or going after them
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:46.800]  they called up and griped at darwin we haven't done that yet h e b but we may
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:49.520]  since you're already accusing us of it and since you did buckle with this but
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:53.200]  the real issue is the police department the batf and obama
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:56.720]  clearly gave this order and that's one of the headlines up at
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:02.400]  um prisonplanet.com. Tennessee follows texas and banning private
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:05.600]  gun sales they're moving to do that there this is coordinated by the winehouse
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:09.840]  texas gun show organizer targeted by atf makes this case in the alex jones show
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:15.040]  and the the key article from today obama administration shuts down oldest gun
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:19.360]  show in central texas and kurt referred to the previous articles
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:23.200]  that had all the proof of that people said oh this is where's the proof it's
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:27.520]  all right there we have some people in denial saying this hasn't even happened
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:31.680]  and of course that's co-and-tell pro uh going on out there no this did happen
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:36.320]  the batf ran this it is going on but there have been big new developments
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:40.560]  they just went ahead and pressured h e b to completely just say no more gun
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:44.160]  shows period in that building it's over austin the place you've gone for close
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:47.840]  to 20 years at least to have gun shows it's over
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:51.440]  they also had a staged arrest where they arrested some guy and then released him
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:55.600]  there on the spot letting back in it looks staged at least by the police
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:59.760]  and that's why h e b saying well after the arrest uh which wasn't an arrest
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:04.800]  uh it's just over it's over it's over and so they can do this with other
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:06.960]  businesses they can do this with your rights
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:11.280]  no law no regulation they are god at least if we let them become god

[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:34.080]  that had been here for more than 15 years they didn't tell him they don't
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:37.120]  run that group out they didn't even know they'd run them out
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:40.320]  and they said you're not going to allow private sales which is a big part of his
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:44.000]  business which is totally legal they threatened the
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:47.440]  leaseholder h e b and told him to make him do this
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:51.760]  mr bettiker posted the sign but then got a petition going to the state attorney
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:56.640]  general then the police put pressure on h e b to just end all gun shows
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:00.720]  at that location they told him no more gun shows not just you it's over
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:04.800]  it's over and i guess they'll harass anybody else that tries to get another
[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:09.680]  location now uh local tv stations are going to
[2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:13.040]  interview the police and there's no debating the facts

[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:19.840]  the article is obama administration shuts down oldest gun show
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:25.040]  in central texas and they are the ones that ran this the bat fe the atf is the
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:29.760]  subdivision of that alcohol tobacco farms and explosives police under the
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:35.120]  direction of atf told uh the event uh bettiker he would be
[2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:39.120]  required to follow their recommendations or they would close down his event
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:42.720]  bettiker said he was told you do what we say or we shut you down
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:47.120]  he said the ultimatum was recorded by police and atf so the news
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:51.040]  needs to now demand that video because well no let's let them lie to the media
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:54.480]  first and then get the video through subpoena or they'll say it malfunctioned
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:58.720]  mr bettiker indicated in enforcing the atf recommendations will destroy his
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:01.600]  business he said he would not issue a public
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:04.080]  notice unless it indicated the so-called recommendations were issued by the
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:08.480]  austin police and atf and the atf said yes that's good do that
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:12.960]  and um this has now happened and and and so
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:17.040]  he decided to stand up so hgb called him this morning and said it's over
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:20.880]  now austin police this is illegal what the atf did violates
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:23.520]  there's no statutes to do this no statutory authority
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:26.800]  it's it's clearly racketeering it's it's clearly corruption
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:30.320]  it's clearly they've damaged him financially it's clearly color of law
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:34.400]  civil rights violation i mean they have really done it but if they get away
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:37.200]  with it the precedent is set and what they do is they set up
[2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:40.640]  stings and fake things they harass gun shops and
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.560]  gun uh shows out of business everywhere
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:48.320]  tennessee's moving to do the same thing but this is without a law without
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:52.560]  anything so let's let's go to darwin bettiker to break down
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:55.680]  recap what happened and then now the latest developments
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:10:58.800]  and kvue you talked to him this morning they're going over to interview the
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:04.640]  austin police department go ahead uh yes there i got a call from uh
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:08.880]  andrew the manager of the uh north austin vintner yesterday
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:12.720]  and he said that he got a phone call from hgb
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:16.720]  saying that uh our shows were over so due to the
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:20.000]  the arrest this past saturday that they couldn't afford
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:23.200]  to allow us to have the shows which wasn't a rest they just put a guy in
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:26.560]  handcuff now the number is 20 minutes and let him go and he went back into the
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:30.800]  show exactly so now it's a matter of
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:34.800]  you know trying to convince hgb to either you know allow us to have a show in
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:38.640]  there again or trying to find a new location with you know
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:44.240]  20 or 19 days 20 days to go before next show so you capitulate to the arm
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:47.360]  twisting post it but then stand up and say we're going to do a petition to the
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:50.160]  attorney general because local governments can't just make up
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:54.800]  imaginary things without laws uh now you got a call from hgb this morning tell
[2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:58.480]  us who called you yeah the lady named madly she called
[2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:02.560]  from atb there in austin and wanted to know why
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:09.360]  she said that what she heard was i told i said that atb agreed to do stings
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:13.840]  agreed with the austin pd and the atf to do stings in my gun show
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:16.720]  which is absolutely not true i would never do
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:20.560]  agree just such a thing and she said that people are
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:25.280]  wanting to start a uh you know an anti atb
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.600]  you know uh what do you call it
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:33.760]  what's the word i'm looking for an anti atb campaign
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:38.080]  and she asked me why i would do that and i said it was not me
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:41.760]  and then i said it was the representative that you sent
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:45.440]  that atb sent to this meeting saying that uh
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:48.400]  basically when he folded he looked at me and he was the only one there was power
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:52.400]  authority to allow me not to have a show that i had to follow these
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:55.520]  recommendations over there to be no show i go that that
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:59.760]  that was on him and and his choice and that's why
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:03.680]  that's why the stuff is happening atb it has nothing to do with me
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:06.640]  and she said well we would at least appreciate a phone call or something
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:10.320]  like that before you went on the radio and i told her well i would appreciate
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:14.320]  a phone call or a heads up before they invited me into a meeting the day before
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:17.440]  the show but see how they're making it that you're bad i'm
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:20.960]  surprised they don't just say it's a conspiracy theory and the gun show never
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:25.040]  even existed and and you know grandpa says there used to be a gun show there
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:30.000]  and the kids laugh and say grandpa says people used to own guns
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:34.960]  you know that's the attitude that they have they shut down your business
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:39.440]  they unlawfully come in order atb to do this you were at the meeting
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:43.840]  and and now it's clear that they've intimidated him into just getting rid of
[2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:47.840]  your contract uh i mean this is outrageous and then you're
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:52.080]  the bad guy and we hadn't even made atb the bad guy in all this
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:55.440]  i know and that's what i tried to explain to her i said if you listen to the
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:13:59.760]  interview that i had with you yesterday never once did i say atb was the bad
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:02.640]  guy and neither did i but here's the issue
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:06.720]  they can't say the police are wrong they can't say it's wrong that they just
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:11.600]  came in like thugs and made all this up and and made your leaseholder i mean
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:14.960]  you know what happens if i go to a business and talk to a leaseholder and
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:19.120]  make them lose their lease i can be sued up one side and down the other
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:22.480]  i mean what other businesses will the police come in and take over i'll tell
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:26.240]  you in seattle it's a major scandal that in some areas of the city
[2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:29.440]  more than half of the bars are owned by police
[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:33.200]  because they would go in and run stings of selling their own
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:38.720]  agent drugs and then asset forfeiture sees the bar a restaurant
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:43.040]  and then keep it for themselves i mean this is a i i i guess we're going to
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:46.400]  the chicago seattle model
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:50.400]  yeah the one the good the well the the good news out of all this is
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:54.480]  since since the show yesterday i've received tons of emails you know people
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:59.120]  saying that they couldn't make it to the show but they would support us anyway
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:01.920]  you know even if they bought complimentary tickets or something online
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:04.960]  just to show their support i mean that's a good feeling knowing that there's so
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:07.680]  many people out there that and you're going to try to get into another venue
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:10.800]  but let's not talk about that right now or the cops will run and try to
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:14.960]  try to defame you and destroy you there i mean
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:18.240]  they're getting deeper into trouble and if i know these austin police they're
[2:15:18.240 --> 2:15:21.120]  going to savagely attack now i'm getting i mean i could be
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:25.440]  rated any minute with setups or whatever uh because they do they're the mafia
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:29.200]  they rule into the story uh but but i mean these people are
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:32.800]  dangerous but i mean they're lawless but but continue
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:36.160]  well yeah and basically i try to i try to explain to her
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:39.120]  she said that it was it was unfair for me
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:43.040]  to uh have a boycott set up against h.e.b because
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:46.560]  so she wouldn't even listen to you you explain to her but still you are the
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:50.240]  bad one not the police starting all this not the feds ordering it
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:54.560]  you are the bad one as the victim exactly because she cannot
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:58.240]  say the government's bad because it is god
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:01.840]  yeah and and i i try to she goes well normally i have these meetings face to
[2:16:01.840 --> 2:16:04.800]  face and i told i'd be more unwilling to set up a
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:07.440]  meeting with her face to face but i wouldn't be there alone this time like
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:11.520]  like the first meeting i had
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:16.240]  so well basically where it where it ended well what's the answer here i mean
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:19.760]  should we have people i guess contact the main line
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:25.120]  uh for h.e.b uh the toll free number eight i think i think the best course of
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:28.640]  action would be to get in contact with brett baker
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:32.560]  uh the gentleman that supposedly headed the uh
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:36.560]  the meeting to get us you know to not allow us to have a show anymore
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:40.640]  and persuade him to the best course of action would to be allowed to still do
[2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:44.560]  the show as scheduled in that building well do you understand it's illegal for
[2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:48.560]  police outside of the law to come into people's businesses and get them shot
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:51.920]  down with their leaseholders i mean they're not
[2:16:51.920 --> 2:16:57.040]  this is this is a serious mafia crime they've committed but to them they just
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:00.000]  think it's funny yeah they think they think they're
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:03.200]  doing they think they're doing something right i guess on their end but
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:05.920]  yeah because they can't get the legislature to pass a law
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:08.640]  so they'll just shut it down because they're god
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:12.320]  and you know the the ironic thing is is the arrest they have made
[2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:15.440]  at other gun shows they've made those arrests because there was a gun show
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:18.000]  going on because they actually knew whether people
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.440]  would be unlike if there was no show they'd be buying them in an alley
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:25.120]  somewhere and they'd have no idea where it was going on
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:29.200]  and gun shows have been over backwards where the cops don't even ask they just
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:32.320]  wander into the back door do whatever they want
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:36.560]  not good enough mission completed gun show shut down after close to 20 years
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:43.280]  now um i mean is h e b making noises about letting you do your show
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:47.600]  well no she we got off the phone i told her i would i would beat with them
[2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:53.120]  but i i think i'm under the the understanding that if no people call them
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:56.400]  and and you know say basically she told me that
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:00.000]  from the other show that was in there they got so many complaints from
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:05.840]  the residents around that area that again again it's like nazi germany they said
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:08.880]  well then everybody's complaining about jewish neighborhoods
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:12.320]  we've got to relocate you you know the german people don't like you here that
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:15.760]  was the excuse oh you know neighborhoods a mile from
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:20.000]  here they get scared seeing people in parking lots constant 911 calls
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:23.120]  because people drive by and see people walking into a gun show
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:26.960]  with a giant gun show sign and there's so many people that moved in here from
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:30.160]  the few cities that have banned guns that they think it's illegal
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:33.920]  so because a bunch of idiots don't know about the second amendment we have to
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:37.520]  end the second amendment because idiots are scared of it
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:40.800]  exactly and then she says she told me on the phone she goes
[2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:45.200]  when did it when did h e b become anti-gun i said as soon as you sent
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:49.520]  somebody to a meeting that crumbled under the the pressure from the apd and
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:54.240]  atm and then had us kick out because of it
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:57.680]  well it's the atm it's the atm and the police
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:01.600]  are the real culprits i'm not even making h e b because they're not the
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.840]  villain here they're just the wimps uh but at the same time
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:09.440]  them trying to say you are the villain now they start to become
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:12.960]  the villain when you're the victim and it's clear
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:16.800]  uh that this is a precedent setting case to let the feds and the police
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:20.960]  behind closed doors shut down gun shows with no law no nothing
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:26.800]  this is outrageous i think i think the best course of action would be to
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:30.640]  have everybody call you know brett baker at h e b and
[2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:34.400]  so he can see just how many people do want to have the show there
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:42.160]  here's the number here's the number 800 432 3113 800 432 3113 800
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:48.560]  432 3113 and you can also go to h e b dot com email them there and let
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:51.760]  them know that for the next few months if they don't reinstate this in the
[2:19:51.760 --> 2:19:54.160]  second amendment and freedom and the right to contract
[2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:57.760]  and if they give in to illegal and lawful racketeering by the feds
[2:19:57.760 --> 2:20:01.520]  that you're not going to buy food there let them know we'll be right back

[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:29.360]  Fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:33.760]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:37.760]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:41.360]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:44.720]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care
[2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:48.240]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:33.680]  is that you got called from the local ABC news affiliate
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:37.360]  and who knows what their newscast will be but what did they tell you when you
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:40.960]  talked to him uh the lady's name was uh no well
[2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:44.640]  knew she was realized and she basically just wanted to hear
[2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:48.640]  uh my side of the story because of course they've heard a bunch of rumors and
[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:52.320]  i told her that you know i'll just tell her the facts and i basically went
[2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:55.840]  through and recapped exactly what happened now in my
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:59.120]  experience they don't know the law did you explain to her that there's no law
[2:24:59.120 --> 2:25:03.200]  here and they just did this exactly i told her i told her what what they had
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:08.240]  me do was was uh unlawful uh but it was all only
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:10.640]  under the pressure of me losing the show completely
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:14.720]  the day before uh we were supposed to start yeah they threatened you with
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:18.400]  massive financial harm and harm to your reputation
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:22.880]  if you didn't that's extortion exactly and that's terrorism that's an act of
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:27.040]  financial terrorism what did she say she said well basically after the whole
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:30.240]  interview she's you know appreciated me having the
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:33.520]  interview with her and she says well it sounds like you didn't willingly go
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:36.560]  along with this and i said absolutely not i was only
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:40.720]  after the pressure of you know the the demise of my business is why i did it
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:43.920]  and now the police can't say they're wrong under federal orders
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:49.360]  and so they're just going to keep saying you're bad and probably stone wall and
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:53.360]  you know watch out when you're in this town but the i know a lot of officers
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:56.160]  are upset by this but the but the people running this i want to hear rd
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:00.240]  saveta say this was wrong and uh come out against this we don't
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:03.920]  know if he's behind this yet but i'm trying to find out right now
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:07.120]  but his department is get guaranteed involved in something wrong if he tries
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:09.280]  to spin this i don't know how he's going to do it
[2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:13.440]  there's no doubt in my mind though the batf recommended the notice ordered it
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:17.520]  was running it was in control and that this is the obama administration doing
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:20.560]  this i was do you mind if i give you a scenario
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:24.560]  what the uh what the atf agent himself told me
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:27.760]  i could do real quick because it's sure not only is it
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:31.840]  disturbing but it i don't think it's lawful either i gave him
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:39.600]  the the uh the notice i gave him a scenario they my grandfather leaves me
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:46.320]  uh a cold pistol in his will and i have a prior domestic charge against me
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:51.200]  so i can't own that gun so i take it to the gun show and i try to sell it
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:54.320]  to do the right thing to do to do the legal thing
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:59.200]  and now by trying to follow the recommendations say i have to take that
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:03.280]  gun and i have to take it to a dealer and have them put in his books
[2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:06.960]  and do a background search on a person that wants to buy it at the show
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:10.240]  now say that person doesn't pass the background check
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:13.920]  and i want my gun back the one my grandfather left me in a will
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:20.320]  now by law i have to do paperwork on the gun that was left to me in my will
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:24.400]  to get my own gun back and i told him now what would happen
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:27.600]  since i had the previous charge against me i'm not going to pass the
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:30.880]  background check then what happens to the gun
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:35.280]  and the atf officer himself looked straight at me and said darwell one way
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:39.360]  around that is you could have the dealer do the background check on the person
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:44.160]  that wants to buy it before he logs it into his book
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:48.080]  and i'm like well and i was totally stunned so basically what you want me
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:52.080]  to do is basically break a law just to appease
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:55.040]  your recommendation and he goes well i'm not telling you
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:59.120]  you need to do that but that would be one one way to get around that
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:01.200]  scenario well let me expand on this that was the
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:05.600]  sheriff matt case and others they regularly when a woman falls for
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:09.360]  divorce or even a man now they get a restraining order and then they say you
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:11.360]  can't own a gun when there's a restraining order
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:14.320]  they say yelling at your wife or husband now is violence
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:18.240]  that's a misdemeanor that's unconstitutional the 68 gun control
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:21.600]  act is for felonies so that's that's more bull
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:24.720]  where the agency's just declared powers that weren't there do you understand
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:28.160]  that exactly i mean when he told me that was
[2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:32.480]  an area to try to follow his recommendations i
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:36.240]  basically just had to turn around and i said thank you and i walked off
[2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:39.600]  when does kvue say this is going to air tonight they say they're going to go
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:42.720]  try to talk to this to the detectives and you know they said they were going to
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:45.520]  interview with the police department shortly she didn't tell me when it was
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:49.280]  going to air enough so i don't know what time it's going
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:53.200]  to air but she said that they were on their way down there and did you explain
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:56.160]  to her that it was a fake arrest it was a stage deal
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:28:59.360]  absolutely that's what i told her interview interview i go it wasn't even
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:01.840]  a real arrest because they let the gentleman go 45
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:04.880]  minutes later well they got mad by you not letting
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:08.240]  them abuse you in secret and putting out the petition for the state attorney
[2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:11.280]  general but see now that they've just shut down the gun show
[2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:15.040]  there's not the problem next month of them trying to force it again in the
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:18.400]  state coming in and blocking them they can just shut down the gun show
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:21.760]  kill our second amendment right to firearms and private sales and then
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:24.320]  sit behind closed doors like chicago mafia
[2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:29.520]  and just rub their hands together yeah i actually had an email from a bfw right
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:32.560]  out of austin's family could use their building but it was just too small
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:35.920]  but i appreciate people actually standing up and saying you know you can
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:40.080]  use our facility to do this well the gun show has been there for close to 20
[2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:43.680]  years that i know of i've been going there for 16 17
[2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:48.000]  i don't know since like 1992 so about 18 years
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:55.440]  that's where everybody goes we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:32.640]  that's why they're sprinting to the finish line he knows he's got the lowest
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:35.200]  approval rating of any president one year in history
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:38.960]  they know they're hated that's why they want open amnesty for the open borders
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:42.080]  to overrun us and further bankrupt us that's why they want to pass all these
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:44.720]  gun bills they've gotten in congress that's why they want to extra
[2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:49.200]  judicially say no buy no fly put gun owners on a no fly list
[2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:52.640]  and that's why the batf shutting down gun shops gun shows
[2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:57.600]  harassing everybody nickle and diamond don't cross a t dot and i shut you down
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:01.040]  that's why they're stinging and doing fake setups and fake arrest and
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:04.480]  arresting people and swat teaming people for arsenals which aren't even
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:06.720]  illegal you're having more than 10 guns
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:11.280]  they are coming after your guns right now at the regulatory and state level and
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:15.040]  covertly in texas they've now shut down the gun show
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:18.640]  that's been here for close to 20 years they ran out the last operator the new
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:22.160]  one came in they said you'll tell people no private sales here
[2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:25.840]  or we're going to shut you down they went to the landlord and got it shut down
[2:36:25.840 --> 2:36:30.480]  today no more gun show where it's been for close to 20 years i say close since
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:36.640]  since college 1617 181992 i have been going to that gun show gone
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:42.000]  gone they they went outside the courts outside the law and said no more gun show
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:48.080]  and h e b the big food chain that owns that warehouse building it's over
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:53.120]  unless we stand up and say no and we've got the owner of the texas gun show
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:56.960]  uh darwin bettiker online with us and i want him to pop in
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:01.120]  in this next 25 minutes we've got with erin zellman founder of the most
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.200]  hardcore true strong second amendment group jews
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:08.080]  the preservation of firearms ownership the big group of course is governors of
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:12.400]  america they both worked together the n r a at the leadership level is a shill
[2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:16.080]  op that's been proven they support of the 68 gun control act you name it
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:20.480]  erin zellman i've got reports here in tennessee trying to ban gun shows all
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:24.560]  these other states the obama is clearly behind this
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:28.000]  and and we have our headline uh on this here
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:32.400]  obama administration shuts down oldest gun show in central texas
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:35.600]  now you're a real expert on this more than i guess you only focus on this
[2:37:35.600 --> 2:37:39.760]  issue am i right in saying this is a new level of tyranny
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:43.520]  to shut down a gun show and is racketeering
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:46.960]  actually uh if it's an old level of tyranny
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:52.000]  now there was a government for for last 100 years if you think about every
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.680]  genocide that's happened last 100 years they've all been preceded by
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.920]  gun control scheme so there's nothing new i mean obama
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:03.840]  has gone to the same dictator school as all the other clowns have
[2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:06.960]  and all the other murderers you know the ball past the Stalin
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:10.880]  the hitlers and he's learned he's learned very well well this was hitler
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:14.960]  specialty studying hitler he would the the first four five or six
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:18.080]  years in power he did it all outside the law with just
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:22.160]  thugs well but there's been added in the
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:26.000]  atf criminals or i have a name i call him obama's
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.960]  bastard and i think people need to give us a very
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:34.560]  serious thought as to what these people are really all about
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:39.440]  well seeing this case confirmed now the local news is covering it
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:44.560]  i mean the police just come in secretly and just shut you down no law no nothing
[2:38:44.560 --> 2:38:47.680]  well it's because the people have tolerated it i mean the chief of police
[2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:53.040]  of that police force needs to have his life changed dramatically
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:57.040]  his personal life has become very public so that's been very effective here in
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:00.560]  milwaukee they've got a chief up here his name is ed flinn who
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:04.320]  can't keep his zipper zipped and people have been talking about it the man has
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:06.960]  just sort of kept his mouth shut after a while
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:10.960]  so you need to find out every personal thing you can about the chief of police
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:17.360]  of austin texas and publicize it you might get his attention at that point
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:21.440]  i remember when there was an internal city operation stealing old people's
[2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:25.280]  homes that were on lucrative property with you know
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:29.600]  three-inch grass zoning violations and it was a good police officer called me
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:32.720]  and said okay i'm gonna give you two city council members homes
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:37.360]  that have literally three-foot grass and we went and showed that on local tv and
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:41.360]  they dropped their attacks so we do have good police out there as well
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:44.240]  well i'm not condemning the police i'm just i'm talking about the chief of
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:48.800]  police no absolutely we're trying to see the police is no longer
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:54.320]  a peace officer you become a politician who can easily be bribed by other
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:58.000]  politicians well looking at this case specifically i've
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.600]  had some constitutional law scholars on i've researched it i mean this is
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:04.960]  blatantly illegal to have secret police running around
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:08.720]  getting people's leases pulled and threatening them and stuff
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:12.320]  well i think that there's an act of desperation going on in america and i
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:16.160]  think that some of these folks who have who are trying to
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:20.880]  destroy america fear for their own safety and they fear that they're
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:26.080]  they're going to fail at their goal to bring america under their heel
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:31.360]  there's no other there's no other there's no other excuse for what's going on
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:34.400]  and as we all know the history of gun control is
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.720]  it has made it very possible for dictators to target people they don't
[2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:42.400]  like and then ultimately murder them but there's one other thing i would
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:46.000]  suggest that people do uh you know we have a free film on our
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  website alex it's called no guns for negroes
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.840]  and i think that it shows that the documentary about the racist roots of
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:58.720]  america's gun control laws i think people need to start showing
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:04.000]  uh the racism that is so perverse throughout the federal government
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:08.800]  especially atf people need to see these jack buddha thugs as a bunch of damn
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:12.320]  racist well the federal government operates as if blacks
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:15.760]  aren't allowed to own guns i mean with knock and talk going on in texas
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:18.480]  and everywhere else where they come and knock and want to inspect your guns
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:22.880]  with no warrant no probable cause door to door but in black areas of the
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:26.240]  country it's been on the news they just forced their way in
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:28.880]  well you see but you have to understand something
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:32.960]  um this film covers about a hundred years ago in georgia where
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:37.520]  the u.s military was going door to door taking guns from blacks
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:41.440]  that's being talked about today in america so that's why i encourage people
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:44.720]  to watch this film because it's going to give them a history lesson
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:48.240]  that they can share with others and give all the other gun owners and
[2:41:48.240 --> 2:41:52.880]  texas a good poke in the ribs and tell them to wake up as to what's going on
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:56.320]  you know the one thing a government fears is an armed citizenry
[2:41:56.320 --> 2:42:00.160]  it's ready to rebel or else they wouldn't be so
[2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:04.800]  darn concerned about gun control so again if i can encourage people to come
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.360]  watch the free film no guns for negroes at jpfo.org
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:12.880]  and you're certainly free to put it on your site if you want alex sure that
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:15.680]  other words that we need to get people watching this
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:20.720]  and learning more about uh the racist roots of america's gun control was
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:25.520]  the danger of gun control and also that film shows the
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:31.280]  uh it gives more details about the uh uh the the racial fear that inspired the
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:35.040]  68 gun control act where tom dodd used the
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:39.120]  nazi gun control laws to create federal law
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:44.480]  it is now they gave incredible power to the batf
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:47.760]  i want you to tell start connecting the dots alex
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:52.720]  no we do it real quick well there's no longer any denial we have most of the
[2:42:52.720 --> 2:42:55.440]  zars in the winehouse we have the attorney general
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:58.240]  arguing in federal court in dc a year and a half ago
[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:01.680]  that he believes in a total abolition of second amendment ownership
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:04.720]  and then they try this double game of saying we don't want your guns we don't
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:08.960]  want your guns we just want to legally restrict them which means total ban
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:11.920]  now they've got all the bills introduced and i agree with you though they're
[2:43:11.920 --> 2:43:15.280]  getting desperate because the national poll show
[2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:21.520]  25 30 years ago 50 50 pro second amendment now it's 70 80 percent
[2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:26.480]  the pro gun culture of liberty really is gaining ground in the minds of men
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:32.000]  and legislatively so they're just going the back door regulatory way
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:36.160]  well again i think we need to uh make personal lives very public
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:40.240]  for those people who have a hand in this i want you to talk to the gun show
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:43.760]  operator who's now they've just totally canceled it they just say sorry
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:46.960]  it's over the police say the batf says they're god
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:51.920]  and why they're so bold but briefly uh you have a great little comic books for
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:55.200]  kids that explain the second amendment and you tell the story in there people
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:59.280]  can look up of athens tennessee the battle of athens
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:03.520]  yes it's funny you bring that up uh it seems like a lot of people want to
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:07.280]  forget it but but i don't know right after world war two
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:11.760]  uh american veterans who had had been living in tennessee before they went
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:15.360]  into the war came back to athens tennessee
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:20.160]  which is in mcminn county tennessee and they're into their their families have
[2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:23.440]  been writing to them about the jack booted thugs
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:27.840]  who had become the political machine who were destroying people's freedom or
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:33.280]  locking people up on false charges who were denying the vote to people
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:38.400]  and the uh uh the the veterans decided to get
[2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:41.200]  together and they started their own political party
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:47.680]  called the gi party and the gi party challenged the existing political
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:51.760]  machine and it was quite a quite a day for a voting
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:56.640]  because the political machine went in and stole the ballot boxes
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:01.840]  even shot a poll watcher uh and trying to tell the people we're going to have
[2:45:01.840 --> 2:45:06.560]  fair elections you can't trust the gi party turns out the uh
[2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:10.240]  the the criminals from the political machine
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:15.760]  held up in the in the sheriff's jail and what ensued after that was the gi
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:19.680]  party getting together other gis who had experience in
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:23.520]  explosives blowing the door off the jail
[2:45:23.520 --> 2:45:28.480]  an eight hour shootout uh with the sheriff and his thugs
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:32.560]  same thing as your police chief and his thugs and
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:36.240]  they all surrendered and finally gi party took over the uh
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:40.800]  political system and they brought some justice back to mc minne county
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:45.200]  uh but to Athens Tennessee the entire story of the battle of Athens
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:50.080]  Tennessee is on our website at jpfo.org and there's not only our article
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:53.040]  but other articles that appear in other publications
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:57.520]  and notice what we're saying and notice when people stood up the state didn't
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:00.720]  come in and arrest them because it was a citizen's arrest
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:04.560]  of an unlawful criminal government well in fact the uh
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:08.000]  uh the criminal politicians call the governor asking him to send in the
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:11.200]  national guard and the governor before they wasn't
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:14.640]  about to send in the national guard to shoot it out with
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:19.440]  veterans who had just returned from world war two
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:23.440]  so they they did uh the government told them the governor said sorry guys you're
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:27.520]  on your own here and they were booted out of office
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:32.160]  and of course the gi party took over and uh but that was back with this country
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:36.160]  brought back to uh the mc minne county but that's why
[2:46:36.160 --> 2:46:40.800]  this country was once free because men who weren't looking for trouble wouldn't
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:43.600]  let their children be slaves how have we gotten this
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:49.280]  attitude of being slaves i mean how do we turn into this
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:53.200]  well i'm not sure how the total answer alec but a lot of it has to do
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:57.440]  with people just getting fat dumb and happy
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:02.080]  and uh not paying attention to the lack of knowledge it should be distributed
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:06.080]  the public school system and we raised two generations
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:12.240]  now people really they really don't appreciate uh the the history of america
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:16.880]  and the and the blood and guts is spilled to make america america
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:21.760]  but we also have people who have become again fat dumb and happy and they want
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:26.400]  the government to do things for them and and and every time you give that much
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:30.400]  power to the government the government destroys freedom
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:34.880]  because the government fears freedom erin zellman i want to shift gears and
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:39.680]  talk to uh darwin vettiker who operates the show and is now has
[2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:44.320]  livelihood destroyed just because the police say so and the and the batf and
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:48.080]  obama say so any comments or or or advice you've got
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:52.000]  for darwin who's online with us right now
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:55.040]  well darwin i i think that you've got to stand tall
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:47:59.760]  uh you've got to really tell others about the situation you've got to create a
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:04.400]  a grassroots fire a tea party so to speak of your own
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:08.560]  uh to get you know there must be a couple of million gun owners in texas
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:14.480]  and get them damn hopping mad and and so that the the people the uh the powers
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:19.040]  to be are going to feel the heat so you can put the powers on the run
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:21.760]  you know obama calls us bitter clingers because we
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:25.440]  cling to our bibles which is i mean moral
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:29.040]  and our guns well that's really your freedom your freedom of religion your
[2:48:29.040 --> 2:48:32.960]  freedom of speech your freedom to defend yourself of course we cling to it
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:37.200]  it's all we've got left in america well i think those are the three things that
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:40.720]  are worth fighting for and i think that you know that
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:46.640]  as we say at jpfo the time has come in america for people to decide
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:50.960]  if they are willing to live by god's law where human beings are commanded to
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:56.480]  defend their lives and help others or if we're now ready to die
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:01.360]  from man's law and uh you know and have no freedom at all
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:04.560]  but that's what george washington said god's law
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:08.560]  and man's law well that's what george still is thought amongst people
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:11.440]  well that's what george washington said over and over again
[2:49:11.440 --> 2:49:16.160]  he said look this is tyranny i'm not gonna live in my knees as a slave
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:19.360]  well apparently you've got some folks in texas and then they've got owners
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:22.880]  throughout america they don't seem to give a damn
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:26.560]  and so you gotta find out why well people are hopping mad going back to
[2:49:26.560 --> 2:49:30.880]  darwin darwin you're seeing huge grassroots anger right now aren't you
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:34.160]  absolutely i mean the flood of emails that we've gotten in
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:37.440]  you know uh in the last 24 hours is astounding
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:40.800]  uh everything from you know we support you to
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:44.320]  well we'll drive from Nebraska to come to your next show
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:47.680]  i mean the support is definitely out there and
[2:49:47.680 --> 2:49:51.520]  and uh i just you know i hope people keep on sending that kind
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:55.360]  but now there's no show see first they said no private sales of guns or we'll
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:58.560]  shut your show down and now they just say it's a shutdown
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:02.640]  i mean that is so illegal to have the police go tell the landlord
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:06.640]  don't put them in there for no reason
[2:50:06.640 --> 2:50:10.480]  yeah i think what you gotta do is to make sure that the powers that kind of
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:12.960]  people are you think you were going to get uh
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:16.560]  from you know not allowing uh to have a show in there is the exact opposite of
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:18.640]  what's going to happen you know what's going to really happen
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:21.840]  erin what were you saying well i didn't mean to interrupt but i think that at
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:24.400]  this point you've got to find some gun owners we're
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:28.480]  going to stand tall and go pay the mayor a visit
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:33.520]  tell them that we have to get rid of this police chief before sunset today
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:36.720]  that it says that he's not a these people no longer be tolerated
[2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:42.480]  and either will you mayor he's not gone by sunset today
[2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:47.440]  but you've got to get some lots of gun owners knocking on the mayor's door
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:51.520]  we do need to flood them you've got to go beyond the chief of police
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:55.520]  and you've got to make it very clear that anybody by the way is promoting this
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:50:59.760]  discussion this movement texas if they're not behind this effort

[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:09.520]  i know police chief art acevedo he's one of the few police chiefs that actually
[2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:13.840]  comes and sits in the studio normally takes about a month to get him in here
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:17.120]  i wanted to get him in here about laws about texting or even looking at your
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:19.280]  cell phone you get a five hundred dollar fine
[2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:24.000]  not about safety about money but that's a legislature issue not him
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:27.200]  and so i am going to give him the benefit of the doubt
[2:54:27.200 --> 2:54:31.200]  because he may not have known that the batf in the special gun unit we're
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:33.760]  having the detectives do this it's a big department
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:37.520]  but if he defends this or doesn't do something about this
[2:54:37.520 --> 2:54:40.720]  we do have a major problem politically and people should be at the city
[2:54:40.720 --> 2:54:43.440]  council regardless there needs to be an investigation
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.280]  and not by the police department because this is outrageous i mean the police
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:50.320]  can come and just you know paint something on your
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:53.920]  front door of your business and say nobody can shop here anymore
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:57.520]  that is effectively what happened here and i have to use the nazi germany
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:55:01.920]  analogy because the soviets did the same thing
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:05.200]  and we have to resist what they're doing
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:08.480]  going back to uh darwin bettaker and erin zellman
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:13.920]  of jpfo.org uh gentlemen other points other things you'd like to add
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:17.760]  uh to uh this darwin other things you want to air
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:23.280]  or um say on air erin zellman well i think that again you know we have to
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:27.600]  find uh some serious gun owners in the state of
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:33.360]  texas who are going to uh say no to this
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:37.520]  i mean they're going to stand tall you know the emails are fine
[2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:41.760]  uh it's nice to have some encouragement but uh boots on the ground
[2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:45.520]  really makes the difference yeah we need people to go to their city
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:48.000]  council people's office and say i want a meeting with you
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:51.680]  we need the state attorney general who i'm told is already looking into this
[2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:55.280]  to come down to austin and say look you know cities can't
[2:55:55.280 --> 2:55:58.800]  folks if you don't follow the state law which they've broken here
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:03.280]  and you get cities where boss hogs make themselves king
[2:56:03.280 --> 2:56:07.200]  i mean this we've seen this over and over again erin zellman
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:10.880]  well yes we have and it's been a nasty result
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:15.120]  so i think that it's important that again that people realize
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:19.280]  that uh you know that you just can't tolerate this type of evil
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:24.000]  because it's like a cancer it's spread the whole obama
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:27.360]  um administration that their whole agenda
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:31.520]  is cancerous well that's what i'm saying this is obama admitted
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:33.920]  we found out he's doing this all over the country
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:37.520]  covertly sending feds in to shut down gun shows illegally
[2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:40.400]  i mean obama and the and the government the federal government
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.080]  they are the real criminals well i think that's another reason why people should
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:48.000]  be using our free film no guns for digros because we have to show
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:52.640]  what a fraud and hypocrite the man is you know we have to show that he will
[2:56:52.640 --> 2:56:56.160]  sell out his own people so he certainly doesn't give a damn about
[2:56:56.160 --> 2:57:01.040]  anybody else if people have to see this guy for what he really is
[2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:05.120]  we will post uh no guns for negroes the history of racism and gun control
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:09.120]  on info wars dot com guys send it to curt let's get that up
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:13.280]  uh absolutely and of course jpfo.org going back
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:19.920]  uh to darwin uh darwin people are also now calling for a boycott of h e b
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:24.800]  uh they're saying how dare you even complain we hadn't blamed h e b for this
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:28.640]  uh i mean do you think h e b should be held accountable as well
[2:57:28.640 --> 2:57:32.880]  well i think i think definitely the the gentleman they sent to the meeting
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:36.480]  should be held accountable for you know for his action
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:41.040]  the only thing i would like to say is if we're not able to get a show
[2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:44.240]  uh back in the back in the same building that we've always been in
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:48.240]  um if anybody out there knows of any facility where we can have a show in
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:51.120]  february uh we gotta we gotta find someplace to have
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:55.440]  a show because if we don't they win and i'm to the point where i'm not gonna
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:57:58.960]  allow that to happen i have a quick question guys
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:02.960]  sure about the sheriff what role is the sheriff playing in all of this
[2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:05.920]  we've tried to get good sheriff sin like raymond
[2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:10.960]  frank and others and um i mean why is the sheriff allowing this
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:15.440]  i mean people are supposed to come to sheriff right to do something like this
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:19.520]  they're in his county i mean the sheriff needs to have his personal life made
[2:58:19.520 --> 2:58:23.440]  for republic and we need to find out what's really going on here
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:27.280]  because something really stinks darwin bettiker we'll talk to you as this
[2:58:27.280 --> 2:58:30.560]  develops and unfolds i appreciate you spending time with us we're

[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:57.040]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:58:59.920]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:04.160]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:59:04.160 --> 2:59:07.760]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:59:07.760 --> 2:59:11.280]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:59:11.280 --> 2:59:14.960]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:59:14.960 --> 2:59:17.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:59:17.920 --> 2:59:21.760]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a

[3:00:15.760 --> 3:00:20.320]  he's from los angeles highway patrol
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:23.680]  i just wish we could have a texan for our police chief but i guess they won't
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:27.520]  do the types of things that the feds want
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:31.360]  but we do need people to go to texasgunshows.net of your constitutional

[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:48.160]  more than 15 years and run out of austin he took it over and i don't know him
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:51.040]  when he was walking into and they said look
[3:00:51.040 --> 3:00:54.240]  you get out of town my son said boy we run this town
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:59.040]  texans don't get guns our california you know boss

[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:09.760]  we're not being run by fidel castrow here uh but in the four minutes we've
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:13.600]  got left with erin zelman uh erin the good news is this is a
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:16.400]  huge story the news is now covering it today in austin
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:19.760]  people are upset people couldn't believe it at first
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:22.640]  when we first broke this on sunday and then monday
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:26.480]  they thought we were making it up now it's admitted to be real people are
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:30.480]  shocked i think americans are just so shocked
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:34.080]  by the level of tyranny like the obama administration cast sunstein saying
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:36.880]  they're going to restrict free speech and take over the web or that we have no
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:40.320]  right to own guns i think people have trouble believing this is really
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:44.080]  happening well they better get over the
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:48.240]  trouble part they better believe because this is what uh
[3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:53.120]  this is what the obama administration has brought to america that is pure tyranny
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:57.920]  a hatred for freedom you have to wonder just who he's uh
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:01.760]  he's a puppet on a string who's pulling the strength with this guy
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:06.560]  you really have to start asking some deep questions about this
[3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:11.360]  well it's it's so unconstitutional to have
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:15.280]  the feds come in and then engage in not just unconstitutional
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:19.920]  but illegal activities like this i mean this is illegal
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:22.720]  well the one interesting thing that i'd like people to follow
[3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:27.200]  is that you know there is the mcdonald versus chicago case
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:31.280]  the arguments are supposed to start march 2nd at the supreme court
[3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:36.000]  and where that would just about abolish all local gun control laws
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:40.240]  if it's passed and so i would encourage people to follow that case
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:44.240]  and on our website we do have a brief that jpfo filed
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:49.280]  uh an amicus carry brief briefly tell folks about that case briefly
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:53.440]  well briefly it's about the city of chicago is an elderly man there named
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:58.000]  mcdonald who is in a high crime area he wanted to own a handgun to defend his
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:01.520]  life city of chicago said no you can't do that
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:05.760]  they've been saying no to people for a long time about the ownership of handgun
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:09.840]  so the case well found its way to supreme court
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:12.800]  and so now the supreme court's going to be asked
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:17.840]  uh to see if the second amendment also has the protection of 14th amendment
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:21.680]  uh to make sure that the people have the right
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:26.560]  uh to defend their lives sounds silly but that's what this case is about the
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:29.680]  people have a right to own gun to defend their lives
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:33.920]  how about we take the police guns in chicago oh no they've got to protect
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:37.680]  themselves but we can't protect ourselves well that's pretty much what it
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:41.120]  boils down to that's why this case is very important
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:44.640]  they're going to encourage people to come to our website jpfo.org and they
[3:03:44.640 --> 3:03:47.920]  can read the case they can download the file
[3:03:47.920 --> 3:03:52.080]  share it with others but people need to start paying real close attention to
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:54.240]  this case
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:57.840]  current administration is absolutely opposed to it
[3:03:57.840 --> 3:04:01.520]  because it'll take power away from those who hate
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:07.360]  the second amendment erin's element in closing with about 45 seconds
[3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:11.120]  it does seem to me though that we are starting to gain ground and that they
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:15.200]  are panicked do you agree oh i think absolutely i mean if you look at some
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:18.480]  of the uh the people have been going to these tea parties
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:22.160]  uh they're going to be people from all walks of life
[3:04:22.160 --> 3:04:26.960]  even people who previously voted for obama this has got them concerned
[3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:29.520]  even though there's problems going on within the tea party i understand that
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:32.560]  but people from all walks of life are saying wait a minute
[3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:36.800]  this is not what i want in my government i don't want to lose my freedom
[3:04:36.800 --> 3:04:40.720]  i don't want more taxes i don't want restrictions on my right
[3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:45.920]  that's probably why gun sales are uh roaring away
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:51.840]  record highs jpfo people intend to people don't intend to give those guns
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:55.840]  back to the government that's not their intention that's not
[3:04:55.840 --> 3:05:02.880]  whether buying them stay there i've got one more question
[3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:06.080]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs

[3:06:06.080 --> 3:06:09.280]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[3:06:09.280 --> 3:06:13.280]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:06:13.280 --> 3:06:16.480]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[3:06:16.480 --> 3:06:20.480]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:25.760]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:28.960]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:33.360]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:35.840]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:39.680]  tim geithner, bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more matches
[3:06:39.680 --> 3:06:42.240]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[3:06:42.240 --> 3:06:46.560]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[3:06:46.560 --> 3:06:51.760]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:55.520]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online

[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:06.560]  hi neighbor they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions
[3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:09.200]  certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:11.840]  supply until there was none left at any price
[3:07:11.840 --> 3:07:15.440]  we would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:18.640]  those unable to care for themselves we would intend
[3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:21.840]  not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish
[3:07:21.840 --> 3:07:25.120]  who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue
[3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:28.320]  if the experience of the katrina disaster is evidence
[3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:32.720]  the bread line may have no bread just like the good intentions on the road to
[3:07:32.720 --> 3:07:36.080]  that unheavenly place the good intentions alone to get
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:39.760]  a supply of food will not feed us only getting our food supply
[3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:43.680]  immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future

[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:15.920]  and the gcn radio network all right i'm going to get more into
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:19.440]  Haiti first i'm going to cover the amazing senate battle
[3:08:19.440 --> 3:08:24.160]  heads of the finish line in massachusetts and you look at this erin zellman
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:29.600]  this is a real indicator that a seat that's never gone to republican
[3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:34.160]  ted kennedy's seat and even the brainwashed people
[3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:38.800]  in that state have finally woken up and are about to vote for a supposedly
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:42.480]  somewhat more pro-gun republican this is a true
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:45.920]  rebuke of obama but he doesn't care he's running
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:49.440]  to the finish line but i wanted to talk to you about the fact that
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:52.640]  the federal government in north com and homeland security
[3:08:52.640 --> 3:08:55.680]  in those myac reports and homeland security reports that we got that we
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:08:59.120]  released last year that the police gave us
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:04.320]  say their number one enemy is gun owners and that the homeland security is set up
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:07.840]  for veterans libertarians constitutionalist
[3:09:07.840 --> 3:09:10.880]  people that aren't going to go along with this
[3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:14.720]  and uh... you know the government is hell bent on getting our guns one way or
[3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:16.880]  the other and it is coming to a confrontation
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:20.560]  and let's not forget our country started there were a lot of taxes and
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:23.760]  corruption and problems but it finally started
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:27.920]  at lexington and concord when the red coats came to take the guns
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:32.160]  and unfortunately uh... for the people that try to enforce this
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:35.200]  i don't i think they take our restraint as weakness
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:38.320]  they don't understand there's a lot of veterans and people
[3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:43.040]  that are just hoping they don't have to but they are ready
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:47.280]  and this is really coming to a head erin zellman
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:52.080]  alex but goes around comes around and we're around
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:57.120]  well back to where we started uh... we're dealing with uh... the british
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:00.240]  uh... i would like to draw people's attention to something that would be a
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:02.800]  wake up call all of your listeners
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:07.840]  we ran a poll on our website about what the u.s. military confiscate guns
[3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:12.960]  from the american people the results were astounding and so were the
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:16.640]  comments almost two thousand people voted
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:20.400]  have over sixty three long comments from both the
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:24.400]  veterans and non-veterans and active duty people
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:28.000]  and let me just give you some numbers that this is shocked people
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:32.080]  only seven percent of the people who voted
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:37.280]  said that the government would not shoot americans to take their gun
[3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:41.840]  seven percent twenty one percent said the government absolutely used the
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:45.760]  military to take people's guns thirty percent said
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:49.920]  that many of the military would follow orders take people's guns
[3:10:49.920 --> 3:10:53.120]  so i would encourage people to come take a look at this poll and
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:56.400]  again it's just go to the front page of jbfo.org
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:11:00.560]  and go down to right above the gun control genocide chart on the
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:04.000]  right-hand side of the jbfo poll
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:08.720]  i would encourage people to take a get a real reality lesson today
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:13.200]  about how dangerous the world is right now or america is right now
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:18.560]  for america we're an endangered species in our own country
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:23.280]  if the obaminoids have their way
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:29.520]  now specifically the reason people know the government will confiscate guns take
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:32.880]  a train of the military comes in the fbi commands the operation
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:36.880]  they block the food aid they block the police and others from texas and
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:40.320]  volunteers that came to help and then the first mission was
[3:11:40.320 --> 3:11:44.720]  go into all the high and dry wealthiest areas put men in handcuffs
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:49.120]  and take their guns like they were criminals with guns in their own house
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:52.720]  that was illegal and they never gave most of those guns back
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:11:55.840]  even when a federal court said give them back they said
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:12:00.240]  we want your guns i mean they really want our guns
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:04.240]  absolutely again you know every dictator has learned
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:06.800]  but if you have an armed citizen where you're not going to be able to accomplish
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:09.200]  your goal
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:14.880]  i mean this is as simple as salt and all these dictators over the last
[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:18.320]  100 years who disarmed people and then murdered them
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:22.800]  and what is genocide they've all insisted that people must be disarmed
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:27.600]  first and then what do the obaminoids have in mind for america
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:32.560]  why are americans an endangered species in their own country
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:37.840]  i mean what what is a flood what what is being planned
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:41.280]  somebody i think every one of your listeners better start asking
[3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:44.480]  some questions and very loudly and demanding answers
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:48.000]  if they can't get an answer from somebody then why is that person allowed
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:52.560]  to stay in a position of authority well we've gotten answers i can't believe
[3:12:52.560 --> 3:12:56.960]  how the attorney general obama every one of his major zars we look at
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:00.000]  get up on camera and say there is no second amendment right
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:03.280]  we are going to get your guns they've introduced the bills
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:06.960]  but then they try this psi op of saying we don't want your guns
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:10.320]  to make everybody stand down but it's obviously not working
[3:13:10.320 --> 3:13:13.920]  we're a year and a half into the greatest gun sales the country's ever seen
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:17.280]  people are snatching it all up and saying that that's
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:22.560]  scaring the daylight out of them alex is actually scaring them and then
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:26.640]  they're fearful because they know that they're going to get caught
[3:13:26.640 --> 3:13:30.000]  uh and their crimes are going to become public
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:34.320]  and they're really scared they're really running scared
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:39.360]  so i would encourage the american people to to educate others about the evils
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:45.040]  of gun control and also uh you know don't stop buying guns and ammunition
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:47.920]  erin and closing let me ask you this question because when you come on a few
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:50.320]  times a year and aggressions spend your time with us
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:54.240]  and i just love your organization and support it i get emails asking me to
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:13:57.680]  ask you a question and i've actually seen you write about it and speak about it
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:04.320]  a few other times why do we see the israel lobby
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:10.000]  uh and so many jewish members of congress being some of the most vehement
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:14.880]  anti-gun people when they know what stalin and hitler and others did
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:19.680]  and they know what happened and they all have their own private bodyguards
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:28.240]  uh why do we see that uh from uh the uh both republican and democrat
[3:14:28.240 --> 3:14:32.240]  jewish leaders so often republicans being middle of the road or democrats
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:36.080]  being vehemently anti-second amendment pro victim disarmament
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:41.600]  why why is that going on well i'm not sure i have the total answer but there's
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:45.440]  a couple things that i can certainly highlight for you uh
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:49.200]  jewish members of congress who do support gun control
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:53.760]  are not very jewish or started people have to understand that
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:58.320]  jewish law demands that jews are commanded by the almighty
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:02.480]  to defend their lives and to defend the lives of those who are under attack
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:07.760]  you can't very well defend someone's life uh i mean to defend someone's life
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:11.920]  uh and in your own life if you don't have the tools to do so
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:16.160]  so jews who pretend to be jews are the ones who usually are supporting gun
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:20.000]  control scheme that's point number one number two
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:24.160]  i think that many of the uh alleged jews and congress who are supporting gun
[3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:27.760]  control schemes really don't understand the bill of
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:31.840]  rights they don't appreciate america and they're probably
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:36.400]  more concerned about being invited to cocktail parties uh than they are about
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:39.680]  preserving freedom in america
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:44.720]  and it's also a lot of big city urban areas i've noticed people from cities
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:47.760]  are generally so scared of guns i had a
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:50.960]  british interviewer from chris mathews here sunday
[3:15:50.960 --> 3:15:56.320]  and i have a 357 magnum it's actually right over here that i have to protect
[3:15:56.320 --> 3:15:58.960]  myself if anybody ever comes into the office
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:02.320]  and she started crying and looked scared and panicked
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:05.760]  in the middle of the interview and i or near the end and i said what's wrong
[3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:08.720]  and she said is that a gun and i said well yeah i mean
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:12.720]  we don't have police here with somebody people kill talk show hosts all the time
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:16.000]  or threaten them well you know what you need to do with that woman
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:18.880]  is uh we have an article on our website written by
[3:16:18.880 --> 3:16:22.320]  sequiatry it's called raging against self-defense
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:25.520]  and she points out the mental health problems
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:30.080]  the gun prohibition is halved and so again i don't mean to sound so
[3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:33.040]  commercial but all these things in our site that are free
[3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:36.960]  but people should come read the article raging against self-defense issues
[3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:39.840]  no no people should visit the site but expanding on that
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:43.120]  literally she's looking in my eyes talking to me
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:47.520]  i see her look over and then she like a little girl who's seen a monster started
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:52.400]  going uh and tears came in her eyes and she went uh
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:56.000]  and was like is that a gun and was panicking and shaking and i said to her
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:59.360]  but you feel safe when you see police with guns don't you
[3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:03.040]  she said well part of her problem alex may very well be as we point out as
[3:17:03.040 --> 3:17:06.320]  that's like raging against self-defense is that
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:10.400]  she may not trust herself to own a gun because she may have so much
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:15.840]  hatred towards people that she doesn't trust you to own a gun
[3:17:15.840 --> 3:17:19.760]  and this is some of the these are some of the problems that gun prohibition is
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:23.600]  trying to mask and trying to take our guns from it
[3:17:23.600 --> 3:17:27.360]  but it's so alien to this human common sense
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:30.560]  i have an office a few of my guys have concealed carries they don't need that
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:34.160]  in texas but they've got them i invite them it's just in their fanny packs
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:38.400]  and it's never an issue year after year because we're just regular normal people
[3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:41.200]  but if anybody ever busted in here they're dead i mean we're gonna defend
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:43.520]  ourselves well you're a gun owner that makes you
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:47.840]  regular normal for the most part gun prohibitions are not normal
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:50.960]  they have some mental health issues
[3:17:51.440 --> 3:17:55.200]  not really a big city or out in a truly someplace
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:17:58.480]  any mental health issues or mental health issues a lot of gun
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:02.800]  uh prohibitionists have to have these mental health issues
[3:18:02.800 --> 3:18:06.160]  well they really do i mean it is irrational and crazy and i've seen it
[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:09.280]  repeatedly and people will see a i had a carpet cleaner at my house
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:13.280]  and i had a shotgun up in a case on the wall and he saw it and panicked and
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:17.040]  said he couldn't clean my house and ran off and called the police on me but
[3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:19.440]  the police didn't i mean these people are crazy
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:22.400]  well they are i mean they have some issues that uh
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:25.520]  we're not going to solve real quickly they need some serious
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:30.400]  psychological counseling and uh you just have to realize that's why they're so
[3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:33.600]  dangerous and i would have at the obama administration
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:37.760]  is made up of people of very serious mental health issues
[3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:42.480]  well that's true but why do they then love swat teams with guns like somebody
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:45.920]  who loves freedom is threatened by that because they may have mental health
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:52.240]  issues but they lost for power and the police are their power arm
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:55.680]  that they use they can use the police to reach out
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:18:59.600]  and to destroy those they fear
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:04.320]  very well said erin zellman we love your organization the great work you do with
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:07.840]  gunners of america jpfo.org we'll talk to you again in the near

[3:19:11.280 --> 3:19:15.120]  deprogram people the good news is most liberals i know are no longer liberals
[3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:19.440]  they're patriots and they're all buying guns and training and loving it
[3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:23.280]  and have broken their fear and once they go out and shoot they laugh
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:26.640]  at their previous fear you're saying that too aren't you absolutely they learn
[3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:32.080]  the fun of a gun and they learn that their self-defense is a very good idea
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:36.320]  that being a coward is not a good idea it is so satisfying that i've got
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:40.640]  firearms i'm not afraid i can't imagine not being armed and that
[3:19:40.640 --> 3:19:45.600]  and that and that being castrated and weak i mean i'm here i'm armed i'm red
[3:19:45.600 --> 3:19:48.080]  blooded like my ancestors and i'm not a slave

[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:57.760]  and they show them slamming people on the ground
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:02.880]  going in to high and dry areas which they admit i mean these are some of the
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:06.320]  most famous areas of the city they were looting them
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:10.320]  i mean we're talking huge palace like houses people are there guarding their

[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:20.880]  and then notice the reporter that did this got his face blown off in iraq
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:25.120]  fighting for tyranny uh again that's a fact folks
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:28.880]  so abc news here it is this is what they want
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:31.920]  any chance they get they're coming for your guns here it is
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:36.240]  that includes new orleans where today authorities stepped up their efforts to
[3:25:36.240 --> 3:25:39.440]  empty the city bob woodruff is there again tonight with an
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:43.520]  extraordinary human drama unfolding bob
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:46.560]  that's true elizabeth and good evening from new orleans here the police and the
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:50.640]  national guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to
[3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:53.760]  carry out an order to force people from the city
[3:25:53.760 --> 3:25:57.520]  without actually using force
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:03.520]  today in new orleans they got a lot tougher on the holdouts police
[3:26:03.520 --> 3:26:06.800]  department not only the flooded areas but new
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:11.440]  orleans driest and wealthiest neighborhoods too
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:16.480]  police department the police and national guard going street by street
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:19.440]  house to house
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:22.080]  we need to make sure too that whenever we knock on doors people
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:25.680]  refuse to leave we need to make note call again
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:29.680]  they say there are no orders to use force just strong persuasion
[3:26:29.680 --> 3:26:33.520]  sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn that's the military
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:37.760]  instructions to disarm anyone inside you say guns
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:41.840]  guns will be taken no one will be able to be armed we will take all weapons
[3:26:41.840 --> 3:26:45.280]  that happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed
[3:26:45.280 --> 3:26:48.720]  themselves to protect their mansions
[3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:52.960]  residents were handcuffed on the ground in the end police took their weapons but
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:55.360]  let them stay in their homes it falls they were a little bit
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:26:59.920]  threatened back it up a few seconds imagine i mean these are famous we're
[3:26:59.920 --> 3:27:03.280]  talking 10 20 30 40 million dollar houses
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:07.680]  wealthy people the generators the the military didn't bring food to the
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:10.800]  people at the super dome they came for their guns and they took them and they
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:13.280]  stole them and they use us an army to do it under
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:16.480]  fbi command now that's your criminal government
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:20.560]  continue with it
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:24.800]  residents were handcuffed on the ground in the end police took their weapons but
[3:27:24.800 --> 3:27:27.920]  let them stay in their homes they were a little bit threatened because our
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:32.800]  weapons were bigger than their weapons for many of the police and guard troops
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:37.440]  it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an american city
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:40.880]  this guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:44.080]  they had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get
[3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:48.240]  permission it is it is surreal that's garrisoning troops
[3:27:48.240 --> 3:27:50.960]  you never expect to do this in your own country
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:54.880]  chris montgomery says he'd rather be in iraq than patrolling american
[3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:58.320]  neighborhoods walking up and down these streets you don't
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:00.800]  you don't want to think about the stuff that you're gonna have to do so many
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:03.920]  cops around the corner let me shoot an american
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:08.320]  yeah you shoot an american give me that gun or
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:11.360]  you're dead but we don't use force we just shoot you
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:14.560]  notice that double thing we shoot you we kill you
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:17.760]  we put you in handcuffs we slam you down on the ground when you come to your
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:20.320]  front door and all the videos of old women
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:23.840]  i don't want to leave my cats and dogs come here lady slammer head
[3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:30.080]  take her gun you don't have guns in america we ruled you
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:33.680]  and that the troops will follow the orders to take the guns if not they'll
[3:28:33.680 --> 3:28:36.800]  court marshal them and line them up
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:40.880]  and and and most of military's illegal aliens and foreigners now anyways i mean
[3:28:40.880 --> 3:28:45.360]  it's it's we have to come to grips with what
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:50.400]  america has turned into the government is illegitimate
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:54.720]  and criminal if they were confiscating guns any chance they could
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:58.320]  under bush what are they going to do now under obama and we'll hold them we'll
[3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:01.200]  probably defeat them we'll slow them down we've been having some victories people
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:04.240]  say i thought obama was coming for the guns that'll be the
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:08.720]  co-intel pro in a couple years yeah but we're gonna stop them
[3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:12.560]  and then you paid by the feds are gonna run around saying
[3:29:12.560 --> 3:29:15.920]  it never happened no they don't want our guns there
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:20.400]  there's not they didn't take guns in katrina
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:24.880]  oh it's sick okay we're gonna go to bright i'm gonna come back and get into

[3:35:30.400 --> 3:35:33.040]  heads of the finish line we've talked about this some
[3:35:33.040 --> 3:35:36.800]  you have this ted kennedy seat that supposedly nobody could get key senator
[3:35:36.800 --> 3:35:40.240]  position you have democrats in the house leaving or saying they're going to
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:42.640]  leave their party at the state level they're leaving
[3:35:42.640 --> 3:35:46.480]  this isn't just a realignment like people mad at bush for some bad stuff he
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:50.080]  did trying to put obama in to change it he's
[3:35:50.080 --> 3:35:53.280]  now betrayed them he's got the lowest approval rating
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:57.760]  of any president one year in ever and it's the one year anniversary in
[3:35:57.760 --> 3:36:02.960]  two days of his year in office and to have this most
[3:36:02.960 --> 3:36:07.840]  powerful democratic position in the country the strong the strongest most
[3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:10.640]  powerful senate seat you know the i mean the most
[3:36:10.640 --> 3:36:16.000]  ironclad supposedly that they had uh it looks like it's going to go to scott
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.560]  brown right now unless they have election fraud
[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:23.360]  and uh this uh martha coakley is in deep trouble
[3:36:23.360 --> 3:36:26.800]  and this is a message i mean the democrats on their open borders their
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:30.000]  gun grabbing uh their lives they're continuing the
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:34.560]  patriot act their gun control they are in deep trouble and larry pratt's been
[3:36:34.560 --> 3:36:37.680]  involved in this race so i first want to get his take
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:41.520]  on what's happening there larry pratt uh the uh
[3:36:41.520 --> 3:36:45.200]  head of gun owners of america the only big national
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:48.160]  and there's some other small groups that are great like jpfo but this is the
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:52.480]  only real national group uh that actually defeats
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:55.760]  gun legislation against the second amendment good to have you here larry
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:37:00.240]  thank you so much it is good to be with you yeah this race is um
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:06.320]  really uh a barn burner it's something that it seems like brown is probably
[3:37:06.320 --> 3:37:11.280]  winning and it also very much looks as if coakley is doing her best
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:16.080]  to lose nothing goes right for this poor woman her husband is a retired
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:22.560]  cambridge massachusetts police officer his union voted overwhelmingly to support
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:26.400]  brown so it doesn't look like it's going to go
[3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:31.440]  well for her tonight and if the margin for brown were sufficient
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:34.960]  over five points i would imagine that's probably
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:41.600]  pushing it beyond where they can uh steal it not cause further outrage so
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:46.960]  uh we've endorsed brown not because we know he's not going to be john wane
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:51.920]  but because he has made one of the two central issues of his campaign that he
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:56.880]  will vote against socialized medicine and since that is
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:00.960]  bad bad news for all americans including gun owners
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:04.400]  well better a crooked stick if that's all we have with a
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:09.440]  rabid dog coming at our throat so that's where we are and i think
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:17.440]  it will signal that democrats in other places and also if we do our jobs right
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:21.040]  republicans in name only the so-called rhinos
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:25.120]  they all should go we start in the primaries
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:30.400]  this year get rid of the rhinos we've endorsed for example patrick hughes
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:36.240]  in the illinois race mark kirk is a very liberal he's like diddy scosa fava that
[3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:39.520]  new york very liberal assembly woman in
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:44.560]  in that special u.s house race last week target the anti-gun people the
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:47.840]  socialist the big government people and get rid of them
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:52.160]  absolutely and the early voting has already begun in the illinois primary
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:55.040]  so people ought to go to patrick hughes
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:38:58.480]  website sorry i don't have the top of my head but it's not a big deal they know
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:03.440]  the race and what about deborah medina running for a republican here in texas
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:07.440]  she's gonna have a tougher climbed in some of the others but she's obviously
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:09.840]  the most liberty minded of the candidates
[3:39:09.840 --> 3:39:14.000]  and at least hutcheson did a disastrous job i'm told
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  in the debate she she got pressed on things and she just
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:21.040]  didn't want to didn't couldn't answer so uh...
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:25.200]  uh... it that that woman is is really
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:29.280]  bad news that that's my problem is bad as rick perry is
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:32.800]  i mean i'd have uh... i mean i i guess we're gonna find out the primary but i
[3:39:32.800 --> 3:39:36.880]  mean he's better than than uh... kabaley hutcheson
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:42.080]  bilderberg chairwoman exactly and not only that she is one nasty woman
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:45.120]  uh... the the things that one hears about her
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:49.120]  from the staff is it's it's like well at the bill
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:52.320]  in that movie the hundred and one dalmatians
[3:39:52.320 --> 3:39:56.240]  this uh... female representation of evil
[3:39:56.240 --> 3:40:01.840]  just nasty all the time and so hopefully the voters are going to see that
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:05.840]  this lady needs to be humiliated uh... first in this primary
[3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:10.240]  and then let's go get her in the primary i guess she's up for her re-election to
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:13.600]  the senate in a couple of years
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:17.440]  we're seeing things turn and i think we have a shot
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:21.280]  you know the the republican establishment tried to pull it off with charlie
[3:40:21.280 --> 3:40:26.640]  chris the governor of florida big big liberal arlen specter of the south
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:30.160]  and the former speaker of the house marco rubio
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:34.000]  has come out of nowhere didn't have nearly the money that chris had
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:37.040]  didn't have any of that establishment bank backing
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:40.560]  and he's already pulled even with him i think he's probably ahead
[3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:44.160]  uh... the republican party is absolutely rejecting
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:47.840]  uh... this notion that oh well we need to have a moderates
[3:40:47.840 --> 3:40:52.480]  so we can raise the money and win no moderates are what have been making the
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:56.080]  republicans losers uh... that because they
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:00.400]  deserve the republican principles will look at every poll gallop 91 percent
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:04.400]  don't want open borders major polls over 75 percent to 80 percent don't want
[3:41:04.400 --> 3:41:08.880]  more gun control want less uh... i mean on every issue
[3:41:08.880 --> 3:41:11.840]  uh... if republicans were actually constitutionalist
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:14.800]  there wouldn't be a democrat in existence the democrats
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:18.320]  are unpopular they're only put in power because bush tripled government
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:21.760]  launched all these illegal wars now in the time we've got left larry pratt
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:24.720]  this is very exciting you're saying you're seeing a major c change
[3:41:24.720 --> 3:41:28.480]  a rebellion against of the big government tyranny shifting years of the
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:32.320]  austin case looking at it from afar i know your
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:36.640]  lawyers are now studying it uh... the the austin gun show here for
[3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:40.800]  close to two decades they run out the saxet people that had been there since
[3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:45.360]  the early nineties a new guy comes in the police they come to a meeting vatfs
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.040]  they're running the meeting they say look
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:50.560]  you're gonna post a message that no private sales
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:55.200]  which are legal in texas uh... and it and they have the htb
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:41:58.640]  leaseholder there they said we're gonna shut you down
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:04.000]  if you don't do this and htb said you better put up the notice so
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:07.360]  so the owner of the gun show you know of the franchise he puts it up
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:12.000]  but has a petition to the governor and the attorney general to come stop this
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:15.680]  it's not a law just color of law and so
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:18.720]  the police we now know have called htb and others they called him this morning
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:22.480]  and said look you fought this no gun show they'll never be another gun show
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:25.200]  there again there won't be another gun show in austin
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:28.960]  you know under this police department under the vatf austin's a test case
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:33.120]  there aren't any gun shows get out by sundown i mean this is racketeering
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:36.560]  civil rights violation violates the commerce clause
[3:42:36.560 --> 3:42:41.200]  uh... it's called word i think under federal law is racketeering there
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:45.680]  what they have done is a criminal conspiracy a racketeering
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:50.640]  offense and especially since the vatf was involved directly
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:54.160]  that means you could trigger the federal law without anything else
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:57.360]  you know and you mentioned a lot of other good possibilities but
[3:42:57.360 --> 3:43:00.800]  this one is a tough one because it means that
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:04.880]  you are in a much more difficult position in court
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:09.360]  it was designed to go after the mafia then they expanded it to go after pro
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:14.000]  lifers no reason why sauce for the goose can't be sauce
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:17.600]  for the gander so we're taking a look at that but you know
[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:24.080]  to just take a step back i had made one mistake about obama i thought he was
[3:43:24.080 --> 3:43:28.240]  a slippery or character i thought he was going to
[3:43:28.240 --> 3:43:33.200]  push push his legislative agenda only as far as he could get away
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:36.320]  with it so as not to stir us up the way he has
[3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:40.080]  done as a matter of fact like joe stalling i mean he's going great guns
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:44.000]  he's rushing us absolutely and that's probably the best thing that could have
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:48.320]  happened because had it been a continuation of the decades long
[3:43:48.320 --> 3:43:52.080]  inching toward socialism i doubt that enough of us
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:56.000]  would have become aware of what is happening but he's done it
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:58.880]  now what i thought he was going to do right away
[3:43:58.880 --> 3:44:04.080]  was to use the instrumentality of agencies like the batf
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:10.880]  to legislate without going through the congress making stuff up just like you
[3:44:10.880 --> 3:44:14.560]  have reported just now what happened in austin
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:18.720]  is the bureaucrats just making up the law as they go
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:23.760]  and that means yeah that's going to draw attention that gets people excited
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:27.760]  but there's a little bit of distance between a bureaucrat who's there before
[3:44:27.760 --> 3:44:31.680]  during and after obama's an office and obama himself
[3:44:31.680 --> 3:44:35.360]  there's a little bit of a disconnect and i would have thought that they'd be
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:39.920]  doing this from day one and especially going after one of his favorite
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:43.040]  enemies the gun owner but here it is better
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:47.600]  late than never i guess in obama's view and so they're coming
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:50.640]  uh... with the bureaucracy to raise havoc
[3:44:50.640 --> 3:44:53.920]  uh... and this is an expansion of things such as
[3:44:53.920 --> 3:44:59.200]  happened to uh... all of some such as happened to various manufacturers that
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:03.840]  can't get licensing for products because of the arbitrariness of the
[3:45:03.840 --> 3:45:07.520]  of the bureau this is the kind of more overt
[3:45:07.520 --> 3:45:11.600]  evil that i was expecting to see earlier and uh...
[3:45:11.600 --> 3:45:18.080]  it's finally here very very exciting
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:24.160]  to to know that that they're putting everything they can on the fire
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:27.680]  to try to burn up the constitution but it's really only backfiring on them i
[3:45:27.680 --> 3:45:31.680]  agree with you the great danger is unless it's hootspa
[3:45:31.680 --> 3:45:35.920]  or bravada or whatever it is or or hubris
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:39.200]  i mean maybe they're right maybe they're gonna get away with it i mean or are
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:43.600]  they just that ham fisted i think it is the latter i really think
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:46.960]  they believe their own propaganda that they are right
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:50.960]  anybody else's evil that the people actually when
[3:45:50.960 --> 3:45:53.920]  this stuff is crammed down our throat will say
[3:45:53.920 --> 3:45:57.760]  oh that wasn't mud after all that really tastes good
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:03.440]  uh... i i i think to a certain extent they really believe it they also feel
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:07.760]  evidently a sense of urgency they know that they're not going to have their
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:12.400]  and they knew going in that they weren't going to have their supermajority
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:15.680]  but for this session of the congress this term of the congress
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:19.760]  these two years and so they're going for the gold while they can
[3:46:19.760 --> 3:46:24.480]  get away with it and evidently they uh... they don't really think they'll be
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:28.000]  defeated and even if they are well devil take the hind most
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:31.920]  they're going to grab the power while they can what they're not counting on
[3:46:31.920 --> 3:46:35.120]  is that they have become you know in a sense
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:38.320]  the president has fulfilled one of his campaign promises
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:43.440]  he has brought us together in massachusetts for example
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:47.600]  a democrat mayor of quincy it's a blue collar industrial town
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:51.680]  people work for a living there and their union oriented and they vote democrat
[3:46:51.680 --> 3:46:56.400]  he's been a democrat there for six terms whatever term is at least two years
[3:46:56.400 --> 3:47:00.160]  and he came out and endorsed brown on the basis
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:06.080]  of the obama care proposals if they don't want social which is so outrageous i mean
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:08.480]  we read the bills months ago people couldn't believe us
[3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:11.760]  i would read the bills the house incident version and listeners thought i was
[3:47:11.760 --> 3:47:16.480]  lying when it said five years in jail quarter million dollar fines taking
[3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:20.880]  money out of your paycheck uh... taxing your health plans
[3:47:20.880 --> 3:47:24.640]  uh... which aren't catalog i mean a lot of families do spend you know twelve
[3:47:24.640 --> 3:47:27.680]  thousand dollars a year whatever i mean this use
[3:47:27.680 --> 3:47:31.280]  cutting medicare and medicare and raising taxes i mean
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:35.520]  this is a ripoff i agree with the observation that was made that
[3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:38.560]  when we see things like the mayor of quincy
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:42.800]  doing what he did it it may well represent a re
[3:47:42.800 --> 3:47:48.400]  alignment once again of the column the reagan democrats people who are not
[3:47:48.400 --> 3:47:52.800]  philosophically conservative but they have an economic interest in being left
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:57.600]  alone and that's going to coincide with the republican if the republican
[3:47:57.600 --> 3:48:00.960]  is perceived as working to leave them alone
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:04.800]  it's pretty exactly and then getting away from rhinos
[3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:09.200]  because the republicans know if it took only six or seven months for obama to
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:11.440]  get the lowest approval rating in history
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:16.080]  for a president the first year if a republican doesn't immediately deliver
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:19.360]  and start slashing anti-gun laws and big government
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:22.560]  right that they're going to be out instantly and so it's not just a
[3:48:22.560 --> 3:48:26.160]  realignment towards conservatism it's a realignment
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:30.000]  of libertarian constitutional exactly completely away
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:33.120]  i mean the pendulum is swinging away from big government
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:37.440]  if the republicans were to gain control of the house
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:39.920]  there's a number of things that they could do
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:43.440]  even with president hussein still in the white house
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:47.760]  they could for example take the batf budget and they could say none of these
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:51.920]  funds may be used to enforce gun show and
[3:48:51.920 --> 3:48:54.800]  actions or or you know whatever would be the most
[3:48:54.800 --> 3:48:57.440]  technically correct legal language but you get the drift
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:00.720]  so you will investigate guns after a crime is committed
[3:49:00.720 --> 3:49:04.400]  you will not go harass old ladies you make them follow
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:08.240]  a a published list of procedures which they don't do
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:12.000]  they don't publish and so they keep changing from one trial to the next
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:15.600]  as to what was the determining factor blah blah blah none of these funds can
[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:18.880]  be used for that and so you the trick would be
[3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:22.400]  don't do it the way newt gingrich did back in 95 where you
[3:49:22.400 --> 3:49:25.520]  play chicken with the whole federal government budget
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:28.160]  now some of us probably wouldn't mind if it all went down but
[3:49:28.160 --> 3:49:31.840]  that you don't uh say okay we're just not going to raise the debt limit and
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:33.920]  that means you have to shut the government down
[3:49:33.920 --> 3:49:37.760]  well that politically it just isn't going to fly but you can
[3:49:37.760 --> 3:49:41.520]  if you get to work right away you could send a budget for the treasury
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:44.480]  department with the amputations in there that you want
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:48.000]  for batf uh well actually they're under under justice now excuse me
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:52.400]  but a justice department budget uh chopped up here there but you know
[3:49:52.400 --> 3:49:55.040]  leaving it essentially intact just a lot of
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:49:59.520]  fingers and arms and legs missing he can either veto it himself in which case
[3:49:59.520 --> 3:50:02.880]  the ball's in his court and who cares if the justice department
[3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:07.360]  gets shut down or he'll accept the amputations the problem is the bat
[3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:11.200]  apple just go firebomb another church to scare everybody into giving them
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:15.440]  funds well you know you can only have
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:19.040]  one waco at a time and as a lot of folks have said
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:22.560]  probably won't be for free the next time either
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:25.200]  you know and what's happening at the state level
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:29.200]  is also encouraging the governor of virginia who's
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:33.360]  raise right of center but he's no fighter uh first thing he did when he got
[3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:37.520]  elected was say do away if socialized medicine passes in
[3:50:37.520 --> 3:50:41.360]  washington not in my state and now we've got first 14 and then 18th
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:45.920]  state attorney general saying this is not just weights and measures
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:48.960]  it's unconstitutional because of the socialism absolutely but but but you
[3:50:48.960 --> 3:50:53.120]  can't selectively enforce certain rules on certain states this thing is dead
[3:50:53.120 --> 3:50:56.320]  even if they pass it and it looks like they may not even get that done
[3:50:56.320 --> 3:50:59.520]  learn crap up there on capitol hill i want to get your final take on that

[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:42.000]  century to come under scrutiny that's a quote by the head of the EU
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:47.760]  group here's another one Ron Paul use Geithner to impeach Obama like I said
[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:51.520]  with Ron Paul we could go on air use this to bring them all down Ron Paul's
[3:54:51.520 --> 3:54:54.960]  coming out I mean folks like Chilchescu or any of
[3:54:54.960 --> 3:55:00.560]  these thugs falling America is mad and the media tries to
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:04.640]  not let you know how awake people are but they are awake
[3:55:04.640 --> 3:55:08.880]  and the republicans and democrats can't can't scam us anymore
[3:55:08.880 --> 3:55:12.480]  with this bait and switch with whatever parties out of power acts like
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:15.120]  they're populist and constitutionalist they get in power

[3:55:25.040 --> 3:55:29.520]  and right now even with the lousy set of cards we have in the congress
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:35.360]  this socialized medical push does not have to happen
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:38.880]  the there's enough of those stupac democrats to
[3:55:38.880 --> 3:55:42.960]  use a term the pro-lifers that are insisting on their language
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:46.240]  that's in the house version that is not in the senate version
[3:55:46.240 --> 3:55:49.920]  that the option of just accepting the senate version
[3:55:49.920 --> 3:55:54.400]  is not all that likely in the house they just are and and they're less likely
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:55:58.560]  to get turned and a lot of times let's face it a blue dog is simply a
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:02.800]  liberal democrat that hasn't voted yet but they so this is another
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:06.800]  this is another hoax because you will be assimilated no way to stop us
[3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:10.160]  no yeah we're not we you can't win we win you lose
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:13.360]  uh this is inevitable it's going to happen soon well it's going to be
[3:56:13.360 --> 3:56:17.920]  happening soon since what last february uh it obviously is a mantra
[3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:22.400]  doesn't mean it's true so i don't see it coming through the house
[3:56:22.400 --> 3:56:26.480]  if the house agrees to something that might be acceptable to the senate
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:30.000]  when it comes back to the senate for their actual approval
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:33.280]  it comes back in the form parliamentarily
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:37.520]  as a new bill and all of the possibilities
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:42.400]  for filibuster are waiting for it all over again they've already had a mass
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:46.560]  exodus the democratic party's bleeding out a lot of them want this to end and
[3:56:46.560 --> 3:56:50.560]  fail so they can move on they know people are going to remember in a few months
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:55.200]  it come election time if this passes they are all politically dead we could
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:57:00.720]  possibly find a senator who would join with the republicans even without brown
[3:57:00.720 --> 3:57:04.320]  being seated in the senate to say hey wait a minute
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:07.600]  uh i know this is an important issue for our party
[3:57:07.600 --> 3:57:11.040]  but i'm not interested in being a kamikaze pilot
[3:57:11.040 --> 3:57:15.680]  i'm taking the next boat back to japan well we're going to find out tomorrow
[3:57:15.680 --> 3:57:19.280]  if brown wins we've got to pray for that as the founder said
[3:57:19.280 --> 3:57:22.960]  we need we need gridlock in washington not the
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:25.840]  the the the skids greased especially right now
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:29.520]  with obama who i've got to say is now officially the worst president u.s

[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:37.760]  doubt this guy is an absolute authoritarian an absolute anti-american
[3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:41.600]  absolutely dangerous i agree with michael savage he may stage terror attacks
[3:57:41.600 --> 3:57:44.720]  he may do anything we've got to stop him in closing
