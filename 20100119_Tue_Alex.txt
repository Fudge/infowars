[00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:09.811]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:11.392]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:12.974]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:17.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:21.222]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:49.826]  I really want to drill down into the news today and cover just a wide range of important stories and developments on our planet and inside our country here in the United States.
[00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:59.012]  In the third hour today, I have the operator and owner of the Texas Gun Show joining us with huge
[00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:03.095]  Horrible developments.
[00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:11.838]  Part two of what developed over the weekend and yesterday with the BATFE, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
[00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:15.739]  People keep emailing me saying, I thought it's the ATF.
[00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:17.019]  It's known as the ATF.
[00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:22.261]  They changed their name, what, five, six years ago to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
[00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.562]  But yes, the same group, the ATF, the Waco Killers.
[00:01:28.393 --> 00:01:41.060]  They just came into Austin, no law, no regulation, no statutory authority, and told the gun show operator, you will not allow private sales of firearms.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.821]  And said, this is a good notice for you to post and hand out.
[00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.123]  And the Austin Police Department was involved as well.
[00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:59.976]  And we've written three or four very important, extremely detailed reports up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com about it, because it's precedent-setting around the nation.
[00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:07.202]  And now we have the PrisonPlanet.com headline, Tennessee follows Texas in banning private gun shows.
[00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:11.946]  But at least Tennessee's attempting to pass a law to violate the Constitution.
[00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:13.768]  This is complete tyranny in Austin.
[00:02:16.277 --> 00:02:28.944]  Well, he got a call yesterday after the show, and I asked, was it because of the show, and he said, no, this decision had been made over the weekend, that the gun show is just completely banned now.
[00:02:28.944 --> 00:02:32.446]  There will never be a gun show in the Crockett Center again.
[00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:34.947]  The owners are saying because of police threats.
[00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:43.244]  And I realized, it really hit me this morning, that this is living in Chicago.
[00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:47.385]  The entire country is going under Chicago mafia-style rule.
[00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:56.127]  Where the police work for the mafia, which is the government, and if you don't pay them off, they just burn your nightclub down.
[00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.727]  That's how Chicago works.
[00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:00.788]  Aaron Russo talks about that in Reflections and Warnings.
[00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.952]  Or they just use regulations, or they just come and beat you up, or they just threaten your landlord.
[00:03:08.952 --> 00:03:11.153]  And it's just mafia!
[00:03:11.153 --> 00:03:13.794]  Just total law of the jungle.
[00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:18.475]  The police in the town I live, I guess, are the opposite of lawmen.
[00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:19.856]  They are there to violate the law.
[00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:21.476]  They are there to trample on it.
[00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:23.157]  They're there to take blood without warrants.
[00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:25.158]  They're there to just do whatever they want.
[00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:26.298]  Bunch of federal minions.
[00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:35.292]  And the Texas Gun Show doesn't have a lot of money, but they certainly have lawsuits.
[00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:44.714]  Civil rights violations, torturous interference, BATF violating the Commerce Clause.
[00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:50.996]  I mean, what jurisdiction do they have here, without federal or even state law, just in the town where I live saying,
[00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.440]  We checked into it for 20 years.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.242]  They've had a gun show there.
[00:03:56.242 --> 00:04:00.806]  They ran the last gun show out, Saxit, that had been there for 16 years.
[00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.348]  I made some phone calls and found out the actual numbers.
[00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:09.253]  I was going to that in college.
[00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:14.939]  I mainly went to get camping supplies and blow dart guns and, you know, just fun things to play around with.
[00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:18.518]  Crossbows, stuff like that.
[00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:20.658]  Just to go target shooting with.
[00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:22.118]  I never shot a deer with a crossbow.
[00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:24.599]  I've shot some deer with bows.
[00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.280]  Compound bows.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.060]  But, uh, it's over!
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.381]  You don't ever get to have a gun show in Austin.
[00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:36.262]  And the police are basically saying, you try to open another one anywhere, we're gonna shut it down.
[00:04:36.262 --> 00:04:37.962]  We don't need any stinking badges.
[00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:39.243]  We don't need anything.
[00:04:39.243 --> 00:04:41.703]  We've got guns!
[00:04:41.703 --> 00:04:43.784]  We've got a police chief that tells us we rule!
[00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:48.144]  And so we now have a complete mafia city.
[00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:51.868]  All right, I'm going to get into the special election in Massachusetts for senator.
[00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.911]  I'm going to get into the unbelievable developments in Haiti.
[00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.454]  I'm going to get into the banks looting us further.
[00:04:57.454 --> 00:04:58.154]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:58.154 --> 00:04:59.216]  You don't want to miss this broadcast.
[00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:03.819]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.144]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.144 --> 00:05:11.186]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:16.191]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.112]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:18.493]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:20.374]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:21.435]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:23.656]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.977]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:26.518]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.518 --> 00:05:31.782]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:35.364]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:38.847]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:40.408]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:41.309]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:42.410]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.351]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:44.432]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:47.494]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.696]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.696 --> 00:05:50.697]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:06.175]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:09.423]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.423 --> 00:06:10.826]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:14.208]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:20.594]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:25.799]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:35.788]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:38.230]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.831]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.293]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:44.414]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.414 --> 00:06:49.578]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:58.685]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.092 --> 00:07:05.374]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[00:07:05.374 --> 00:07:08.635]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:07:08.635 --> 00:07:16.438]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[00:07:16.698 --> 00:07:17.219]  We're good to go.
[00:07:34.957 --> 00:07:35.517]  We're good to go.
[00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:05.956]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:18.986]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:25.752]  Wycliffe John is a prolific multi-platinum musician.
[00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:36.828]  And he has given millions of dollars of his own money over the last decade to Haiti, where he's from.
[00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:42.050]  And he goes and produces videos where he's on the street handing money out.
[00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.791]  And I remember over the weekend
[00:08:44.793 --> 00:08:55.779]  Hearing ABC News on the radio, reading the articles saying, you know, charity watch groups question Wyclef Jean's charity.
[00:08:55.779 --> 00:09:06.826]  And then I dug and dug and dug in articles and did find an ABC News where it said, oh, his income tax records show that in 2007 he only collected $79,000 in donations
[00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:24.315]  And gave $411,000 of his own money, and so it looks like this charity isn't very effective at collecting money.
[00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:34.263]  And so, with that, they ran news headlines all over the country saying, don't give money to Wyclef Jean.
[00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:40.007]  And I actually spent the time to go look it up, because as soon as I heard them attacking him, I said, this must be a real charity.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.041]  And of course I went and looked it up.
[00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:55.487]  He's given millions and millions and millions of dollars building aid centers, giving them food, education, shoes, clothing.
[00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:58.288]  And because of that, that's why he's bad.
[00:09:58.288 --> 00:10:04.091]  I mean, that's like saying, this man may not be eligible to be a father.
[00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:06.532]  The CPS may need to take his children.
[00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:12.075]  Because his children all are straight-A students and have never been sick or in trouble.
[00:10:13.106 --> 00:10:16.968]  And so we have to take your children.
[00:10:16.968 --> 00:10:23.992]  I mean, in fact, I printed it off Sunday night and I'm looking around for it in my stack because I highlighted it.
[00:10:23.992 --> 00:10:28.495]  And we're going to dig it out from ABC News because it's Orwellian.
[00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:29.655]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:10:29.655 --> 00:10:32.117]  You read the headlines saying that people are questioning
[00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:37.143]  So they just put the word out, don't give to him, no, give to United Way.
[00:10:53.527 --> 00:11:16.112]  That's what Bill Clinton and George W. Bush say, and give to the American Red Cross, who on record, at every major disaster, keep more than half the money for themselves, lie to the public, and say it's all going to the people that are in trouble, and then give the money to anti-gun groups, and pro-big government groups, and land-grabbing fake environmental groups.
[00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:17.112]  I mean, that's on record.
[00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.793]  And so it's a swindle.
[00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:28.696]  Oh no, don't give to local church groups in the country.
[00:11:28.696 --> 00:11:30.117]  Don't give to real charities.
[00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:31.838]  Don't give to small organizations.
[00:11:31.838 --> 00:11:40.225]  No, go to the big charity watchdog groups and give to them.
[00:11:40.225 --> 00:11:43.527]  And they list a bunch of crooks.
[00:11:43.527 --> 00:11:46.930]  I was driving into work this morning scanning through talk radio and every station was
[00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:52.649]  This station would like you to give to the United Way and the American Red Cross.
[00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:58.093]  This station would like you to give to the two known criminal groups.
[00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:02.776]  But not Wycliffe, because people question whether... That's what the article said.
[00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:10.822]  They said, well, since the charity's mainly him giving most of his money away, you know, the question is, can he handle the $5 million he raised in three days?
[00:12:11.926 --> 00:12:28.539]  Very jealous, because this was a small charity, mainly Wycliffe Jean, giving most of his money, and so because he's giving most of his money, and it's only, you know, a half million dollars a year or so total, it's a small charity, he can't afford it.
[00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:36.946]  I mean, you know, he obviously doesn't know how to distribute five million, so don't give to him, he's bad!
[00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:38.167]  Here's USA Today.
[00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:39.128]  Wycliffe Jean,
[00:12:41.107 --> 00:12:42.809]  Haiti charity comes under fire.
[00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:54.639]  Donations continue to roll in to Grammy award-winning musician Wyclef Jean's Haiti, Yali Haiti, an organization that works to raise awareness and support for Haiti since its founding in 2005.
[00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.319]  Indeed, with just a few days of
[00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:01.739]  Catastrophic earthquake in Haiti.
[00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:04.100]  The organization received more than 2 million.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:10.801]  Now they're reporting it's up to 5 million in donations via $5 text messages from concerned supporters.
[00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:18.522]  But the organization's questionable financial health is causing some charitable watchdogs to step forward with their concerns.
[00:13:18.522 --> 00:13:23.603]  For instance, the foundation's spending exceeded its revenues by $411,000.
[00:13:28.695 --> 00:13:36.202]  With a large percent of its expenses benefiting several of Jon's for-profit businesses, ABC News reports.
[00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:37.683]  And then that's the one I want.
[00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:39.965]  Guys, oh, you did print it, here it is.
[00:13:39.965 --> 00:13:40.986]  Groups raise doubts.
[00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:50.294]  And when you go to ABC, see how USA Today spun that to sound, man, he... And then you find out that no, he gave $411,000 and $79,000 was donated.
[00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:57.682]  Now that is spin, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:57.682 --> 00:14:02.212]  Because the way this USA Today article is written, you think he's running a scam.
[00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:22.332]  Then they go on to say, my concern is, this is Sandra Meninenti, Vice President of Marketing for the Watchdog Charity Navigator, tells ABC News, that the organization may not be expected and experienced enough to handle the extreme level of damage and devastation of Haiti.
[00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:24.173]  Well, yeah, that's why everybody works together.
[00:14:24.173 --> 00:14:28.856]  But you're better to send, as Ron Paul has said, lots of little charities in, but instead the U.S.
[00:14:28.856 --> 00:14:29.557]  military's there
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.586]  They've locked it down, the French government's even said, and won't let people get aid in.
[00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:35.087]  See?
[00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:35.487]  Just like...
[00:14:36.673 --> 00:14:37.574]  New Orleans.
[00:14:37.574 --> 00:14:44.858]  They're going to lock it down, not let the aid get in, and then they're going to ship the Haitians to the U.S., and they're going to end up being your cops.
[00:14:44.858 --> 00:14:45.738]  That's how it works.
[00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:49.400]  They bring in the minority groups, get them on welfare, and make them your rulers.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.221]  That's what Minnesota is now.
[00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:53.063]  People are ruled by the foreigners they brought in.
[00:14:53.063 --> 00:14:54.063]  In Minneapolis-St.
[00:14:54.063 --> 00:14:58.806]  Paul, you drive around and half the cops are foreigners, can't even speak English, and they'll do what they're told.
[00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:02.068]  And so, the Haitians will be shipped here and be made our rulers.
[00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:08.088]  And, of course, Wycliffe Jean, he won't be allowed to bring anything to him.
[00:15:08.088 --> 00:15:10.328]  So, won't be allowed to actually save him.
[00:15:10.328 --> 00:15:18.610]  Large portions will just die, and then they'll bring, you know, half a million Haitians here to be put on welfare, and then ten years later be given submachine guns to rule over us.
[00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.290]  I mean, that's the, quote, liberal model.
[00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.151]  That's how this works.
[00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:24.871]  They're making the illegal aliens cops and military now.
[00:15:24.871 --> 00:15:26.411]  That's Associated Press.
[00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:29.512]  The number one recruiting center in the world, Mexico City, for the army.
[00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:32.608]  That's how you get foreign troops.
[00:15:32.608 --> 00:15:37.810]  You just make your military out of foreign troops.
[00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:44.752]  So, you know, you read that and it says, ooh, $411,000 with large percent of its expenses benefiting several of John's for-profit businesses.
[00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:55.496]  Then, you actually read the ABC News they link to, and it says, in 2007, this is ABC News, the foundation spending exceeded its revenue by $411,000.
[00:15:57.788 --> 00:16:00.570]  It brought in just $79,000 that year.
[00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:13.418]  And it goes on to say he gave $411,000 from his for-profit businesses to the Haitians, but USA Today like devils.
[00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:15.159]  Man, we ought to write an article about this.
[00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:17.480]  I mean, this is mainstream media fraud.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:26.506]  This is what's so disgusting about these people, how they can take something good and turn it into something bad.
[00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:41.377]  And ladies and gentlemen, I have literally 20, 30, I don't know, more articles that make me just as angry, that are just as important, and I've just spent basically eight, nine minutes on this and I've got to move on.
[00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:43.298]  But here are the articles to go read it for yourself.
[00:16:43.298 --> 00:16:46.520]  USA Today, Wycliffe Johns,
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:17:10.306]  Yeah, Lee Haiti charity comes under fire and then it just totally distorts yellow journalism and says he made $411,000 off this for himself and then you read the actual ABC News report that they just stole from and twisted from and it's still deceptive with groups raised doubts about Wycliffe Jean's charity and then it goes on to admit well he only
[00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:15.214]  Raised from other people donating $79,000 in 2007, but he gave $411,000 from his own business.
[00:17:15.214 --> 00:17:16.056]  That is true charity.
[00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:16.597]  That is admirable.
[00:17:26.308 --> 00:17:30.070]  By the way, Wyclef Jean, we play one of his songs here on air.
[00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:34.232]  His rendition of... I forget the title of the song.
[00:17:34.232 --> 00:17:37.294]  They point a cannon at you, fortunate son.
[00:17:37.294 --> 00:17:38.854]  Can you cue that up, John?
[00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:40.315]  Maybe we can go out to break with it.
[00:17:40.315 --> 00:17:40.955]  If you can find it.
[00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:42.276]  If not, we'll play it later.
[00:17:42.276 --> 00:17:43.597]  But I'm done talking about this.
[00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:45.158]  I haven't even gotten into Haiti yet.
[00:17:45.158 --> 00:17:47.899]  Yes, they plan to ship the Haitians here.
[00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:49.019]  Holy mackerel!
[00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:53.582]  As if we're not already bankrupt enough with 30-plus million illegal aliens running all over us.
[00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:59.043]  Just the state's all going bankrupt and the crime and everything else.
[00:17:59.043 --> 00:18:00.904]  They're not going to help the Haitians in Haiti.
[00:18:00.904 --> 00:18:11.729]  The army's there locking down, deciding who can come in with charity, as they always do, just like Katrina.
[00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:15.731]  And they're now saying they're going to ship the Haitians here.
[00:18:15.731 --> 00:18:20.233]  How many millions of Haitians are there?
[00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:22.434]  Let's go out to break with the evil
[00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:26.481]  Wycliffe, who dare gives his own money to Haiti.
[00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:26.761]  Here it is.
[00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.555]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[00:18:45.555 --> 00:18:47.136]  Ooh!
[00:18:47.136 --> 00:18:49.759]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.262]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:18:52.262 --> 00:18:59.330]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.751]  Tell them!
[00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:21.450]  God, it ain't me It ain't me, no I ain't no sinner's son It ain't me, no It ain't me, no I ain't no fortunate one Some folks are born silver spoon in their hand
[00:19:27.558 --> 00:19:31.259]  Lord, don't they have themselves?
[00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:33.919]  Don't they have themselves?
[00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:51.382]  The taxman give them the key to the land And wonder why there's nothing left for school and him Yeah, tell me It ain't me, no It ain't me, no I ain't no millionaire, son
[00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:55.507]  It didn't mean

[00:21:01.824 --> 00:21:05.871]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:05.871 --> 00:21:09.096]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:09.096 --> 00:21:10.499]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:21:11.301 --> 00:21:13.884]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:13.884 --> 00:21:20.289]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:25.354]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:35.463]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:37.925]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:37.925 --> 00:21:39.507]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.969]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:43.810]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.235]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:49.235 --> 00:21:54.260]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:22:00.325 --> 00:22:06.669]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:11.592]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[00:22:11.592 --> 00:22:15.674]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[00:22:15.674 --> 00:22:17.015]  Let's put this another way.
[00:22:17.015 --> 00:22:22.378]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[00:22:22.378 --> 00:22:25.280]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.941]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:29.322]  You can possess it in your hand.
[00:22:29.642 --> 00:22:30.903]  You can take it with you.
[00:22:30.903 --> 00:22:32.383]  Gold is real money.
[00:22:32.383 --> 00:22:33.744]  Gold is honest money.
[00:22:33.744 --> 00:22:36.465]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

[00:23:00.393 --> 00:23:03.934]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.934 --> 00:23:06.215]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.215 --> 00:23:07.095]  Don't!
[00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:10.536]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:23:38.572 --> 00:23:39.933]  What have you got to lose?

[00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:48.139]  888-352-7726.
[00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:48.579]  FBI's behind you.
[00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:49.280]  CIA's behind you.
[00:24:10.021 --> 00:24:10.861]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:11.942]  You're my man.
[00:24:11.942 --> 00:24:14.743]  Secret Service.
[00:24:14.743 --> 00:24:16.364]  Yeah, tell him.
[00:24:16.364 --> 00:24:19.365]  I'm the fortunate one.
[00:24:19.365 --> 00:24:21.026]  No, no, no, no.
[00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.946]  FBI.
[00:24:22.946 --> 00:24:26.808]  C-I-N-I.
[00:24:26.808 --> 00:24:28.489]  Yeah.
[00:24:28.489 --> 00:24:36.092]  Secret Service.
[00:24:36.092 --> 00:24:36.352]  Just.
[00:24:36.352 --> 00:24:36.492]  Just.
[00:24:40.743 --> 00:24:52.129]  That's Wyclef Jean actually giving money for years to Haiti, his own money, so he's bad.
[00:24:52.129 --> 00:25:00.034]  Man, I want to get him on, but he's actually in Haiti right now risking his life.
[00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:04.216]  If you've got to give money to a big charity, I've done the research over the years.
[00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:09.973]  The Salvation Army has the highest rating I've seen of a big charity.
[00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:20.835]  90% of the money you give actually gets given to someone as food or blankets or cots or church services.
[00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:22.656]  Clothing.
[00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:28.237]  And that's who, when I was growing up in Dallas, every Christmas, every holiday, we would go spend
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:29.600]  I don't
[00:25:47.557 --> 00:25:59.504]  I've taken my children to give at charities and, you know, to deliver clothes and food and to go give shoes and clothes to a local charity for Haiti, but that's not enough.
[00:25:59.504 --> 00:26:08.890]  I've got to, even though I'm very busy, I've got to get around to taking them down to really, really see the homeless, really witness it, really witness people that are down and out.
[00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.551]  It's very important for their education.
[00:26:12.253 --> 00:26:21.800]  And I mean, I'm not up here telling parents what to do with their children, but it certainly was instrumental in my upbringing that it at least be done a few times a year.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.122]  My cousin Buckley Hammond does a great job.
[00:26:24.122 --> 00:26:36.391]  He was dating this girl he really liked, and she was always going to a Methodist church that runs a soup kitchen, what, five days a week, and now he does that pretty much full-time in his spare time and loves it.
[00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:40.860]  And it is better to give than to receive.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:50.181]  The problem is, the globalists are masters at taking your donations, your goodwill, and using it towards evil.
[00:26:50.181 --> 00:26:57.082]  That's why the best way to be involved in charities is at point-blank range.
[00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:58.823]  And charity starts in your own community.
[00:26:58.823 --> 00:27:06.064]  It's a charity to the community to go speak out against gun control at your city council, or against land grabbing.
[00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:13.793]  You know, helping people who are having their land stolen without just compensation all over the country by the environmentalists.
[00:27:13.793 --> 00:27:19.536]  I mean, do you know the type of looting and financial raping going on?
[00:27:19.536 --> 00:27:24.499]  I mean, do you know the CPS grabs over a million children a year without due process?
[00:27:24.499 --> 00:27:30.622]  And they're five to seven times, depending on what federal statistic, more likely to abuse children than any other group.
[00:27:30.622 --> 00:27:32.063]  That's charity.
[00:27:32.063 --> 00:27:35.045]  Real charity means defending people from criminals and government.
[00:27:36.417 --> 00:27:40.879]  And so everything we do here is a defense of the innocent.
[00:27:40.879 --> 00:27:47.261]  There are 9.88 million people, as of a census a few years ago in Haiti, it's well over 10 million now.
[00:27:47.261 --> 00:28:02.486]  Their population increases, according to the World Parasite Bank, World Bank, by 1.44% a year, and so this is a three-year-old census, so... I guess that must mean it's ranked 82nd
[00:28:04.963 --> 00:28:09.264]  Largest population in the world, so it's well over 10 million right now.
[00:28:09.264 --> 00:28:20.908]  I guess that would make it about 12 million, 13 million that are now in Haiti, going off this older population number.
[00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.589]  The language is Haitian, Creole, French, and French.
[00:28:23.589 --> 00:28:25.089]  95% black, 5% white and mixed.
[00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:27.290]  Religion, 95% Christianity, 2.7% spiritualism,
[00:28:35.834 --> 00:28:39.915]  That's the voodoo.
[00:28:39.915 --> 00:28:46.958]  95% Christian, and people are saying, oh, because they got some voodoo down there, they all deserve to die, and it's judgment of God.
[00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:50.679]  A lot of people have been asking me, is this an earthquake weapon?
[00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:51.219]  I don't know.
[00:28:51.219 --> 00:28:56.081]  Secretary of Defense, in 1997, in a press conference with the Army Times,
[00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:07.713]  April 28, 1997 said that we have earthquake weapons, weather weapons, and tectonic volcanic weapons.
[00:29:07.713 --> 00:29:09.954]  The government said that.
[00:29:09.954 --> 00:29:12.335]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:18.577]  I know they've got systems since the 60s declassified five years ago that can create hurricanes and control them.
[00:29:18.577 --> 00:29:24.999]  I know we've interviewed a lot of top meteorologists saying that Katrina was clearly unnatural.
[00:29:24.999 --> 00:29:25.339]  I don't know.
[00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:28.264]  But I sure know they're going to use this.
[00:29:28.264 --> 00:29:34.006]  We're going to break down the latest developments in Haiti and their plan to ship them here.
[00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:36.427]  What a nightmare.
[00:29:36.427 --> 00:29:38.547]  As this country descends into depression.
[00:29:38.547 --> 00:29:41.588]  Then we're going to get into the latest attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:29:41.588 --> 00:29:42.649]  It's bad.
[00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:45.609]  Part two of what's happening here with the banning of the gun show.
[00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:47.350]  Just an outright ban on the gun show now.
[00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.071]  We'll tell you about that as well.
[00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:52.471]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.471 --> 00:29:53.972]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.004 --> 00:30:00.608]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:01.769]  What's your home worth?
[00:30:01.769 --> 00:30:03.870]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.912]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[00:31:02.069 --> 00:31:06.090]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.351]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:10.752]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.122]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:20.527]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.527 --> 00:31:25.711]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.711 --> 00:31:35.719]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:38.181]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:39.762]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.762 --> 00:31:42.224]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.224 --> 00:31:44.346]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:49.490]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:58.617]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.638 --> 00:32:02.480]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.906]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[00:32:06.906 --> 00:32:12.693]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[00:32:12.693 --> 00:32:17.038]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:18.740]  No more protection till you use it again.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.221]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:24.625]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.

[00:32:57.658 --> 00:32:57.938]  That's 888-245-0300.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:38.394]  Coming up in an hour and a half, in the third hour, we've got the proprietor, manager, the owner, Darwin Bedecker, joining us.
[00:33:38.394 --> 00:33:42.898]  They just went ahead and called in yesterday and just said, look, gun shows are banned in that building.
[00:33:43.857 --> 00:33:46.038]  Police ordered HEB.
[00:33:46.038 --> 00:33:47.739]  There's no physical order.
[00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:48.979]  It's just they rule.
[00:33:48.979 --> 00:33:50.280]  They've got the weapons.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.961]  We're here to pay them taxes and lick their boots.
[00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:55.842]  And there'll never be a gun show there again.
[00:33:55.842 --> 00:33:57.783]  Do you understand, boy?
[00:33:57.783 --> 00:34:02.645]  And so, that's the bottom line now.
[00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:06.087]  Because they don't want us rallying people there.
[00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:11.569]  They don't want us standing up against the unconstitutional directive from the BATF.
[00:34:13.106 --> 00:34:14.066]  So that's coming up.
[00:34:14.066 --> 00:34:25.911]  Then we've got, for 30 minutes, Aaron Zellman, Jews the Preservation of Firearms ownership, with what he thinks we should do about this, and the latest on the attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:34.974]  All over the country, the feds are financing the legislatures, pushing them with promises of federal funds if they'll ban gun shows outright.
[00:34:34.974 --> 00:34:36.755]  That's going on in Tennessee and other places.
[00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:37.855]  That's coming up.
[00:34:37.855 --> 00:34:41.537]  And then we've got Larry Pratt popping in on this front.
[00:34:43.348 --> 00:34:45.810]  So that is coming up.
[00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:50.373]  I want to, I just have huge stacks of important news here.
[00:34:50.373 --> 00:34:58.880]  I also want to open the phones up throughout the full broadcast today on any issue, any news item, any news story you wish to discuss with us.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:58.960]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.060]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.962]  I want to blitz through some news
[00:35:12.537 --> 00:35:23.059]  Here in a moment after I give you the latest on what's happening with the Haiti situation and my big concerns here, but then we're going to go to your
[00:35:24.278 --> 00:35:25.098]  Your phone calls.
[00:35:25.098 --> 00:35:44.749]  I almost have a fear of going to the calls because every time I go to calls, callers call in with breaking huge news that we then ferret out and confirm and it's always some new horrible violation of rights and freedoms going on covertly and illegally by the federal government at the local level.
[00:35:44.749 --> 00:35:47.891]  But nevertheless, we are going to your phone calls.
[00:35:47.891 --> 00:35:50.012]  I mean, I'm not here on this radio show
[00:35:52.432 --> 00:35:55.833]  Trying to find evidence of government corruption.
[00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:57.454]  There's so much of it.
[00:35:57.454 --> 00:36:00.995]  I'm exhausted mentally, psychologically, spiritually.
[00:36:00.995 --> 00:36:02.695]  I don't even want to learn more.
[00:36:02.695 --> 00:36:03.996]  I don't even want to know more.
[00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:05.816]  I'm like the general public.
[00:36:05.816 --> 00:36:11.898]  I'm so deep down this rat hole, this Alice in Wonderland system, that I can't believe it.
[00:36:11.898 --> 00:36:15.179]  I can't believe the bold corruption.
[00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:17.080]  Now they're saying a new banker bailout.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.021]  Trillions more robbing everything.
[00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:19.341]  I mean, I...
[00:36:23.274 --> 00:36:27.815]  And then I see fake revolutions that are controlled by the government.
[00:36:27.815 --> 00:36:32.236]  I mean, this thing in Massachusetts is wonderful, on the surface.
[00:36:32.236 --> 00:36:52.499]  I mean, you've got a Democrat-controlled seat that's never been Republican, and it looks like the Republican's going to win, taking Ted Kennedy's seat, and that shows that the ultra-liberal brainwashed collectivist in Massachusetts have finally had enough and know that Obama completely betrayed them.
[00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:58.373]  And so they're hoping Republicans won't betray them.
[00:36:58.373 --> 00:36:59.594]  But the Democrats don't care.
[00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:01.836]  They say, we don't care if it destroys our party.
[00:37:01.836 --> 00:37:03.938]  We're going to pass government takeover of healthcare.
[00:37:05.049 --> 00:37:13.297]  Because they're bought and paid for by big banks, and they're going to get multi-million dollar jobs in the private sector as part of their payoffs, and they don't care.
[00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:14.638]  They're bank robbers.
[00:37:14.638 --> 00:37:16.500]  They don't care if you don't like them.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:23.567]  And the Republicans are going to betray you as they take over the House and Senate in the next two to three years, probably this year.
[00:37:23.567 --> 00:37:26.750]  And you watch, just like when the Democrats got in in 2006 and the wars expanded.
[00:37:29.696 --> 00:37:31.418]  Obama gets in.
[00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:39.244]  So we've got to ask ourselves, how do we fix this when both parties, whatever party's out of power, poses as if they're patriots.
[00:37:39.244 --> 00:37:41.647]  The Republican Party sounds like Alex Jones.
[00:37:41.647 --> 00:37:47.852]  I mean, Dick Armey's talking about world government, world socialism, new world order, Glenn Beck is.
[00:37:47.852 --> 00:37:49.954]  But what is Glenn Beck's solution?
[00:37:49.954 --> 00:37:52.236]  An excise tax and a sales tax?
[00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:54.358]  I drove into work this morning and tuned into him.
[00:37:55.362 --> 00:38:02.026]  I tuned in for five minutes, spot-checking different shows, and he was saying we've got to have new taxes.
[00:38:02.026 --> 00:38:05.448]  He had Kramer on from CNBC.
[00:38:05.448 --> 00:38:07.349]  Oh, we need new taxes!
[00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:09.710]  Oh, it's so conservative to pay off this debt!
[00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.272]  It's an illegal debt to foreign banks!
[00:38:12.272 --> 00:38:15.814]  We don't need to pay it!
[00:38:15.814 --> 00:38:20.016]  When they've got the supposed patriots pushing for new taxes, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:26.166]  Do you need me to explain to you that that's why he's Benedict Arnold?
[00:38:26.166 --> 00:38:28.669]  I love Napolitano.
[00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:33.815]  I'm not going after Beck because he's got the number one TV show on cable news.
[00:38:33.815 --> 00:38:35.978]  I would love it if he was a real deal.
[00:38:35.978 --> 00:38:37.740]  He's not!
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.643]  They've got a little bit of Napolitano they spice up here and there.
[00:38:41.872 --> 00:38:46.713]  Because he's for real, and then they can get the whole Libertarian Ron Paul audience with it.
[00:38:46.713 --> 00:38:49.894]  And we need to put pressure on Beck to knock it off!
[00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:56.115]  He's got all these conservative zombies out there now chanting, we need tax raise, we need new taxes.
[00:38:56.115 --> 00:39:00.796]  No, no, no, no, no!
[00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:03.777]  That is not conservative!
[00:39:03.777 --> 00:39:07.338]  Every time I tune into the TV show or the radio show, he's calling for taxes.
[00:39:07.338 --> 00:39:08.898]  He must be doing this every five minutes!
[00:39:11.385 --> 00:39:20.132]  I literally watch YouTube clips of him two or three times a week of select things he does, and a lot of times we have multiple TVs on so people can just monitor.
[00:39:20.132 --> 00:39:35.784]  We have two TVs in the studio, TV in the coffee room, TVs back in the hallways, on different C-Span, different news channels, and I'll be in there getting coffee at 10 o'clock at night or something, and they'll be re-airing Beck, or it'll be 5 o'clock and I'm up here and they got him on.
[00:39:36.525 --> 00:39:48.873]  I'll be sitting there, and it's just every time I see the deception, I see the sucker punch, I see the Benedict Arnold, I mean, and I don't want to be enemies with Beck.
[00:39:48.873 --> 00:39:50.594]  It's not good for my radio show.
[00:39:50.594 --> 00:39:57.699]  It's not good for the success of what I do, but it is good for the country, and so I'm gonna ram him.
[00:39:57.699 --> 00:40:06.185]  I'm gonna ram him politically, just like you think it was popular to come out day one when they staged 9-11 and document how it was an inside job, lost more than half of my stations?
[00:40:09.144 --> 00:40:15.930]  You think it was good to attack Obama when he had an 85, 86, 87, depending on the poll approval rating?
[00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.591]  I rammed him.
[00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:20.713]  I rammed him the day he got elected as a trader.
[00:40:20.713 --> 00:40:23.436]  I rammed him as soon as he got in office.
[00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:31.212]  You think it was popular to come out day one with the Obama deception and say he was a complete liar and betrayer?
[00:40:31.212 --> 00:40:35.154]  Now, six, eight months later, I'm looking good, aren't I?
[00:40:35.154 --> 00:40:36.634]  Because I told the truth!
[00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.295]  I was right again!
[00:40:38.295 --> 00:40:45.597]  And I told you Obama's bad, and I told you George Bush was bad, and I'm telling you Glenn Beck is bonafide evil.
[00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:51.799]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[00:40:51.799 --> 00:40:53.600]  Just a word to the wise is sufficient.
[00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:58.767]  He called for the banker bailout.
[00:40:58.767 --> 00:41:00.771]  And every time I mention that, I get emails saying I'm a liar.
[00:41:02.597 --> 00:41:02.977]  Oh really?
[00:41:02.977 --> 00:41:05.879]  Just go to YouTube and type in, Glenn Beck supports bailout.
[00:41:05.879 --> 00:41:09.281]  Or go to the video clip, Glenn Beck neo-con not libertarian.
[00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:10.782]  It has the clips of him.
[00:41:10.782 --> 00:41:15.165]  Calling Ron Paul a kook, a nut, saying arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:17.406]  They've got new clips of him a few months ago doing it.
[00:41:17.406 --> 00:41:20.188]  He is a double talking piece of trash.
[00:41:20.188 --> 00:41:22.829]  Look, I hate Chris Matthews.
[00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:24.290]  I can't stand him.
[00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.492]  He makes me sick.
[00:41:26.492 --> 00:41:28.393]  He is an absolute piece of trash.
[00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:33.943]  A race-baiting person injecting racial division.
[00:41:33.943 --> 00:41:37.664]  You know, if you think Obama's a socialist, that's code word for the N-word.
[00:41:37.664 --> 00:41:39.445]  You know, really evil stuff.
[00:41:39.445 --> 00:41:45.248]  But at least he's evil and out in the open as an American-hating piece of trash.
[00:41:45.248 --> 00:41:48.009]  Alright, I said I was going to cover Haiti and get to other news and take your calls.
[00:41:48.009 --> 00:41:52.891]  It's just... I can't stand phoniness.
[00:41:55.154 --> 00:41:59.395]  And I can't stand watching people getting conned.
[00:41:59.395 --> 00:42:03.596]  I cannot abide it.
[00:42:03.596 --> 00:42:05.097]  Hey, you want to get betrayed though?
[00:42:05.097 --> 00:42:05.537]  Go ahead.
[00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:08.458]  Just like you moron Democrats.
[00:42:08.458 --> 00:42:11.538]  You are so stupid!
[00:42:11.538 --> 00:42:14.319]  Of course Obama was a shill.
[00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:16.540]  Of course he was a con man.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.320]  Of course he betrayed everything he said he'd do.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.361]  Look at his donors.
[00:42:20.361 --> 00:42:21.341]  Look at who he appointed.
[00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:31.897]  A year out during the election, he was saying he'd end the war immediately, end wiretapping, end secret arrest, end torture, end all the wars, not hire any lobbyists.
[00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:37.521]  And I said on air, I said, if this guy's for real, they will assassinate him.
[00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:43.452]  And there were stories about the Secret Service not protecting him in Dallas, and I said, man, this looks bad.
[00:42:43.452 --> 00:43:02.805]  But I said, because he's got Rahm Emanuel behind him, because he, who's the guy that stopped the Democrats from ending the war in 2006, Han showed that, because he's got Axelrod, because of the people around him, because of the fact he's gotten three to five times, depending on the donor, on average it's four times, the Wall Street money McCain's got, I said 98% chance this is a scam.
[00:43:05.586 --> 00:43:15.611]  And then we knew it was a scam four months before he got elected in November of 2008, because he immediately said, I never said we were going to get out of Iraq immediately.
[00:43:15.611 --> 00:43:17.512]  16 months.
[00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:18.853]  By the time he got elected, it was 20 months.
[00:43:20.114 --> 00:43:21.975]  Well, I never said to get rid of the Patriot Act.
[00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:23.556]  Well, I never said I wouldn't hire lobbyists.
[00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:25.857]  Well, I never said I wouldn't have signing statements.
[00:43:25.857 --> 00:43:27.899]  And I said, I said, that's it.
[00:43:27.899 --> 00:43:30.160]  I've been recording everything he's been doing.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.062]  They're building him up as this messianic leader.
[00:43:33.062 --> 00:43:36.924]  He does have all these admitted authoritarians in his administration.
[00:43:36.924 --> 00:43:39.926]  We declare war on Obama in the Infowar.
[00:43:39.926 --> 00:43:43.628]  And I began making the Obama deception on election night.
[00:43:44.864 --> 00:43:52.650]  I'd already quietly told my team three months before, he's going to be the president, he's going to betray, we're going to make a film called the Obama Deception on him.
[00:43:55.979 --> 00:44:03.985]  And we went into gear and the media said, how did Alex Jones, only a month and a half after he got in office, already have a film out thing?
[00:44:03.985 --> 00:44:12.171]  And that was the line on the George Soros news websites was, Mr. Jones does a hate piece before Obama's even had time to do anything.
[00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:15.173]  Making up all these lies.
[00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:17.915]  You watch that film, it is evergreen.
[00:44:17.915 --> 00:44:20.476]  People watch it and they go, how did this guy make this?
[00:44:21.337 --> 00:44:25.140]  When Obama had just been elected, how did he know all this would happen?
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.943]  Because I can read all the white papers of every one of his czars!
[00:44:28.943 --> 00:44:30.504]  I know what they think!
[00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:33.707]  I stay up till 3, 4 in the morning reading what they say!
[00:44:33.707 --> 00:44:38.350]  And then I get up here and I've got so much knowledge and information, I can't even dump it all on you!
[00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.251]  There's too much of it!
[00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:51.400]  And guaranteed the Republicans are going to get in and betray you and stage terror attacks and launch new wars.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.380]  And you know what?
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.082]  I'm not saying vote for the Democrats either.
[00:44:55.082 --> 00:44:56.623]  I'm saying, what do we do?
[00:44:56.623 --> 00:44:58.244]  This is a scam.
[00:44:58.244 --> 00:45:02.106]  It's like I'm at a Don King boxing match and people are saying, who are you going to bet on, Alex?
[00:45:02.106 --> 00:45:03.166]  Who are you going to bet on?
[00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.007]  And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:45:04.007 --> 00:45:06.928]  I don't know who Don King has rigged this for.
[00:45:06.928 --> 00:45:07.969]  He owns both the fighters.
[00:45:08.735 --> 00:45:10.716]  They're like, but don't you like the boxing match, Alex?
[00:45:10.716 --> 00:45:15.237]  Don't you think this guy's got, you know, better punching power and more stamina?
[00:45:15.237 --> 00:45:16.137]  It doesn't matter!
[00:45:16.137 --> 00:45:16.798]  It's rigged!
[00:45:16.798 --> 00:45:18.998]  Don't you people get it?
[00:45:18.998 --> 00:45:22.059]  I don't know what we do!
[00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:28.061]  But I can't just play along with this phony, baloney narrative.
[00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:30.662]  You know, I do know what we do, but it's a wide range of things.
[00:45:30.662 --> 00:45:32.683]  We get Libertarians and Republicans
[00:45:34.582 --> 00:45:44.484]  Elected, who have the bona fides, who have the facts, who have the pedigree, like Ron Paul, like Deborah Medina, people like that.
[00:45:44.484 --> 00:45:52.326]  You run for office, whether it's dog catcher, or the school board, or mayor, or whatever it is, or the water district.
[00:45:52.326 --> 00:45:54.646]  Believe me, there's corruption going on everywhere.
[00:45:54.646 --> 00:45:58.207]  One good person in one of those bodies can sabotage the corruption.
[00:45:59.963 --> 00:46:01.764]  You just get up and start fighting.
[00:46:01.764 --> 00:46:03.145]  Doesn't mean you got all the answers.
[00:46:03.145 --> 00:46:05.227]  Doesn't mean you land every punch.
[00:46:05.227 --> 00:46:09.270]  But, I mean, just get it going, folks.
[00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:12.833]  I'm sure a lot of you have been in a fistfight with some bully.
[00:46:12.833 --> 00:46:15.075]  I mean, you don't sit there and calculate it all.
[00:46:15.075 --> 00:46:18.037]  You just, you stomp somebody.
[00:46:18.037 --> 00:46:19.058]  Just start stomping!
[00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:24.195]  Open up a can of resistance!
[00:46:24.195 --> 00:46:25.536]  It's like cleaning your garage out.
[00:46:25.536 --> 00:46:40.610]  You know, you haven't cleaned it in three, four years, it's full of crud, just jam-packed full of spiderwebs and garbage and Christmas ornaments and everything else and old clothes, and if you sit there and eat around the edges of it and fiddle-prattle with it, you'll never get it done.
[00:46:42.486 --> 00:46:44.266]  You just gotta get going.
[00:46:44.266 --> 00:46:45.987]  Does it mean you're gonna get it all done right?
[00:46:45.987 --> 00:46:47.807]  Does it mean you're gonna get it all done that day?
[00:46:47.807 --> 00:46:48.327]  No.
[00:46:48.327 --> 00:46:54.648]  But you just start getting aggressive and taking action.
[00:46:54.648 --> 00:46:56.589]  That's what you do.
[00:46:56.589 --> 00:47:04.010]  And you get your states, which are on the verge of revolting under the Constitution.
[00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.890]  It's already happening.
[00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.650]  You get them to say no to the feds.
[00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:07.891]  You discredit the government.
[00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.131]  You discredit both parties.
[00:47:09.131 --> 00:47:10.331]  You expose... I mean,
[00:47:12.202 --> 00:47:15.384]  At CPAC every year they have Newt Gingrich speak.
[00:47:15.384 --> 00:47:17.025]  Newt Gingrich is for gun control.
[00:47:17.025 --> 00:47:20.326]  Newt Gingrich is for man-made global warming, carbon taxes.
[00:47:20.326 --> 00:47:25.289]  Newt Gingrich openly calls for world government in multiple books he's written.
[00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:31.712]  I mean, why do you support the Republican Party and CPAC when they have people like him speaking at them?
[00:47:31.712 --> 00:47:37.155]  Why does Rush Limbaugh say how great Newt Gingrich is?
[00:47:37.155 --> 00:47:37.896]  We're going to go to Brighton.
[00:47:38.834 --> 00:47:45.239]  I'm going to come back and get into Haiti and then some other news and I'm going to go to your calls the full next hour and then the horrible attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:46.620]  Big new developments there.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.143]  They just went ahead and said, look, we're just banning the gun show, period.
[00:47:49.143 --> 00:47:50.243]  No law, no regulation.
[00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:52.605]  They just banned it after the show yesterday.
[00:47:52.605 --> 00:47:53.706]  They just said, you know what?
[00:47:53.706 --> 00:47:55.748]  You're not going to rally the people and stop us, Alex.
[00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:56.709]  We're just banning it.
[00:47:56.709 --> 00:47:57.890]  No more gun shows in Austin.
[00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.051]  If you don't like it, we'll SWAT team you.
[00:47:59.898 --> 00:48:06.523]  And I'm sure Arte Saaveda, you know, the slick person that he is, he'll come on the show, he'll act all friendly.
[00:48:06.523 --> 00:48:07.644]  That's why he's so dangerous.
[00:48:07.644 --> 00:48:08.784]  More and more, I realize.
[00:48:08.784 --> 00:48:12.547]  I'm going to talk to Arte Saaveda and find out if he knows what his detectives are doing.
[00:48:12.547 --> 00:48:15.670]  I've got to wait until I fully pass judgment on him.
[00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:20.033]  And we'll see if he'll come in and do an interview, but he's done it three times, but I mean, I've had enough.
[00:48:25.994 --> 00:48:28.436]  I want people to get the new film Shadow Government we're carrying.
[00:48:28.436 --> 00:48:29.477]  I'm really impressed with it.
[00:48:29.477 --> 00:48:35.222]  Here is the trailer for Shadow Government.
[00:48:35.222 --> 00:48:37.143]  You are being watched.
[00:48:37.143 --> 00:48:40.126]  We live in a surveillance society.
[00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:42.708]  Why do I have to come down?
[00:48:42.708 --> 00:48:46.511]  Monitor every human being on the planet.
[00:48:46.511 --> 00:48:50.074]  I don't know how they knew all about us.
[00:48:50.074 --> 00:48:53.417]  A big government will take more and more of their rights away from us.
[00:48:55.254 --> 00:48:56.495]  Are you aware?
[00:48:56.495 --> 00:48:58.937]  Yes or no?
[00:48:58.937 --> 00:49:04.280]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.042]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:49:07.042 --> 00:49:11.765]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:49:11.765 --> 00:49:14.167]  We are warned of such a global system.
[00:49:14.167 --> 00:49:19.010]  The great experiment that was once America has been prostituted by special interests.
[00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.793]  All they're thinking about is, oh, government, do something, protect me, save us from all of this.
[00:49:25.669 --> 00:49:27.199]  We are living in the last days.
[00:49:30.031 --> 00:49:34.512]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:51:01.115 --> 00:51:05.416]  We are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy.
[00:51:05.416 --> 00:51:07.217]  The JFK assassinations.
[00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:08.611]  This is Houston.
[00:51:08.611 --> 00:51:10.252]  Say again, please.
[00:51:10.252 --> 00:51:11.933]  Houston, we've had a problem.
[00:51:11.933 --> 00:51:14.015]  Landing on the moon.
[00:51:14.015 --> 00:51:21.201]  The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief.
[00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:23.182]  9-11.
[00:51:23.182 --> 00:51:25.804]  I know that many of my supporters are disappointed.

[00:51:52.358 --> 00:51:53.059]  Exposing tyranny since 1991.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.987]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.987 --> 00:52:09.233]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.233 --> 00:52:10.636]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.022]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.022 --> 00:52:20.408]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.408 --> 00:52:25.952]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.952 --> 00:52:35.600]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.041]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.041 --> 00:52:39.622]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.622 --> 00:52:42.104]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.104 --> 00:52:44.225]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.225 --> 00:52:49.367]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:53:02.128 --> 00:53:05.010]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.551]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:53:08.551 --> 00:53:14.074]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen, and prepare just in case it does.
[00:53:14.074 --> 00:53:16.735]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:19.937]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:53:19.937 --> 00:53:23.239]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[00:53:23.239 --> 00:53:25.880]  Because it might take years to recover.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:31.563]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:53:32.424 --> 00:53:39.750]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.

[00:53:47.856 --> 00:53:52.339]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[00:53:52.339 --> 00:53:58.164]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:54:04.446 --> 00:54:05.807]  We're good to go.
[00:54:24.568 --> 00:54:34.796]  By the way, the gun show owner is getting calls from HEB, from everybody else saying, why'd you throw us under the bus?
[00:54:34.796 --> 00:54:39.019]  Hey, it's the feds that came in and told you to make him post that notice.
[00:54:39.019 --> 00:54:39.759]  It's the feds.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.102]  That then have now had the gun show completely shut down.
[00:54:43.102 --> 00:54:44.243]  What do you expect them to do?
[00:54:44.243 --> 00:54:45.104]  Just take it?
[00:54:45.104 --> 00:54:47.586]  We haven't thrown HEB under the bus.
[00:54:47.586 --> 00:54:59.017]  I threw HEB under the bus ten years ago when they put biometric thumb scanners in to make you thumb scan to buy and sell and HEB backed off of it in many areas.
[00:54:59.017 --> 00:55:00.458]  I shop at HEB a lot.
[00:55:00.458 --> 00:55:02.660]  Where am I supposed to buy my food?
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:06.864]  You think for five, six years when I boycotted I liked having to go to other grocery stores?
[00:55:08.268 --> 00:55:10.129]  When there's more H-E-Bs in the other stores?
[00:55:10.129 --> 00:55:14.692]  And then I ended my boycott when you backed off on a lot of the thumb scanners?
[00:55:14.692 --> 00:55:17.634]  Look, we'll buy your stinking food, H-E-B!
[00:55:17.634 --> 00:55:21.716]  But yeah, people are forming a boycott of you for giving into the feds!
[00:55:21.716 --> 00:55:24.578]  I didn't call for that boycott, but maybe we need to!
[00:55:24.578 --> 00:55:25.659]  You're so delusional!
[00:55:25.659 --> 00:55:30.862]  Again, the biggest chain in Texas.
[00:55:30.862 --> 00:55:32.463]  Howard Butts, the owner.
[00:55:32.463 --> 00:55:34.024]  Rusty Butts is his nickname.
[00:55:34.024 --> 00:55:36.465]  My grandmother went to school with him.
[00:55:36.465 --> 00:55:37.246]  Was friends with him.
[00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:42.011]  At Baylor.
[00:55:42.011 --> 00:55:43.253]  Rusty Butts.
[00:55:43.253 --> 00:55:46.476]  Listen, Rusty Butts.
[00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.598]  You... That's really his nickname.
[00:55:48.598 --> 00:55:51.520]  You need to... Well, you know what?
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.103]  We'll just start contacting Mr. Butts ourself.
[00:55:54.103 --> 00:55:55.544]  How about that?
[00:55:55.544 --> 00:55:57.906]  How about we start giving the phone number out to HEB?
[00:55:57.906 --> 00:56:00.789]  You're accusing us of starting some boycott of you?
[00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:01.670]  Thanks for the idea!
[00:56:04.244 --> 00:56:06.365]  That's our listeners that are just angry at you.
[00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:08.946]  No, we're angry at the BATF and the police.
[00:56:08.946 --> 00:56:13.948]  They're the ones that did this.
[00:56:13.948 --> 00:56:15.009]  Okay, that's coming up.
[00:56:15.009 --> 00:56:18.330]  That's coming up in the third hour today.
[00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:19.751]  I'm gonna go to your calls in the next hour.
[00:56:21.883 --> 00:56:28.510]  On the Haiti situation, plan to bring Haitians to Central Florida, not set in stone.
[00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.731]  WFTV.
[00:56:29.731 --> 00:56:30.813]  That's because there's opposition.
[00:56:30.813 --> 00:56:34.476]  They'll tell you it's not set in stone, so you'll stand down so they can ship them all in.
[00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:40.035]  Who knows how many of the 10 million Haitians they'll ship in, instead of just helping them in their country.
[00:56:40.035 --> 00:56:47.901]  The American Red Cross says a plan to bring 45,000 evacuees from Haiti to Florida and 4,000 of those to Orange County is not set in stone.
[00:56:47.901 --> 00:56:55.007]  The Red Cross clarified Friday who could be involved in the plan to move people out of Haiti.
[00:56:55.007 --> 00:57:01.652]  The Red Cross is preparing for two things, the repatriation of Americans living in Haiti and the possibility of a mass migration of Haitian nationals.
[00:57:04.269 --> 00:57:07.192]  American Red Cross has seen massive migration in the U.S.
[00:57:07.192 --> 00:57:10.455]  from areas like Kosovo, Bosnia, and the past.
[00:57:10.455 --> 00:57:18.543]  So we're setting the precedent that every time there's a tsunami, or an earthquake, or a fire, of the six plus billion people living outside the U.S.
[00:57:18.543 --> 00:57:18.904]  What is it?
[00:57:18.904 --> 00:57:21.306]  Six billion?
[00:57:21.306 --> 00:57:22.107]  Five hundred million?
[00:57:22.107 --> 00:57:24.850]  Because there's close to seven billion people in the world now.
[00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:25.230]  What is there?
[00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.811]  Six billion?
[00:57:27.879 --> 00:57:30.181]  900 million, conservatively.
[00:57:30.181 --> 00:57:32.102]  And 300 million are in the U.S.
[00:57:32.102 --> 00:57:34.823]  So I guess, you know, over 6 billion get to come here?
[00:57:34.823 --> 00:57:38.966]  And then we can have a big government welfare system and give them all money and goodies?
[00:57:38.966 --> 00:57:50.172]  You go to big cities and it seems like all they hire on the police force is foreigners that can't speak English, and they walk over and say, I told you, no videotaping on streets of New York!
[00:57:50.172 --> 00:57:52.913]  Turn camera off!
[00:57:52.913 --> 00:57:53.894]  I arrest you!
[00:57:53.894 --> 00:57:54.094]  Hey!
[00:57:55.899 --> 00:57:59.560]  We have that video in Truth Rising.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.101]  Cops who can't even hardly speak English.
[00:58:02.101 --> 00:58:04.222]  This not America.
[00:58:04.222 --> 00:58:05.442]  This Eastern Europe.
[00:58:05.442 --> 00:58:07.002]  This Mexico.
[00:58:07.002 --> 00:58:08.743]  You turn camera off.
[00:58:08.743 --> 00:58:10.303]  You my slave now.
[00:58:10.303 --> 00:58:11.304]  I have gun.
[00:58:11.304 --> 00:58:12.664]  We take your gun.
[00:58:12.664 --> 00:58:13.724]  We make you slave.
[00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:20.483]  You'd like to be my slave, huh?
[00:58:20.483 --> 00:58:23.286]  I come from country where government rule.
[00:58:23.286 --> 00:58:25.968]  Now you serve me as my property.
[00:58:25.968 --> 00:58:30.052]  I mean, literally.
[00:58:30.052 --> 00:58:32.955]  You American pigs are owned by us now.
[00:58:32.955 --> 00:58:36.157]  There's nothing you can do to stop us.
[00:58:36.157 --> 00:58:38.259]  We're going to take everything you got.
[00:58:38.259 --> 00:58:42.383]  We have the weapons!

[01:00:05.327 --> 01:00:06.628]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.628 --> 01:00:08.388]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.388 --> 01:00:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.730]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:12.650]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:21.514]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:35.083]  More on Haiti, more on the economy, more on the bellwether election coming up in Massachusetts, with Kennedy's seat all coming up.
[01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:38.247]  But right now, let's start going to your phone calls.
[01:00:38.247 --> 01:00:42.612]  Rico, Rico in Toronto, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:00:43.476 --> 01:00:44.979]  Hi Alex.
[01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:48.907]  I just wanted to tell you, I'm of Asian descent.
[01:00:48.907 --> 01:00:50.731]  Both my parents are Asian.
[01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:54.920]  I was born in Montreal and then I moved to Toronto a few years after that.
[01:00:57.412 --> 01:00:59.815]  I want to say I'm very proud to be Haitian.
[01:00:59.815 --> 01:01:00.576]  I love Haiti.
[01:01:00.576 --> 01:01:01.957]  It's a beautiful place.
[01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:05.501]  When I was from three to five, I was there also.
[01:01:05.501 --> 01:01:13.749]  And I also understand that it's a very complicated question, the Haitian question, because I was the first one to get it.
[01:01:13.749 --> 01:01:15.772]  It's independence by force.
[01:01:17.413 --> 01:01:39.197]  Yeah, it was the Haitians beating the French that made Napoleon sell 13 states in the Louisiana Purchase, and Haiti led the charge in Latin America and the Caribbean to throw out the Spanish, the French, and the Empire, and so Haiti has always been basically embargoed and maneuvered into the position it's in.
[01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:40.724]  That's right.
[01:01:40.724 --> 01:01:41.365]  That's right.
[01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:54.881]  And CIA was involved and on and on and on with all the puppet... And that's why they don't want... That's why they don't want real charities to be able to give money to the people of Haiti.
[01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:56.543]  That's why they're demonizing people.
[01:01:57.421 --> 01:01:58.242]  That's right.
[01:01:58.242 --> 01:02:13.864]  My main question to you, when it came to the actual earthquake, because the first thing that came into my mind when it happened, and everything was so coordinated, I said, this is a hard weapon
[01:02:14.805 --> 01:02:18.688]  Um, uh, operation, uh, tectonic weapon operation.
[01:02:18.688 --> 01:02:20.789]  That's the first thing that came into my mind.
[01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:33.858]  Well, the, the, the, the White House, um, the Secretary of Defense, uh, in 1997, uh, said that they have these weapons, so.
[01:02:33.858 --> 01:02:36.280]  What do you think?
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.122]  You know, I, I rarely speculate and I don't know.
[01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.312]  We know Bill Clinton was made the envoy, what, a year ago.
[01:02:44.312 --> 01:02:46.273]  We know there was already pre-positioning going on.
[01:02:46.273 --> 01:02:51.595]  We know that in the first big flood in New Orleans in the 20s, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:02:51.595 --> 01:02:53.415]  I have a Pulitzer Prize winning book on it.
[01:02:53.415 --> 01:02:56.516]  They blew up the levees to flood the poor areas.
[01:02:56.516 --> 01:02:57.237]  That's a fact.
[01:02:57.237 --> 01:03:06.280]  That's why people, when it happened years later, with Katrina, and there were reports of explosions, thought they blew up the levees.
[01:03:07.102 --> 01:03:08.723]  Because it was done before.
[01:03:08.723 --> 01:03:12.406]  We know they can control hurricanes.
[01:03:12.406 --> 01:03:15.228]  And again, Secretary of Defense Cohen said that as well.
[01:03:15.228 --> 01:03:17.269]  We know they have these systems.
[01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:29.498]  And so, again, I can't come out and say that they did it because you do have natural earthquakes in that area, though you don't have a lot of earthquakes in that area of the Caribbean.
[01:03:29.498 --> 01:03:32.380]  The whole thing is very, very suspicious, but I don't know.
[01:03:33.997 --> 01:03:38.841]  That's what I was thinking when the first thing that happened.
[01:03:38.841 --> 01:03:41.023]  I just said to me, it just seems too coordinated.
[01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:44.246]  It was like theater.
[01:03:44.246 --> 01:03:48.789]  Clinton coming out and she's saying, oh my God, I'm cancelling my trip.
[01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:51.612]  I just, I was like, I don't believe this.
[01:03:51.612 --> 01:03:53.013]  Well, I don't believe it either.
[01:03:53.013 --> 01:03:55.195]  So 10 million people in Haiti.
[01:03:55.195 --> 01:03:56.596]  Have you talked to any family there?
[01:03:56.596 --> 01:03:57.817]  I mean, how hellish is it really?
[01:03:58.973 --> 01:04:01.618]  Well, okay, this is how serious it is.
[01:04:01.618 --> 01:04:04.584]  Um, my mom, okay, I have a friend who's a dentist.
[01:04:04.584 --> 01:04:06.848]  He went down to do a week of charity work.
[01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:12.455]  The two hours before the earthquake hit, she left.
[01:04:12.455 --> 01:04:20.823]  Now, my mom was still there because she used to help him also with that, but she is down there also to open up a school to do charity work also herself because she's an artist.
[01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:21.844]  She's a singer.
[01:04:21.844 --> 01:04:25.126]  So she was there for three days.
[01:04:25.126 --> 01:04:27.849]  We were just going nuts because we didn't hear from her.
[01:04:27.849 --> 01:04:28.870]  The communication was cut.
[01:04:29.651 --> 01:04:33.032]  You know, we were crying, we just don't know what's going on.
[01:04:33.032 --> 01:04:35.192]  Finally, we got a hold of her.
[01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:39.133]  They're flying her back in today.
[01:04:39.133 --> 01:04:40.833]  Well, stay there, stay there Rico.
[01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:49.474]  I want to come back to you and through your mother get reports of what she said is going on and you've got skin in the game and so to get your view on that.
[01:04:49.474 --> 01:04:52.555]  Also researching the amazing racism in the Caribbean.
[01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:58.336]  You think there's racism in the United States or Canada against Haitians by the Dominican Republic?
[01:04:58.456 --> 01:04:59.548]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:04:59.548 --> 01:04:59.993]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.509 --> 01:05:05.072]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:05.972]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.972 --> 01:05:09.394]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.394 --> 01:05:10.254]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:15.157]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.157 --> 01:05:15.898]  It's true.
[01:05:15.898 --> 01:05:20.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.601]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.601 --> 01:05:25.183]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.183 --> 01:05:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.085 --> 01:05:29.886]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.886 --> 01:05:32.648]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.648 --> 01:05:36.330]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:37.111]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.111 --> 01:05:41.254]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.254 --> 01:05:46.017]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:50.479]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.918]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:09.263]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.263 --> 01:06:11.324]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.324 --> 01:06:16.328]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.328 --> 01:06:17.229]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.489 --> 01:06:18.610]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.491]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:21.572]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.572 --> 01:06:23.773]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:25.114]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.635]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.635 --> 01:06:31.919]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:35.501]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:38.964]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:40.525]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.525 --> 01:06:41.445]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:42.546]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.546 --> 01:06:43.466]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:44.567]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:47.608]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:47.608 --> 01:06:49.389]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.389 --> 01:06:50.310]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:59.835 --> 01:07:03.957]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:07:03.957 --> 01:07:06.819]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:06.819 --> 01:07:08.920]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.141]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:12.802]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:07:12.802 --> 01:07:17.124]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:07:17.264 --> 01:07:19.845]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:33.473]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:07:33.473 --> 01:07:36.194]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:36.194 --> 01:07:43.358]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:07:49.622 --> 01:07:52.443]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:52.443 --> 01:08:02.109]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:07.693]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.477 --> 01:08:11.580]  The Earth was born in fire.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:15.124]  There are three different extinct volcanoes in Austin.
[01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:20.731]  One just a few miles from me, Pilot Knob, over at McKinney-Ruff's City Park.
[01:08:20.731 --> 01:08:21.772]  I've camped out there.
[01:08:21.772 --> 01:08:22.773]  Amazingly beautiful.
[01:08:22.773 --> 01:08:28.120]  You tell the average Austinite we live on a huge fault line and volcanic range.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:28.861]  They don't believe it.
[01:08:30.695 --> 01:08:37.521]  Remember Danny Glover's ridiculous statement that global warming is what caused what happened in Haiti.
[01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:43.045]  The atmosphere has nothing to do with tectonic volcanic activity.
[01:08:43.045 --> 01:08:45.728]  Greg, Al, Virgil, Step, we're going to all your calls.
[01:08:45.728 --> 01:08:47.989]  Finishing up with Rico in Toronto.
[01:08:47.989 --> 01:08:51.793]  He's a Canadian of Haitian descent.
[01:08:51.793 --> 01:08:53.714]  His mother was down there doing charity work.
[01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:55.296]  Haitians really try to give back.
[01:08:56.276 --> 01:09:01.981]  Uh, statistically, and go back to their original home country to help the people there.
[01:09:01.981 --> 01:09:04.043]  And his mother is still there.
[01:09:04.043 --> 01:09:05.985]  Rico, finish up with what she told you she saw.
[01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:11.752]  Uh, she said that Port-au-Prince is just basically just dead bodies.
[01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:13.473]  Just, that's all it was.
[01:09:13.473 --> 01:09:18.796]  She was staying away from there because it's just, you know, they also have nothing to live on, right?
[01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:20.057]  Because it's a city.
[01:09:20.057 --> 01:09:21.578]  So everything in the city needs to come in.
[01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:26.540]  It's not like the country where you can, you know, pick a mango or, you know, fish or something like that.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:33.704]  Like, it's just, just dead bodies and just like, um, pain and just people dead.
[01:09:33.704 --> 01:09:34.545]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:35.065]  Just, um,
[01:09:36.045 --> 01:09:37.926]  A trail of them.
[01:09:37.926 --> 01:09:44.529]  When she called us, she was saying that she was actually staying away from there.
[01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:48.170]  Thank God we're lucky, she's coming back today.
[01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:52.332]  So they flew her out because she does have her citizenship and all that stuff.
[01:09:52.332 --> 01:09:56.133]  So she was in a smaller town or city?
[01:09:56.133 --> 01:10:00.655]  When it hit, she said she was in Port-au-Prince.
[01:10:04.031 --> 01:10:09.213]  She was going to go to the bathroom and she said everything started shaking.
[01:10:09.213 --> 01:10:15.155]  And lucky for her, the door to the bathroom was very close to the door to go outside.
[01:10:15.155 --> 01:10:21.237]  So she just ran outside and she said that's when everything started falling and stuff like that.
[01:10:21.237 --> 01:10:23.078]  But she was really lucky.
[01:10:23.078 --> 01:10:25.619]  And she just said after that, it was just like, it's bad.
[01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:31.401]  And what I'm seeing is that they're making it worse, you know, by not, same thing as Katrina, like the same pattern.
[01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:33.030]  The same pattern.
[01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.771]  That's right.
[01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.111]  The military's gone in.
[01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:36.512]  The French government's saying the U.S.
[01:10:36.512 --> 01:10:43.896]  military's locking it down and not letting aid in because they've got to control freak it and, quote, have a security perimeter.
[01:10:43.896 --> 01:10:46.677]  And so it's clearly making it a lot worse.
[01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:49.438]  That's what government always does.
[01:10:49.438 --> 01:10:52.920]  Yeah, that I know, you know, by just looking at history.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.040]  Yep.
[01:10:55.734 --> 01:10:57.615]  But, uh, we're lucky.
[01:10:57.615 --> 01:10:59.436]  We're one of the lucky ones.
[01:10:59.436 --> 01:11:05.819]  You know, her story is so, whatever, fantastic, or one of the fantastic stories.
[01:11:05.819 --> 01:11:09.021]  The news media is meeting us at the airport today when we go pick her up.
[01:11:09.021 --> 01:11:12.203]  She's coming in at 3.30 Eastern Standard Time.
[01:11:12.203 --> 01:11:18.106]  So, we'll go pick her up at Pearson, and they're going to be coming to cover her also.
[01:11:18.106 --> 01:11:23.789]  Well, Rico, before you leave, Google Secretary of Defense William Cohen.
[01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:40.815]  Uh, earthquake and weather weapons, and you'll get Army Times, April 27th or 28th, I think it's 28th, 1997, and you can hold it up to the news camera and say, Secretary of Defense Cohen said they have earthquake weapons.
[01:11:40.815 --> 01:11:42.176]  This needs to be investigated.
[01:11:42.176 --> 01:11:45.317]  And if they say you're a kook, say, hey, Army Times.
[01:11:45.317 --> 01:11:47.098]  I mean, we're only asking the question.
[01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:49.960]  But there are natural earthquakes, there are natural tsunamis.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:12:06.852]  I mean, for Americans, many geologists we've had on say there's a real danger of the mega caldera, the mega super volcano that covers part of four states, centering in and around Yellowstone, could explode in the next few decades.
[01:12:06.852 --> 01:12:08.373]  And if that sucker goes off,
[01:12:09.173 --> 01:12:15.334]  I mean, again, they're talking about man destroying the Earth, carbon dioxide hurting the planet.
[01:12:15.334 --> 01:12:25.916]  This is a planet with floating continents on top of lava, thousands and thousands and thousands of degrees, floating around on lava.
[01:12:25.916 --> 01:12:28.937]  Huge asteroids, comets hit us.
[01:12:28.937 --> 01:12:33.538]  We're beamed and energized by high-powered radiation from a huge sun.
[01:12:34.218 --> 01:12:43.228]  I mean it's just, in fact he just pulled up the article, Cohen addresses 428 at Conference on Terrorism.
[01:12:43.228 --> 01:12:47.973]  And so again, let me see, January, February, March, April, yeah, 428, I was right in my memory.
[01:12:47.973 --> 01:12:50.756]  Terrorisms, weapons of mass destruction, and the U.S.
[01:12:50.756 --> 01:12:51.256]  strategy.
[01:12:52.764 --> 01:12:59.330]  At the Nunn Policy Forum, April 28, 1997, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia.
[01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.633]  You actually found the transcript itself.
[01:13:01.633 --> 01:13:02.533]  Go ahead and print that for me.
[01:13:02.533 --> 01:13:08.419]  But Army Times also reported his quotes about the earthquake and weather weapons.
[01:13:08.419 --> 01:13:09.340]  But there it is!
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.401]  I'm only reporting what's real.
[01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:13.063]  And by 1967, the U.S.
[01:13:13.063 --> 01:13:14.504]  government had certified that they had
[01:13:15.822 --> 01:13:19.446]  Well, Rico, do you have any ideas of good charities that we can give to?
[01:13:19.446 --> 01:13:23.930]  I mean, clearly they're demonizing Wyclef Jean's charity because he gave $411,000 more of his own money than what even came in.
[01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:25.171]  They say that's bad.
[01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:48.373]  That's a very good question, and since I'm actually getting the chance to speak to such a large audience, let me ask my sister, because she's involved with that end.
[01:13:48.373 --> 01:13:58.576]  Mayor Paul, what do you... Sorry, sorry, what charities would be good, because Alex Jones is asking me to give?
[01:13:58.576 --> 01:14:00.096]  Red Cross of Alabama.
[01:14:00.096 --> 01:14:01.896]  Okay, there's no other ones?
[01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:06.337]  Red Cross that I have there for the Navy.
[01:14:06.337 --> 01:14:06.477]  Okay.
[01:14:09.332 --> 01:14:10.433]  Okay.
[01:14:10.433 --> 01:14:18.857]  The problem is the Red Cross usually steals half the money, but I guess she's saying they're the big force on the ground, so even if they steal half of it, is she saying give it to them?
[01:14:18.857 --> 01:14:20.698]  Because I guess at least something will get there.
[01:14:20.698 --> 01:14:22.840]  That's what she's saying.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.320]  She's saying they're the only ones right now.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.102]  They're the ones who are bringing my mom back.
[01:14:27.102 --> 01:14:30.044]  But see, that's why the Pentagon is only letting them in.
[01:14:30.044 --> 01:14:31.404]  Do you see that?
[01:14:31.404 --> 01:14:32.625]  Yes.
[01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:35.767]  That's because they approved the sanctions.
[01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:51.030]  Tell Alex Jones if you think CNN impacts your world and a list of all the big ones and all the small ones that are not associated.
[01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:57.986]  Uh, hold on, Rico.
[01:14:57.986 --> 01:15:01.229]  Tell me about, because I've forgotten about the sanctions on them.
[01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:04.173]  They still have sanctions on them even during this?
[01:15:18.005 --> 01:15:19.866]  Uh, that I know of, no.
[01:15:19.866 --> 01:15:24.790]  But, I mean, you just look at it like the government is ineffective.
[01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:26.391]  It's always been like that.
[01:15:26.391 --> 01:15:27.612]  Like, I'm Haitian.
[01:15:27.612 --> 01:15:31.835]  You know that when you go, it's just like, they just come there to make money.
[01:15:31.835 --> 01:15:34.216]  You get into politics in the 80s because you want to make money.
[01:15:34.216 --> 01:15:38.259]  You basically, you want to scam, you want to steal.
[01:15:38.922 --> 01:15:39.603]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:39.603 --> 01:15:43.305]  You want a big armored compound, you want bodyguards like you want.
[01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.807]  It's just there to make money.
[01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.169]  It's always been the same thing.
[01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:54.895]  It doesn't have the levers that it's good, like Canada or the United States, even though they do the same thing.
[01:15:54.895 --> 01:15:56.156]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:56.156 --> 01:15:58.437]  Governments always do this.
[01:15:58.437 --> 01:16:00.459]  What about Habitat for Humanity?
[01:16:00.459 --> 01:16:01.400]  They're pretty good.
[01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:03.230]  Yes, yes.
[01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:15.359]  I would say that they're better because, like, the Red Cross, I remember even seeing an interview, even when 9-11 happened, and they were saying that the woman that was VP there was making $250,000 a year.
[01:16:15.359 --> 01:16:16.840]  Well, it's not just that.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.062]  They kept like $2 billion of it and just gave it to themselves.
[01:16:20.062 --> 01:16:22.444]  Well, listen, Rico, keep calling in to give us updates.
[01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.525]  God bless you.
[01:16:23.525 --> 01:16:27.247]  And call us back tomorrow to give us an update once your mother's home today.
[01:16:27.247 --> 01:16:27.888]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[01:16:28.325 --> 01:16:28.946]  Thank you, Rico.
[01:16:28.946 --> 01:16:29.646]  Well, that's good news.
[01:16:29.646 --> 01:16:30.427]  His mom's getting back.
[01:16:30.427 --> 01:16:32.649]  Maybe we can have her on, Rico.
[01:16:32.649 --> 01:16:34.050]  Very interesting.
[01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:36.472]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Wisconsin.
[01:16:36.472 --> 01:16:38.654]  Greg, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:16:38.654 --> 01:16:39.074]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:39.074 --> 01:16:40.075]  How you doing?
[01:16:40.075 --> 01:16:42.157]  I'm doing alright.
[01:16:42.157 --> 01:16:46.901]  First off, I don't think the idea of controlled earthquakes is too far-fetched at all.
[01:16:46.901 --> 01:16:50.885]  I mean, every time they need a distraction, what happens?
[01:16:51.915 --> 01:16:53.436]  Look, they admit they have it.
[01:16:53.436 --> 01:16:55.738]  There needs to be an investigation of that.
[01:16:55.738 --> 01:16:59.260]  But I can't say that we know that's what happened.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.361]  Yeah, I can't say it either.
[01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:01.222]  I mean, it's ironic.
[01:17:01.222 --> 01:17:04.824]  The night before the earthquake, me and my fiancé were watching 2012.
[01:17:04.824 --> 01:17:08.267]  We wake up the next day and an earthquake hit.
[01:17:08.267 --> 01:17:09.928]  I'm like, damn.
[01:17:09.928 --> 01:17:15.272]  Yeah, what did you think of Jesse Ventura's last show in the season?
[01:17:15.272 --> 01:17:16.152]  What are you talking about?
[01:17:16.152 --> 01:17:18.934]  Oh, you're talking about 2012, the movie.
[01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:21.356]  I thought you were talking about the 2012 Jesse Ventura's TV show.
[01:17:22.412 --> 01:17:27.294]  Nope, I have not seen that, but I do like Jesse Manger and I listen to him when you have him on the air.
[01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:35.518]  I was just watching CNN, a 5.8 earthquake just hit the Cayman Islands about an hour and a half ago, two hours ago.
[01:17:37.211 --> 01:17:38.892]  Well, don't worry, Al Gore will save us.
[01:17:38.892 --> 01:17:43.275]  If we just pay him some tax money, he'll wave a magic wand.
[01:17:43.275 --> 01:17:47.558]  I mean, literally, every time there's any type of weather or an earthquake, they say it's global warming.
[01:17:47.558 --> 01:17:48.879]  It's not.
[01:17:48.879 --> 01:17:52.862]  I mean, next they're going to say if you slip and fall on a banana peel, just pay Al Gore a tax.
[01:17:52.862 --> 01:17:54.363]  That'll fix it.
[01:17:54.363 --> 01:17:55.544]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:55.544 --> 01:18:04.791]  But the reason I was calling, man, I was watching CNN Friday night, Larry King Live, and I caught a clip, and I mean, it's stage media all the way.
[01:18:05.365 --> 01:18:11.767]  Uh, this guy, he's getting interviewed and you can tell the whole time that he's talking, uh, he's being told what to say.
[01:18:11.767 --> 01:18:13.228]  He doesn't even know what he's saying.
[01:18:13.228 --> 01:18:15.609]  He was supposedly in the earthquake.
[01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:18.910]  And I mean, if I could play it over the air for you, I'd love for you guys to hear it.
[01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:21.131]  I, I, I need people to hear this.
[01:18:21.131 --> 01:18:23.651]  Put your phone right up, put your phone right up to the speaker.
[01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:25.072]  Go ahead and try it.
[01:18:25.072 --> 01:18:31.734]  Okay.
[01:18:31.734 --> 01:18:33.775]  People always want to do this, but then they don't play it quickly.
[01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:35.586]  Yeah, one sec, sorry.
[01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:37.387]  I was on the fifth floor.
[01:18:37.387 --> 01:18:39.969]  I was laying on the floor and the concrete was still on top of me.
[01:19:05.129 --> 01:19:06.810]  I, uh, going a little further.
[01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:10.130]  I pulled myself out.
[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:15.512]  I looked up and there was a little, uh, just a light at the top of my shell clawing and clawing.
[01:19:15.512 --> 01:19:20.413]  And after about 30 minutes, I got up on top.
[01:19:20.413 --> 01:19:24.194]  What were you doing in Haiti?
[01:19:24.194 --> 01:19:25.635]  Uh, was a business venture.
[01:19:25.635 --> 01:19:28.295]  I had, uh, three of my other friends.
[01:19:28.295 --> 01:19:34.297]  I had my, uh, uh, my brother-in-law.
[01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:36.911]  My son-in-law, excuse me, I'm sorry.
[01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:37.812]  A little bit, Eric.
[01:19:37.812 --> 01:19:39.234]  My son-in-law.
[01:19:39.234 --> 01:19:40.755]  Okay, yeah, I hear it.
[01:19:40.755 --> 01:19:43.397]  I mean, it sounds like the guy's nervous, but you saw the video.
[01:19:43.397 --> 01:19:47.641]  I mean, they always have some staged stuff with the media, but we can't prove this is staged.
[01:19:47.641 --> 01:19:49.083]  Greg, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:52.286]  Al, Virgil, Step, Nick, many others.

[01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:59.813]  Then we're going to get into the government banning gun shows in Austin, Texas.

[01:22:01.556 --> 01:22:02.577]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.577 --> 01:22:08.119]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.119 --> 01:22:08.659]  I get it.
[01:22:08.659 --> 01:22:18.284]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.284 --> 01:22:19.685]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:24.067]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:22:24.267 --> 01:22:26.108]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.148]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.148 --> 01:22:31.550]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:35.811]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.811 --> 01:22:37.411]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:41.373]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:45.194]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:46.094]  You should too.
[01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.255]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.255 --> 01:22:50.496]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:50.776 --> 01:22:51.136]  800-686-2237 800-686-2237 That's 800-686-2237
[01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:03.356]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:23:03.356 --> 01:23:05.257]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?

[01:23:16.985 --> 01:23:18.667]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:21.268]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:23:21.268 --> 01:23:21.729]  NoMoreMortgage.
[01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:25.030]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:27.531]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:23:27.531 --> 01:23:31.432]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.

[01:23:48.995 --> 01:23:49.315]  Call the number.

[01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:54.737]  800-578-6279.
[01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:33.016]  Living on the road, my friend, was gonna keep you free and clean.
[01:24:33.016 --> 01:24:40.662]  And now you wear your skin like iron, and your breath as hard as kerosene.
[01:24:40.662 --> 01:24:41.903]  What's your mama's only boy?
[01:24:41.903 --> 01:24:44.185]  Her favorite one, it seems.
[01:24:47.401 --> 01:24:49.022]  She cried.
[01:24:49.022 --> 01:24:55.926]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[01:24:55.926 --> 01:24:58.887]  He sank into your dream.
[01:24:58.887 --> 01:24:59.988]  Yeah, Poncho!
[01:24:59.988 --> 01:25:02.549]  Poncho was a bandit boy.
[01:25:02.549 --> 01:25:06.131]  His horse was fast as polished steel.
[01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:07.852]  He wore his gun outside his pants.
[01:25:15.801 --> 01:25:18.102]  At least we're living for liberty and freedom.
[01:25:18.102 --> 01:25:22.106]  At least we're doing the best we can to beat these people.
[01:25:22.106 --> 01:25:27.990]  In history, we'll be known as lovers of decency and honor and everything good.
[01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:29.932]  Everything virtuous.
[01:25:29.932 --> 01:25:33.995]  The enemy will be known as tyrants.
[01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:37.098]  And they will fall.
[01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:40.400]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.962]  Let's talk to Al in Ohio.
[01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:43.323]  Al, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:25:44.218 --> 01:25:53.384]  Hi Alex, I gave $600 to the Red Cross in July 2008 because of the floods in Iowa, and I guess $300 that went to anti-gun groups?
[01:25:57.116 --> 01:25:58.197]  Well, roughly, yes.
[01:25:58.197 --> 01:26:02.880]  They always say they're spending all the money on aid, and they keep more than half, generally.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.882]  And then, yes, that's mainstream news.
[01:26:04.882 --> 01:26:16.670]  Oklahoma City, 9-11, every other major event, they just pocket it, and then the government lets them do it because they then give it to non-governmental land grabbers, gun grabbers, absolutely.
[01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:23.535]  I had a Better Business Bureau donation guide, and they
[01:26:24.232 --> 01:26:28.094]  They gave Red Cross their highest rating.
[01:26:28.094 --> 01:26:30.495]  No, that's how the system... Sir, don't believe me.
[01:26:30.495 --> 01:26:34.016]  Just Google Red Cross caught stealing money, Oklahoma City.
[01:26:34.016 --> 01:26:36.157]  Red Cross in trouble for keeping the money.
[01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:39.958]  I mean, you didn't hear about that huge national scandal with United Way and Red Cross?
[01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:43.340]  What, they raised $6 billion and kept over $3 billion for themselves?
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.600]  I know about United Way.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.581]  They give to Planned Parenthood, so I never give to United Way.
[01:26:47.581 --> 01:26:48.642]  No, no, it's all the same.
[01:26:48.642 --> 01:26:51.023]  Red Cross... United Way's probably worse.
[01:26:52.219 --> 01:27:02.427]  Alright, so is there like a website or organization that I can contact that can, you know, give me better information than the better business spirit about these charities?
[01:27:02.427 --> 01:27:07.071]  You know, whether or not they give to these pro-abortion, anti-gun groups, etc.? ?
[01:27:07.793 --> 01:27:11.695]  Well, I'm looking at CNN's list and I see World Vision in there.
[01:27:11.695 --> 01:27:14.476]  That's an admitted CIA front.
[01:27:14.476 --> 01:27:16.077]  See, they love reporters.
[01:27:16.077 --> 01:27:22.559]  They love missionaries, aid groups, to take them over because they're a perfect cover.
[01:27:22.559 --> 01:27:24.420]  And World Vision's one of their biggest covers.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:32.223]  I mean, I wouldn't give to anybody... I mean, do they even link Salvation Army of these hundred or so things on CNN?
[01:27:32.223 --> 01:27:34.705]  Guys, do a CTRL-F and see if Salvation Army.
[01:27:34.705 --> 01:27:35.385]  Look under S.
[01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:39.496]  Is Salvation Army even on there?
[01:27:39.496 --> 01:27:43.156]  Okay, Salvation Army's on there, so we know CNN's got one good group.
[01:27:43.156 --> 01:27:51.858]  And that doesn't mean Salvation Army's perfect, but I mean, I've researched it myself, and that's one of the better big ones, and they are in Haiti.
[01:27:51.858 --> 01:28:00.060]  So I would give to Salvation Army, because it's more of a libertarian-slash-conservative group that I know they don't give money to the gun grabbers or land grabbers.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:11.224]  And I know that they have one of the highest ratios of, what, 90% or more of the money you give to them goes directly to aid, directly to helping people.
[01:28:11.224 --> 01:28:14.966]  So what about if I want to check into another charity, how would I do that?
[01:28:14.966 --> 01:28:21.749]  To, you know, get all the information about, you know, another charity besides Salvation Army.
[01:28:23.829 --> 01:28:29.891]  Any group you think about giving to, go do cross-web searches, startpage.com searches, whatever, Google.
[01:28:29.891 --> 01:28:34.132]  Do cross-searches for groups they're supporting and working with.
[01:28:34.132 --> 01:28:37.754]  And I've got to tell you, most of them are... That's how the globalists take over.
[01:28:37.754 --> 01:28:41.775]  They get us, who mean well, to give money, and then they use it against us.
[01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:47.257]  But, I mean, again, I'm no super mega expert on charities.
[01:28:47.257 --> 01:28:55.028]  I just know Red Cross, United Way, have been caught, in every case, swindling.
[01:28:55.028 --> 01:28:56.249]  And that's just a fact.
[01:28:57.284 --> 01:28:59.885]  People weren't as aware of this back in 2001.
[01:28:59.885 --> 01:29:02.826]  I went on air and said, don't give money to them, they're gonna steal most of it.
[01:29:02.826 --> 01:29:07.508]  And then people got really mad, but then a month later I got all these apologies going, how did you know that?
[01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:23.215]  Well, I mean, sir, in Oklahoma City, the government made the Red Cross, the head group that was able to take all the mail coming into the Postal Service, and they would take large checks given to people by name that they saw on television, and they would endorse it over to themselves.
[01:29:24.127 --> 01:29:25.708]  That's daily Oklahoman.
[01:29:25.708 --> 01:29:30.192]  I mean, you talk about hardcore evil.
[01:29:30.192 --> 01:29:35.636]  That doesn't mean the average volunteer for Red Cross is bad, and Red Cross does do some good.
[01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:39.839]  The average person out there giving people Gatorade and blankets, they're good people.
[01:29:39.839 --> 01:29:46.685]  It's just that when you give them money, they give it to Handgun Control Incorporated and the Violence Policy Center and they come after your guns.
[01:29:51.371 --> 01:29:55.300]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:58.006]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.523 --> 01:30:05.086]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.086 --> 01:30:05.987]  Number one.
[01:30:05.987 --> 01:30:09.410]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:10.270]  Number two.
[01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:15.174]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.174 --> 01:30:15.915]  It's true.
[01:30:15.915 --> 01:30:20.778]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.778 --> 01:30:21.319]  Number three.
[01:30:21.599 --> 01:30:25.181]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.181 --> 01:30:29.904]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.904 --> 01:30:32.666]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.666 --> 01:30:37.128]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:37.128 --> 01:30:41.271]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:46.034]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.314 --> 01:30:50.498]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.498 --> 01:30:52.280]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.542]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.542 --> 01:30:56.885]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:02.213 --> 01:31:06.194]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:15.057]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.057 --> 01:31:19.678]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.678 --> 01:31:30.501]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.121 --> 01:31:40.650]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:46.075]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.075 --> 01:31:53.581]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.581 --> 01:31:56.324]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:01.388 --> 01:32:05.411]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.411 --> 01:32:08.653]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.653 --> 01:32:13.457]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.457 --> 01:32:19.861]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.861 --> 01:32:22.103]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.623 --> 01:32:22.923]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:22.923 --> 01:32:23.444]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.444 --> 01:32:24.064]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.064 --> 01:32:24.765]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:24.765 --> 01:32:26.887]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.519 --> 01:32:48.801]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.801 --> 01:32:57.904]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:03.786 --> 01:33:06.148]  I'm going to try to accelerate through your calls now.
[01:33:06.148 --> 01:33:08.709]  Virgil, Step, Nick, Brian, many others.
[01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:15.374]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:15.374 --> 01:33:17.175]  Virgil in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:19.097]  Hey Alex.
[01:33:19.097 --> 01:33:20.618]  Welcome.
[01:33:20.618 --> 01:33:28.543]  I wanted to ask you about something you mentioned about the NRA yesterday, about them being like some sort of CIA front.
[01:33:28.543 --> 01:33:30.705]  You mentioned something about Charleston Heston and
[01:33:32.119 --> 01:33:34.383]  The NRA being, yeah.
[01:33:34.383 --> 01:33:35.585]  I'm pretty sure he said something like that.
[01:33:45.233 --> 01:33:49.075]  Pushing for the passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[01:33:49.075 --> 01:33:52.776]  In fact, I'll just get Larry Pratt to tell you about it, the head of Gun Owners of America.
[01:33:52.776 --> 01:33:54.357]  I've interviewed Heston.
[01:33:54.357 --> 01:33:55.978]  He later apologized about it.
[01:33:55.978 --> 01:33:57.978]  There were riots all over the country.
[01:33:57.978 --> 01:34:02.640]  The NRA was set up by the federal government because the Northerners couldn't shoot as good as the Southerners.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.442]  It was set up to get people ready to shoot better for war.
[01:34:06.442 --> 01:34:09.463]  It's always been like that.
[01:34:09.463 --> 01:34:12.745]  The NRA called me an extremist when I was trying to beat
[01:34:13.638 --> 01:34:18.505]  The bill they had in 2000 in Texas in the Dallas Morning News, they called me an extremist.
[01:34:18.505 --> 01:34:24.694]  They said, oh, we don't have an opinion on this gun show loophole bill and a bill to ban junior shooting sports.
[01:34:24.694 --> 01:34:29.481]  And that's when I found out and all these pro-gun experts said, you didn't know they're a shill organization?
[01:34:30.836 --> 01:34:36.719]  I mean, look, they got, what is it, 10 million members or something, and they can't ever seem to stop anything or turn anything back?
[01:34:36.719 --> 01:34:39.561]  And they argued in the federal case in D.C.
[01:34:39.561 --> 01:34:44.604]  that, oh, we agree with some gun control, just not that you can totally be banned.
[01:34:44.604 --> 01:34:51.207]  And so they kind of play the middle of the road, which then makes us go ahead and capitulate.
[01:34:51.207 --> 01:34:53.608]  And you've got great NRA members.
[01:34:53.608 --> 01:34:56.190]  A lot of their own board members have gone public and criticized them.
[01:34:57.498 --> 01:34:59.279]  I'll bring that up to Larry Pratt when he's on with us.
[01:34:59.279 --> 01:35:04.261]  We've done a whole show with him where he reads the quotes from them and the things they've done.
[01:35:04.261 --> 01:35:13.366]  Yes, the NRA, as much as they wave muskets around in the air, is a mega-compromise organization.
[01:35:13.366 --> 01:35:16.007]  Isn't it a lobbyist group, basically?
[01:35:16.007 --> 01:35:16.687]  Yes.
[01:35:16.687 --> 01:35:18.588]  So we should stop giving our money to them.
[01:35:18.588 --> 01:35:23.591]  I mean, hell, it's set there in the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
[01:35:23.591 --> 01:35:25.892]  So, I mean, you know, why do we have to have
[01:35:26.818 --> 01:35:30.399]  Somebody bribing our politicians to keep our gun rights.
[01:35:30.399 --> 01:35:31.520]  That's all I wanted to say.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:31.900]  Take it easy.
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:32.980]  Virgil, I appreciate it.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:41.384]  Well, you do need Gun Owners of America and the NRA and your local state organizations like Texas Rifle Association.
[01:35:41.384 --> 01:35:43.845]  If we didn't have them, it'd be over.
[01:35:43.845 --> 01:35:54.409]  The problem is, the NRA always kicks good people off their board, and if we had a real NRA, our problems would be over very, very quickly.
[01:35:54.409 --> 01:35:54.649]  Okay?
[01:35:57.011 --> 01:35:58.992]  Let's go ahead and talk to Step in Texas.
[01:35:58.992 --> 01:36:00.873]  Step, you're on the air.
[01:36:00.873 --> 01:36:02.453]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[01:36:02.453 --> 01:36:14.298]  I was kind of listening to your show the last couple of days and really kind of considering the attitude of law enforcement towards us.
[01:36:14.298 --> 01:36:17.799]  And this is the thing that I find most shocking.
[01:36:17.799 --> 01:36:19.920]  How did they develop
[01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:24.051]  a attitude to hate their neighbor.
[01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:25.192]  I don't get that.
[01:36:25.192 --> 01:36:32.676]  Well, that's not all the police, but big cities have hired people with under 100 IQs as official policy.
[01:36:32.676 --> 01:36:34.757]  That's NMSNBC saying how great it is.
[01:36:34.757 --> 01:36:36.318]  People never believe that when I say it.
[01:36:36.318 --> 01:36:38.840]  That has been going on for over 15 years that I know of.
[01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:43.022]  They then tell them everybody hates you.
[01:36:43.022 --> 01:36:44.063]  Everybody's out to get you.
[01:36:44.063 --> 01:36:46.164]  You've got to stick together.
[01:36:46.164 --> 01:36:51.148]  They teach them in this threat continuum of force that you've got to be in control of the situation.
[01:36:51.148 --> 01:36:53.809]  That if someone argues with you, go ahead and taser them.
[01:36:53.809 --> 01:36:56.791]  That you can have pain compliance or torture people.
[01:36:56.791 --> 01:37:00.894]  They've been taught to torture, but it's not a big issue unless you torture somebody in Abu Ghraib.
[01:37:00.894 --> 01:37:03.996]  But if you do it here, it's okay.
[01:37:03.996 --> 01:37:04.476]  They have
[01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:17.343]  Really gotten the police, I mean, look, they hire a bunch of people from big cities who've never had parents that taught them how to shoot, they don't come from a true conservative culture, and they're just really scared to death.
[01:37:17.343 --> 01:37:20.285]  I mean, I see cops pulling over old ladies who were scared.
[01:37:20.285 --> 01:37:22.447]  When the cop's walking up, they're shaking.
[01:37:22.447 --> 01:37:25.530]  They think everybody's out to kill them, everybody's out to shoot them.
[01:37:25.530 --> 01:37:31.975]  They hire a lot of wimps who are just so scared that they're trigger happy, and so they just go into this bullying
[01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:37.772]  And they also train cops that, you know, it's up to them to do whatever they want.
[01:37:37.772 --> 01:37:41.193]  I mean, I've had cops all over the country, in D.C.
[01:37:41.193 --> 01:37:45.215]  and New York and Austin, and walk up and say, you can't videotape on the street.
[01:37:45.215 --> 01:37:46.015]  You can't be here.
[01:37:46.015 --> 01:37:47.316]  And I go, First Amendment, pal.
[01:37:47.316 --> 01:37:50.797]  And they say, I'm going to arrest you and start grabbing their handcuffs and their gun.
[01:37:50.797 --> 01:37:51.537]  And I go, go ahead.
[01:37:51.537 --> 01:37:52.978]  I'm going to sue you.
[01:37:52.978 --> 01:37:54.159]  You know what you're doing is illegal.
[01:37:54.159 --> 01:37:54.879]  And they back off.
[01:37:55.717 --> 01:37:58.199]  The average person, well actually I've been arrested a few times for that.
[01:37:58.199 --> 01:38:01.322]  The average person doesn't back off.
[01:38:01.322 --> 01:38:04.805]  I mean, the average person does back off and so the police don't back off.
[01:38:04.805 --> 01:38:09.209]  I mean, you gotta let them know that when they get outside the Constitution and Bill of Rights, they're engaging in a crime.
[01:38:10.123 --> 01:38:11.063]  Sure, I was doing a bunch of legal
[01:38:38.767 --> 01:38:55.235]  I worked for myself last week and I was doing some research on the UCC and I accidentally just kind of stumbled into the National Law Enforcement Community website called PoliceLink, run by Monster.
[01:38:55.235 --> 01:38:59.837]  And on that website, you have cops from all over the country.
[01:39:02.171 --> 01:39:09.216]  And what they had to say in their little forums, I encourage everyone to go to that forum and look at what they're saying.
[01:39:09.216 --> 01:39:10.657]  They don't care about the law.
[01:39:10.657 --> 01:39:13.780]  They don't care about the Constitution.
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.821]  They don't care about what courts say.
[01:39:15.821 --> 01:39:20.324]  They actually accused me of inventing the UCC.
[01:39:20.324 --> 01:39:25.248]  They're actually going out there and saying that I invented the UCC.
[01:39:25.248 --> 01:39:26.949]  Oh, no, no, no, listen, listen.
[01:39:26.949 --> 01:39:29.171]  They now say that the Second Amendment
[01:39:30.205 --> 01:39:30.766]  We're good to go.
[01:39:53.462 --> 01:40:03.447]  That you write an article and pull out quotes and then links to what page it's on and just point out what they're saying and send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:03.447 --> 01:40:07.629]  And if it's a balanced article that proves what it says, we'll post it.
[01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:09.710]  Send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:09.710 --> 01:40:12.531]  A lot of great articles that listeners are writing that we're posting.
[01:40:12.531 --> 01:40:13.391]  We post most of them.
[01:40:13.391 --> 01:40:15.292]  Most of the stuff you write is really informative.
[01:40:15.292 --> 01:40:19.114]  Kurt goes over it, Paul goes over it, and we end up posting it.
[01:40:19.114 --> 01:40:21.035]  But we don't have the time or energy.
[01:40:21.035 --> 01:40:21.555]  I've seen that.
[01:40:21.555 --> 01:40:22.796]  That's a great issue.
[01:40:23.476 --> 01:40:31.444]  Go into the police message boards, like PoliceLink, and I've been on there, and I can't even read it.
[01:40:31.444 --> 01:40:33.946]  I mean, they talk about us like we are the enemy.
[01:40:33.946 --> 01:40:40.772]  Now, again, you go to other more conservative or libertarian police sites, they are very well-spoken.
[01:40:40.772 --> 01:40:43.815]  I mean, you hear the police that call into this show.
[01:40:43.815 --> 01:40:45.477]  They don't stutter.
[01:40:45.477 --> 01:40:48.139]  They're very smooth.
[01:40:49.304 --> 01:40:50.526]  Very well spoken.
[01:40:50.526 --> 01:40:55.714]  Every cop that's a fan of the show that's ever called sounds like they ought to be a corporate executive.
[01:40:55.714 --> 01:41:00.241]  Now, you listen to these thugs on videotapes and things bragging about what they do to people?
[01:41:00.241 --> 01:41:03.185]  It's like, oh yeah, I do.
[01:41:03.185 --> 01:41:04.527]  I mean, that's who they want.
[01:41:05.268 --> 01:41:11.913]  And so cops that think it's funny to violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution are literally morons, just like the general public.
[01:41:11.913 --> 01:41:13.895]  They're drawing from the general public.
[01:41:13.895 --> 01:41:21.141]  They take these weak people who are bullies or who want to be tough, who want some petty power.
[01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:27.426]  I mean, before they tried to hire the quiet, focused, really strong people that wanted to be guardians.
[01:41:28.694 --> 01:41:29.835]  Peacekeepers.
[01:41:29.835 --> 01:41:31.997]  That's what police were.
[01:41:31.997 --> 01:41:39.342]  And then the New York-Chicago mafia model of police became the national template.
[01:41:39.342 --> 01:41:46.987]  And notice, big cities never hire in the department from somebody whose family's been there for 100 years or 50 years.
[01:41:46.987 --> 01:41:51.070]  They always hire from New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles.
[01:41:51.823 --> 01:41:59.866]  They always hire... I mean, the CIA openly runs the LAPD and the Highway Patrol in California.
[01:41:59.866 --> 01:42:03.888]  And if you notice, Austin's police chiefs from the Highway Patrol.
[01:42:03.888 --> 01:42:06.249]  They're now with the Marines running checkpoints in California.
[01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:08.278]  I mean, that's who they hire.
[01:42:08.278 --> 01:42:20.730]  They hire them, they bring them in, they put in the culture, and I watch these police videos where they're beating people up in the jail cells, laughing, and then you'll see them do news interviews later, and they can't even talk.
[01:42:24.153 --> 01:42:32.896]  And, I mean, look, you give a low-grade moron a gun and power, and you say, hey, the Bill of Rights Constitution, that don't exist!
[01:42:32.896 --> 01:42:37.878]  Compare it to the, oh, the funny man!
[01:42:37.878 --> 01:42:40.519]  Black helicopter gonna get to me!
[01:42:40.519 --> 01:42:47.961]  And, I mean, that's what tyranny is, is a bunch of, I mean, you watch Clockwork Orange of a futuristic nightmare police state.
[01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:51.443]  They hire a couple former street gang thugs who've got IQs of about 80 points.
[01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:56.771]  And they're like, it's no longer Officer Demoski!
[01:42:56.771 --> 01:43:01.293]  It's no longer Dem, it's Officer Demoski!
[01:43:01.293 --> 01:43:05.936]  Now I'm gonna torture you!
[01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:09.538]  And I appreciate your call, Step.
[01:43:09.538 --> 01:43:11.460]  Nick in Tokyo, you're on the air.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:16.423]  Hey Alex, I've got something about the Fed and something about Haiti for you.
[01:43:16.423 --> 01:43:18.244]  Okay.
[01:43:18.244 --> 01:43:19.945]  About the Fed, I bail out.
[01:43:20.649 --> 01:43:22.670]  It's a game I developed, actually.
[01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:26.092]  I've been trying to get a hold of you guys, but I haven't had a chance to talk about it.
[01:43:26.092 --> 01:43:27.733]  It's for the iPhone.
[01:43:27.733 --> 01:43:33.797]  It's basically, you know, rips apart the Federal Reserve and ruthlessly satirizes it.
[01:43:33.797 --> 01:43:36.779]  It's available on the App Store right now, for sale.
[01:43:36.779 --> 01:43:38.820]  And I'd really love to get the opportunity to talk to you about it.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.581]  You're the guy that's bombarded us with hundreds of emails, aren't you, Nick?
[01:43:41.581 --> 01:43:42.442]  That's correct.
[01:43:42.442 --> 01:43:43.543]  I'm a tenacious man.
[01:43:43.543 --> 01:43:45.084]  I'm a tenacious man.
[01:43:45.084 --> 01:43:47.505]  Alright, I appreciate your call, Nick.
[01:43:47.505 --> 01:43:48.105]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:53.262]  Business deals on the air, but I appreciate your call.
[01:43:53.262 --> 01:43:58.306]  I'm reviewing a bunch of applications right now.
[01:43:58.306 --> 01:43:59.667]  Not applications for applications.
[01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:03.969]  I'm reviewing different types of applications we're developing, but I appreciate your information, sir.
[01:44:03.969 --> 01:44:05.290]  Thank you.
[01:44:05.290 --> 01:44:06.451]  We're looking at what you sent us.
[01:44:06.451 --> 01:44:07.352]  Thank you.
[01:44:07.352 --> 01:44:09.273]  Let's talk to Brian in Colorado.
[01:44:09.273 --> 01:44:11.654]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:44:11.654 --> 01:44:12.615]  Yes, Alex.
[01:44:12.615 --> 01:44:15.937]  I've been listening to you for nine years now.
[01:44:15.937 --> 01:44:16.978]  Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
[01:44:18.729 --> 01:44:26.231]  Well, you know, that's a false meme or a statement that gets made by everyone that no one listens to me, everyone thinks we're crazy.
[01:44:26.231 --> 01:44:38.075]  Really, 98% were against the banker bailout in Gallup Poll, 91% in Gallup Poll are against open borders, upwards of 80% are against new gun laws and are pro-gun in major polls.
[01:44:38.075 --> 01:44:38.775]  The public
[01:44:39.355 --> 01:44:39.555]  Yeah.
[01:44:55.343 --> 01:45:02.970]  Uh, have a tendency to listen to you, because people that know you have some type of weird psychological contempt for their peers.
[01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:04.851]  They think you're showing off to them.
[01:45:04.851 --> 01:45:07.914]  Like, like I was talking about, you know, Officer Demoski.
[01:45:07.914 --> 01:45:10.075]  Like, you know how to talk!
[01:45:10.075 --> 01:45:13.578]  Are you showing off to me, uh, Brian?
[01:45:13.578 --> 01:45:16.261]  Uh, and so just move on.
[01:45:16.261 --> 01:45:23.747]  I mean, let me guess, you're trying to talk to your co-workers and people, and they like to sit in their little feel-good clicks, and, you know, they're, you know, the economy's not falling apart.
[01:45:24.887 --> 01:45:28.868]  The jobless rate isn't 20%.
[01:45:28.868 --> 01:45:29.789]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:45:29.789 --> 01:45:30.249]  Well, good.
[01:45:30.249 --> 01:45:34.070]  We don't need those TV heads that only know the football scores.
[01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:39.712]  Move on, get involved in organizations and groups, or found one locally, and find people that do want to take action.
[01:45:39.712 --> 01:45:41.352]  Wear a Patriot t-shirt.
[01:45:41.352 --> 01:45:42.953]  Walk around the street.
[01:45:42.953 --> 01:45:44.913]  Walk into stores and businesses and bars.
[01:45:44.913 --> 01:45:48.274]  You'll find fellow-minded people and take action.
[01:45:48.274 --> 01:45:49.555]  And big things start small.
[01:45:49.555 --> 01:45:53.216]  I mean, so you make the announcement here, Brian, nobody listens to you.
[01:45:53.216 --> 01:45:53.756]  What does that mean?
[01:45:54.912 --> 01:46:00.181]  Well, you know, I'm almost done with people now, but, uh... People are friendly.
[01:46:00.181 --> 01:46:00.501]  Oh, everybody.
[01:46:00.501 --> 01:46:01.142]  My family, I have, uh...
[01:46:06.807 --> 01:46:09.348]  Alienated many, many friends.
[01:46:09.348 --> 01:46:12.309]  But, uh, now... Well, I mean, maybe it's your approach.
[01:46:12.309 --> 01:46:15.750]  I mean, because I've woken up tens of millions of people.
[01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:16.791]  You've got to be authoritative.
[01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:17.571]  You've got to be focused.
[01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:18.631]  You've got to have the facts.
[01:46:18.631 --> 01:46:21.292]  I mean, have you ever tried the approach of, hey, tell me what you think of this film?
[01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:23.353]  Have you ever given them a fall of the republic?
[01:46:23.353 --> 01:46:24.033]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:24.033 --> 01:46:24.533]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:24.533 --> 01:46:28.255]  Some people won't even bother to watch it at all.
[01:46:28.255 --> 01:46:29.955]  So you've never had any success?
[01:46:29.955 --> 01:46:30.876]  Just nothing?
[01:46:30.876 --> 01:46:32.276]  Zero?
[01:46:32.276 --> 01:46:33.297]  Slowly, I am.
[01:46:33.297 --> 01:46:33.877]  Slowly, I am.
[01:46:35.464 --> 01:46:36.745]  Yes, I am.
[01:46:36.745 --> 01:46:39.887]  Yes, I am.
[01:46:39.887 --> 01:46:45.390]  Well, most people.
[01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:50.072]  What I wanted to talk to you about is I'm a senior in electrical engineering, Steven.
[01:46:50.072 --> 01:46:52.974]  And my hero is Nikola Tesla.
[01:46:54.384 --> 01:46:57.105]  And they don't want you to know about this guy at all.
[01:46:57.105 --> 01:47:13.851]  Yeah, the FBI raided him, took everything he had, but going back to the school, you got a bunch of stupid yuppie kids in there who all they know about is this TV show Lost, or Dancing with the Stars, or the NFL, and they are intimidated when you talk about things, see?
[01:47:13.851 --> 01:47:18.113]  So that's what that giggling and laughing is, because there's nothing between their ears, brother.
[01:47:18.113 --> 01:47:21.034]  Yeah, well, nobody knows really anything.
[01:47:21.988 --> 01:47:25.652]  Point is, I wanted to make... And that's why the government's gonna gang-rape him real good.
[01:47:25.652 --> 01:47:26.553]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:26.553 --> 01:47:27.754]  Yeah.
[01:47:27.754 --> 01:47:35.302]  Um, Nikola Tesla, like, sometime in the 20s or something like that, invented an earthquake machine.
[01:47:35.302 --> 01:47:37.484]  Yes, I know he did.
[01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:42.689]  Um, so, if that was in the 20s, everything in the universe is vibrating.
[01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:44.331]  Everything has a resonant frequency.
[01:47:45.106 --> 01:47:51.670]  And if you tap the earth at its resonant frequency, it starts vibrating stronger and stronger and stronger.
[01:47:51.670 --> 01:47:53.652]  Yeah, I mean, see, I don't even go off that.
[01:47:53.652 --> 01:47:57.454]  I just have the Secretary of Defense, Army Times, saying they have the earthquake weapons.
[01:47:57.454 --> 01:48:01.237]  I mean, I just bypass directly to them saying it, and that's how you wake people up.
[01:48:01.237 --> 01:48:04.139]  You say, oh, here's the government admitting it.
[01:48:04.139 --> 01:48:06.680]  So, I mean, and then the debate's over.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.143]  Oh, here's the government admitting this GMO corn causes labor failure.
[01:48:11.004 --> 01:48:14.427]  I mean, it's just boom, boom, point-blank range with the info.
[01:48:14.427 --> 01:48:18.791]  But yes, he did work on seismic tectonic vibration systems.
[01:48:18.791 --> 01:48:29.580]  The problem is there's a lot of kooks that then will sell a glass jar with some Christmas tree lights in it and say it'll cure cancer, and it's not a true Tesla wave system, and they've never really studied it enough.
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:34.063]  So you have quacks claiming they understand the technology, when really only Nikola Tesla did.
[01:48:37.179 --> 01:48:41.002]  So that was in the 20s, like, so what do you think they have now, you know?
[01:48:41.002 --> 01:48:42.924]  No, we know what they have now, sir.
[01:48:42.924 --> 01:48:50.751]  They have earthquake weapons, seismic systems using Tesla coil systems.
[01:48:50.751 --> 01:49:00.060]  They have patented nuke systems where they drill down on the ocean floor, generally off an ocean island to cause a tsunami weapon or an earthquake weapon.
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:01.061]  That was declassified 1954.
[01:49:03.002 --> 01:49:06.323]  A source of that is Sydney Morning Herald, Associated Press.
[01:49:06.323 --> 01:49:09.064]  That came out, what, eight years ago?
[01:49:09.064 --> 01:49:13.505]  The Secretary of Defense admits they have tectonic volcanic weapons.
[01:49:13.505 --> 01:49:22.047]  I've had Ben Levinson, the father of weather weapons, Stanford Research Institute, certified 1967 with hurricane weapon systems.
[01:49:22.047 --> 01:49:23.288]  They can do it with eight aircraft.
[01:49:24.108 --> 01:49:25.149]  I mean, just on and on.
[01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:29.593]  But no one ever talks about the White House admitting chemtrails all admitted they're spraying us.
[01:49:29.593 --> 01:49:35.218]  Everyone just speculates and only talks about rumors when it's all out in the open, hitting us, hitting us hard.
[01:49:35.218 --> 01:49:39.362]  But I don't know if this particular operation was an earthquake weapon.
[01:49:39.362 --> 01:49:42.665]  Well, another thing I want to talk about is this smart grid.
[01:49:42.665 --> 01:49:46.268]  Now, I just took a class last semester and we learned all about it.
[01:49:47.154 --> 01:49:49.915]  Yes, everything will have RFID dust in it.
[01:49:49.915 --> 01:49:52.056]  Everything will be face scanned.
[01:49:52.056 --> 01:49:54.717]  Google is all NSA, admittedly run.
[01:49:54.717 --> 01:49:57.398]  Everything in real time will be scanned and tracked.
[01:49:57.398 --> 01:50:04.921]  And so instead of the web just tracking the web, it will track everything on the surface of the earth in real time.
[01:50:04.921 --> 01:50:08.642]  The thing is, we haven't built any power stations.
[01:50:08.642 --> 01:50:11.503]  But the demand for power is becoming exponential.
[01:50:11.503 --> 01:50:15.525]  We've been doing this on purpose, so we'll have to accept the smart grid.
[01:50:16.198 --> 01:50:19.145]  Because they can't rebuild the transmission line.
[01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:21.991]  I mean, sir, the smart grid is wireless internet.
[01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:24.777]  And all the government and private groups that cover most of the country now.
[01:50:26.175 --> 01:50:31.837]  So, your heater, your water heater, and all that stuff will have... It's all going in.
[01:50:31.837 --> 01:50:37.000]  In California, it's a big stink that they're tracking everything, and the government will control your thermostat.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.460]  In Austin, they just come and put it in.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.641]  They don't even tell you.
[01:50:39.641 --> 01:50:43.463]  And then you try to tell the public, they start drooling and laughing, but a lot of them are listening.
[01:50:43.463 --> 01:50:46.244]  They go, you mean government control thermostat?
[01:50:46.244 --> 01:50:48.405]  There's no such thing as thermostat!
[01:50:49.105 --> 01:50:50.785]  They're not done with that!
[01:50:50.785 --> 01:50:52.586]  That's a conspiracy theory!
[01:50:52.586 --> 01:50:55.246]  Electricity's a conspiracy theory!
[01:50:55.246 --> 01:50:56.807]  I take my mercury!
[01:50:56.807 --> 01:51:02.028]  The news said mercury good for me!
[01:51:02.028 --> 01:51:06.429]  For the first time ever, the makers of Alpine Air Foods have approved an incredible sale!
[01:51:06.429 --> 01:51:09.209]  With savings only available through ready-made resources!
[01:51:09.209 --> 01:51:14.770]  For a limited time, save 25% off all cases of freeze-dried foods by Alpine Air!
[01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:17.531]  Yes, 25% off on case lots only of Alpine Air Foods!
[01:51:17.551 --> 01:51:18.252]  We're good to go.
[01:51:34.355 --> 01:51:34.976]  I don't know.
[01:52:01.095 --> 01:52:01.757]  Hello.
[01:52:01.757 --> 01:52:06.528]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:52:06.528 --> 01:52:10.938]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:52:13.507 --> 01:52:16.328]  Like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:52:16.328 --> 01:52:21.509]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[01:52:21.509 --> 01:52:22.749]  Boy was I wrong.
[01:52:22.749 --> 01:52:25.890]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[01:52:25.890 --> 01:52:29.771]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[01:52:29.771 --> 01:52:32.692]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[01:52:32.992 --> 01:52:33.532]  Wow!
[01:52:33.532 --> 01:52:35.054]  I watched the DVD last night.
[01:52:35.054 --> 01:52:36.274]  I was awestruck.
[01:52:36.274 --> 01:52:37.956]  What wonderful work you have done.
[01:52:37.956 --> 01:52:40.497]  This information can bless many people.
[01:52:40.497 --> 01:52:41.698]  Thank you again.
[01:52:41.698 --> 01:52:42.459]  Thanks again.
[01:52:42.459 --> 01:52:45.581]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[01:52:45.581 --> 01:52:46.182]  Thank you.
[01:52:46.182 --> 01:52:49.604]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:52:49.604 --> 01:52:53.187]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:52:53.187 --> 01:52:57.530]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:53:01.132 --> 01:53:02.433]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.433 --> 01:53:08.016]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:08.016 --> 01:53:13.039]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:13.039 --> 01:53:13.519]  It's true.
[01:53:13.519 --> 01:53:18.062]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:53:18.602 --> 01:53:23.826]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.826 --> 01:53:26.147]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:53:26.147 --> 01:53:30.950]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:32.071]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:35.133]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:53:35.133 --> 01:53:38.756]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.756 --> 01:53:41.938]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:41.938 --> 01:53:44.179]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:44.179 --> 01:53:45.080]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:48.722 --> 01:53:50.163]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:50.163 --> 01:53:57.786]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.786 --> 01:54:06.870]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:13.133]  Once Madison Avenue makes people feel insecure from a young age with their advertisements and cultures,
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:18.622]  They can then sell you whatever they want to feel secure.
[01:54:18.622 --> 01:54:24.727]  And so people have been taught all their archetypal role models are idiots.
[01:54:24.727 --> 01:54:27.588]  And so people think it's cute to be morons.
[01:54:27.588 --> 01:54:31.591]  No, when you become morons, you go into bondage.
[01:54:31.591 --> 01:54:38.296]  And again, anytime you talk to a police officer who's well-spoken and intelligent, they're a patriot, they know what's going on.
[01:54:38.296 --> 01:54:43.259]  But then you talk to another one and they just start laughing at you and you really have a conversation with them.
[01:54:43.259 --> 01:54:44.600]  They can't even really talk.
[01:54:45.663 --> 01:54:47.224]  And they're just like the public.
[01:54:47.224 --> 01:54:51.967]  I mean, only a moron would know that we're not in serious trouble.
[01:54:51.967 --> 01:54:54.529]  Only an idiot would be in denial about this.
[01:54:54.529 --> 01:54:56.370]  Mark in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:56.370 --> 01:55:00.553]  Hey Alex, first time caller here, so I'm a little nervous.
[01:55:00.553 --> 01:55:03.174]  Welcome, sir.
[01:55:03.174 --> 01:55:11.540]  Are you familiar with the article from NextGov.com titled Defense Launches Online System to Coordinate Haiti Relief Efforts?
[01:55:12.791 --> 01:55:23.993]  No, but I know the Pentagon's already, in the last three years, taken over the entire Internet and are putting in the hubs to shut it down, according to the White House press releases, so they are unbelievable what they're doing.
[01:55:23.993 --> 01:55:26.713]  Well, here's an excerpt from that.
[01:55:26.713 --> 01:55:37.155]  On Monday, Gene DeMay, DSA's technical manager for the agency's transnational information sharing cooperation project, happened to be at the headquarters of the U.S.
[01:55:37.155 --> 01:55:41.296]  Southern Command in Miami, preparing for a test of the system.
[01:55:41.809 --> 01:55:42.430]  This is it.
[01:55:54.258 --> 01:56:10.044]  So they just so happen to be doing a drill of Haiti being hit by a disaster, and they always, they were running drills of the exact same bus, exact same trains, exact same locations, being bombed the exact same time, BBC, for the 7-7 bombings.
[01:56:10.044 --> 01:56:18.086]  They were running drills of the exact same targets, the exact same time being hit on 9-11, and that is very suspicious.
[01:56:18.086 --> 01:56:20.867]  Will you send that to us?
[01:56:20.867 --> 01:56:22.288]  I mean, give me the headline right now.
[01:56:22.868 --> 01:56:32.654]  It's called Defense Launches Online System to Coordinate Haiti Relief Efforts, and it's from NextGov.com.
[01:56:32.654 --> 01:56:34.255]  NextGov?
[01:56:34.255 --> 01:56:35.316]  Yes.
[01:56:35.316 --> 01:56:42.920]  Alright, NextGov.gov, and the guys are all on the telephone, so let me write that down myself.
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.902]  Tell me the headline again.
[01:56:44.902 --> 01:56:50.045]  Defense Launches Online System to Coordinate Haiti Relief Efforts.
[01:56:52.426 --> 01:56:57.162]  to coordinate Haiti relief efforts.
[01:56:59.141 --> 01:57:01.964]  Defense launches online system.
[01:57:01.964 --> 01:57:03.305]  Okay, got it.
[01:57:03.305 --> 01:57:05.026]  Again, the full headline.
[01:57:05.026 --> 01:57:09.070]  Defense launches online system to coordinate Haiti relief efforts.
[01:57:09.070 --> 01:57:10.171]  Alpha Tango Delta.
[01:57:10.171 --> 01:57:12.653]  Get me that information right now, man.
[01:57:12.653 --> 01:57:13.113]  Wow.
[01:57:13.113 --> 01:57:17.537]  So they were running a drill of something similar happening at the same time.
[01:57:17.537 --> 01:57:21.681]  Now that's not as bad as the exact same bus, exact same trains, exact same time.
[01:57:21.681 --> 01:57:23.383]  But it is very suspicious.
[01:57:23.883 --> 01:57:26.785]  And it is the Department of Defense that has the earthquake weapons.
[01:57:26.785 --> 01:57:28.967]  Well, I tell you, that's really suspicious.
[01:57:28.967 --> 01:57:30.748]  We'll continue to ferret into that.
[01:57:30.748 --> 01:57:32.609]  Anything else?
[01:57:32.609 --> 01:57:35.331]  No, just saying you're doing a great job.
[01:57:35.331 --> 01:57:36.952]  You helped cure my apathy.
[01:57:36.952 --> 01:57:41.035]  I started a website myself, RevolutionaryPolitics.com.
[01:57:41.035 --> 01:57:41.935]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:41.935 --> 01:57:43.156]  Well done!
[01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:45.598]  Good to hear from you.
[01:57:45.598 --> 01:57:51.082]  I like plugs like that where he brings some meat to the table and then gives us an attack point to spread the info.
[01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:55.453]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Ed in New York.
[01:57:55.453 --> 01:57:56.234]  Ed, you're on the air.
[01:57:56.234 --> 01:57:58.676]  Hello, Alex.
[01:57:58.676 --> 01:57:58.876]  Hello.
[01:57:58.876 --> 01:58:00.897]  It's your time caller.
[01:58:00.897 --> 01:58:02.698]  Hope you're doing well.
[01:58:02.698 --> 01:58:03.459]  I'm doing alright.
[01:58:03.459 --> 01:58:07.021]  I mean, the police just banned my gun show because they just felt like it.
[01:58:07.021 --> 01:58:13.245]  I guess next they'll make me mow their yard because they feel like it.
[01:58:13.245 --> 01:58:15.727]  My daughters come of age, maybe they'll demand my daughters.
[01:58:15.727 --> 01:58:16.908]  I mean, I don't know what's coming next.
[01:58:16.908 --> 01:58:21.111]  I don't know how you can resist having a heart attack with all the stuff that you got.
[01:58:23.115 --> 01:58:38.443]  Anyway, I don't listen to you all the time, but I hear you on the shortwave, and sometimes I hear you on the recording at night.
[01:58:38.443 --> 01:58:42.586]  Stay there, stay there, I gotta see where this is going.
[01:58:42.586 --> 01:58:44.167]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:04.335]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:59:04.335 --> 01:59:08.820]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[02:00:10.511 --> 02:00:12.092]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.092 --> 02:00:13.013]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.013 --> 02:00:17.838]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.838 --> 02:00:21.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.248 --> 02:00:29.873]  Welcome to the Hathaway Point in this Tuesday, the 19th day of January, 2010 edition.
[02:00:29.873 --> 02:00:39.240]  We'll be simulcasting the last two hours of the show here live at PrisonPlanet.TV for TV viewers and members of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:42.302]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:42.302 --> 02:00:44.924]  Alright, I've got a bunch of financial news.
[02:00:44.924 --> 02:00:46.665]  I haven't even gotten into what's happening.
[02:00:47.917 --> 02:00:54.099]  Uh, with this huge election coming up today in Massachusetts, how important that is.
[02:00:54.099 --> 02:01:00.361]  These are Democrats revolting against Obama, showing he has broken all his promises and they're very upset about it.
[02:01:00.361 --> 02:01:06.343]  The problem is the Republicans, if we don't fully get them in line, will do the same thing when they get into power in the next few years.
[02:01:06.903 --> 02:01:10.706]  So we're going to be discussing that coming up in the next hour in great detail.
[02:01:10.706 --> 02:01:12.027]  Please stay with us for that.
[02:01:12.027 --> 02:01:22.997]  And we'll continue with Open Phones in this hour on a host of issues, though we've got Jews and Preservation of Firearms ownership founder Aaron Zellman coming on in 30 minutes.
[02:01:22.997 --> 02:01:30.103]  Now, for the next 20 minutes or so, we are joined by Darwin Bedecker.
[02:01:31.277 --> 02:01:41.644]  The Austin Police, under color of law, ran out the Saks at Gun and Knife Show that had been here since I was in college, we're talking 16 years ago at least, out of the Crockett Center.
[02:01:41.644 --> 02:01:46.607]  But Davy Crockett's evil, so they've rechanged his name to the Market Center.
[02:01:46.607 --> 02:01:48.828]  It's an old Walmart building.
[02:01:48.828 --> 02:01:50.509]  Walmart owns it.
[02:01:50.509 --> 02:01:54.552]  H-E-B has the general lease on it, big grocery store chain here in Texas.
[02:01:56.428 --> 02:02:02.932]  They called him last week, doing his first show here in Austin, taking over from the Saxon they'd run out.
[02:02:02.932 --> 02:02:04.393]  Didn't tell him that.
[02:02:04.393 --> 02:02:18.042]  Called him as if he was the Saxon and said, look, we got all this dirt on you, you know, things that have gone on in your show, and we're going to shut you down if you don't tell people there's no private sale of guns, which is legal and lawful in most states.
[02:02:18.042 --> 02:02:20.524]  Just like at a garage sale or anything else.
[02:02:20.524 --> 02:02:21.385]  And he said,
[02:02:23.029 --> 02:02:24.190]  Well, I'm not the Saxon.
[02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:27.952]  They didn't even know that, the BATF and the Austin Police.
[02:02:27.952 --> 02:02:33.895]  And they said, well, and they had the HEB people there, and they said, look, we're just going to shut this down if you don't tell your tenant to do this.
[02:02:33.895 --> 02:02:35.976]  Color of law, completely illegal.
[02:02:35.976 --> 02:02:37.257]  HEB buckled.
[02:02:37.257 --> 02:02:39.238]  HEB's already getting a lot of protest calls.
[02:02:39.238 --> 02:02:42.140]  They think we've given their number out or going after them.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:43.981]  They've called up and griped at Darwin.
[02:02:43.981 --> 02:02:45.962]  We haven't done that yet, HEB, but we may.
[02:02:46.994 --> 02:02:56.619]  Since you're already accusing us of it, and since you did buckle to this, but the real issue is the police department, the BATF, and Obama clearly gave this order, and that's one of the headlines up at...
[02:02:58.166 --> 02:03:00.288]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:03:00.288 --> 02:03:03.030]  Tennessee follows Texas in banning private gun sales.
[02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:04.251]  They're moving to do that there.
[02:03:04.251 --> 02:03:05.812]  This is coordinated by the White House.
[02:03:05.812 --> 02:03:10.035]  Texas gun show organizer targeted by ATF makes his case on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:03:10.035 --> 02:03:17.300]  And the key article from today, Obama administration shuts down oldest gun show in Central Texas.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:21.023]  And Kurt referred to the previous articles that had all the proof of that.
[02:03:21.023 --> 02:03:23.145]  People said, oh, where's the proof?
[02:03:23.145 --> 02:03:24.326]  It's all right there.
[02:03:24.326 --> 02:03:27.148]  We have some people in denial saying this hasn't even happened.
[02:03:27.808 --> 02:03:30.851]  Of course, that's COINTELPRO going on out there.
[02:03:30.851 --> 02:03:31.811]  No, this did happen.
[02:03:31.811 --> 02:03:33.573]  The BATF ran this.
[02:03:33.573 --> 02:03:35.074]  It is going on.
[02:03:35.074 --> 02:03:36.435]  But there have been big new developments.
[02:03:36.435 --> 02:03:42.300]  They just went ahead and pressured HEB to completely just say, no more gun shows, period, in that building.
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:43.180]  It's over, Austin.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:47.324]  The place you've gone for close to 20 years, at least, to have gun shows, it's over.
[02:03:48.024 --> 02:03:53.046]  They also had a staged arrest where they arrested some guy and then released him there on the spot, let him back in.
[02:03:53.046 --> 02:03:55.787]  It looks staged, at least by the police.
[02:03:55.787 --> 02:04:01.070]  And that's why HEB is saying, well, after the arrest, which wasn't an arrest, it's just over.
[02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:02.230]  It's over.
[02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:03.451]  It's over.
[02:04:03.451 --> 02:04:05.411]  And so they can do this with other businesses.
[02:04:05.411 --> 02:04:07.112]  They can do this with your rights.
[02:04:07.112 --> 02:04:08.553]  No law, no regulation.
[02:04:08.553 --> 02:04:09.673]  They are God.
[02:04:09.673 --> 02:04:11.454]  At least if we let them become God.
[02:04:11.454 --> 02:04:14.995]  And so joining us is Darwin Bedecker.
[02:04:14.995 --> 02:04:16.216]  Darwin, thanks for coming on.
[02:04:18.715 --> 02:04:21.417]  We're about to go to break, but when did H-E-B call you?
[02:04:29.213 --> 02:04:35.157]  I created all this, you know, they said they're having a threat of boycott against H-E-B.
[02:04:35.157 --> 02:04:41.561]  That's like if a woman gets raped, you know, it's like, why were you walking out of work at 8 o'clock at night, lady?
[02:04:41.561 --> 02:04:46.484]  I mean, that's the same, that's the same, or somebody gets mugged, or somebody gets robbed.
[02:04:46.484 --> 02:04:51.027]  You're the person that's been basically ruined by this, but no, you are the bad one!
[02:04:51.027 --> 02:04:51.907]  You are bad!
[02:04:51.907 --> 02:04:54.169]  How dare you not lick boots properly!
[02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.969]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:54.969 --> 02:04:55.650]  Darwin, stay there.
[02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:04.571]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.571 --> 02:05:09.893]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.893 --> 02:05:11.953]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.953 --> 02:05:16.955]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.955 --> 02:05:18.136]  How much do you want?
[02:05:18.136 --> 02:05:19.256]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.256 --> 02:05:21.137]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:21.137 --> 02:05:22.217]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.217 --> 02:05:24.418]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.418 --> 02:05:25.758]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.758 --> 02:05:27.279]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.279 --> 02:05:28.319]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:05:28.499 --> 02:05:29.821]  And you can't feed yourself?
[02:05:29.821 --> 02:05:32.544]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.544 --> 02:05:36.129]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:36.129 --> 02:05:39.954]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.954 --> 02:05:41.175]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.175 --> 02:05:42.076]  We don't know.
[02:05:42.076 --> 02:05:43.178]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.178 --> 02:05:44.119]  All you can get.
[02:05:44.119 --> 02:05:44.940]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.243]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:06:00.836 --> 02:06:01.996]  What's your home worth?
[02:06:01.996 --> 02:06:04.097]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:06:04.097 --> 02:06:07.138]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[02:07:04.336 --> 02:07:07.198]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:07.198 --> 02:07:08.479]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:11.541]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[02:08:05.982 --> 02:08:07.283]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.283 --> 02:08:09.044]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.044 --> 02:08:10.806]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.806 --> 02:08:12.387]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.387 --> 02:08:13.307]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.307 --> 02:08:18.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:22.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.711 --> 02:08:28.513]  Darwin Bedecker is standing up.
[02:08:28.513 --> 02:08:33.156]  He came in to take over a gun show in Austin that had been here for more than 15 years.
[02:08:33.156 --> 02:08:35.137]  They didn't tell him they'd run that group out.
[02:08:35.137 --> 02:08:37.338]  They didn't even know they'd run them out.
[02:08:37.338 --> 02:08:42.861]  And they said, you're not going to allow private sales, which is a big part of his business, which is totally legal.
[02:08:42.861 --> 02:08:46.644]  They threatened the leaseholder, HEB, and told him to make him do this.
[02:08:47.625 --> 02:08:52.833]  Mr. Bedeker posted the sign, but then got a petition going to the State Attorney General.
[02:08:52.833 --> 02:08:57.680]  Then the police put pressure on HEB to just end all gun shows at that location.
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.823]  They told him, no more gun shows, not just you.
[02:08:59.823 --> 02:09:00.965]  It's over.
[02:09:00.965 --> 02:09:01.385]  It's over.
[02:09:02.591 --> 02:09:06.174]  And I guess they'll harass anybody else that tries to get another location.
[02:09:06.174 --> 02:09:13.261]  Now, local TV stations are going to interview the police, and there's no debating the facts.
[02:09:13.261 --> 02:09:16.324]  We need to make sure KVUE and others don't spin this.
[02:09:16.324 --> 02:09:26.073]  The article is Obama administration shuts down oldest gun show in Central Texas, and they are the ones that ran this, the BATFE, the ATF is the subdivision of that.
[02:09:26.733 --> 02:09:29.254]  Alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives.
[02:09:29.254 --> 02:09:39.299]  Police under the direction of ATF told the event, Bedecker, he would be required to follow their recommendations or they would close down his event.
[02:09:39.299 --> 02:09:42.881]  Bedecker said he was told, you do what we say or we shut you down.
[02:09:42.881 --> 02:09:45.642]  He said the ultimatum was recorded by police and ATF.
[02:09:45.642 --> 02:09:49.024]  So the news needs to now demand that video.
[02:09:49.024 --> 02:09:52.845]  Because, well, no, let's let them lie to the media first and then get the video through subpoena.
[02:09:52.845 --> 02:09:53.866]  Or they'll say it malfunctioned.
[02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:59.636]  Mr. Bedecker indicated enforcing the ATF recommendations would destroy his business.
[02:09:59.636 --> 02:10:05.222]  He said he would not issue a public notice unless it indicated the so-called recommendations were issued by the Austin Police and ATF.
[02:10:05.222 --> 02:10:08.726]  And the ATF said, yes, that's good, do that.
[02:10:08.726 --> 02:10:11.929]  And this has now happened.
[02:10:11.929 --> 02:10:16.253]  And so he decided to stand up, so HEB called him this morning and said, it's over.
[02:10:17.176 --> 02:10:19.518]  Now, Austin Police, this is illegal.
[02:10:19.518 --> 02:10:23.722]  What the ATF did violates, there's no statutes to do this, no statutory authority.
[02:10:23.722 --> 02:10:31.609]  It's clearly racketeering, it's clearly corruption, it's clearly, they've damaged him financially, it's clearly color of law, civil rights violation.
[02:10:31.609 --> 02:10:33.591]  I mean, they have really done it.
[02:10:33.591 --> 02:10:36.253]  But if they get away with it, the precedent is set.
[02:10:36.253 --> 02:10:40.217]  And what they do is they set up stings and fake things, they harass gun shops and
[02:10:41.858 --> 02:10:46.022]  Yes sir, I got a call from Andrew, the manager of the North Austin Event Center yesterday.
[02:11:09.185 --> 02:11:15.451]  And he said that he got a phone call from H-E-B saying that our shows were over.
[02:11:15.451 --> 02:11:21.376]  So due to the arrest this past Saturday that they couldn't afford to allow us to have the shows in America.
[02:11:21.376 --> 02:11:26.901]  Which wasn't arrest, they just put a guy in handcuffs, now the number's 20 minutes, and let him go, and he went back into the show.
[02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:28.931]  Not exactly.
[02:11:28.931 --> 02:11:42.823]  So now it's a matter of, you know, trying to convince H-E-B to either, you know, allow us to have a show in there again, or trying to find a new location with, you know, 20 or 19 days, 20 days to go before next show.
[02:11:42.823 --> 02:11:52.812]  So you capitulate to the arm-twisting, post it, but then stand up and say we're going to do a petition to the Attorney General because local governments can't just make up imaginary things without laws.
[02:11:52.812 --> 02:11:54.713]  Now, you got a call from H-E-B this morning.
[02:11:54.713 --> 02:11:55.494]  Tell us who called you.
[02:11:56.169 --> 02:11:58.211]  That was a lady named Natalie.
[02:11:58.211 --> 02:12:02.094]  She called from ATB there in Austin and wanted to know why.
[02:12:02.094 --> 02:12:15.404]  She said that what she heard was, I said that ATB agreed to do stings, agreed with the Austin PD and ATF to do stings in my gun show, which is absolutely not true.
[02:12:15.404 --> 02:12:19.066]  I would never agree to such a thing.
[02:12:19.066 --> 02:12:21.528]  And she said that people are wanting to start a
[02:12:23.072 --> 02:12:29.817]  You know, anti-HEB, you know, uh, what do you call it?
[02:12:29.817 --> 02:12:31.398]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[02:12:31.398 --> 02:12:34.120]  Anti-HEB campaign.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:37.562]  And she asked me why I would do that and I said it was not me.
[02:12:37.562 --> 02:12:43.406]  And then I said it was the representative that you sent, that HEB sent to this meeting.
[02:12:44.475 --> 02:12:44.955]  I don't know.
[02:13:15.356 --> 02:13:17.358]  But see how they're making it that you're bad?
[02:13:17.358 --> 02:13:21.762]  I'm surprised they don't just say it's a conspiracy theory and the gun show never even existed.
[02:13:21.762 --> 02:13:28.569]  And you know, Grandpa says there used to be a gun show there and the kids laugh and say, Grandpa says people used to own guns!
[02:13:28.569 --> 02:13:32.793]  You know, that's the attitude that they have.
[02:13:32.793 --> 02:13:38.699]  They shut down your business, they unlawfully come in, order H-E-B to do this, you were at the meeting,
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:42.621]  I know, and that's what I tried to explain to her.
[02:13:42.621 --> 02:13:48.602]  I said, if you listen to the interview that I had with you yesterday, never once did I say H-E-B was the bad guy.
[02:14:00.410 --> 02:14:02.751]  And neither did I, but here's the issue.
[02:14:02.751 --> 02:14:04.933]  They can't say the police are wrong.
[02:14:04.933 --> 02:14:11.557]  They can't say it's wrong that they just came in like thugs and made all this up and made your leaseholder.
[02:14:11.557 --> 02:14:16.460]  I mean, you know what happens if I go to a business and talk to a leaseholder and make them lose their lease?
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:18.982]  I can be sued up one side and down the other.
[02:14:19.862 --> 02:14:22.203]  What other businesses will the police come in and take over?
[02:14:22.203 --> 02:14:40.971]  I'll tell you, in Seattle it's a major scandal that in some areas of the city, more than half of the bars are owned by police, because they would go in and run stings of selling their own agent drugs, and then asset forfeiture sees the bar or restaurant, and then keep it for themselves.
[02:14:40.971 --> 02:14:44.913]  I mean, this is a... I guess we're going the Chicago-Seattle model.
[02:14:46.599 --> 02:14:58.511]  Yeah, well the good news out of all this is since the show yesterday I've received tons of emails, you know, people saying that they couldn't make it to the show but they would support us anyway.
[02:14:59.252 --> 02:15:03.514]  You know, even if they bought complimentary tickets or something online just to show their support.
[02:15:03.514 --> 02:15:14.878]  So, I mean, that's a good feeling, knowing that there's so many people out there that... And you're going to try to get into another venue, but let's not talk about that right now or the cops will run and try to defame you and destroy you there.
[02:15:14.878 --> 02:15:16.739]  I mean, they're getting deeper into trouble.
[02:15:16.739 --> 02:15:20.120]  And if I know these Austin police, they're going to savagely attack now.
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:25.562]  I mean, I could be raided any minute with set-ups or whatever, because they are the mafia.
[02:15:25.562 --> 02:15:26.303]  They rule.
[02:15:26.303 --> 02:15:26.943]  End of the story.
[02:15:27.603 --> 02:15:32.926]  Uh, but, but, I mean, these people are dangerous, but, I mean, they're lawless, but, but continue.
[02:15:32.926 --> 02:15:44.513]  Well, yeah, and basically I tried to, I tried to explain to her, she said that it was, it was unfair for me to, uh, have a boycott set up against H-E-B because... So she wouldn't even listen to you?
[02:15:44.513 --> 02:15:47.275]  You explained to her, but still, you are the bad one!
[02:15:47.275 --> 02:15:52.958]  Not the police starting all this, not the feds ordering it, you are the bad one as the victim.
[02:15:52.958 --> 02:15:53.559]  Exactly.
[02:15:53.559 --> 02:15:56.981]  Because she cannot say the government's bad because it is God.
[02:15:58.379 --> 02:16:11.622]  Yeah, and she goes, well normally I have these meetings face-to-face, and I told her I'd be more than willing to set up a meeting with her face-to-face, but I wouldn't be there alone this time, like the first meeting I had.
[02:16:11.622 --> 02:16:14.662]  So that's basically where it ended.
[02:16:14.662 --> 02:16:16.103]  Well, what's the answer here?
[02:16:16.103 --> 02:16:23.244]  I mean, should we have people, I guess, contact the main line for H-E-B, the toll-free number?
[02:16:23.244 --> 02:16:26.885]  I think the best course of action would be to get in contact
[02:16:27.492 --> 02:16:28.233]  We're good to go.
[02:16:42.978 --> 02:16:51.503]  Well, do you understand it's illegal for police outside of the law to come into people's businesses and get them shut down with their leaseholders?
[02:16:51.503 --> 02:16:56.366]  This is a serious mafia crime they've committed.
[02:16:56.366 --> 02:16:58.967]  But to them, they just think it's funny.
[02:16:58.967 --> 02:17:03.390]  Yeah, they think they're doing something right, I guess, on their end.
[02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:07.913]  Yeah, because they can't get the legislature to pass a law, so they'll just shut it down because they're God.
[02:17:08.883 --> 02:17:16.569]  And you know, the ironic thing is that the arrests they have made at other gun shows, they've made those arrests because there was a gun show going on.
[02:17:16.569 --> 02:17:25.977]  Because they actually knew where the people would be, unlike if there was no show, they'd be behind them in an alley somewhere and they'd have no idea where it was going on.
[02:17:25.977 --> 02:17:32.462]  And gun shows have been over backwards where the cops don't even ask, they just wander into the back door, do whatever they want.
[02:17:32.462 --> 02:17:33.562]  Not good enough.
[02:17:33.562 --> 02:17:36.185]  Mission completed, gun show shut down after close to 20 years.
[02:17:39.557 --> 02:17:43.362]  I mean, is H-E-B making noises about letting you do your show?
[02:17:43.362 --> 02:17:45.104]  Well, no.
[02:17:45.104 --> 02:17:45.845]  We got off the phone.
[02:17:45.845 --> 02:17:47.748]  I told her I would be with him.
[02:17:47.748 --> 02:17:52.474]  But I think I'm under the understanding that if enough people call them,
[02:17:55.970 --> 02:18:05.576]  Again, it's like Nazi Germany.
[02:18:05.576 --> 02:18:09.018]  They said, well then everybody's complaining about Jewish neighborhoods.
[02:18:09.018 --> 02:18:10.519]  We've got to relocate you.
[02:18:10.519 --> 02:18:12.300]  You know, the German people don't like you here.
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:12.980]  That was the excuse.
[02:18:14.361 --> 02:18:30.332]  You know, neighborhoods a mile from here, they get scared seeing people in parking lots, constant 911 calls, because people drive by and see people walking into a gun show with a giant gun show sign, and there's so many people that moved in here from the few cities that have banned guns that they think it's illegal.
[02:18:30.332 --> 02:18:37.677]  So because a bunch of idiots don't know about the Second Amendment, we have to end the Second Amendment because idiots are scared of it.
[02:18:37.677 --> 02:18:38.538]  Exactly.
[02:18:38.538 --> 02:18:43.401]  And she told me on the phone, she goes, when did HEB become anti-gun?
[02:18:44.071 --> 02:18:52.113]  I said as soon as you sent somebody to a meeting that crumbled under the pressure from the APD and ATF and then had us kick out because of it.
[02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:58.863]  Well, it's the ATF and the police are the real culprits.
[02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:04.307]  I'm not even making HEB because they're not the villain here, they're just the wimps.
[02:19:04.307 --> 02:19:11.772]  But at the same time, them trying to say you are the villain, now they start to become the villain when you're the victim.
[02:19:11.772 --> 02:19:21.098]  And it's clear that this is a precedent-setting case to let the feds and the police behind closed doors shut down gun shows with no law, no nothing.
[02:19:21.098 --> 02:19:22.439]  This is outrageous.
[02:19:24.091 --> 02:19:33.986]  I think the best course of action would be to have everybody call Brett Baker at H-E-B so he can see just how many people do want to have the show there.
[02:19:34.522 --> 02:19:36.002]  Here's the number.
[02:19:36.002 --> 02:19:36.642]  800-432-3113.
[02:19:36.642 --> 02:19:36.963]  800-432-3113.
[02:19:36.963 --> 02:19:37.483]  800-432-3113.
[02:19:37.483 --> 02:19:59.948]  And you can also go to heb.com, email them there, and let them know that for the next few months, if they don't reinstate this in the Second Amendment and freedom and the right to contract, and if they give in to illegal, unlawful racketeering by the feds, that you're not going to buy food there.
[02:19:59.948 --> 02:20:00.588]  Let them know.
[02:20:00.588 --> 02:20:01.208]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.408 --> 02:20:05.993]  Well, Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the truth.
[02:20:05.993 --> 02:20:09.156]  Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[02:20:09.156 --> 02:20:18.245]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed and transported great distances?
[02:20:18.746 --> 02:20:25.951]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company, like you, wants to see Americans change and take control of their own food supply, one seed at a time.
[02:20:25.951 --> 02:20:32.815]  Over 12 years, we've become America's premier supplier of pure, non-GMO seeds with over 1,400 varieties.
[02:20:32.815 --> 02:20:42.462]  Gardeners and homesteaders know Baker Creek offers some of the most popular seed collection kits, like our large heirloom kit with 60 full-size seed packets for only $99.
[02:20:42.462 --> 02:20:47.725]  The kit contains 25 types of vegetables and comes packaged in a metal can for long-term storage for just $99.
[02:20:49.046 --> 02:20:52.208]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:52.208 --> 02:20:54.409]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:54.409 --> 02:20:58.672]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:20:58.672 --> 02:20:59.933]  I have tremendous influence.
[02:21:17.105 --> 02:21:20.166]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[02:21:20.166 --> 02:21:21.526]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:21.526 --> 02:21:22.527]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:22.527 --> 02:21:25.027]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:25.027 --> 02:21:25.988]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:25.988 --> 02:21:26.788]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:21:47.094 --> 02:21:49.998]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:23:08.209 --> 02:23:11.932]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[02:23:20.666 --> 02:23:21.106]  I think so.

[02:24:04.997 --> 02:24:07.159]  Folks, this is thuggism.
[02:24:07.159 --> 02:24:08.100]  This is illegal.
[02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:09.542]  This is fraud.
[02:24:09.542 --> 02:24:16.890]  And it's time to let the government, the B-A-T-F-E, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms people, know they're not our kings.
[02:24:19.687 --> 02:24:25.869]  And of course they're trying to make the gun show they destroyed and shut down illegally, the bad guy, when they're the victim.
[02:24:25.869 --> 02:24:39.412]  Now the good news here is, Darwin, Bedecker, is that you got called from the local ABC News affiliate, and who knows what their newscast will be, but what did they tell you when you talked to them?
[02:24:39.412 --> 02:24:43.793]  The lady's name was Noelle Newton, she was real nice, and she basically just wanted to hear
[02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:55.456]  Uh, my side of the story, because of course they've heard a bunch of rumors and I told her that, you know, I'll just tell her the facts and I basically went through and recapped exactly what happened.
[02:24:55.456 --> 02:24:57.317]  Now in my experience, they don't know the law.
[02:24:57.317 --> 02:25:00.679]  Did you explain to her that there's no law here and they just did this?
[02:25:00.679 --> 02:25:01.440]  Exactly.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:07.483]  I told her, I told her what they had me do was unlawful.
[02:25:07.483 --> 02:25:11.406]  But it was only under the pressure of me losing the show completely the day before
[02:25:12.501 --> 02:25:13.442]  Uh, we were supposed to start.
[02:25:13.442 --> 02:25:19.066]  Yeah, they threatened you with massive financial harm and harm to your reputation if you didn't.
[02:25:19.066 --> 02:25:20.748]  That's extortion.
[02:25:20.748 --> 02:25:21.428]  Exactly.
[02:25:21.428 --> 02:25:22.349]  That's terrorism.
[02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:24.410]  That's an act of financial terrorism.
[02:25:24.410 --> 02:25:25.651]  What did she say?
[02:25:25.651 --> 02:25:31.116]  She said, well, basically, after the whole interview, she, you know, appreciated me having the interview with her.
[02:25:31.116 --> 02:25:34.318]  And she said, well, it sounds like you didn't willingly go along with this.
[02:25:34.318 --> 02:25:35.979]  And I said, absolutely not.
[02:25:35.979 --> 02:25:40.503]  It was only after the pressure of, you know, the demise of my business is why I did it.
[02:25:40.856 --> 02:25:48.435]  And now the police can't say they're wrong under federal orders and so they're just gonna keep saying you're bad and probably stonewall and...
[02:25:49.502 --> 02:26:00.069]  You know, watch out when you're in this town, but the, I know a lot of officers are upset by this, but the people running this, I want to hear Arte Cerveda say this was wrong and come out against this.
[02:26:00.069 --> 02:26:06.813]  We don't know if he's behind this yet, but I'm trying to find out right now, but his department is guaranteed involved in something wrong.
[02:26:06.813 --> 02:26:09.435]  If he tries to spin this, I don't know how he's going to do it.
[02:26:09.435 --> 02:26:17.740]  There's no doubt in my mind, though, the BATF recommended the notice, ordered it, was running it, was in control, and that this is the Obama administration doing this.
[02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:24.752]  Do you mind if I give you a scenario of what the ATF agent himself told me?
[02:26:24.752 --> 02:26:26.872]  I could do real quick because it's... Sure.
[02:26:26.872 --> 02:26:31.013]  Not only is it disturbing, but I don't think it's lawful either.
[02:26:31.013 --> 02:26:36.815]  I gave him the notice, I gave him a scenario.
[02:26:36.815 --> 02:26:47.718]  Say my grandfather leaves me a Colt pistol in his will and I have a prior domestic charge against me, so I can't own that gun.
[02:26:48.294 --> 02:26:53.638]  So I take it to the gun show and I try to sell it to do the right thing, to do the legal thing.
[02:26:53.638 --> 02:27:07.089]  And now by trying to follow their recommendations, say I have to take that gun and I have to take it to a dealer and have them put it in his books and do a background search on a person that wants to buy it at the show.
[02:27:07.089 --> 02:27:14.054]  Now say that person doesn't pass the background check and I want my gun back, the one my grandfather left me in a will.
[02:27:14.054 --> 02:27:17.337]  Now by law, I have to do paperwork
[02:27:18.149 --> 02:27:23.091]  On the gun that was left to me in my will, to get my own gun back.
[02:27:23.091 --> 02:27:26.892]  And I told him, now what would happen since I had the previous charge against me?
[02:27:26.892 --> 02:27:28.433]  I'm not going to pass the background check.
[02:27:28.433 --> 02:27:31.034]  Then what happens to the gun?
[02:27:31.034 --> 02:27:42.198]  And the ATF officer himself looked straight at me and said, Darwin, well, one way around that is you could have the dealer do the background check on the person that wants to buy it before he logs it into his book.
[02:27:44.352 --> 02:27:46.698]  And I'm like, and I was totally stunned.
[02:27:46.698 --> 02:27:52.912]  I'm like, so basically what you want me to do is basically break a law just to appease your recommendation.
[02:27:54.079 --> 02:27:59.560]  And he goes, well I'm not telling you you need to do that, but that would be one way to get around that scenario.
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.901]  Well let me expand on this.
[02:28:00.901 --> 02:28:03.602]  That was the Sheriff Mack case and others.
[02:28:03.602 --> 02:28:11.464]  They, regularly when a woman files for divorce, or even a man now, they get a restraining order and then they say you can't own a gun when there's a restraining order.
[02:28:11.464 --> 02:28:14.444]  They say yelling at your wife or husband now is violence.
[02:28:14.444 --> 02:28:15.705]  That's a misdemeanor.
[02:28:15.705 --> 02:28:16.945]  That's unconstitutional.
[02:28:16.945 --> 02:28:19.726]  The 68 Gun Control Act is for felonies.
[02:28:20.146 --> 02:28:24.289]  So that's more bull where the agency's just declared powers that weren't there.
[02:28:24.289 --> 02:28:25.610]  Do you understand that?
[02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:27.251]  Exactly.
[02:28:27.251 --> 02:28:36.358]  I mean, when he told me that was a scenario to try to follow his recommendations, I basically just had to turn around and say, thank you, and I walked off.
[02:28:36.358 --> 02:28:38.479]  When does KVUE say this is going to air?
[02:28:38.479 --> 02:28:38.820]  Tonight?
[02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:41.682]  They say they're going to go try to talk to the detectives?
[02:28:41.682 --> 02:28:44.584]  Well, they said they were going to interview with the police department shortly.
[02:28:44.584 --> 02:28:46.205]  She didn't tell me when it was going to air or not.
[02:28:48.470 --> 02:28:55.218]  I don't know what time it's going to air, but she said that they were on their way down there.
[02:28:55.218 --> 02:28:57.040]  Absolutely.
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:58.641]  That's what I told her in the interview.
[02:28:58.641 --> 02:29:01.745]  I go, it wasn't even a real arrest because they let the gentleman go 45 minutes ago.
[02:29:02.824 --> 02:29:09.089]  Well, they got mad by you not letting them abuse you in secret and putting out the petition for the State Attorney General.
[02:29:09.089 --> 02:29:16.736]  But see, now that they've just shut down the gun show, there's not the problem next month of them trying to force it again and the state coming in and blocking them.
[02:29:16.736 --> 02:29:25.804]  They can just shut down the gun show, kill our Second Amendment right to firearms and private sales, and then sit behind closed doors like Chicago Mafia and just rub their hands together.
[02:29:27.396 --> 02:29:32.740]  I actually had an email from a VFW right out of Austin saying we could use their building, but it was just too small.
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:37.543]  But I appreciate people actually standing up and saying, you know, you can use our facility to do this.
[02:29:37.543 --> 02:29:41.866]  Well, the gun show's been there for close to 20 years, that I know of.
[02:29:41.866 --> 02:29:43.907]  I've been going there for 16, 17.
[02:29:43.907 --> 02:29:45.428]  I don't know, since like 1992.
[02:29:45.428 --> 02:29:48.170]  So about 18 years.
[02:29:48.170 --> 02:29:51.752]  That's where everybody goes.
[02:29:51.752 --> 02:29:53.153]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.153 --> 02:29:54.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.649 --> 02:30:00.871]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.871 --> 02:30:05.432]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.432 --> 02:30:06.332]  Number one.
[02:30:06.332 --> 02:30:09.753]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.753 --> 02:30:10.614]  Number two.
[02:30:10.614 --> 02:30:15.515]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.515 --> 02:30:16.255]  It's true.
[02:30:16.255 --> 02:30:21.117]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.117 --> 02:30:21.657]  Number three.
[02:30:21.937 --> 02:30:25.540]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.540 --> 02:30:30.243]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.243 --> 02:30:33.006]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.006 --> 02:30:37.489]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.489 --> 02:30:41.632]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.

[02:31:01.291 --> 02:31:04.312]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.312 --> 02:31:09.635]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.635 --> 02:31:11.696]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.696 --> 02:31:16.698]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.698 --> 02:31:17.879]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.879 --> 02:31:18.999]  When do you want it?
[02:31:18.999 --> 02:31:20.880]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:21.961]  When will you need it?
[02:31:21.961 --> 02:31:24.162]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.162 --> 02:31:25.502]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.502 --> 02:31:26.803]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.003 --> 02:31:32.269]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:35.874]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.874 --> 02:31:39.698]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.698 --> 02:31:40.919]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.919 --> 02:31:41.820]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:42.922]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.922 --> 02:31:43.863]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.863 --> 02:31:44.664]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.944 --> 02:31:47.989]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:32:48.038 --> 02:32:49.961]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:33:05.211 --> 02:33:09.834]  Ladies and gentlemen, the federal government is taking over all the states.
[02:33:09.834 --> 02:33:12.837]  They're engaged in total unconstitutional behavior.
[02:33:12.837 --> 02:33:16.279]  The White House is announcing they are going to start censoring the web.
[02:33:16.279 --> 02:33:17.400]  They're head of regulation.
[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:19.522]  Cass Sunstein is saying it.
[02:33:19.522 --> 02:33:21.563]  Italy is banning free speech on the web.
[02:33:21.563 --> 02:33:23.304]  That's mainstream news.
[02:33:23.304 --> 02:33:25.766]  Australia's doing it.
[02:33:25.766 --> 02:33:30.450]  The New World Order is moving fast and hard against free people everywhere.
[02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:33.252]  But it's illegitimate, it's illegal, it's tyranny.
[02:33:34.687 --> 02:33:40.711]  Past generations faced Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and others.
[02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:42.633]  We're facing our own criminal governments.
[02:33:42.633 --> 02:33:45.555]  This is how history works.
[02:33:45.555 --> 02:33:55.722]  You know, I have an online video bookstore, and it is one of the main funders of the radio show, the TV show, the films I make, all the work we do, and it's expensive.
[02:33:55.722 --> 02:34:02.327]  Plus, you get great videos, so you're getting great videos, great books, great material, but you're also financing what we do.
[02:34:02.907 --> 02:34:05.029]  So please go to InfoWars.com.
[02:34:05.029 --> 02:34:10.793]  Look at all the specials on Patriot Apparel, Don't Tread on Me shirts, Obama Joker shirts.
[02:34:10.793 --> 02:34:12.554]  I mean, we've got like 70 or 80.
[02:34:12.554 --> 02:34:13.615]  I haven't counted them.
[02:34:13.615 --> 02:34:17.598]  I know it's more than 70 different t-shirts, sweatshirts, ball caps.
[02:34:17.598 --> 02:34:19.500]  You want to meet like-minded people?
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:20.621]  Wear these to the gun show.
[02:34:20.621 --> 02:34:21.521]  Wear these to church.
[02:34:21.521 --> 02:34:22.322]  Wear these to work.
[02:34:22.322 --> 02:34:23.223]  Wear these on the street.
[02:34:23.923 --> 02:34:25.024]  This is our culture.
[02:34:25.024 --> 02:34:26.425]  We're the majority.
[02:34:26.425 --> 02:34:27.927]  We're the constitutionalist.
[02:34:27.927 --> 02:34:29.929]  We need to show it.
[02:34:29.929 --> 02:34:30.929]  Go to the Tea Parties.
[02:34:30.929 --> 02:34:33.191]  Wake them up that both parties are controlled.
[02:34:33.191 --> 02:34:34.392]  We founded the Tea Parties.
[02:34:34.392 --> 02:34:35.994]  The neocons took it over.
[02:34:35.994 --> 02:34:36.795]  The point is...
[02:34:38.075 --> 02:34:41.857]  We need to carry the ball, carry the flag of liberty, and educate people.
[02:34:41.857 --> 02:34:43.698]  So visit the online video bookstore.
[02:34:43.698 --> 02:34:51.602]  It's got the best materials, the best books, the best videos, all my films, but scores of other films like Shadow Government that just came out that is amazingly powerful.
[02:34:51.602 --> 02:34:53.503]  I'm really impressed with these filmmakers.
[02:34:53.503 --> 02:35:01.706]  Get Fall of the Republic half price, get t-shirts for free when you order videos, a bunch of specials, get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:35:02.867 --> 02:35:12.656]  Get a trial membership, watch the live radio show in living color, download all my films in super high quality, burn them to disk, give them to people to play on their computers and TVs and most DVD players.
[02:35:12.656 --> 02:35:14.798]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:14.798 --> 02:35:16.620]  Now, we've got
[02:35:18.450 --> 02:35:20.072]  Haiti, and that's coming up next hour.
[02:35:20.072 --> 02:35:24.357]  We've got the key election in Massachusetts today, and what that means.
[02:35:24.357 --> 02:35:29.743]  Democrats revolting against Ted Kennedy's seat, showing how angry people are at Obama.
[02:35:29.743 --> 02:35:31.665]  That's why they're sprinting to the finish line.
[02:35:31.665 --> 02:35:35.309]  He knows he's got the lowest approval rating of any president one year in in history.
[02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:36.290]  They know they're hated.
[02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:40.853]  That's why they want open amnesty for the open borders to overrun us and further bankrupt us.
[02:35:40.853 --> 02:35:43.735]  That's why they want to pass all these gun bills they've got in Congress.
[02:35:43.735 --> 02:35:49.359]  That's why they want to extra-judicially say no-buy, no-fly, put gun owners on a no-fly list.
[02:35:49.359 --> 02:35:54.082]  And that's why the BATF's shutting down gun shops, gun shows, harassing everybody.
[02:35:54.082 --> 02:35:57.764]  Nickel and diamond, don't cross a T, dot an I, shut you down.
[02:35:57.764 --> 02:36:05.910]  That's why they're stinging and doing fake setups and fake arrests and arresting people and SWAT teaming people for arsenals, which aren't even illegal, you know, having more than 10 guns.
[02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:11.214]  They are coming after your guns right now at the regulatory and state level.
[02:36:11.214 --> 02:36:16.999]  And covertly in Texas, they've now shut down the gun show that's been here for close to 20 years.
[02:36:16.999 --> 02:36:18.480]  They ran out the last operator.
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:19.681]  The new one came in.
[02:36:19.681 --> 02:36:23.404]  They said, you'll tell people no private sales here or we're going to shut you down.
[02:36:23.404 --> 02:36:26.787]  They went to the landlord and got it shut down today.
[02:36:26.787 --> 02:36:29.430]  No more gun show where it's been for close to 20 years.
[02:36:29.430 --> 02:36:31.351]  I say close since since college, 16, 17, 18, 1992.
[02:36:34.714 --> 02:36:35.976]  I have been going to that gun show.
[02:36:35.976 --> 02:36:36.957]  Gone!
[02:36:36.957 --> 02:36:37.899]  Gone!
[02:36:37.899 --> 02:36:48.333]  They went outside the courts, outside the law, and said no more gun show and H-E-B, the big food chain that owns that warehouse building, it's over.
[02:36:48.333 --> 02:36:49.734]  Unless we stand up and say no.
[02:36:51.124 --> 02:36:58.369]  The owner of the Texas Gun Show, Darwin Bedecker, online with us, and I want him to pop in in this next 25 minutes.
[02:36:58.369 --> 02:37:06.835]  We've got with Aaron Zellman, founder of the most hardcore, true, strong Second Amendment group, Jews of Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[02:37:06.835 --> 02:37:08.877]  The big group, of course, is Gun Owners of America.
[02:37:08.877 --> 02:37:09.878]  They both work together.
[02:37:09.878 --> 02:37:12.840]  The NRA, at the leadership level, is a shill op.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:13.780]  That's been proven.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:16.262]  They supported the 68 Gun Control Act, you name it.
[02:37:16.262 --> 02:37:16.903]  Aaron Zellman,
[02:37:17.803 --> 02:37:22.166]  I've got reports here in Tennessee trying to ban gun shows, all these other states.
[02:37:22.166 --> 02:37:28.169]  Obama is clearly behind this and we have our headline on this here.
[02:37:28.169 --> 02:37:32.552]  Obama administration shuts down oldest gun show in Central Texas.
[02:37:32.552 --> 02:37:36.615]  Now you're a real expert on this more than I because you only focus on this issue.
[02:37:36.615 --> 02:37:42.158]  Am I right in saying this is a new level of tyranny to shut down a gun show and is racketeering?
[02:37:43.638 --> 02:37:46.641]  Actually, it's an old level of tyranny.
[02:37:46.641 --> 02:37:57.892]  In other words, the government, for the last 100 years, if you think about every genocide that's happened in the last 100 years, they've all been preceded by gun control schemes.
[02:37:57.892 --> 02:37:58.733]  So there's nothing new.
[02:37:58.733 --> 02:38:07.602]  I mean, Obama has gone to the same dictator school as all the other clowns have, and all the other murderers, you know, the Pol Pots, the Stalins, the Hitlers.
[02:38:08.331 --> 02:38:09.952]  And he's learned, he's learned very well.
[02:38:09.952 --> 02:38:13.093]  Well, this was Hitler's specialty, studying Hitler.
[02:38:13.093 --> 02:38:20.236]  He would, you know, the first five or six years in power, he did it all outside the law with just thugs.
[02:38:20.236 --> 02:38:24.458]  Well, let's explain that and the ATF criminals.
[02:38:24.458 --> 02:38:27.259]  Or I have a name, I call them Obama's bastards.
[02:38:27.259 --> 02:38:32.601]  And I think people need to give us some very serious thought as to what these people are really all about.
[02:38:34.687 --> 02:38:42.394]  Well, seeing this case confirmed now, the local news is covering it, I mean, the police just come in secretly and just shut you down?
[02:38:42.394 --> 02:38:44.676]  No law, no nothing?
[02:38:44.676 --> 02:38:46.557]  Well, it's because the people have tolerated it.
[02:38:46.557 --> 02:38:53.203]  I mean, the chief of police of that police force needs to have his life changed dramatically.
[02:38:53.203 --> 02:38:55.886]  His personal life has become very public.
[02:38:55.886 --> 02:38:58.508]  That's been very effective here in Milwaukee.
[02:38:58.508 --> 02:39:01.831]  They've got a chief up here, his name is Ed Flynn, who can't keep his zippers zipped.
[02:39:02.523 --> 02:39:07.486]  I remember when there was an internal city operation stealing old people's homes that were on lucrative property.
[02:39:24.093 --> 02:39:26.214]  Well, I'm not condemning the police.
[02:39:26.214 --> 02:39:27.654]  I'm just talking about the Chief of Police.
[02:39:27.654 --> 02:39:30.095]  The Chief of Police is no longer a peace officer.
[02:39:30.095 --> 02:39:30.695]  He's become a politician.
[02:39:52.322 --> 02:39:56.123]  Who could easily be bribed by other politicians.
[02:39:56.123 --> 02:40:00.925]  Well, looking at this case specifically, I've had some constitutional law scholars on, I've researched it.
[02:40:00.925 --> 02:40:08.808]  I mean, this is blatantly illegal to have secret police running around getting people's leases pulled and threatening them and stuff.
[02:40:08.808 --> 02:40:18.811]  Well, I think that there's an act of desperation going on in America, and I think that some of these folks who are trying to destroy America fear for their own safety.
[02:40:19.457 --> 02:40:26.299]  And they fear that they're going to fail at their goal to bring America under their heel.
[02:40:26.299 --> 02:40:31.581]  There's no other excuse for what's going on.
[02:40:31.581 --> 02:40:41.564]  And as we all know, the history of gun control has made it very possible for dictators to target people they don't like and then ultimately murder them.
[02:40:41.564 --> 02:40:43.485]  But there's one other thing I would suggest that people do.
[02:40:44.765 --> 02:40:50.190]  You know, we have a free film on our website, Alex, it's called No Guns for Negroes.
[02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:56.315]  And I think that it shows that it's a documentary about the racist roots of America's gun control laws.
[02:40:56.315 --> 02:41:06.023]  I think people need to start showing the racism that is so perverse throughout the federal government, especially the ATF.
[02:41:06.023 --> 02:41:09.266]  People need to see these jack-buddha thugs as a bunch of damn racists.
[02:41:09.824 --> 02:41:13.548]  Well, the federal government operates as if blacks aren't allowed to own guns.
[02:41:13.548 --> 02:41:26.420]  I mean, with knock-and-talk going on in Texas and everywhere else where they come and knock and want to inspect your guns with no warrant, no probable cause, door-to-door, but in black areas of the country, it's been on the news, they just force their way in.
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:28.202]  Well, you see, but you have to understand something.
[02:41:29.125 --> 02:41:33.648]  This film covers about 100 years ago in Georgia where the U.S.
[02:41:33.648 --> 02:41:37.691]  military was going door-to-door taking guns from blacks.
[02:41:37.691 --> 02:41:39.733]  That's being talked about today in America.
[02:41:39.733 --> 02:41:51.661]  So that's why I encourage people to watch this film because it will give them a history lesson that they can share with others and give all the other gun owners in Texas a good poke in the ribs and tell them to wake up as to what's going on.
[02:41:51.661 --> 02:41:57.325]  You know, the one thing a government fears is an armed citizenry that's ready to rebel.
[02:41:58.775 --> 02:42:03.276]  Or else they wouldn't be so darn concerned about gun control.
[02:42:03.276 --> 02:42:12.239]  So again, if I can encourage people to come watch the free film, No Guns for Negroes at JPFO.org, and you're certainly free to put it on your site if you want, Alex.
[02:42:12.239 --> 02:42:12.759]  Sure!
[02:42:12.759 --> 02:42:27.904]  In other words, we need to get people watching this and learning more about the racist roots of America's gun control laws, the danger of gun control, and also that film shows, it gives more details about the
[02:42:28.934 --> 02:42:29.755]  I want you to tell... No, we do!
[02:42:50.643 --> 02:42:51.964]  Well, there's no longer any denial.
[02:42:51.964 --> 02:42:53.906]  We have most of the czars in the White House.
[02:42:53.906 --> 02:42:57.370]  We have the Attorney General arguing in federal court in D.C.
[02:42:57.370 --> 02:43:01.854]  a year and a half ago that he believes in a total abolition of Second Amendment ownership.
[02:43:01.854 --> 02:43:04.557]  And then they try this double game of saying, we don't want your guns.
[02:43:04.557 --> 02:43:05.678]  We don't want your guns.
[02:43:05.678 --> 02:43:09.081]  We just want to legally restrict them, which means total ban.
[02:43:09.081 --> 02:43:10.923]  Now they've got all the bills introduced.
[02:43:10.923 --> 02:43:11.804]  And I agree with you, though.
[02:43:11.804 --> 02:43:14.226]  They're getting desperate because the national polls show
[02:43:15.396 --> 02:43:19.557]  Well again, I think we need to make personal lives very public for those people who have a hand in this.
[02:43:38.755 --> 02:43:42.477]  I want you to talk to the gun show operator, who's now, they've just totally cancelled it.
[02:43:42.477 --> 02:43:48.499]  They just say, sorry, it's over, the police say, the BATF says, they're God, and why they're so bold.
[02:43:48.499 --> 02:43:59.444]  But briefly, you have great little comic books for kids that explain the Second Amendment, and you tell the story in there, people can look up, of Athens, Tennessee, the Battle of Athens.
[02:43:59.444 --> 02:44:02.245]  Yes, it's funny you bring that up.
[02:44:02.245 --> 02:44:04.766]  It seems like a lot of people want to forget it, but I don't.
[02:44:05.610 --> 02:44:18.399]  Right after World War II, American veterans who had been living in Tennessee before they went into the war came back to Athens, Tennessee, which is in McMinn County, Tennessee.
[02:44:18.399 --> 02:44:32.549]  And their families had been writing to them about the jackbooted thugs who had become the political machine, who were destroying people's freedom, who were locking people up on false charges, who were denying the vote to people.
[02:44:36.944 --> 02:44:42.345]  The veterans decided to get together and they started their own political party called the G.I.
[02:44:42.345 --> 02:44:43.785]  Party.
[02:44:43.785 --> 02:44:44.506]  And the G.I.
[02:44:44.506 --> 02:44:49.326]  Party challenged the existing political machine.
[02:44:49.326 --> 02:45:02.709]  And it was quite a day for voting because the political machine went in and stole the ballot boxes, even shot a poll watcher in trying to tell the people, we're going to have fair elections.
[02:45:02.709 --> 02:45:03.849]  You can't trust the G.I.
[02:45:03.849 --> 02:45:04.169]  Party.
[02:45:05.003 --> 02:45:15.869]  Turns out the criminals from the political machine held up in the sheriff's jail, and what ensued after that was the G.I.
[02:45:15.869 --> 02:45:23.773]  party getting together other G.I.s who had experience in explosives, blowing the door off the jail.
[02:45:23.773 --> 02:45:30.736]  An eight-hour shootout with the sheriff and his thugs, same thing as your police chief and his thugs.
[02:45:32.899 --> 02:45:34.560]  They all surrendered, and finally the G.I.
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:43.326]  Party took over the political system, and they brought some justice back to McMinn County, to Athens, Tennessee.
[02:45:43.326 --> 02:45:52.312]  The entire story of the Battle of Athens, Tennessee is on our website at JPFO.org, and there's not only our article, but other articles that appeared in other publications.
[02:45:55.498 --> 02:46:02.841]  And notice when people stood up, the state didn't come in and arrest them, because it was a citizen's arrest of an unlawful criminal government.
[02:46:02.841 --> 02:46:08.923]  Well, in fact, the criminal politicians called the governor asking him to send in the National Guard.
[02:46:08.923 --> 02:46:19.566]  And the governor, of course, wasn't about to send in the National Guard to shoot it out with veterans, who had just returned from World War II.
[02:46:19.566 --> 02:46:24.268]  So the government told them, the governor said, sorry guys, you're on your own here.
[02:46:25.146 --> 02:46:27.688]  And they were booted out of office.
[02:46:27.688 --> 02:46:28.669]  And, of course, the G.I.
[02:46:28.669 --> 02:46:30.671]  Party took over.
[02:46:30.671 --> 02:46:42.642]  But that was back when this country was once free because men who weren't looking for trouble wouldn't let their children be slaves.
[02:46:42.642 --> 02:46:46.486]  How have we gotten this attitude of being slaves?
[02:46:46.486 --> 02:46:47.587]  I mean, how did we turn into this?
[02:46:49.417 --> 02:47:04.241]  Well, I'm not sure I have the total answer, Alex, but a lot of it has to do with people just getting fat, dumb, and happy, and not paying attention to the lack of knowledge that should be distributed in the public school system.
[02:47:04.241 --> 02:47:15.884]  And we've raised two generations of people who really don't appreciate the history of America and the blood and guts that's been spilled to make America, America.
[02:47:16.943 --> 02:47:17.643]  We're good to go.
[02:47:32.754 --> 02:47:45.720]  Aaron Zellman, I want to shift gears and talk to Darwin Bedecker, who operates the show and has now his livelihood destroyed just because the police say so and the BATF and Obama say so.
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:52.163]  Any comments or advice you've got for Darwin, who's online with us right now?
[02:47:52.163 --> 02:47:55.325]  Well, Darwin, I think that you've got to stand tall.
[02:47:55.325 --> 02:47:58.547]  You've got to really tell others about the situation.
[02:47:58.547 --> 02:48:01.148]  You've got to create a grassroots fire.
[02:48:01.846 --> 02:48:06.230]  You know, Obama calls us bitter clingers, because we cling to our Bibles, which is
[02:48:24.514 --> 02:48:26.435]  I mean, moral and our guns.
[02:48:26.435 --> 02:48:27.996]  Well, that's really your freedom.
[02:48:27.996 --> 02:48:31.338]  Your freedom of religion, your freedom of speech, your freedom to defend yourself.
[02:48:31.338 --> 02:48:33.139]  Of course we cling to it.
[02:48:33.139 --> 02:48:35.741]  It's all we've got left in America.
[02:48:35.741 --> 02:48:39.303]  Well, I think those are the three things that are worth fighting for.
[02:48:39.303 --> 02:48:52.712]  And I think that, you know, as we say at JPFO, the time has come in America for people to decide if they are willing to live by God's law, where human beings are commanded to defend their lives and help others,
[02:48:53.647 --> 02:49:01.534]  Or, if we're now ready to die, from man's law, and have no freedom at all.
[02:49:01.534 --> 02:49:05.918]  But that's what George Washington said... In God's law, and man's law.
[02:49:05.918 --> 02:49:08.700]  Well, that's what George... Still is thought amongst people.
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:11.602]  Well, that's what George Washington said over and over again.
[02:49:11.602 --> 02:49:13.023]  He said, look, this is tyranny.
[02:49:13.023 --> 02:49:16.286]  I'm not going to live on my knees as a slave.
[02:49:16.286 --> 02:49:21.831]  Well, apparently you've got some folks in Texas and gun owners throughout America that don't seem to give a damn.
[02:49:24.253 --> 02:49:28.696]  You gotta find out why.
[02:49:28.696 --> 02:49:31.618]  Absolutely.
[02:49:31.618 --> 02:49:38.544]  I mean, the flood of emails that we've gotten in, you know, in the last 24 hours is astounding.
[02:49:38.544 --> 02:49:43.727]  Everything from, you know, we support you to, we'll drive from Nebraska to come to your next show.
[02:49:43.727 --> 02:49:46.890]  I mean, the support is definitely out there.
[02:49:47.905 --> 02:49:51.669]  And, uh, I just, you know, I hope people keep on spending that kind.
[02:49:51.669 --> 02:49:52.970]  But now there's no show.
[02:49:52.970 --> 02:49:56.293]  See, first they said no private sales of guns or we'll shut your show down.
[02:49:56.293 --> 02:49:58.415]  And now they just say it's just shut down.
[02:49:58.415 --> 02:50:06.803]  I mean, that is so illegal to have the police go tell the landlord, don't put them in there for no reason.
[02:50:06.803 --> 02:50:12.408]  Well, I think what you've got to do is make sure that the kind of PR you think you're going to get, uh,
[02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:20.134]  Aaron, what were you saying?
[02:50:20.134 --> 02:50:28.640]  Well, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I think that at this point, you've got to find some gun owners who are going to stand tall and go pay the mayor a visit.
[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:34.344]  Tell them that we have to get rid of this police chief before sunset today.
[02:50:34.344 --> 02:50:38.787]  He will no longer be tolerated, and neither will you, mayor.
[02:50:38.787 --> 02:50:40.628]  He's not gone by sunset today.
[02:50:42.631 --> 02:50:47.692]  But you've got to get lots of gun owners knocking on the mayor's door.
[02:50:47.692 --> 02:51:00.796]  You've got to go beyond the chief of police, and you've got to make it very clear that anybody, by the way, who's promoting this secessionist movement in Texas, if they're not behind this effort, shame on them.
[02:51:00.796 --> 02:51:01.156]  Stay there.
[02:51:01.738 --> 02:51:03.539]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[02:51:03.539 --> 02:51:05.361]  You may have storable food questions.
[02:51:05.361 --> 02:51:10.225]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[02:51:10.225 --> 02:51:12.006]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:51:12.006 --> 02:51:14.428]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.

[02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:06.632]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.632 --> 02:52:09.894]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.894 --> 02:52:14.697]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.697 --> 02:52:18.540]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[02:52:19.170 --> 02:52:21.052]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.052 --> 02:52:26.617]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.617 --> 02:52:36.365]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.365 --> 02:52:38.727]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.727 --> 02:52:40.329]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.329 --> 02:52:42.531]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.751 --> 02:52:47.137]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:52:47.137 --> 02:52:50.041]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.041 --> 02:52:59.153]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:53:01.072 --> 02:53:04.857]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[02:53:04.857 --> 02:53:15.010]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[02:53:15.010 --> 02:53:16.953]  There is a solution that doesn't involve
[02:53:17.193 --> 02:53:17.573]  I think so.
[02:53:36.764 --> 02:53:47.229]  Heart and Body Extract has a 23-year proven track record of using certified organic herbs that make up an excellent formula to balance and support the heart and circulatory system.

[02:54:05.845 --> 02:54:08.047]  I know police chief Art Acevedo.
[02:54:08.047 --> 02:54:10.931]  He's one of the few police chiefs that actually comes and sits in the studio.
[02:54:10.931 --> 02:54:13.013]  It normally takes about a month to get him in here.
[02:54:13.013 --> 02:54:17.738]  I wanted to get him in here about laws about texting or even looking at your cell phone.
[02:54:17.738 --> 02:54:19.419]  You get a $500 fine.
[02:54:19.419 --> 02:54:24.185]  Not about safety, about money, but that's a legislature issue, not him.
[02:54:24.185 --> 02:54:26.247]  And so I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[02:54:27.349 --> 02:54:32.590]  Because he may not have known that the BATF and the Special Gun Unit were having the detectives do this.
[02:54:32.590 --> 02:54:33.911]  It's a big department.
[02:54:33.911 --> 02:54:41.713]  But if he defends this, or doesn't do something about this, we do have a major problem politically, and people should be at the City Council regardless.
[02:54:41.713 --> 02:54:46.734]  There needs to be an investigation, and not by the police department, because this is outrageous.
[02:54:46.734 --> 02:54:47.995]  I mean, if the police can come and just
[02:54:48.876 --> 02:54:54.044]  You know, paint something on your front door of your business and say, nobody can shop here anymore.
[02:54:54.044 --> 02:54:56.148]  That is effectively what happened here.
[02:54:56.148 --> 02:55:00.495]  And I have to use the Nazi Germany analogy because the Soviets did the same thing.
[02:55:02.113 --> 02:55:05.354]  And we have to resist what they're doing.
[02:55:05.354 --> 02:55:10.837]  Going back to Darwin Bedecker and Aaron Zellman of JPFO.org.
[02:55:10.837 --> 02:55:12.297]  Gentlemen, other points?
[02:55:12.297 --> 02:55:16.119]  Other things you'd like to add to this, Darwin?
[02:55:16.119 --> 02:55:21.381]  Other things you want to air or say on air, Aaron Zellman?
[02:55:21.381 --> 02:55:31.705]  Well, I think that again, you know, we have to find some serious gut owners in the state of Texas who are going to say no to this.
[02:55:33.567 --> 02:55:35.368]  They're going to stand tall.
[02:55:35.368 --> 02:55:37.749]  The emails are fine.
[02:55:37.749 --> 02:55:42.852]  It's nice to have some encouragement, but boots on the ground really makes the difference.
[02:55:44.059 --> 02:55:48.121]  Yeah, we need people to go to their city council people's office and say, I want a meeting with you.
[02:55:48.121 --> 02:56:03.447]  We need the state attorney general, who I'm told is already looking into this, to come down to Austin and say, look, you know, cities can't, folks, if you don't follow the state law, which they've broken here, and you get cities where boss hogs make themselves king.
[02:56:03.447 --> 02:56:07.249]  I mean, this, we've seen this over and over again, Aaron Zellman.
[02:56:07.249 --> 02:56:10.070]  Well, yes, we have, and it's been a nasty result.
[02:56:10.985 --> 02:56:20.956]  So I think that it's important that, again, that people realize that, you know, that you just can't tolerate this type of evil, because it's just like a cancer.
[02:56:20.956 --> 02:56:22.417]  It spreads.
[02:56:22.417 --> 02:56:26.742]  The whole Obama administration, their whole agenda,
[02:56:28.558 --> 02:56:29.579]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:56:29.579 --> 02:56:31.641]  This is Obama, admitted.
[02:56:31.641 --> 02:56:37.245]  We found out he's doing this all over the country, covertly sending feds in to shut down gun shows illegally.
[02:56:37.245 --> 02:56:42.410]  I mean, Obama and the government, the federal government, they are the real criminals.
[02:56:42.410 --> 02:56:49.996]  Well, I think that's another reason why people should be using our free film, No Guns for Negroes, because we have to show what a fraud and a hypocrite the man is.
[02:56:49.996 --> 02:56:56.962]  You know, we have to show that he will sell out his own people, so he certainly doesn't give a damn about anybody else.
[02:56:58.718 --> 02:57:01.180]  People have to see this guy for what he really is.
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:06.643]  We will post No Guns for Negroes, The History of Racism and Gun Control on Infowars.com.
[02:57:06.643 --> 02:57:07.423]  Guys, send it to Kurt.
[02:57:07.423 --> 02:57:08.084]  Let's get that up.
[02:57:08.084 --> 02:57:09.564]  You too.
[02:57:09.564 --> 02:57:10.285]  Absolutely.
[02:57:10.285 --> 02:57:12.486]  And of course JPFO.org.
[02:57:12.486 --> 02:57:15.868]  Going back to Darwin.
[02:57:15.868 --> 02:57:20.691]  Darwin, people are also now calling for a boycott of HEB.
[02:57:20.691 --> 02:57:22.612]  They're saying, how dare you even complain?
[02:57:22.612 --> 02:57:25.093]  We hadn't blamed HEB for this.
[02:57:25.093 --> 02:57:27.575]  I mean, do you think HEB should be held accountable as well?
[02:57:29.033 --> 02:57:36.575]  I think definitely the gentleman they sent to the meeting should be held accountable for his action.
[02:57:36.575 --> 02:57:53.800]  The only thing I would like to say is if we're not able to get a show back in the same building that we've always been in, if anybody out there knows of any facility where we can have a show in February, we've got to find someplace to have a show because if we don't, they win.
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:57.141]  I'm to the point where I'm not going to allow that to happen.
[02:57:57.141 --> 02:57:58.281]  I have a quick question, guys.
[02:57:59.136 --> 02:58:00.738]  What about the Sheriff?
[02:58:00.738 --> 02:58:05.202]  What role is the Sheriff playing in all of this?
[02:58:05.202 --> 02:58:13.850]  I mean, people are supposed to come to the Sheriff, right?
[02:58:13.850 --> 02:58:15.651]  To do something like this?
[02:58:15.651 --> 02:58:17.513]  They're in his county?
[02:58:17.513 --> 02:58:21.257]  I mean, the Sheriff needs to have his personal life made very public.
[02:58:21.257 --> 02:58:23.599]  And we need to find out what's really going on here.
[02:58:23.599 --> 02:58:24.900]  Because something really stinks.
[02:58:25.509 --> 02:58:28.931]  Darwin Bedecker, we'll talk to you as this develops and unfolds.
[02:58:28.931 --> 02:58:30.491]  I appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:58:30.491 --> 02:58:31.592]  We're standing right beside you.
[02:58:31.592 --> 02:58:36.574]  I appreciate you and your fans and your group of people helping me out with this.
[02:58:36.574 --> 02:58:37.294]  You bet.
[02:58:37.294 --> 02:58:37.695]  Thank you.
[02:58:37.695 --> 02:58:43.297]  We're going to come back in five more minutes with Erin Zellman.
[02:58:43.297 --> 02:58:45.918]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.918 --> 02:58:48.860]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.141 --> 02:58:55.703]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.703 --> 02:58:56.603]  Number one.
[02:58:56.603 --> 02:59:00.025]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.025 --> 02:59:00.885]  Number two.
[02:59:00.885 --> 02:59:05.787]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.787 --> 02:59:06.528]  It's true.
[02:59:06.528 --> 02:59:11.390]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.390 --> 02:59:11.910]  Number three.
[02:59:12.210 --> 02:59:15.793]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.793 --> 02:59:20.516]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.516 --> 02:59:23.279]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.279 --> 02:59:27.742]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.742 --> 02:59:31.885]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.885 --> 02:59:36.669]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.949 --> 02:59:41.112]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.112 --> 02:59:42.894]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.894 --> 02:59:45.156]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:45.156 --> 02:59:47.758]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:47.758 --> 02:59:49.139]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:49.139 --> 02:59:55.124]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:08.337 --> 03:00:12.142]  You know, I hope that Austin Police Chief Arne Seveda isn't behind this.
[03:00:12.142 --> 03:00:13.904]  He claims he's a conservative.
[03:00:13.904 --> 03:00:15.907]  He grew up in Communist Cuba.
[03:00:15.907 --> 03:00:17.709]  He's from Los Angeles.
[03:00:17.709 --> 03:00:21.013]  Highway patrol.
[03:00:21.013 --> 03:00:25.639]  I just wish we could have a Texan for our police chief, but I guess they won't do the types of things that the feds want.
[03:00:27.674 --> 03:00:41.817]  But we do need people to go to texasgunshows.net if you're constitutional lawyers, if you want to help file lawsuits on the BATF, on the Austin Police Department, on others, because this is a small family gun show.
[03:00:41.817 --> 03:00:42.997]  The big gun show pulled out.
[03:00:42.997 --> 03:00:47.198]  They were harassed after more than 15 years and run out of Austin.
[03:00:47.198 --> 03:00:49.919]  He took it over not knowing what he was walking into.
[03:00:49.919 --> 03:00:54.400]  And they said, look, you get out of town by sunset, boy, we run this town.
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:55.600]  Texans don't get guns.
[03:00:56.500 --> 03:01:00.124]  Our California boss is here.
[03:01:00.124 --> 03:01:03.668]  He rules now.
[03:01:03.668 --> 03:01:04.829]  I hope that's not the case.
[03:01:04.829 --> 03:01:06.771]  I hope we're not being run by Fidel Castro here.
[03:01:09.079 --> 03:01:14.363]  In the four minutes we've got left with Aaron Zellman, Aaron, the good news is this is a huge story.
[03:01:14.363 --> 03:01:16.524]  The news is now covering it today in Austin.
[03:01:16.524 --> 03:01:17.865]  People are upset.
[03:01:17.865 --> 03:01:19.987]  People couldn't believe it at first.
[03:01:19.987 --> 03:01:24.670]  When we first broke this on Sunday and then Monday, they thought we were making it up.
[03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:26.111]  Now it's admitted to be real.
[03:01:26.111 --> 03:01:26.931]  People are shocked.
[03:01:28.212 --> 03:01:31.693]  Americans are just so shocked by the level of tyranny.
[03:01:31.693 --> 03:01:36.413]  Like the Obama administration cast Sunstein saying they're going to restrict free speech and take over the web.
[03:01:36.413 --> 03:01:37.734]  Or that we have no right to own guns.
[03:01:37.734 --> 03:01:42.334]  I think people have trouble believing this is really happening.
[03:01:42.334 --> 03:01:44.855]  Well, they better get over the trouble part.
[03:01:44.855 --> 03:01:45.955]  They better believe.
[03:01:45.955 --> 03:01:51.536]  Because this is what the Obama administration has brought to America.
[03:01:51.536 --> 03:01:53.296]  That is pure tyranny.
[03:01:53.296 --> 03:01:55.297]  A hatred for freedom.
[03:01:55.297 --> 03:01:56.897]  You have to wonder just who he's
[03:01:58.143 --> 03:02:01.924]  He's a puppet on a string and he's pulling the strings with this guy.
[03:02:01.924 --> 03:02:07.525]  You really have to start asking some deep questions about this.
[03:02:07.525 --> 03:02:17.848]  Well, it's so unconstitutional to have the feds come in and then engage in not just unconstitutional, but illegal activities like this.
[03:02:17.848 --> 03:02:20.048]  I mean, this is illegal.
[03:02:20.048 --> 03:02:26.430]  Well, the one interesting thing that I'd like people to follow is that, you know, there is the McDonald v. Chicago case.
[03:02:27.378 --> 03:02:31.499]  The arguments are supposed to start March 2nd at the Supreme Court.
[03:02:31.499 --> 03:02:36.141]  And where that would just about abolish all local gun control laws.
[03:02:36.141 --> 03:02:37.821]  If it's passed.
[03:02:37.821 --> 03:02:40.422]  And so I would encourage people to follow that case.
[03:02:40.422 --> 03:02:44.803]  And on our website we do have a brief that JPFO filed.
[03:02:44.803 --> 03:02:46.344]  An Amicus Curie brief.
[03:02:46.344 --> 03:02:48.224]  Briefly tell folks about that case.
[03:02:48.224 --> 03:02:49.385]  Briefly.
[03:02:49.385 --> 03:02:51.845]  Well briefly, it's about the city of Chicago.
[03:02:51.845 --> 03:02:54.026]  There's an elderly man there named McDonald.
[03:02:54.713 --> 03:02:56.134]  He lives in a high-crime area.
[03:02:56.134 --> 03:02:58.915]  He wanted to own a handgun to defend his life.
[03:02:58.915 --> 03:03:01.657]  The city of Chicago said, no, you can't do that.
[03:03:01.657 --> 03:03:05.819]  They've been saying no to people for a long time about the ownership of handguns.
[03:03:05.819 --> 03:03:10.042]  So the case found its way to the Supreme Court.
[03:03:10.042 --> 03:03:19.307]  And so now the Supreme Court's going to be asked to see if the Second Amendment also has the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment to make sure that
[03:03:20.239 --> 03:03:23.581]  People have the right to defend their lives.
[03:03:23.581 --> 03:03:26.523]  Sounds silly, but that's what this case is about.
[03:03:26.523 --> 03:03:29.786]  The people have a right, don't gun, to defend their lives.
[03:03:29.786 --> 03:03:32.748]  How about we take the police guns in Chicago?
[03:03:32.748 --> 03:03:36.610]  Oh no, they've got to protect themselves, but we can't protect ourselves.
[03:03:36.610 --> 03:03:38.972]  Well, that's pretty much what it boils down to.
[03:03:38.972 --> 03:03:41.294]  That's why this case is very important.
[03:03:41.294 --> 03:03:46.057]  Again, I would encourage people to come to our website, JPFO.org, and they can read the case.
[03:03:46.057 --> 03:03:48.759]  They can download the file and share it with others.
[03:03:49.898 --> 03:03:54.880]  The people need to start paying real close attention to this case.
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:58.541]  The Obama administration is absolutely opposed to it.
[03:03:58.541 --> 03:04:04.184]  It'll take power away from those who hate the Second Amendment.
[03:04:04.184 --> 03:04:07.525]  Aaron Zellman in closing with about 45 seconds.
[03:04:07.525 --> 03:04:11.967]  It does seem to me though that we are starting to gain ground and that they are panicked.
[03:04:11.967 --> 03:04:13.167]  Do you agree?
[03:04:13.167 --> 03:04:14.428]  Oh I think absolutely.
[03:04:14.428 --> 03:04:15.528]  I mean if you look at some of the
[03:04:16.497 --> 03:04:19.539]  The people have been going to these Tea Parties.
[03:04:19.539 --> 03:04:22.282]  They're going to be people from all walks of life.
[03:04:22.282 --> 03:04:25.224]  Even people who previously voted for Obama.
[03:04:25.224 --> 03:04:26.365]  This has got them concerned.
[03:04:26.365 --> 03:04:29.607]  Even though there's problems going on within the Tea Party, I understand that.
[03:04:29.607 --> 03:04:32.649]  But people from all walks of life are saying, wait a minute.
[03:04:32.649 --> 03:04:35.411]  This is not what I want in my government.
[03:04:35.411 --> 03:04:36.993]  I don't want to lose my freedom.
[03:04:36.993 --> 03:04:38.534]  I don't want more taxes.
[03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:40.875]  I don't want restrictions on my rights.
[03:04:40.875 --> 03:04:43.978]  That's probably why gun sales are roaring away.
[03:04:46.027 --> 03:04:47.349]  Record highs.
[03:04:47.349 --> 03:04:54.478]  People don't intend to give those guns back to the government.
[03:04:54.478 --> 03:04:55.659]  That's not their intention.
[03:04:55.659 --> 03:04:58.403]  That's not why they're buying them.
[03:04:58.403 --> 03:04:59.945]  Stay there, I've got one more question.
[03:05:02.981 --> 03:05:06.942]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:06.942 --> 03:05:15.803]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:05:15.803 --> 03:05:20.424]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:05:20.424 --> 03:05:31.246]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:05:31.886 --> 03:05:41.389]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:41.389 --> 03:05:46.831]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:05:46.831 --> 03:05:54.314]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:54.314 --> 03:05:57.075]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:06:02.190 --> 03:06:06.191]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:06.191 --> 03:06:09.432]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.432 --> 03:06:14.233]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:06:14.233 --> 03:06:20.635]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:20.635 --> 03:06:22.856]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.396 --> 03:06:23.716]  Tim Geithner?
[03:06:23.716 --> 03:06:24.217]  Bernanke?
[03:06:24.217 --> 03:06:24.737]  They're arsonists!
[03:06:24.737 --> 03:06:25.557]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:25.557 --> 03:06:27.679]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:42.307 --> 03:06:44.448]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:44.448 --> 03:06:49.589]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:49.589 --> 03:06:58.692]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:03.380]  Hi, neighbor.
[03:07:03.380 --> 03:07:06.681]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[03:07:06.681 --> 03:07:11.963]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[03:07:11.963 --> 03:07:17.705]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[03:07:17.705 --> 03:07:25.307]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[03:07:25.307 --> 03:07:30.209]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[03:07:30.829 --> 03:07:38.654]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[03:07:38.654 --> 03:07:43.097]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[03:07:43.097 --> 03:07:44.077]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:07:44.077 --> 03:07:44.137]  800-409-5633.
[03:07:44.137 --> 03:07:45.138]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:07:45.138 --> 03:07:45.338]  Who am I?
[03:07:45.338 --> 03:07:45.899]  Someone who cares.
[03:08:02.978 --> 03:08:09.625]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.625 --> 03:08:13.950]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:17.174]  All right, I'm going to get more into Haiti.
[03:08:17.174 --> 03:08:19.596]  First, I'm going to cover the amazing Senate battle.
[03:08:19.596 --> 03:08:21.498]  Heads of the finish line in Massachusetts.
[03:08:22.734 --> 03:08:41.605]  And you look at this, Aaron Zellman, this is a real indicator that a seat that's never gone to a Republican, Ted Kennedy's seat, and even the brainwashed people in that state have finally woken up and are about to vote for a supposedly somewhat more pro-gun Republican.
[03:08:41.605 --> 03:08:45.107]  This is a true rebuke of Obama, but he doesn't care.
[03:08:45.107 --> 03:08:48.669]  He's running to the finish line, but I wanted to talk to you about the fact that
[03:08:49.574 --> 03:09:02.563]  The federal government and NORTHCOM and Homeland Security, in those MIAC reports and Homeland Security reports that we got, that we released last year, that the police gave us, say their number one enemy is gun owners.
[03:09:02.563 --> 03:09:11.089]  And that Homeland Security is set up for veterans, libertarians, constitutionalists, people that aren't going to go along with this.
[03:09:11.089 --> 03:09:17.013]  And, you know, the government is hell-bent on getting our guns one way or the other, and it is coming to a confrontation.
[03:09:17.013 --> 03:09:18.615]  And let's not forget, our country started
[03:09:19.375 --> 03:09:28.082]  There were a lot of taxes and corruption and problems, but it finally started at Lexington and Concord when the Redcoats came to take the guns.
[03:09:28.082 --> 03:09:35.308]  And unfortunately, for the people that try to enforce this, I think they take our restraint as weakness.
[03:09:35.308 --> 03:09:43.274]  They don't understand there's a lot of veterans and people that are just hoping they don't have to, but they are ready.
[03:09:43.274 --> 03:09:45.496]  And this is really coming to a head, Aaron Zellman.
[03:09:47.658 --> 03:09:50.500]  Alex, what goes around comes around.
[03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:52.542]  And we're around.
[03:09:52.542 --> 03:09:57.525]  Back to where we started when we were dealing with the British.
[03:09:57.525 --> 03:09:59.787]  I would like to draw people's attention to something.
[03:09:59.787 --> 03:10:02.849]  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to all of your listeners.
[03:10:02.849 --> 03:10:05.651]  But we ran a poll on our website about, will the U.S.
[03:10:05.651 --> 03:10:10.655]  military confiscate guns from the American people?
[03:10:10.655 --> 03:10:13.537]  The results were astounding, and so were the comments.
[03:10:14.381 --> 03:10:16.162]  Almost 2,000 people voted.
[03:10:16.162 --> 03:10:24.566]  We have over 63 long comments from both veterans and non-veterans and active duty people.
[03:10:24.566 --> 03:10:26.086]  And let me just give you some numbers.
[03:10:26.086 --> 03:10:28.147]  This should shock people.
[03:10:28.147 --> 03:10:37.672]  Only 7% of the people who voted said that the government would not shoot Americans to take their guns.
[03:10:37.672 --> 03:10:37.972]  7%.
[03:10:37.972 --> 03:10:42.494]  21% said the government would absolutely use the military.
[03:10:43.055 --> 03:10:45.356]  To take people's guns.
[03:10:45.356 --> 03:10:50.057]  30% said that many of the military would follow orders to take people's guns.
[03:10:50.057 --> 03:10:52.657]  So I would encourage people to come take a look at this poll.
[03:10:52.657 --> 03:11:04.180]  Again, just go to the front page of JPFO.org and go down to right above the gun control genocide chart on the right-hand side of the JPFO poll.
[03:11:04.180 --> 03:11:09.982]  I would encourage people to take a, get a real reality lesson today about how dangerous
[03:11:10.635 --> 03:11:15.901]  The world is right now, or America is right now, for Americans.
[03:11:15.901 --> 03:11:18.785]  We're an endangered species in our own country.
[03:11:18.785 --> 03:11:21.288]  If the Abominoids have their way.
[03:11:24.901 --> 03:11:30.063]  Now, specifically, the reason people know the government will confiscate guns, take Katrina.
[03:11:30.063 --> 03:11:49.292]  The military comes in, the FBI commands the operation, they block the food aid, they block the police and others from Texas and volunteers that came to help, and then the first mission was go into all the high and dry wealthiest areas, put men in handcuffs, and take their guns like they were criminals with guns in their own house.
[03:11:49.292 --> 03:11:52.393]  That was illegal, and they never gave most of those guns back.
[03:11:52.933 --> 03:11:57.014]  Even when a federal court said, give them back, they said, we want your guns.
[03:11:57.014 --> 03:12:00.255]  I mean, they really want our guns.
[03:12:00.255 --> 03:12:01.015]  Well, absolutely.
[03:12:01.015 --> 03:12:09.817]  Again, you know, every dictator has learned that if you have an armed citizenry, you're not going to be able to accomplish your goal.
[03:12:09.817 --> 03:12:12.778]  I mean, this is a simple assault.
[03:12:12.778 --> 03:12:19.280]  And all these dictators over the last 100 years who disarmed people and then murdered them, known as genocide.
[03:12:19.918 --> 03:12:24.282]  They've all insisted that people must be disarmed first.
[03:12:24.282 --> 03:12:27.704]  And then what do the Abominoids have in mind for America?
[03:12:27.704 --> 03:12:34.069]  Why are Americans an endangered species in their own country?
[03:12:34.069 --> 03:12:38.693]  I mean, what is being planned?
[03:12:38.693 --> 03:12:44.698]  I think every one of your listeners better start asking some questions very loudly and demanding answers.
[03:12:44.698 --> 03:12:49.542]  If they can't get an answer from somebody, then why is that person allowed to stay in a position of authority?
[03:12:50.370 --> 03:12:51.750]  Well, we've gotten answers.
[03:12:51.750 --> 03:13:08.755]  I can't believe how the Attorney General, Obama, every one of his major czars we look at, get up on camera and say, there is no Second Amendment right, we are going to get your guns, they've introduced the bills, but then they try this psy-op of saying, we don't want your guns, to make everybody stand down.
[03:13:08.755 --> 03:13:10.456]  But it's obviously not working.
[03:13:10.456 --> 03:13:19.018]  We're a year and a half into the greatest gun sales the country's ever seen, people are snatching it all up, and saying... Well, that's scaring the daylights out of them, Alex.
[03:13:19.682 --> 03:13:20.303]  I don't think so.
[03:13:45.194 --> 03:13:59.552]  Aaron, in closing, let me ask you this question, because when you come on a few times a year and are gracious to spend your time with us, and I just love your organization and support it, I get emails asking me to ask you a question, and I've actually seen you write about it and speak about it a few other times.
[03:13:59.552 --> 03:14:01.734]  Why do we see the Israel lobby
[03:14:05.703 --> 03:14:19.184]  And so many Jewish members of Congress, being some of the most vehement anti-gun people, when they know what Stalin and Hitler and others did, and they know what happened, and they all have their own private bodyguards,
[03:14:20.966 --> 03:14:30.394]  Why do we see that from both Republican and Democrat Jewish leaders so often?
[03:14:30.394 --> 03:14:36.578]  Republicans being middle of the road or Democrats being vehemently anti-Second Amendment, pro-victim disarmament.
[03:14:36.578 --> 03:14:39.040]  Why is that going on?
[03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:45.545]  Well, I'm not sure I have the total answer, but there's a couple things that I can certainly highlight for you.
[03:14:45.545 --> 03:14:48.588]  Jewish members of Congress who do support gun control
[03:14:49.309 --> 03:14:52.350]  Are not very Jewish, for starters.
[03:14:52.350 --> 03:14:53.850]  People have to understand that.
[03:14:53.850 --> 03:15:02.652]  Jewish law demands that Jews are commanded by the Almighty to defend their lives and to defend the lives of those who are under attack.
[03:15:02.652 --> 03:15:12.094]  You can't very well defend someone's life, I mean, defend someone's life, and your own life, if you don't have the tools to do so.
[03:15:12.094 --> 03:15:17.416]  So Jews who pretend to be Jews are the ones who usually are supporting gun control schemes.
[03:15:17.416 --> 03:15:18.336]  That's point number one.
[03:15:19.113 --> 03:15:28.723]  Number two, I think that many of the alleged Jews in Congress who are supporting gun control schemes really don't understand the Bill of Rights.
[03:15:28.723 --> 03:15:30.144]  They don't appreciate America.
[03:15:30.144 --> 03:15:37.952]  And they're probably more concerned about being invited to cocktail parties than they are about preserving freedom in America.
[03:15:41.155 --> 03:15:43.237]  And it's also a lot of big city urban areas.
[03:15:43.237 --> 03:15:47.000]  I've noticed people from cities are generally so scared of guns.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:54.487]  I had a British interviewer from Chris Matthews here Sunday and I have a .357 Magnum.
[03:15:54.487 --> 03:15:58.210]  It's actually right over here that I have to protect myself if anybody ever comes into the office.
[03:15:59.150 --> 03:16:05.951]  And she started crying and looked scared and panicked in the middle of the interview, or near the end, and I said, what's wrong?
[03:16:05.951 --> 03:16:07.232]  And she said, is that a gun?
[03:16:07.232 --> 03:16:10.012]  And I said, well, yeah, I mean, we don't have police here.
[03:16:10.012 --> 03:16:13.773]  If somebody... People kill talk show hosts all the time or threaten them.
[03:16:13.773 --> 03:16:19.774]  Well, you know what you need to do with that woman is... We have an article on our website written by a psychiatrist.
[03:16:19.774 --> 03:16:22.535]  It's called Raging Against Self-Defense.
[03:16:22.535 --> 03:16:27.476]  And she points out the mental health problems that gun prohibitionists have.
[03:16:28.803 --> 03:16:37.068]  So again, I don't mean to sound so commercial with all these things on our site that are free, but people should come read the article, Raging Against Self-Defense Issues.
[03:16:37.068 --> 03:16:44.232]  No, no, people should visit the site, but expanding on that, literally she's looking in my eyes, talking to me, I see her look over,
[03:16:45.276 --> 03:16:53.582]  And then she, like a little girl who's seen a monster, started going, uh, uh, uh, uh, and tears came into her eyes, and she went, uh, and was like, is that a gun?
[03:16:53.582 --> 03:16:55.524]  And was panicking and shaking.
[03:16:55.524 --> 03:16:59.487]  And I said to her, but you feel safe when you see police with guns, don't you?
[03:16:59.487 --> 03:17:14.598]  And she said, well, part of her problem, Alex, may very well be, as we point out in this essay, Raging Against Self-Defense, is that she may not trust herself to own a gun because she may have so much inner hatred towards people that she doesn't trust you to own a gun.
[03:17:16.869 --> 03:17:23.006]  This is some of the problems that gun prohibitionists try to mask and try to take our guns from us.
[03:17:23.766 --> 03:17:27.608]  But it's so alien to this human common sense.
[03:17:27.608 --> 03:17:28.449]  I have an office.
[03:17:28.449 --> 03:17:30.090]  A few of my guys have concealed carries.
[03:17:30.090 --> 03:17:31.731]  They don't need that in Texas, but they've got them.
[03:17:31.731 --> 03:17:32.651]  I invite them.
[03:17:32.651 --> 03:17:34.372]  It's just in their fanny packs.
[03:17:34.372 --> 03:17:38.595]  And it's never an issue year after year because we're just regular normal people.
[03:17:38.595 --> 03:17:40.556]  But if anybody ever busted in here, they're dead.
[03:17:40.556 --> 03:17:42.097]  I mean, we're going to defend ourselves.
[03:17:42.097 --> 03:17:43.097]  Well, you're a gun owner.
[03:17:43.097 --> 03:17:45.859]  That makes you regular normal for the most part.
[03:17:45.859 --> 03:17:47.540]  Gun prohibitionists are not normal.
[03:17:47.540 --> 03:17:49.081]  They have some mental health issues.
[03:17:56.479 --> 03:18:03.741]  Well they really do.
[03:18:03.741 --> 03:18:18.844]  I mean it is irrational and crazy and I've seen it repeatedly when people will see a... I had a carpet cleaner at my house and I had a shotgun up in a case on the wall and he saw it and panicked and said he couldn't clean my house and ran off and called the police on me but the police didn't... I mean these people are crazy!
[03:18:19.571 --> 03:18:20.331]  Well, they are.
[03:18:20.331 --> 03:18:24.133]  I mean, they have some issues that we're not going to solve real quickly.
[03:18:24.133 --> 03:18:28.114]  They need some serious psychological counseling.
[03:18:28.114 --> 03:18:31.756]  And you just have to realize that's why they're so dangerous.
[03:18:31.756 --> 03:18:37.878]  And I would have bet the Obama administration is made up of people of very serious mental health issues.
[03:18:37.878 --> 03:18:38.538]  Well, that's true.
[03:18:38.538 --> 03:18:42.160]  But why do they then love SWAT teams with guns?
[03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:44.400]  Like, somebody who loves freedom is threatened by that.
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:48.202]  Because they may have mental health issues, but they lust for power.
[03:18:49.033 --> 03:18:52.823]  And the police are their power arm.
[03:18:52.823 --> 03:18:57.596]  They can use the police to reach out and to destroy those they fear.
[03:19:01.141 --> 03:19:02.502]  Very well said, Aaron Zellman.
[03:19:02.502 --> 03:19:06.866]  We love your organization and the great work you do with Gun Owners of America, JPFO.org.
[03:19:06.866 --> 03:19:12.331]  We'll talk to you again in the near future, and your website is a treasure trove of facts to deprogram people.
[03:19:12.331 --> 03:19:24.482]  The good news is, most liberals I know are no longer liberals, they're patriots, and they're all buying guns and training and loving it, and have broken their fear, and once they go out and shoot, they laugh at their previous fear.
[03:19:24.482 --> 03:19:25.863]  You're saying that too, aren't you?
[03:19:25.863 --> 03:19:26.444]  Absolutely.
[03:19:26.444 --> 03:19:27.585]  They learn the fun of a gun.
[03:19:28.402 --> 03:19:34.805]  And they learned that self-defense is a very good idea, and that being a coward is not a good idea.
[03:19:34.805 --> 03:19:37.386]  It is so satisfying that I've got firearms.
[03:19:37.386 --> 03:19:37.966]  I'm not afraid.
[03:19:37.966 --> 03:19:43.148]  I can't imagine not being armed and that being castrated and weak.
[03:19:43.148 --> 03:19:48.311]  I mean, I'm here, I'm armed, I'm red-blooded like my ancestors, and I'm not a slave.
[03:19:48.311 --> 03:19:51.052]  Aaron Selman, we appreciate you, fellow patriot.
[03:19:51.052 --> 03:19:52.993]  Look forward to talking to you again in the near future.
[03:19:52.993 --> 03:19:53.613]  Be well, Alex.
[03:19:54.557 --> 03:19:55.377]  Take care.
[03:19:55.377 --> 03:19:56.097]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:56.097 --> 03:19:59.578]  I'm going to play a clip from New Orleans with them confiscating guns using the army.
[03:19:59.578 --> 03:20:01.899]  Then I'm getting into the election in Massachusetts.
[03:20:01.899 --> 03:20:08.901]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:08.901 --> 03:20:10.161]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:20:10.161 --> 03:20:10.982]  It's very real.
[03:20:10.982 --> 03:20:14.883]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:20:14.883 --> 03:20:19.164]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:20:19.324 --> 03:20:21.905]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:20:21.905 --> 03:20:27.927]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[03:20:27.927 --> 03:20:32.708]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:20:32.708 --> 03:20:35.549]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:20:35.549 --> 03:20:38.150]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:38.490 --> 03:20:38.730]  We're good.
[03:21:01.617 --> 03:21:07.961]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[03:21:07.961 --> 03:21:12.904]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[03:21:12.904 --> 03:21:16.966]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[03:21:16.966 --> 03:21:18.327]  Let's put this another way.
[03:21:18.327 --> 03:21:23.670]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:26.571]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[03:21:26.571 --> 03:21:29.233]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[03:21:29.233 --> 03:21:30.614]  You can possess it in your hand.
[03:21:31.254 --> 03:21:32.194]  Take it with you.
[03:21:32.194 --> 03:21:33.675]  Gold is real money.
[03:21:33.675 --> 03:21:35.035]  Gold is honest money.
[03:21:35.035 --> 03:21:37.756]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[03:21:37.756 --> 03:21:44.958]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[03:21:44.958 --> 03:21:46.179]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[03:21:46.179 --> 03:21:46.939]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[03:22:03.067 --> 03:22:07.075]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:07.075 --> 03:22:10.342]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:10.342 --> 03:22:11.765]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:22:12.449 --> 03:22:15.131]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.131 --> 03:22:21.517]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.517 --> 03:22:26.581]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.581 --> 03:22:36.709]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.809 --> 03:22:39.171]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:39.171 --> 03:22:40.752]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.752 --> 03:22:43.214]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.214 --> 03:22:45.316]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.316 --> 03:22:50.479]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.479 --> 03:22:55.503]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:55.503 --> 03:23:03.109]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:03.109 --> 03:23:05.271]  Our economy is in great distress.
[03:23:05.993 --> 03:23:09.536]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[03:23:09.536 --> 03:23:15.060]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:17.722]  You have auto and home insurance.
[03:23:17.722 --> 03:23:20.944]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[03:23:20.944 --> 03:23:26.889]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term because it might take years to recover?
[03:23:26.889 --> 03:23:32.553]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[03:23:33.414 --> 03:23:40.738]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[03:23:40.738 --> 03:23:48.842]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[03:23:48.842 --> 03:23:53.325]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[03:23:53.325 --> 03:23:59.148]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[03:24:10.485 --> 03:24:17.591]  Okay, coming up, I'm going to get into all the other news we haven't even covered yet, but this Second Amendment issue is central.
[03:24:17.591 --> 03:24:23.816]  The government can't get our guns through unconstitutional laws, so they just do it by hook and by crook.
[03:24:23.816 --> 03:24:25.518]  That is tyranny.
[03:24:25.518 --> 03:24:30.061]  That is illegal, and what's happened in Austin is criminal on so many fronts.
[03:24:30.061 --> 03:24:31.343]  It's an open and shut case.
[03:24:32.415 --> 03:24:33.356]  And the people are fighting.
[03:24:33.356 --> 03:24:44.844]  Now I want to remind you, and there's a bunch of these video clips, this is ABC News, from back during Katrina 2005, September 8, 2005, and notice the propaganda.
[03:24:44.844 --> 03:24:47.286]  They talk about getting people evacuated.
[03:24:47.286 --> 03:24:49.888]  They got a lot tougher.
[03:24:49.888 --> 03:24:57.813]  So they introduce it like that, then they say, oh, and they do this non-violently, and then they show them slamming people on the ground.
[03:24:57.813 --> 03:24:58.434]  Going in,
[03:25:00.322 --> 03:25:05.147]  To high and dry areas, which they admit, I mean, these are some of the most famous areas of the city.
[03:25:05.147 --> 03:25:06.549]  They were looting them.
[03:25:06.549 --> 03:25:09.472]  I mean, we're talking huge palace-like houses.
[03:25:09.472 --> 03:25:10.814]  People were there guarding their property.
[03:25:10.814 --> 03:25:12.315]  A lot of them had generators.
[03:25:12.315 --> 03:25:13.156]  No water, no nothing.
[03:25:13.156 --> 03:25:15.499]  They just put them in handcuffs, take their guns, and they stole them!
[03:25:17.705 --> 03:25:23.130]  And then notice the reporter that did this got his face blown off in Iraq, fighting for tyranny.
[03:25:23.130 --> 03:25:25.292]  Again, that's a fact, folks.
[03:25:25.292 --> 03:25:27.795]  So ABC News, here it is.
[03:25:27.795 --> 03:25:29.076]  This is what they want.
[03:25:29.076 --> 03:25:30.878]  Any chance they get, they're coming for your guns.
[03:25:30.878 --> 03:25:32.059]  Here it is.
[03:25:32.059 --> 03:25:37.865]  That includes New Orleans, where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[03:25:37.865 --> 03:25:41.688]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding.
[03:25:41.688 --> 03:25:41.909]  Bob?
[03:25:43.700 --> 03:25:45.541]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[03:25:45.541 --> 03:26:00.210]  Here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[03:26:00.210 --> 03:26:05.253]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[03:26:05.253 --> 03:26:09.236]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[03:26:12.930 --> 03:26:25.762]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[03:26:25.762 --> 03:26:29.826]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[03:26:29.826 --> 03:26:32.409]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[03:26:32.409 --> 03:26:33.750]  That's the military.
[03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:36.012]  Instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[03:26:37.116 --> 03:26:37.876]  You said guns?
[03:26:37.876 --> 03:26:38.937]  Guns will be taken.
[03:26:38.937 --> 03:26:40.277]  No one will be able to be armed.
[03:26:40.277 --> 03:26:41.938]  We will take all weapons.
[03:26:41.938 --> 03:26:48.841]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[03:26:48.841 --> 03:26:51.162]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[03:26:51.162 --> 03:26:54.403]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[03:26:54.403 --> 03:26:54.843]  Good pause.
[03:26:54.843 --> 03:26:56.263]  They were a little bit threat.
[03:26:56.263 --> 03:26:57.684]  Back it up a few seconds.
[03:26:57.684 --> 03:27:03.406]  Imagine, I mean these are famous, we're talking 10, 20, 30, 40 million dollar houses.
[03:27:03.406 --> 03:27:04.747]  Wealthy people with generators.
[03:27:05.951 --> 03:27:08.672]  The military didn't bring food to the people at the Superdome.
[03:27:08.672 --> 03:27:11.553]  They came for their guns and they took them and they stole them.
[03:27:11.553 --> 03:27:12.553]  And they used U.S.
[03:27:12.553 --> 03:27:14.934]  Army to do it under FBI command.
[03:27:14.934 --> 03:27:16.554]  Now that's your criminal government.
[03:27:16.554 --> 03:27:17.895]  Continue with it.
[03:27:17.895 --> 03:27:20.675]  ...protect their mansions.
[03:27:20.675 --> 03:27:22.996]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[03:27:22.996 --> 03:27:26.657]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[03:27:26.657 --> 03:27:29.438]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[03:27:31.206 --> 03:27:37.589]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[03:27:37.589 --> 03:27:41.031]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[03:27:41.031 --> 03:27:44.873]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[03:27:44.873 --> 03:27:46.534]  It is, it is surreal.
[03:27:46.534 --> 03:27:48.355]  That's garrisoning troops!
[03:27:48.355 --> 03:27:50.176]  You never expect to do this in your own country.
[03:27:51.076 --> 03:27:55.863]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[03:27:55.863 --> 03:28:00.631]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're gonna have to do.
[03:28:00.631 --> 03:28:04.036]  Somebody pops around the corner, and you shoot an American.
[03:28:04.036 --> 03:28:05.298]  Yeah.
[03:28:05.298 --> 03:28:06.559]  You shoot an American.
[03:28:07.554 --> 03:28:08.974]  Give me that gun or you're dead.
[03:28:08.974 --> 03:28:11.535]  But we don't use force, we just shoot you.
[03:28:11.535 --> 03:28:12.575]  Notice that double thing.
[03:28:12.575 --> 03:28:17.236]  We shoot you, we kill you, we put you in handcuffs, we slam you down on the ground.
[03:28:17.236 --> 03:28:22.097]  When you come to your front door, in all the videos of old women, I don't want to leave my cats and dogs.
[03:28:22.097 --> 03:28:22.997]  Come here, lady!
[03:28:22.997 --> 03:28:25.077]  Slam her head, take her gun.
[03:28:25.077 --> 03:28:26.917]  You don't have guns in America.
[03:28:26.917 --> 03:28:27.858]  We rule you!
[03:28:27.858 --> 03:28:33.259]  And the troops will follow the orders to take the guns.
[03:28:33.259 --> 03:28:35.059]  If not, they'll court-martial them and line them up.
[03:28:37.017 --> 03:28:41.958]  And most of the military is illegal aliens and foreigners now anyways.
[03:28:41.958 --> 03:28:48.480]  We have to come to grips with what America has turned into.
[03:28:48.480 --> 03:28:52.101]  The government is illegitimate and criminal.
[03:28:52.101 --> 03:28:57.502]  If they were confiscating guns any chance they could under Bush, what are they going to do now under Obama?
[03:28:57.502 --> 03:28:58.262]  And we'll hold them.
[03:28:58.262 --> 03:28:59.362]  We'll probably defeat them.
[03:28:59.362 --> 03:29:00.103]  We'll slow them down.
[03:29:00.103 --> 03:29:01.083]  We've been having some victories.
[03:29:01.083 --> 03:29:04.044]  People say, I thought Obama was coming for the guns.
[03:29:04.044 --> 03:29:05.624]  That'll be the COINTELPRO in a couple years.
[03:29:07.230 --> 03:29:08.851]  Yeah, but we're going to stop them.
[03:29:08.851 --> 03:29:14.275]  And then you, paid by the feds, are going to run around saying, It never happened.
[03:29:14.275 --> 03:29:16.697]  They don't want our guns.
[03:29:16.697 --> 03:29:21.841]  They didn't take guns in Katrina.
[03:29:21.841 --> 03:29:22.461]  Oh, it's sick.
[03:29:22.461 --> 03:29:23.382]  Okay, we're going to go to break.
[03:29:23.382 --> 03:29:28.706]  I'm going to come back and get into what's happening in a bunch of other news, including Massachusetts.
[03:29:33.063 --> 03:29:34.945]  There's just so much more to cover.
[03:29:34.945 --> 03:29:37.026]  But we're the good guys.
[03:29:37.026 --> 03:29:40.369]  We're the people following the law, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[03:29:40.369 --> 03:29:46.334]  The government is nothing but a receivership body, the muscle for foreign banks to rob you.
[03:29:46.334 --> 03:29:51.879]  It's very simple.
[03:29:51.879 --> 03:29:53.280]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.280 --> 03:29:55.802]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.802 --> 03:29:58.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.406 --> 03:30:06.713]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[03:30:06.713 --> 03:30:09.477]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[03:30:09.477 --> 03:30:13.843]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:30:16.186 --> 03:30:19.267]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[03:30:19.267 --> 03:30:24.267]  We also have some specials where you can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[03:30:24.267 --> 03:30:35.309]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[03:30:35.309 --> 03:30:37.290]  This film needs to be seen.
[03:30:37.290 --> 03:30:38.430]  Everybody needs to get it.

[03:30:49.225 --> 03:30:50.645]  Shadow government.

[03:31:03.130 --> 03:31:07.151]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:07.151 --> 03:31:10.392]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.392 --> 03:31:11.813]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:31:12.518 --> 03:31:15.181]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:15.181 --> 03:31:21.586]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.586 --> 03:31:26.771]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.771 --> 03:31:30.054]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:30.054 --> 03:31:36.760]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.880 --> 03:31:39.222]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.222 --> 03:31:40.804]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.804 --> 03:31:43.266]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.266 --> 03:31:45.388]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.388 --> 03:31:50.553]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.553 --> 03:31:55.557]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:33:08.821 --> 03:33:09.181]  Central.
[03:33:09.181 --> 03:33:10.404]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.

[03:33:14.652 --> 03:33:16.817]  Central Standard Time.
[03:33:17.884 --> 03:33:20.307]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:33:20.307 --> 03:33:26.213]  I'm going to hit a couple news stories here, then we're going to Larry Pratt, the real constitutional expert.
[03:33:26.213 --> 03:33:28.856]  I asked him during the break, I said, what do you think of this Austin case?
[03:33:28.856 --> 03:33:31.578]  He said, racketeering.
[03:33:31.578 --> 03:33:34.662]  And they have one of the most high-powered legal teams out there.
[03:33:34.662 --> 03:33:38.225]  We're going to tell you what he's looking at doing, coming up in just a moment.
[03:33:39.287 --> 03:33:46.793]  But before we do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that we have here, ladies and gentlemen, that have made this radio show possible.
[03:33:46.793 --> 03:33:49.676]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[03:33:49.676 --> 03:33:51.958]  It's a great little solar-powered panel.
[03:33:51.958 --> 03:33:56.683]  The unit, the control system, the little battery pack can run several large appliances.
[03:33:56.683 --> 03:33:58.805]  You can get a bunch of them and run your whole house.
[03:33:58.805 --> 03:34:00.486]  Just a great system.
[03:34:00.486 --> 03:34:04.089]  Our listeners have given us wonderful reviews of this.
[03:34:04.750 --> 03:34:08.872]  And so everybody will visit MySolarBackup.com, MySolarBackup.com.

[03:35:28.646 --> 03:35:30.527]  Amazing Senate battle.
[03:35:30.527 --> 03:35:31.508]  Heads of the finish line.
[03:35:31.508 --> 03:35:33.128]  We've talked about this some.
[03:35:33.128 --> 03:35:36.090]  You have this Ted Kennedy seat that supposedly nobody could get.
[03:35:36.090 --> 03:35:37.811]  Key Senator position.
[03:35:37.811 --> 03:35:41.272]  You have Democrats in the House leaving or saying they're going to leave their party.
[03:35:41.272 --> 03:35:42.793]  At the state level, they're leaving.
[03:35:42.793 --> 03:35:46.755]  This isn't just a realignment, like people mad at Bush for some bad stuff he did.
[03:35:48.277 --> 03:35:49.958]  Trying to put Obama in to change it.
[03:35:49.958 --> 03:35:51.338]  He's now betrayed them.
[03:35:51.338 --> 03:35:56.359]  He's got the lowest approval rating of any president one year in, ever.
[03:35:56.359 --> 03:36:01.421]  And it's the one year anniversary in two days of his year in office.
[03:36:01.421 --> 03:36:12.945]  And to have this most powerful Democratic position in the country, the strongest, most powerful Senate seat, I mean the most ironclad, supposedly, that they had.
[03:36:14.665 --> 03:36:18.767]  It looks like it's going to go to Scott Brown right now, unless they have election fraud.
[03:36:18.767 --> 03:36:23.589]  And this Martha Coakley is in deep trouble.
[03:36:23.589 --> 03:36:24.889]  And this is a message.
[03:36:24.889 --> 03:36:31.632]  I mean, the Democrats on their open borders, they're gun grabbing, they're lies, they're continuing the Patriot Act, they're gun controlled.
[03:36:32.523 --> 03:36:39.204]  They are in deep trouble, and Larry Pratt's been involved in this race, so I first want to get his take on what's happening there.
[03:36:39.204 --> 03:36:54.467]  Larry Pratt, the head of Gun Owners of America, the only big national, and there's some other small groups that are great, like JPFO, but this is the only real national group that actually defeats gun legislation against the Second Amendment.
[03:36:54.467 --> 03:36:55.847]  Good to have you here, Larry.
[03:36:55.847 --> 03:36:56.807]  Thank you so much.
[03:36:56.807 --> 03:36:58.127]  It is good to be with you.
[03:36:58.127 --> 03:37:01.908]  Yeah, this race is really a barn burner.
[03:37:02.498 --> 03:37:12.424]  It's something that it seems like Brown is probably winning, and it also very much looks as if Coakley is doing her best to lose.
[03:37:12.424 --> 03:37:14.726]  Nothing goes right for this poor woman.
[03:37:14.726 --> 03:37:19.909]  Her husband is a retired Cambridge, Massachusetts police officer.
[03:37:19.909 --> 03:37:24.872]  His union voted overwhelmingly to support Brown.
[03:37:24.872 --> 03:37:30.736]  It doesn't look like it's going to go well for her tonight, and if the margin for Brown were sufficient,
[03:37:31.647 --> 03:37:33.748]  Over five points, I would imagine.
[03:37:33.748 --> 03:37:40.873]  That's probably pushing it beyond where they can steal it and not cause further outrage.
[03:37:40.873 --> 03:37:55.443]  So we've endorsed Brown, not because we know he's not going to be John Wayne, but because he has made one of the two central issues of his campaign that he will vote against socialized medicine.
[03:37:55.443 --> 03:38:01.247]  And since that is bad, bad news for all Americans, including gun owners, well,
[03:38:02.008 --> 03:38:06.610]  Better a crooked stick if that's all we have with a rabid dog coming at our throat.
[03:38:06.610 --> 03:38:23.276]  So that's where we are, and I think it will signal that Democrats in other places, and also if we do our jobs right, Republicans in name only, the so-called RINOs, they all should go.
[03:38:23.276 --> 03:38:27.377]  We start in the primaries this year, get rid of the RINOs,
[03:38:27.932 --> 03:38:31.835]  We've endorsed, for example, Patrick Hughes in the Illinois race.
[03:38:31.835 --> 03:38:34.797]  Mark Kirk is a very liberal.
[03:38:34.797 --> 03:38:41.363]  He's like Didi Scosafava, that New York very liberal assemblywoman in that special U.S.
[03:38:41.363 --> 03:38:42.443]  House race last year.
[03:38:42.443 --> 03:38:48.008]  We need to target the anti-gun people, the socialists, the big government people, and get rid of them!
[03:38:48.008 --> 03:38:48.648]  Absolutely.
[03:38:48.648 --> 03:38:52.291]  And the early voting has already begun in the Illinois primary.
[03:38:52.291 --> 03:38:54.553]  So, people ought to go to Patrick Hughes.
[03:38:55.440 --> 03:38:58.302]  Sorry, I don't have it at the top of my head, but it's not a biggie.
[03:38:58.302 --> 03:38:59.122]  They know the race.
[03:38:59.122 --> 03:39:03.545]  And what about Debra Medina running for Republican here in Texas?
[03:39:03.545 --> 03:39:16.232]  She's going to have a tougher climb than some of the others, but she's obviously the most liberty-minded of the candidates, and at least Hutchison did a disastrous job, I'm told, in the debate.
[03:39:16.232 --> 03:39:19.773]  She got pressed on things and she just didn't want to, couldn't answer.
[03:39:22.393 --> 03:39:25.855]  That woman is really bad news.
[03:39:25.855 --> 03:39:27.356]  Yeah, that's my problem.
[03:39:27.356 --> 03:39:38.603]  As bad as Rick Perry is, I mean, I guess we're going to find out in the primary, but he's better than Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Bilderberg chairwoman.
[03:39:38.603 --> 03:39:39.203]  Exactly.
[03:39:39.203 --> 03:39:42.825]  And not only that, she is one nasty woman.
[03:39:42.825 --> 03:39:46.027]  The things that one hears about her from the staff
[03:39:47.456 --> 03:39:52.418]  It's like Cruella de Vil in that movie, the 101 Dalmatians.
[03:39:52.418 --> 03:39:56.339]  This female representation of evil.
[03:39:56.339 --> 03:39:58.620]  Just nasty all the time.
[03:39:58.620 --> 03:40:04.542]  And so hopefully the voters are going to see that this lady needs to be humiliated.
[03:40:04.542 --> 03:40:08.584]  First in this primary, and then let's go get her in the primary.
[03:40:08.584 --> 03:40:11.985]  I guess she's up for her re-election to the Senate in a couple of years.
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:17.543]  But we're seeing things turn, and I think we have a shot.
[03:40:17.543 --> 03:40:35.874]  You know, the Republican establishment tried to pull it off with Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, a big, big liberal, Arlen Specter of the South, and the former Speaker of the House, Marco Rubio, has come out of nowhere, didn't have nearly the money that Crist had, didn't have any of that establishment backing,
[03:40:37.205 --> 03:40:38.887]  And he's already pulled even with him.
[03:40:38.887 --> 03:40:40.909]  I think he's probably ahead.
[03:40:40.909 --> 03:40:50.337]  The Republican Party is absolutely rejecting this notion that, oh well, we need to have a moderates so we can raise the money and win.
[03:40:50.337 --> 03:40:54.041]  No, moderates are what have been making the Republicans losers.
[03:40:55.071 --> 03:40:58.094]  Because they desert the Republican principles.
[03:40:58.094 --> 03:40:59.214]  Well, look at every poll.
[03:40:59.214 --> 03:41:01.796]  Gallup, 91% don't want open borders.
[03:41:01.796 --> 03:41:07.140]  Major polls over 75% to 80% don't want more gun control, want less.
[03:41:07.140 --> 03:41:13.745]  I mean, on every issue, if Republicans were actually Constitutionalists, there wouldn't be a Democrat in existence.
[03:41:13.745 --> 03:41:15.766]  The Democrats are unpopular.
[03:41:15.766 --> 03:41:19.729]  They're only put in power because Bush tripled government, launched all these illegal wars.
[03:41:20.169 --> 03:41:22.753]  In the time we've got left, Larry Pratt, this is very exciting.
[03:41:22.753 --> 03:41:27.541]  You're saying you're seeing a major sea change, a rebellion against the big government tyranny.
[03:41:27.541 --> 03:41:29.023]  Shifting gears, though, the Austin...
[03:41:30.017 --> 03:41:31.078]  Case.
[03:41:31.078 --> 03:41:32.078]  Looking at it from afar.
[03:41:32.078 --> 03:41:34.520]  I know your lawyers are now studying it.
[03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:38.182]  The Austin Gun Show here for close to two decades.
[03:41:38.182 --> 03:41:42.085]  They run out the sacks of people that have been there since the early 90s.
[03:41:42.085 --> 03:41:43.486]  A new guy comes in.
[03:41:43.486 --> 03:41:44.827]  The police say, come to a meeting.
[03:41:44.827 --> 03:41:46.168]  BATF's there running the meeting.
[03:41:46.168 --> 03:41:53.112]  They say, look, you're going to post a message that no private sales, which are legal in Texas.
[03:41:53.112 --> 03:41:55.954]  And they have the H-E-B leaseholder there.
[03:41:55.954 --> 03:41:59.537]  And they said, we're going to shut you down if you don't do this.
[03:42:00.517 --> 03:42:04.140]  And H-E-B said, you better put up the notice.
[03:42:04.140 --> 03:42:12.226]  So the owner of the gun show, of the franchise, he puts it up, but has a petition to the governor and the attorney general to come stop this.
[03:42:12.226 --> 03:42:14.868]  It's not a law, just color of law.
[03:42:14.868 --> 03:42:17.991]  And so the police we now know have called H-E-B and others.
[03:42:17.991 --> 03:42:21.173]  They called him this morning and said, look, you fought this, no gun show.
[03:42:21.173 --> 03:42:23.315]  There'll never be another gun show there again.
[03:42:23.315 --> 03:42:24.716]  There won't be another gun show in Austin.
[03:42:25.416 --> 03:42:31.479]  You know, under this police department, under the BATF, Austin's a test case, there aren't any gun shows, get out by sundown.
[03:42:31.479 --> 03:42:37.421]  I mean, this is racketeering, civil rights violation, violates the Commerce Clause, it's colorable.
[03:42:37.421 --> 03:42:41.363]  The key word, I think, under federal law is racketeering.
[03:42:41.363 --> 03:42:50.167]  What they have done is a criminal conspiracy, a racketeering offense, and especially since the BATF was involved directly,
[03:42:50.748 --> 03:43:05.015]  That means you could trigger the federal law without anything else, you know, and you mentioned a lot of other good possibilities, but this one is a tough one because it means that you are in a much more difficult position in court.
[03:43:05.015 --> 03:43:10.558]  It was designed to go after the Mafia, then they expanded it to go after pro-lifers.
[03:43:10.558 --> 03:43:15.440]  No reason why sauce for the goose can't be sauce for the gander.
[03:43:15.440 --> 03:43:19.402]  So we're taking a look at that, but you know, to just take a step back,
[03:43:20.572 --> 03:43:23.214]  I had made one mistake about Obama.
[03:43:23.214 --> 03:43:26.357]  I thought he was a slipperier character.
[03:43:26.357 --> 03:43:37.446]  I thought he was going to push his legislative agenda only as far as he could get away with it, so as not to stir us up the way he has done, as a matter of fact.
[03:43:37.446 --> 03:43:38.647]  No, he's like Joe Stalin.
[03:43:38.647 --> 03:43:40.268]  I mean, he's going great guns.
[03:43:40.268 --> 03:43:41.269]  He's rushing us.
[03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:42.049]  Absolutely.
[03:43:42.049 --> 03:43:50.116]  And that's probably the best thing that could have happened, because had it been a continuation of the decades-long inching toward socialism,
[03:43:50.757 --> 03:43:56.162]  I doubt that enough of us would have become aware of what is happening, but he's done it.
[03:43:56.162 --> 03:44:14.118]  Now, what I thought he was going to do right away was to use the instrumentality of agencies like the BATF to legislate without going through the Congress, making stuff up, just like you've reported just now, what happened in Austin
[03:44:14.759 --> 03:44:18.941]  Is the bureaucrats just making up the law as they go?
[03:44:18.941 --> 03:44:31.827]  And that means, yeah, that's going to draw attention, that gets people excited, but there's a little bit of distance between a bureaucrat who's there before, during, and after Obama's in office, and Obama himself.
[03:44:31.827 --> 03:44:41.351]  There's a little bit of a disconnect, and I would have thought that they'd be doing this from day one, and especially going after one of his favorite enemies, the gun owner.
[03:44:41.769 --> 03:44:46.192]  But here it is, better late than never, I guess, in Obama's view.
[03:44:46.192 --> 03:44:51.115]  And so they're coming with the bureaucracy to raise havoc.
[03:44:51.115 --> 03:45:05.184]  And this is an expansion of things such as happened to Olufsen, such as happened to various manufacturers that can't get licensing for products because of the arbitrariness of the Bureau.
[03:45:05.184 --> 03:45:10.147]  This is the kind of more overt evil that I was expecting to see earlier.
[03:45:10.905 --> 03:45:15.648]  And it's finally here.
[03:45:15.648 --> 03:45:27.716]  Very, very exciting to know that they're putting everything they can on the fire to try to burn up the Constitution, but it's really only backfiring on them.
[03:45:27.716 --> 03:45:28.717]  I agree with you.
[03:45:28.717 --> 03:45:35.041]  The great danger is, unless it's chutzpah or bravado or whatever it is, or hubris,
[03:45:36.022 --> 03:45:41.446]  I mean, maybe they're right, maybe they're gonna get away with it, I mean, or are they just that ham-fisted?
[03:45:41.446 --> 03:45:42.726]  I think it is the latter.
[03:45:42.726 --> 03:45:57.436]  I really think they believe their own propaganda, that they are right, anybody else is evil, that the people actually, when this stuff is crammed down our throat, will say, oh, that wasn't mud after all, that really tastes good!
[03:45:57.436 --> 03:46:02.619]  I think to a certain extent they really believe it, they also feel
[03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:05.952]  Evidently, a sense of urgency.
[03:46:05.952 --> 03:46:17.222]  They know that they're not going to have their, and they knew going in, that they weren't going to have their supermajority, but for this session of the Congress, this term of the Congress, these two years.
[03:46:17.222 --> 03:46:29.974]  And so they're going for the gold while they can get away with it, and evidently they don't really think they'll be defeated, and even if they are, well devil take the hindmost, they're going to grab the power while they can.
[03:46:30.441 --> 03:46:38.384]  What they're not counting on is that they have become, in a sense, the president has fulfilled one of his campaign promises.
[03:46:38.384 --> 03:46:41.025]  He has brought us together.
[03:46:41.025 --> 03:46:51.829]  In Massachusetts, for example, a Democrat mayor of Quincy, it's a blue-collar industrial town, people work for a living there, and they're union-oriented, and they vote Democrat.
[03:46:51.829 --> 03:46:57.991]  He's been a Democrat there for six terms, whatever term is, at least two years, and he came out and endorsed
[03:46:58.550 --> 03:47:03.693]  Brown on the basis of the Obamacare proposals.
[03:47:03.693 --> 03:47:04.454]  They don't want socialism.
[03:47:04.454 --> 03:47:05.875]  Which is so outrageous!
[03:47:05.875 --> 03:47:07.436]  I mean, we read the bills months ago.
[03:47:07.436 --> 03:47:08.656]  People couldn't believe us.
[03:47:08.656 --> 03:47:22.705]  I would read the bills, the House and Senate version, and listeners thought I was lying when it said five years in jail, quarter million dollar fines, taking money out of your paycheck, taxing your health plans, which aren't Cadillac.
[03:47:22.705 --> 03:47:25.927]  I mean, a lot of families do spend, you know, $12,000 a year or whatever.
[03:47:25.927 --> 03:47:26.587]  I mean, this is
[03:47:27.868 --> 03:47:30.730]  Cutting Medicare and Medicaid and raising taxes?
[03:47:30.730 --> 03:47:32.572]  I mean, this is a rip-off!
[03:47:32.572 --> 03:47:47.904]  I agree with the observation that was made that when we see things like the mayor of Quincy doing what he did, it may well represent a realignment once again of, call them the Reagan Democrats, people who are not
[03:47:48.527 --> 03:47:51.389]  Exactly, and then getting away from rhinos, because the Republicans know
[03:48:06.957 --> 03:48:21.767]  If it took only six or seven months for Obama to get the lowest approval rating in history for a president in the first year, if a Republican doesn't immediately deliver and start slashing anti-gun laws in big government, they're going to be out instantly.
[03:48:21.767 --> 03:48:29.952]  And so it's not just a realignment towards conservatism, it's a realignment of libertarian constitutionalists completely away.
[03:48:29.952 --> 03:48:33.014]  I mean, the pendulum is swinging away from big government.
[03:48:33.294 --> 03:48:43.541]  If the Republicans were to gain control of the House, there's a number of things that they could do, even with President Hussein still in the White House.
[03:48:43.541 --> 03:48:54.388]  They could, for example, take the BATF budget and they could say none of these funds may be used to enforce gun show actions or whatever would be the most
[03:48:54.847 --> 03:48:57.729]  Technically correct legal language, but you get the drift.
[03:48:57.729 --> 03:49:00.891]  And you will investigate guns after a crime is committed?
[03:49:00.891 --> 03:49:03.313]  You will not go harass old ladies?
[03:49:03.313 --> 03:49:08.376]  You make them follow a published list of procedures, which they don't do.
[03:49:08.376 --> 03:49:09.377]  They don't publish.
[03:49:09.377 --> 03:49:15.001]  And so they keep changing from one trial to the next as to what was the determining factor, blah blah blah.
[03:49:15.001 --> 03:49:16.662]  None of these funds can be used for that.
[03:49:16.662 --> 03:49:21.465]  And so the trick would be, don't do it the way Newt Gingrich did back in 95, where you
[03:49:22.506 --> 03:49:25.692]  Play chicken with the whole federal government budget.
[03:49:25.692 --> 03:49:33.586]  Now, some of us probably wouldn't mind if it all went down, but you don't say, okay, we're just not going to raise the debt limit and that means you have to shut the government down.
[03:49:34.062 --> 03:49:36.725]  Well, politically it just isn't going to fly.
[03:49:36.725 --> 03:49:56.743]  But you can, if you get to work right away, you could send a budget for the Treasury Department with the amputations in there that you want for BATF, well actually they're under justice now, excuse me, but a Justice Department budget chopped up here, there, but you know, leaving it essentially intact, just a lot of fingers and arms and legs missing.
[03:49:57.594 --> 03:50:05.939]  He can either veto it himself, in which case the ball's in his court, and who cares if the Justice Department gets shut down, or he'll accept the amputations.
[03:50:05.939 --> 03:50:12.263]  The problem is the BATF will just go firebomb another church to scare everybody into giving them funds.
[03:50:12.263 --> 03:50:22.130]  Well, you know, you can only have one Waco at a time, and as a lot of folks have said, probably won't be for free the next time either.
[03:50:22.130 --> 03:50:27.153]  And what's happening at the state level is also encouraging.
[03:50:27.677 --> 03:50:31.484]  The governor of Virginia, who's, he's right of center, but he's no fighter.
[03:50:31.484 --> 03:50:34.129]  First thing he did when he got elected was say...
[03:50:34.798 --> 03:50:38.379]  DOA if socialized medicine passes in Washington.
[03:50:38.379 --> 03:50:39.219]  Not in my state.
[03:50:39.219 --> 03:50:46.121]  And now we've got first 14 and then 18 state attorney generals saying this is not just weights and measures.
[03:50:46.121 --> 03:50:48.122]  It's unconstitutional because of the socialism.
[03:50:48.122 --> 03:50:48.762]  Absolutely.
[03:50:48.762 --> 03:50:52.323]  But you can't selectively enforce certain rules on certain states.
[03:50:52.323 --> 03:50:56.464]  This thing is dead even if they pass it and it looks like they may not even get that done.
[03:50:56.464 --> 03:50:58.244]  Larry Pratt up there on Capitol Hill.
[03:50:58.244 --> 03:51:00.125]  I want to get your final take on that when we come back.
[03:51:03.522 --> 03:51:07.123]  If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem go away by yourself.
[03:51:07.123 --> 03:51:11.044]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved once and for all.
[03:51:11.044 --> 03:51:12.285]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:51:12.285 --> 03:51:17.546]  For 30 years, I've helped thousands of people solve their tax debt problem, and I can help you solve yours, too.
[03:51:17.546 --> 03:51:21.587]  We take a very simple but proven three-step approach to solving your problem.
[03:51:21.587 --> 03:51:26.709]  First, we stabilize IRS collection actions so you don't have to worry about the IRS seizing your bank account or paycheck.
[03:51:27.341 --> 03:51:34.447]  Next, we build a comprehensive plan to get your tax debt reduced to the fullest extent possible, sometimes even completely eliminated.
[03:51:34.447 --> 03:51:39.130]  And finally, we work with you every step of the way to get your problem solved once and for all.
[03:51:39.130 --> 03:51:40.932]  Call us for a free consultation.

[03:51:45.435 --> 03:51:48.237]  We'll work together to get your problem solved, guaranteed.
[03:51:48.237 --> 03:51:52.821]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you too.
[03:51:53.359 --> 03:51:57.961]  Call us today at 800-346-6829.
[03:51:57.961 --> 03:52:03.044]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:52:03.044 --> 03:52:07.046]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.046 --> 03:52:10.307]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.307 --> 03:52:11.728]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.512 --> 03:52:15.095]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.095 --> 03:52:21.501]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.501 --> 03:52:26.686]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:26.686 --> 03:52:36.675]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.795 --> 03:52:39.136]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.136 --> 03:52:40.717]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.717 --> 03:52:43.178]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.178 --> 03:52:45.319]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.319 --> 03:52:50.462]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.462 --> 03:52:59.566]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.077 --> 03:53:02.477]  I think so.
[03:53:18.592 --> 03:53:19.252]  We're good to go!
[03:53:46.630 --> 03:53:50.391]  Folks, everything the government scammers and the offshore banks touch turns to dust.
[03:54:09.875 --> 03:54:12.537]  They've got the power, but they're destroying themselves in the process.
[03:54:12.537 --> 03:54:16.140]  It's kind of like you've got a pickup truck driving through a boulder field.
[03:54:16.140 --> 03:54:21.084]  You might make it to the other side, but your car's going to be totaled by the other end.
[03:54:21.084 --> 03:54:24.547]  Look at this InfoWars.com article from Steve Watson.
[03:54:24.547 --> 03:54:26.769]  We'll be covering this at the start of the show tomorrow.
[03:54:26.769 --> 03:54:35.616]  International hearings begin on falsified swine flu pandemic by the EU, proving it was all a fraud to make money and a dangerous vaccine.
[03:54:36.357 --> 03:54:39.519]  Greatest medical scandal of the century to come under scrutiny.
[03:54:39.519 --> 03:54:43.001]  That's a quote by the head of the EU group.
[03:54:43.001 --> 03:54:43.621]  Here's another one.
[03:54:43.621 --> 03:54:45.222]  Ron Paul.
[03:54:45.222 --> 03:54:47.403]  Use Geithner to impeach Obama.
[03:54:47.403 --> 03:54:49.704]  Like I said with Ron Paul a week ago on air.
[03:54:49.704 --> 03:54:51.045]  Use this to bring them all down.
[03:54:51.045 --> 03:54:52.546]  Ron Paul's coming out.
[03:54:52.546 --> 03:54:56.028]  I mean, folks like Ceausescu or any of these thugs falling.
[03:54:57.897 --> 03:55:04.882]  America is mad, and the media tries to not let you know how awake people are, but they are awake!
[03:55:04.882 --> 03:55:15.270]  And the Republicans and Democrats can't scam us anymore with this bait-and-switch, with whatever party's out of power acts like they're populist and constitutionalist until they get in power.
[03:55:15.270 --> 03:55:20.654]  I'm telling you, if you get the word out and fight hard, we've got a 70% chance of beating these people.
[03:55:22.374 --> 03:55:24.095]  Larry Pratt, do you agree with that statement?
[03:55:24.095 --> 03:55:25.195]  I do, Alex.
[03:55:25.195 --> 03:55:35.997]  And right now, even with the lousy set of cards we have in the Congress, this socialized medical push does not have to happen.
[03:55:35.997 --> 03:55:45.779]  There's enough of those stew-packed Democrats, to use a term, the pro-lifers that are insisting on their language that's in the House version that is not in the Senate version,
[03:55:46.328 --> 03:55:52.253]  That the option of just accepting the Senate version is not all that likely in the House.
[03:55:52.253 --> 03:55:55.796]  And they're less likely to get turned.
[03:55:55.796 --> 03:56:02.421]  And a lot of times, let's face it, a blue dog is simply a liberal Democrat that hasn't voted yet.
[03:56:02.421 --> 03:56:06.905]  So this is another hoax, because you will be assimilated, no way to stop us.
[03:56:06.905 --> 03:56:10.748]  No, yeah, you can't win, we win, you lose.
[03:56:10.748 --> 03:56:12.349]  This is inevitable, it's going to happen soon.
[03:56:12.654 --> 03:56:14.295]  Well, it's going to be happening soon.
[03:56:14.295 --> 03:56:16.435]  Since what, last February?
[03:56:16.435 --> 03:56:19.576]  Obviously, as a mantra, it doesn't mean it's true.
[03:56:19.576 --> 03:56:22.597]  So, I don't see it coming through the House.
[03:56:22.597 --> 03:56:34.041]  If the House agrees to something that might be acceptable to the Senate, when it comes back to the Senate for their actual approval, it comes back in the form, parliamentarily, as a new bill.
[03:56:34.779 --> 03:56:41.225]  And all of the possibilities for filibuster are waiting for it all over again.
[03:56:41.225 --> 03:56:42.987]  And they've already had a mass exodus.
[03:56:42.987 --> 03:56:45.029]  The Democratic Party's bleeding out.
[03:56:45.029 --> 03:56:48.312]  A lot of them want this to end and fail so they can move on.
[03:56:48.312 --> 03:56:54.338]  They know people are going to remember in a few months, come election time, if this passes, they are all politically dead.
[03:56:55.279 --> 03:57:05.145]  possibly find a senator who would join with the Republicans, even without Brown being seated in the Senate, to say, hey, wait a minute.
[03:57:05.145 --> 03:57:11.249]  I know this is an important issue for our party, but I'm not interested in being a kamikaze pilot.
[03:57:11.249 --> 03:57:13.571]  I'm taking the next boat back to Japan.
[03:57:14.364 --> 03:57:16.485]  Well, we're going to find out tomorrow if Brown wins.
[03:57:16.485 --> 03:57:17.986]  We've got to pray for that.
[03:57:17.986 --> 03:57:29.592]  As the founders said, we need gridlock in Washington, not the skids greased, especially right now with Obama, who I've got to say is now officially the worst president in U.S.
[03:57:29.592 --> 03:57:29.912]  history.
[03:57:29.912 --> 03:57:38.957]  I thought Bush or Clinton might have been that, but I mean, there's no doubt this guy is an absolute authoritarian, an absolute anti-American, absolutely dangerous.
[03:57:38.957 --> 03:57:39.997]  I agree with Michael Savage.
[03:57:39.997 --> 03:57:41.298]  He may stage terror attacks.
[03:57:41.758 --> 03:57:43.819]  He may do anything, we've got to stop him.
[03:57:43.819 --> 03:57:49.060]  In closing, Larry Pratt, Gun Owners of America, more than ever needs people's support.
[03:57:49.060 --> 03:57:51.961]  GunOwners.org, tell folks how to support.
[03:57:51.961 --> 03:58:05.186]  GunOwners.org, you can become a member there, and if you just want to find out what we're doing, go to GunOwners.org, sign up for our email alerts, and that'll keep you posted on what's happening and what you can do to fight them in Washington.
[03:58:05.186 --> 03:58:08.607]  Larry Pratt, great job, God bless you, have a great New Year in 2010.
[03:58:10.799 --> 03:58:11.139]  Same to you.
[03:58:44.061 --> 03:58:46.543]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:52.166 --> 03:58:55.168]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:55.168 --> 03:59:00.512]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:59:00.512 --> 03:59:02.553]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:59:02.553 --> 03:59:07.556]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:07.556 --> 03:59:08.477]  How much do you want?
[03:59:08.717 --> 03:59:09.838]  When do you want it?
[03:59:09.838 --> 03:59:11.739]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:59:11.739 --> 03:59:12.799]  When will you need it?
[03:59:12.799 --> 03:59:15.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:15.000 --> 03:59:16.341]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:16.341 --> 03:59:17.882]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:17.882 --> 03:59:23.145]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:23.145 --> 03:59:26.727]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:26.727 --> 03:59:30.189]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:30.549 --> 03:59:31.770]  How much will you need?
[03:59:31.770 --> 03:59:32.671]  We don't know.
[03:59:32.671 --> 03:59:33.772]  How much do you want?
[03:59:33.772 --> 03:59:34.712]  All you can get.
[03:59:34.712 --> 03:59:35.793]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:35.793 --> 03:59:38.855]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:59:38.855 --> 03:59:40.637]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:59:40.637 --> 03:59:41.718]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:41.718 --> 03:59:45.821]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
