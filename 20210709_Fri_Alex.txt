[00:30.000 --> 00:39.680]  I'm going to say something very calmly here on air right now on this live Friday, July
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.880]  night broadcast, and I'm going to just let this sink in for everybody.
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.480]  I have a stack of news articles here without even looking.
[00:49.480 --> 00:52.600]  I mean, if I wanted to, I'd find a hundred more.
[00:52.600 --> 00:59.720]  I have a stack of news articles here with renowned emergency brain surgeons in the United
[00:59.720 --> 01:07.520]  States and in Italy and in Australia without even looking.
[01:07.520 --> 01:15.640]  It's just in the news that brain trauma surgeons are saying they've never seen brains look
[01:15.640 --> 01:29.280]  like this, swollen, bloody messes, holes eaten in all the tissue, liquefaction.
[01:29.280 --> 01:33.000]  And now let's let this next part sink in.
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and all the usual criminal suspects are blocking that information
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.360]  and saying that's not from the UN.
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.680]  Do you see the old reports back in the 80s, they had the cop killer bullets that would
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.760]  shoot through VESC and they'd see doctors and trauma doctors, oh, I've never seen a
[01:53.760 --> 01:55.680]  bullet shoot through things like this.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.680]  It cost so much damage.
[01:56.680 --> 01:59.480]  So they banned those bullets just on the word of some doctors.
[01:59.480 --> 02:05.800]  Of course, the bullet's supposed to be deadly, but the point is, is that now the most trusted
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.680]  people come out and say this is eating the brains and it's in the literature, it does
[02:10.680 --> 02:16.040]  it and it's in all the studies and holding America and the world underwater, drowning
[02:16.040 --> 02:18.400]  us, killing us, is big tech hiding this.
[02:18.400 --> 02:23.680]  And I got another article right here, YouTube caught auto-sensoring comments that criticized
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.720]  the Chinese Communist Party, well, of course they do, and then they get up there in front
[02:29.720 --> 02:34.880]  of Congress and say, oh, we don't censor anybody, but then they censor everywhere in the left
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.400]  calls for more censorship and for my show to be taken off the air along with Tucker Carlson.
[02:40.400 --> 02:42.080]  It was such an incredible time.
[02:42.080 --> 02:49.400]  I mean, look at these articles, Mom45 who got a job at John Hopkins Hospital dies in
[02:49.400 --> 02:55.040]  John Hopkins Hospital after she got the second shot and they said, yeah, the vaccine reaction
[02:55.040 --> 03:03.320]  swole her brain until all the blood vessels popped and it was a long, horrifyingly painful
[03:03.320 --> 03:08.280]  death, the pain we said, she went from being in great shape and totally happy to deader
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.920]  than a doornail within a few days of taking the injection.
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.160]  Oh, here's another one, beautiful young Italian girl killed by a vaccine.
[03:17.160 --> 03:24.160]  Brain surgeon, renowned brain surgeon said he's never seen a brain look like this.
[03:24.160 --> 03:31.640]  I've never seen anything like this, goes on to describe it as the worst thrombosis and
[03:31.640 --> 03:36.840]  neurological trauma.
[03:36.840 --> 03:39.840]  They crushed her brain.
[03:39.840 --> 03:43.880]  They had to remove her skull, the top of her skull off, she still died.
[03:43.880 --> 03:46.880]  So she's in there with the top of her skull off, the brain's like, never seen a brain
[03:46.880 --> 03:47.880]  swallow like this.
[03:47.880 --> 03:50.880]  Bye-bye, you're dead.
[03:50.880 --> 03:55.720]  And they're killing everybody right in front of us and testing to see what we'll do because
[03:55.720 --> 04:02.320]  they know that we will adapt by not overcoming, we will adapt by submitting because they've
[04:02.320 --> 04:09.200]  got us in that captured learned helplessness mass stock home syndrome place.
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.240]  This is an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:12.240 --> 04:18.160]  I haven't even gotten into the stack, but they've got people in Australia, the US, Italy,
[04:18.160 --> 04:25.600]  all saying the same thing, the brains are bloody messes, the lungs are shredded like
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.000]  somebody shot them with a shotgun, one doctor described, they just said, I've never seen
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  anything like it.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.360]  They say over and over again, the autopsies, the autopsies, or they're trying to save these
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.960]  people, the hearts swelling up, and you know, if you're 20 and it swells up, you can die.
[04:38.960 --> 04:39.960]  Some have it.
[04:39.960 --> 04:46.080]  If you're 70 and got a lot of plaque, your heart swells, arteries close, bye-bye.
[04:46.080 --> 04:47.960]  And you're dead.
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.080]  And they are killing us with enjoyment.
[04:52.080 --> 05:05.280]  And now, the feds have announced for its inoculations, stay with us.
[05:05.280 --> 05:28.520]  Their
[05:28.520 --> 05:32.920]  is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is
[05:32.920 --> 05:37.960]  absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality
[05:37.960 --> 05:41.960]  products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family

[05:58.360 --> 06:12.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:12.840 --> 06:34.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, July 9th. The year is 2021. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:34.760 --> 06:42.040]  Well, it's official. Legislation has been introduced in the House and it looks like it's going to pass
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.160]  to create a new law enforcement body in the Justice Department that will track everyone's
[06:49.160 --> 06:53.800]  medical records. And if you've been vaccinated, that means whatever they cook up, they want to put
[06:53.800 --> 07:04.840]  your body, gene therapies, you name it. And the bill is 666. And there's another bill called 6666
[07:05.960 --> 07:13.240]  that is now law that is the contact tracers coming to your house. And of course, they did not give
[07:13.240 --> 07:17.080]  them those numbers because it was consecutive because that was just the next bill number. They
[07:17.080 --> 07:25.640]  chose in committee those numbers to rub it in your face. A little calling card for everybody.
[07:26.840 --> 07:36.600]  Kind of like the quote, gay choir that is a city sponsored in San Francisco saying,
[07:36.600 --> 07:41.000]  we're going to corrupt your children. We're coming for your children. We're going to recruit your
[07:41.000 --> 07:49.320]  children. And of course, that is the entire giant push everywhere, all over the news,
[07:49.320 --> 07:55.720]  cartoons, movies. Well, now they come out and say, oh, they were just baiting us. And they don't
[07:55.720 --> 07:59.400]  really mean it, but they did take the video down so they can then misrepresent what was actually
[07:59.400 --> 08:04.200]  said in it. But we have the video and we have the statements by these organizations and groups
[08:04.200 --> 08:09.560]  that the left pushes like San Francisco government pushes drag queen story time, which is a man in
[08:09.560 --> 08:15.320]  a clown suit shaking his ass in front of children and having him sit on his pervert lap. That's why
[08:15.320 --> 08:23.000]  so many get busted being child traffickers, child rapists. But oh, no, no, no. All they wanted was
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.560]  gay marriage, ladies and gentlemen. And so people who are homosexual in the world who are not
[08:29.560 --> 08:33.640]  child molesters and who are not bad people because they're heterosexual child molesters and they're
[08:33.640 --> 08:40.040]  homosexual child molesters are all equally as bad. You need to not let the pedophiles claim that
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.000]  they run your movement because they do now. And then you can whine and complain, oh, we're getting
[08:45.000 --> 08:52.040]  threats. Oh, oh, you hate us because of our sexual choices. And no, no, no, no, we don't like you
[08:52.040 --> 08:58.440]  because a bunch of creeping men seeing a song about you're coming for our children. And then all the
[08:58.440 --> 09:03.800]  that Jocelyn elders wanted to teach elementary students how to masturbate and suck weights down
[09:03.800 --> 09:08.440]  and taught us our pain else helps them. Remember that was came on congressional testimony.
[09:09.160 --> 09:15.800]  She said, I died. You need the takers need to touch the peanuts. I mean, it's pedophilia.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.520]  That's what this is. That's who you are. That's the operating system of the Vatican now and the
[09:22.520 --> 09:28.600]  left and Hollywood, my God. And it's coming out. And so we're going to hit it all today,
[09:28.600 --> 09:34.920]  ladies and gentlemen, the massive number of deaths from these poison injections, the literature,
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.080]  the studies that it would do indeed that foul cheated studies at University of Texas eight
[09:39.080 --> 09:44.120]  years ago and found that this happened in other mammals when you gave them a vaccine that attacks
[09:44.120 --> 09:52.600]  the spike protein makes your body in a large percentage of people attack itself. And that
[09:52.600 --> 10:00.280]  might just mean arthritis or heart pain. But if you and your system really, really takes to the
[10:00.280 --> 10:06.120]  vaccine, and your body really decides to attack that spike protein that is in all the damn tissues
[10:06.120 --> 10:13.480]  of your body, your most reactive tissues in your ovaries, in your uterus, in your testicles,
[10:13.480 --> 10:19.880]  in your brain, in your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your heart will become a bloody mess.
[10:19.880 --> 10:25.160]  Your body will eat holes in itself. You will reject your body. You all heard of people
[10:25.160 --> 10:28.600]  getting a liver transplant. They got to give them anti-rejection drugs because the body's like,
[10:28.600 --> 10:35.080]  I don't know what this is. And then you've got all the rest of it. But I'm going to air a very
[10:35.080 --> 10:40.520]  special report here that just went live at band.video and freeworldnews.tv. It is an extremely
[10:40.520 --> 10:48.280]  powerful Greg Reese report dealing with the fact that we are all under globalist mind control.
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.920]  We must declare independence against it. And Britney Spears is a great case point example.
[11:02.520 --> 11:08.680]  Britney Spears and several other big names were groomed to star in the new Mickey Mouse Club
[11:08.680 --> 11:15.800]  during a time the company was rife with pedophiles. Dozens of Disney employees have been arrested
[11:15.800 --> 11:23.000]  for child sex crimes, including top executives and directors and in some cases rehired by Disney
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.200]  to work with children after doing extremely short jail time for raping a child actor.
[11:28.840 --> 11:35.160]  Former Disney Chairman and Democrat Senator George Mitchell was identified as a pedophile who visited
[11:35.160 --> 11:41.560]  Epstein Island. And before that, Ghislaine Maxwell was doing photo ops for Disney's Save the Children.
[11:42.120 --> 11:47.880]  Several former child stars have claimed that the industry is crawling with pedophiles. We have
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.640]  already heard many of their stories. If we can look at the evidence and overcome our emotions,
[11:53.640 --> 12:01.960]  we can see what this is. Trauma-based mind control programs such as MK Ultra and Project Monarch
[12:01.960 --> 12:08.200]  were revealed to the public via declassified documents in the 70s and again in the 90s with
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.520]  several victims giving testimony before Congress. The basis of these programs is the routine infliction
[12:14.520 --> 12:20.680]  of severe trauma upon a child in order to force their mind into a dissociative state, allowing
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.920]  them to be controlled without awareness. Up until the age of seven, children live mostly in a hypnotic
[12:26.920 --> 12:33.160]  state of mind when their sense of reality is being written, which explains why they target children,
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.000]  specifically those that come from abusive households. Bryce Taylor and Kathy O'Brien
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.120]  have each described in their books how they were regularly brought to Disneyland and Disney World,
[12:44.120 --> 12:48.600]  where they would be tortured and raped while being programmed with Disney stories,
[12:48.600 --> 12:54.280]  as well as Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. This has been verified in CIA documents.
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.640]  O'Brien says she was tortured in a room beneath Disney World, which we know was designed by agents
[12:59.640 --> 13:06.520]  of the CIA who were running this program at that time. Victims of these programs were sold into them
[13:06.520 --> 13:12.920]  by their abusive parents, a model we see today with parents pimping their children out to the
[13:12.920 --> 13:18.920]  entertainment industry. Britney's parents had her audition for Disney when she was eight years old,
[13:18.920 --> 13:24.840]  where she was then brought into the industry, sent to New York City for training, and brought on the
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.600]  show three years later at age 11, where she was dressed and directed to perform like an adult.
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.440]  The art of mind control was known as far back as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where people's
[13:36.440 --> 13:43.400]  belief systems were being created by illusions force-fed into their minds. Story. Our imagination
[13:43.400 --> 13:49.480]  has always been influenced by story. And if you can control the stories told to the public, you
[13:49.480 --> 13:55.480]  can control their imagination. Since the dawn of television, visual storytelling has been the most
[13:55.480 --> 14:02.840]  fundamental form of mind control in the modern world. Television. Movies. Videos. And since the
[14:02.840 --> 14:08.920]  beginning, we have been subjected to a long-term agenda of sexual subversion. As each generation
[14:08.920 --> 14:15.640]  is born, the stimuli becomes slightly more perverse. As the Mickey Mouse Club grew old,
[14:15.640 --> 14:21.480]  their young impressionable audience grew to perceive them as highly successful, while flaunting
[14:21.480 --> 14:28.680]  sexual promiscuity and sexual assault. You can destroy a society by destroying its sexual
[14:28.680 --> 14:35.400]  morality. This is fundamental in any society based on the family. When our children are naturally in
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.920]  this theta brainwave state of hypnotic learning, they should be protected within the family and
[14:40.920 --> 14:48.120]  learn from them, organically. But the emerging global state now being forced on us by multinational
[14:48.120 --> 14:55.320]  corporations and big banks want to destroy this society. They want to mold our children, exploit
[14:55.320 --> 15:01.480]  them, and even castrate them. It is now being promoted in highly produced inspirational show
[15:01.480 --> 15:07.480]  tunes. And they draft laws to help facilitate all of this. A Republican senator who has produced
[15:07.480 --> 15:12.600]  such films as Breeding Farm, about women being kidnapped and forcibly bred for babies to be
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.880]  sold on the black market before they are fed to cannibals, is pushing a bill to fund film and
[15:17.880 --> 15:24.680]  television. This is the new normal. This is the inverted reality being programmed into our minds.
[15:25.720 --> 15:31.080]  Decades of traumatic abuse has demonstrably hurt Britney Spears. The human mind can only
[15:31.080 --> 15:38.440]  handle so much for so long. Britney is a tragic symptom of society's indifference. Because if
[15:38.440 --> 15:45.320]  enough of us really wanted to, we could change all of this right now. For InForce.com, this is
[15:45.320 --> 16:15.240]  Greg Rees. It's Britney Spears. MKUltra and the destruction of America and then the world. It's live at Bandod Video. Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.

[17:06.240 --> 17:25.240]  That's 833-470-0438.
[17:25.240 --> 17:49.240]  I just wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother.
[17:49.240 --> 17:58.240]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[17:58.240 --> 18:11.240]  So we have free shipping, double patriot points through this weekend and our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60% off and your purchase funds the M4.
[18:11.240 --> 18:23.240]  But seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine. You need to experience it for yourself, takes two weeks to a month to kick in, try it and tell me what you think. You can't lose your fun in the M4.
[18:23.240 --> 18:36.240]  And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from research, I'm telling you I couldn't do what I do without deep breath crystal iodine and X2.
[18:36.240 --> 18:46.240]  But just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible. What it did for libido is incredible. When I don't take it, I feel the difference. When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[18:46.240 --> 19:09.240]  Take your X2 today, discounted the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take it under your tongue at infowarstore.com. The globalists hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful deep breath crystal iodine is.
[19:16.240 --> 19:29.240]  The sleeper must awaken.
[19:29.240 --> 19:38.240]  They can put you into a trance, a twilight daydream.
[19:38.240 --> 19:46.240]  They can manipulate you by increments until you finally wake up and are a demon possessed monster.
[19:46.240 --> 20:12.240]  The footage I'm going to roll some b-roll of here in just a moment of a man running around in California up the side of a building and attacking a church and setting the cross on fire.
[20:12.240 --> 20:31.240]  And jumping from building to building like someone out of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[20:31.240 --> 20:42.240]  This is happening all over the western world where you have drugs, pharmaceuticals, Hollywood.
[20:42.240 --> 20:54.240]  Man wearing only boxers and one sock climbs Los Angeles church, bell tower and lights cross on fire.
[20:54.240 --> 21:03.240]  There are hundreds of churches a week in Europe being burned, the majority have been burned to the ground.
[21:03.240 --> 21:20.240]  And when the Muslims and a consortium of devil worshipers just spiritually dialed into this force, go and burn them down, the news covers up that it was a targeted event like Notre Dame.
[21:20.240 --> 21:22.240]  Isn't that amazing?
[21:22.240 --> 21:40.240]  They are drawn when in that lowered state when their conscious mind and spirit has been removed from the controls to be nothing more than an avatar driven by a force that desires to burn down churches and rape children.
[21:40.240 --> 21:56.240]  And if you go to any Democrat event or you go to an Antifa event or you even go to a mainline pro-choice event, women in steppard-wife outfits will tell you they love Satan and start sticking their tongues out and licking their lips.
[21:56.240 --> 22:09.240]  And I mean we've caught it on tape countless times. I went when they had an event called Donald Trump, Alex Jones and the fake news, they shut down part of downtown a few years ago. I of course was not invited.
[22:09.240 --> 22:16.240]  They tried to police throw me out but the cops wouldn't do it. And so it was just open air in the street with a big stage.
[22:16.240 --> 22:32.240]  And men came over and began to tell me that they like to have sex with children and shake their butts at me. And they look like the men that you see in the quote, gay choir that says it's coming for your children, it's going to corrupt your children.
[22:32.240 --> 22:42.240]  And so when you're around these people, they're weak, they're pathetic, they're stupid, they look very unhealthy, they can be white, they can be black, they can be Hispanic, they're usually white.
[22:42.240 --> 22:55.240]  And they're all very, very nely. But that fake feminine spirit is just an act as a cover for what unbelievable monsters they are.
[22:55.240 --> 23:07.240]  These are ugly, gross men who are driven by a spirit that absolutely wants to destroy innocence and take these children down with them.
[23:07.240 --> 23:14.240]  Because when you look at these men and the looks in their faces and how they act, they are enslaved.
[23:14.240 --> 23:21.240]  There is a spirit in control of them. And it's hideous.
[23:21.240 --> 23:34.240]  And it doesn't want life on this earth. It wants to kill, steal, and destroy. It wants to make sure the children have no parents and can be swallowed into a satanic abyss by these individuals.
[23:34.240 --> 23:41.240]  The Washington Post said last week, take your children to gay pride parades and let them see the kink.
[23:41.240 --> 23:50.240]  Let them see people eating feces. Let them see people cutting themselves. Let them see people in bondage.
[23:50.240 --> 23:53.240]  And what is their response now that they've done this?
[23:53.240 --> 24:05.240]  Jay Min's chorus jokes about converting kids and Alex Jones pounces. They go on to say it was just a troll and that Alex Jones said kill everybody.
[24:05.240 --> 24:09.240]  I didn't know such thing. And so now the FBI has been called.
[24:09.240 --> 24:19.240]  Well, I mean, so many of the FBI are pedophiles now. Hell, they probably will be upset that I'm trying to get in the way of them and children.
[24:19.240 --> 24:30.240]  But, you know, you really should be calling the FBI on an organization of men meeting and saying we're coming to corrupt your children.
[24:30.240 --> 24:35.240]  We're coming for them. We're coming to get them. That's a pretty scary thing.
[24:35.240 --> 24:38.240]  What a group of men. But see, they all wear rainbow.
[24:38.240 --> 24:55.240]  I really like you. Highest rate of suicide, highest rate of hurting each other, totally unhappy because of the culture in and around it that is so incredibly disgusting and anti-human.
[24:55.240 --> 25:14.240]  It's a it's a pedophile army. And in my view, if the FBI rated the Gay San Francisco choir, I would bet that a large percentage of those men have child porn on their computers.
[25:14.240 --> 25:20.240]  And I bet a large percentage of them are sex offenders already.
[25:20.240 --> 25:27.240]  Like routinely, I said somebody's run the background check on this drag queen story time in Houston and both the men that lead it.
[25:27.240 --> 25:32.240]  Raped eight and nine year old separately in aggravated assault in both cases.
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.240]  Kidnap children, took one in a shed, bent him over and raped him at age eight.
[25:37.240 --> 25:45.240]  Other one basically go read the story, grab them and rape them as well.
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.240]  I mean, they'll grab your kid out of a backyard, they'll bend them over and they'll rape them.
[25:50.240 --> 25:56.240]  And in California, it's legal for them to give your child HIV or hepatitis knowingly.
[25:56.240 --> 26:02.240]  They call it bug chasing. They have even articles in Rolling Stone.
[26:02.240 --> 26:10.240]  Twenty years ago, about four Rolling Stone was a thousand percent evil saying, hey, gay men, you need to stop trying to give each other HIV and hepatitis.
[26:10.240 --> 26:20.240]  They call it gift givers and gift receivers and they want to give your child the gift of death because it's a death cult.
[26:20.240 --> 26:23.240]  I don't hate lesbians because they like women.
[26:23.240 --> 26:25.240]  I've been around the block a few times.
[26:25.240 --> 26:27.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I like women too.
[26:27.240 --> 26:30.240]  Hell, I was like saying, you've got a taste for red wine.
[26:30.240 --> 26:31.240]  So do I.
[26:31.240 --> 26:33.240]  It's not that the women like women.
[26:33.240 --> 26:39.240]  It's that everything that comes with it, the anti male, the anti family, the chip on the shoulder, the support of the police.
[26:39.240 --> 26:42.240]  What's wrong with you people?
[26:42.240 --> 26:54.240]  Why are you so into getting around kids with a bunch of pervert men just staring at these children like they're a lion and the child is a gazelle?
[26:54.240 --> 26:58.240]  These are just blasted beyond hell individuals.
[26:58.240 --> 27:08.240]  Creepy men dressed up like women, you know, like Psycho and Albert Hitchcock's Psycho dresses up like his mother.
[27:08.240 --> 27:10.240]  Because he killed her.
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.240]  Because she's in the basement stuffed.
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.240]  Psychologists know what all this is.
[27:16.240 --> 27:22.240]  And now, oh, the schools are having talks with your elementary students about, you're really a girl.
[27:22.240 --> 27:24.240]  We're going to give you a lot of attention because you are.
[27:24.240 --> 27:27.240]  We're going to send you to this gender reassignment thing.
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.240]  And if your parents don't like it, in most jurisdictions now, they will take your children from you.
[27:32.240 --> 27:40.240]  The CPS will and put them in another home with a bunch of these perverts that don't just want to stick their members in your children.
[27:40.240 --> 27:50.240]  They want to chop their testicles and penises off and chop little girls' breasts off because the end goal is to mutilate and attack what God created,
[27:50.240 --> 27:57.240]  the power of men and women coming together in our trillions of whatever endless years we've been here.
[27:57.240 --> 28:02.240]  Randy Dewright.
[28:02.240 --> 28:05.240]  Randy Dewright, thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[28:05.240 --> 28:08.240]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[28:08.240 --> 28:15.240]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.240]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[28:19.240 --> 28:25.240]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[28:25.240 --> 28:28.240]  I don't think I'm 55 years old.
[28:28.240 --> 28:36.240]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[28:36.240 --> 28:39.240]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[28:39.240 --> 28:47.240]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[28:47.240 --> 28:51.240]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[28:51.240 --> 28:57.240]  Anyway, it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[28:57.240 --> 29:04.240]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers in the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[29:04.240 --> 29:07.240]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[29:07.240 --> 29:09.240]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[29:09.240 --> 29:11.240]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[29:11.240 --> 29:13.240]  If you don't have food a month or so.
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.240]  But what's in that food? Iodine.
[29:15.240 --> 29:22.240]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate and the food itself is lacking.
[29:22.240 --> 29:30.240]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine and governments are lowering the allowances mostly you need to have because they want control.
[29:30.240 --> 29:33.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful.

[29:57.240 --> 30:00.240]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[30:00.240 --> 30:01.240]  It's very bittersweet.
[30:01.240 --> 30:04.240]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[30:04.240 --> 30:06.240]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[30:06.240 --> 30:08.240]  I care about beating the new world order.
[30:08.240 --> 30:13.240]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[30:13.240 --> 30:16.240]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[30:16.240 --> 30:18.240]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.240]  But let's just say this.
[30:19.240 --> 30:21.240]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[30:21.240 --> 30:23.240]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[30:23.240 --> 30:27.240]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[30:27.240 --> 30:28.240]  They're great products.
[30:28.240 --> 30:30.240]  Plus, they fund the operation.
[30:30.240 --> 30:33.240]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[30:33.240 --> 30:34.240]  Do they fund freedom?
[30:34.240 --> 30:35.240]  No, a lot of them don't.
[30:35.240 --> 30:39.240]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice.
[30:39.240 --> 30:41.240]  When the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[30:41.240 --> 30:43.240]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[30:43.240 --> 30:46.240]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[30:46.240 --> 30:49.240]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[30:49.240 --> 30:52.240]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[30:52.240 --> 30:54.240]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[30:54.240 --> 31:05.240]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[31:24.240 --> 31:35.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to plunge into all the news and tie it together here.
[31:35.240 --> 31:40.240]  The Satanism, the pedophilia, the open declaration of war against humanity,
[31:40.240 --> 31:44.240]  the externalization of Satan's plan here on this planet, the spiritual battle,
[31:44.240 --> 31:47.240]  the churches rolling over and doing nothing to fight it.
[31:47.240 --> 31:52.240]  And where this capitulation is going to take us very, very quickly.
[31:52.240 --> 31:56.240]  And just how hellish things are going to get before humanity finally wakes up
[31:56.240 --> 31:58.240]  and comes back up for air.
[31:58.240 --> 32:01.240]  That really is up to us. We have free will.
[32:01.240 --> 32:05.240]  But before I go any further, please remember it is viewers and listeners that keep
[32:05.240 --> 32:10.240]  this independent, powerful media operation on air.
[32:10.240 --> 32:14.240]  Info wars is reaching more people than ever before.
[32:14.240 --> 32:16.240]  We're more influential than ever before.
[32:16.240 --> 32:21.240]  What we talk about is being proven to be accurate and our credibility is exploding.
[32:21.240 --> 32:26.240]  And all glory goes to God.
[32:26.240 --> 32:31.240]  And I just want to thank the listeners who God's worked through with your action.
[32:31.240 --> 32:34.240]  You're spreading the word in all the different ways you do it.
[32:34.240 --> 32:38.240]  You have really taken action steadfastly.
[32:38.240 --> 32:41.240]  And I just want to thank you for keeping me in the fight.
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.240]  And when you're in the fight, you are just as important as I am or President Trump or anybody else.
[32:46.240 --> 32:49.240]  We can all sit there and, you know, say this person should have done better there
[32:49.240 --> 32:51.240]  or that person could have done better here. Doesn't matter.
[32:51.240 --> 32:54.240]  We love God. We love children. We love justice.
[32:54.240 --> 33:01.240]  And we're not backing down. We're not giving in because it is a spiritual attack that we are under.
[33:01.240 --> 33:05.240]  And evil wants us to accept it in the name of just being friends and being nice.
[33:05.240 --> 33:07.240]  But that's not what evil wants.
[33:07.240 --> 33:09.240]  It wants to enslave us and destroy us.
[33:09.240 --> 33:13.240]  And it uses those that it has under its control.
[33:13.240 --> 33:18.240]  Whether it's a heterosexual pedophile or a homosexual pedophile or whatever these people are,
[33:18.240 --> 33:21.240]  they have a desire.
[33:21.240 --> 33:23.240]  Like a man in the desert wants water.
[33:23.240 --> 33:25.240]  They want to destroy innocence.
[33:25.240 --> 33:28.240]  Like a man in the desert needs water.
[33:28.240 --> 33:31.240]  Or like a starving man needs bread.
[33:31.240 --> 33:33.240]  And it is their drive.
[33:33.240 --> 33:39.240]  And when you see Michael Abinadi and you see Hunter Biden and you see these people
[33:39.240 --> 33:42.240]  and they look like these husks.
[33:42.240 --> 33:44.240]  They look like jack-o-lanterns.
[33:44.240 --> 33:47.240]  There's like a flickering light coming out of their eye because it's not them.
[33:47.240 --> 33:49.240]  They're gone.
[33:49.240 --> 33:58.240]  Something is repulsive about them because your humanity sees that the lights are home.
[33:58.240 --> 34:01.240]  But nobody's home.
[34:01.240 --> 34:03.240]  To quote Mark Chestnut.
[34:03.240 --> 34:09.240]  So there isn't a place that you can buy products where it's going to have a bigger effect.
[34:09.240 --> 34:19.240]  These are dynamite high-end products that fund the Info War and will also change your life.
[34:19.240 --> 34:20.240]  Here's an example.
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.240]  Everybody likes green capsules, concentrated vegetables.
[34:26.240 --> 34:31.240]  Because it's known to be really good for your guts and fiber and processing.
[34:31.240 --> 34:34.240]  We have one finally after years of trying to get a really high-end one.
[34:34.240 --> 34:35.240]  It just came in.
[34:35.240 --> 34:37.240]  We'll be promoting it next week.
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.240]  It's the most expensive formula you could find anywhere.
[34:42.240 --> 34:45.240]  The amount of money that goes into each model, but we're still going to sell it at a very low price.
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.240]  Because most supplements have a five to six times markup.
[34:49.240 --> 34:51.240]  We don't do that.
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.240]  And still, just some crappy greens concentrates in these things.
[34:56.240 --> 34:57.240]  It helps people.
[34:57.240 --> 34:58.240]  People take it because it works.
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.240]  This is high-end quality concentrated.
[35:02.240 --> 35:08.240]  Everything we have is the highest quality we can get.
[35:08.240 --> 35:10.240]  And so it will end this weekend.
[35:10.240 --> 35:13.240]  We've extended the sale because people only buy stuff when it's on sale.
[35:13.240 --> 35:14.240]  I understand that.
[35:14.240 --> 35:16.240]  I'm the same way.
[35:16.240 --> 35:20.240]  Pre-shipping, double-patriot points will end this weekend.
[35:20.240 --> 35:22.240]  The free shipping will end this weekend.
[35:22.240 --> 35:23.240]  The double-patriot points will end this weekend.
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.240]  But I'm going to sell the X2 at 40% off until it is gone.
[35:28.240 --> 35:32.240]  And the current sales rates, that's at about two weeks because I have to get the money in here.
[35:32.240 --> 35:34.240]  Even though it will be months and months, the more it comes in.
[35:34.240 --> 35:36.240]  It's a good halogen, deeper crystal iodine.
[35:36.240 --> 35:39.240]  We've already sold out of the X3, or it's about to.
[35:39.240 --> 35:41.240]  It's called back to regular price.
[35:41.240 --> 35:43.240]  We've got turbo force, 40% off.
[35:43.240 --> 35:44.240]  It's about to sell out.
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.240]  Alpha power, 40% off.
[35:46.240 --> 35:47.240]  The Azov is 50% off.
[35:47.240 --> 35:48.240]  Polyblock, 40% off.
[35:48.240 --> 35:51.240]  Supermail vitality, residual vitality, 50% off.
[35:51.240 --> 35:52.240]  It's amazing.
[35:52.240 --> 35:53.240]  Cold pressed.
[35:53.240 --> 35:55.240]  That's the big difference.
[35:55.240 --> 35:57.240]  It's the same stuff that's in alpha power.
[35:57.240 --> 35:59.240]  But it takes five, six times.
[35:59.240 --> 36:04.240]  They tell me more of the herbs because it's cold pressed one time.
[36:04.240 --> 36:05.240]  It's like wine.
[36:05.240 --> 36:06.240]  It's never heated.
[36:06.240 --> 36:11.240]  And so technically, it's weaker than alpha power, but it's way stronger because you can't
[36:11.240 --> 36:14.240]  measure that live enzyme of these herbs and how they do it.
[36:14.240 --> 36:16.240]  It's the top place in the country.
[36:16.240 --> 36:18.240]  We probably label it and it goes on and on.
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.240]  But this is what all the elites and people take is supermail vitality under another name.
[36:22.240 --> 36:25.240]  It's been out for 50 years produced in Utah.
[36:25.240 --> 36:27.240]  And they're nice enough to let us do it.
[36:27.240 --> 36:29.240]  I'd call them liberals too, but they're not.
[36:29.240 --> 36:30.240]  They're like real liberals.
[36:30.240 --> 36:33.240]  They care about the earth and their health and they know about the new world order and
[36:33.240 --> 36:34.240]  all that.
[36:34.240 --> 36:37.240]  But it's definitely some high-end stuff.
[36:37.240 --> 36:39.240]  And then it just continues on from there.
[36:39.240 --> 36:44.240]  Infowarstore.com also has the ultimate krill oil, highest grade of krill oil, 40% off.
[36:44.240 --> 36:48.240]  Some comedians have had some fun with that and made some jokes about it.
[36:48.240 --> 36:50.240]  In fact, see if you can pull that up from yesterday, guys.
[36:50.240 --> 36:54.240]  It's like a 40-second clip of Alex Jones talking about krill oil.
[36:54.240 --> 36:55.240]  They get it wrong and say, fish oil.
[36:55.240 --> 36:56.240]  Fish oil is great too.
[36:56.240 --> 36:57.240]  We have high-end fish oil.
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.240]  But krill oil, the dreams you have when you take it, at least I and others do.
[37:01.240 --> 37:05.240]  And what it does, your cardiovascular system, your body, your brain, everything is just amazing.
[37:05.240 --> 37:11.240]  And then again, this is the highest grade of krill oil you're going to find out there.
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.240]  Did you guys find that comedian piece?
[37:13.240 --> 37:15.240]  I know I just sprung it on you.
[37:15.240 --> 37:20.240]  A little bit of comment relief, but I guess someone hearing this is like, wow, this sounds
[37:20.240 --> 37:22.240]  crazy, but it's really true.
[37:22.240 --> 37:27.240]  What's in high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil is just the next level.
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.240]  And again, this will give you the fish burps, which I don't like.
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.240]  But if you're not getting fish burps, folks, it's not the real deal.
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.240]  Anything out there that's telling you it's the real deal and doesn't give you fish burps,
[37:38.240 --> 37:40.240]  it's a byproduct that goes with it.
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.240]  And so I take it when I go to sleep at night.
[37:42.240 --> 37:44.240]  When I don't take it, I feel it.
[37:44.240 --> 37:45.240]  My dreams aren't as good.
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.240]  I mean, it's like a drug, literally, for me, krill oil and fish oil when they're high-end.
[37:50.240 --> 37:53.240]  Here's a comedian making a joke about it.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.240]  Dude, look at the camera.
[37:54.240 --> 37:55.240]  Do the whole thing.
[37:55.240 --> 37:56.240]  Go.
[37:56.240 --> 37:58.240]  Have you ever seen fish oil like this?
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.240]  I don't know.
[37:59.240 --> 38:00.240]  You haven't.
[38:00.240 --> 38:01.240]  You've always seen it all brown.
[38:01.240 --> 38:02.240]  This runs all yellowy.
[38:02.240 --> 38:08.240]  And the reason that you see it is because I want my audience to have goodwill.
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.240]  Because if you get that goodwill, I get your goodwill.
[38:12.240 --> 38:14.240]  Do you understand the book?
[38:14.240 --> 38:19.240]  This little pill right here is solid, gold, liquid consciousness.
[38:19.240 --> 38:20.240]  You don't believe me?
[38:20.240 --> 38:21.240]  Look it up.
[38:21.240 --> 38:25.240]  Look up fish oil and then buy it at Alec Jones dot com info wars.
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.240]  The world is a horror place with that man being shut out.
[38:30.240 --> 38:31.240]  You have to do it like this.
[38:31.240 --> 38:32.240]  Do it.
[38:32.240 --> 38:33.240]  Just do this.
[38:33.240 --> 38:34.240]  Again, that's a joke.
[38:34.240 --> 38:36.240]  I like that.
[38:36.240 --> 38:39.240]  And I will come on your podcast if you'd like.
[38:39.240 --> 38:41.240]  By the way, folks, I've always wanted to do comedy.
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.240]  Joe Rogan tells me I really need to do it.
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.240]  And I guess if I get good enough, I'll get to go on tour with Joe and Dave Chappelle.
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.240]  So I've got to go ahead, though, and go out there.
[38:53.240 --> 38:55.240]  Is that a joke, CNN?
[38:55.240 --> 38:58.240]  I know Brian Stelter's like, who's Alec Jones friends with?
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.240]  Who's he involved with?
[38:59.240 --> 39:02.240]  I'm supposed to tell you who you can talk to who you can.
[39:02.240 --> 39:08.240]  You think Brian Stelter will get jealous if I open up, say, a year from now for Joe
[39:08.240 --> 39:13.240]  Rogan to say 30,000 people in Dallas at the American Airlines Center or something like
[39:13.240 --> 39:14.240]  that.
[39:14.240 --> 39:16.240]  People think CNN would like that.
[39:16.240 --> 39:21.240]  Oh, let me tell you something else fun.
[39:21.240 --> 39:24.240]  Are you ready for pay-per-view?
[39:24.240 --> 39:26.240]  Alec Jones takes on 10 medgets.
[39:26.240 --> 39:28.240]  Oh, it's in the works.
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.240]  See, because I've decided this stuff is so serious, and this news is so out of control,
[39:33.240 --> 39:37.240]  that we also need to really screw with the global springs and have fun at the same time.
[39:37.240 --> 39:39.240]  Because we're not against fun.
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.240]  We're not against that.
[39:41.240 --> 39:42.240]  No, we're not.
[39:42.240 --> 39:43.240]  We're not against that.
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.240]  So I am going to start doing comedy.
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.240]  And we are doing it here on the air quite a bit.
[39:51.240 --> 39:53.240]  I can hear the news now.
[39:53.240 --> 39:57.240]  Jones admits he's an actor, and it's all fake because he does comedy.
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.240]  No, that's not how it works.
[40:02.240 --> 40:08.240]  You can be a radio talk show host and be very serious, and then you can go do a comedy piece.
[40:08.240 --> 40:10.240]  But they think the public's so dumb.
[40:10.240 --> 40:12.240]  Jones's lawyer admits he's all fake.
[40:12.240 --> 40:13.240]  Really?
[40:13.240 --> 40:15.240]  I've offered a million dollars for whoever can find that.
[40:15.240 --> 40:16.240]  It's not true.
[40:16.240 --> 40:17.240]  You see it all in the news every day.
[40:17.240 --> 40:19.240]  Oh, Jones admits he plays a character on air.
[40:19.240 --> 40:20.240]  No, I didn't.
[40:20.240 --> 40:21.240]  It's not true.
[40:21.240 --> 40:22.240]  This is me.
[40:22.240 --> 40:23.240]  This is Alec Jones.
[40:23.240 --> 40:24.240]  This is the real deal.
[40:24.240 --> 40:29.240]  But yes, when I play Cobra Commander to illustrate tyranny, Cobra Commander says,
[40:29.240 --> 40:31.240]  Take your vaccines.
[40:31.240 --> 40:38.240]  I'm obviously not trying to deceive you that Cobra Commander is real, or that Death Crow is real.
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.240]  Autobots rule out.
[40:40.240 --> 40:41.240]  I don't really think I'm Optimus Prime.
[40:41.240 --> 40:42.240]  I'm Alec Jones.
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.240]  We'll be right back, and I'm going to get into the really hardcore news on the other side.
[40:46.240 --> 40:51.240]  But I am intending to battle Medjits, so it'll be my greatest victory yet.
[40:51.240 --> 41:20.240]  Stay with us.
[41:21.240 --> 41:47.240]  We'll be right back, and we'll be right back.
[41:47.240 --> 42:13.240]  We'll be right back, and we'll be right back.
[42:13.240 --> 42:39.240]  We'll be right back.
[42:39.240 --> 43:03.240]  We know that the Satanic principalities of this planet want us poisoned.
[43:03.240 --> 43:04.240]  They want to attack our bodies.
[43:04.240 --> 43:08.240]  They want to kill us because we're made the image of God.
[43:08.240 --> 43:13.240]  God gave us the components of ourselves, of our bodies, to be strong.
[43:13.240 --> 43:15.240]  We've got everything we need.
[43:15.240 --> 43:19.240]  That's why the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine bromide.
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.240]  You name it, instead of iodine.
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.240]  Our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is deficient, and the average person is deficient.
[43:25.240 --> 43:30.240]  It attacks your IQ, it attacks your stamina, and your libido and fertility particularly.
[43:30.240 --> 43:31.240]  Look into it.
[43:31.240 --> 43:34.240]  We have the purest iodide you're going to find anywhere on the planet in X2,
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.240]  and it's discounted right now with free shipping for 40% off.
[43:37.240 --> 43:40.240]  In the dropper bottle, we have it for 60% off in the spray bottle.
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.240]  It's the exact same formula, but I want you to experience it yourself.
[43:43.240 --> 43:45.240]  If you've been on the fence about iodine, this is the best.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.240]  Try it today.
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.240]  It takes about 15 days to kick in.
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.240]  It's exclusively available at M4store.com right now, and it funds the M4.
[43:53.240 --> 43:57.240]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[43:57.240 --> 44:00.240]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long,
[44:00.240 --> 44:06.240]  because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[44:06.240 --> 44:10.240]  Because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.240]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.240]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage,
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.240]  a privacy pocket at M4store.com.
[44:21.240 --> 44:24.240]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[44:24.240 --> 44:30.240]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.240]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[44:33.240 --> 44:38.240]  We've got a private label with M4Wars on them for $14.95,
[44:38.240 --> 44:42.240]  because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family of these systems
[44:42.240 --> 44:46.240]  to educate them about what these, quote, smart phones really are.
[44:46.240 --> 44:49.240]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[44:49.240 --> 44:52.240]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know
[44:52.240 --> 44:54.240]  you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[44:54.240 --> 45:04.240]  They're 50% off right now at M4store.com.
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.240]  In studio with us in the third hour today.
[45:28.240 --> 45:30.240]  By the way, I just had the crew during the break saying,
[45:30.240 --> 45:35.240]  are you really going to fight 10 midgets, and is this going to be real or staged?
[45:35.240 --> 45:38.240]  And the answer is, no, that's in the works.
[45:38.240 --> 45:40.240]  With a big organization, big national group,
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.240]  they wanted me to do something like this for a while, and I said, what about midgets?
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.240]  And no, I mean, with boxing gloves, I think 10 of them will probably beat my ass pretty bad.
[45:48.240 --> 45:51.240]  And that's kind of the fun of the thing.
[45:51.240 --> 45:54.240]  And so for charity and stuff, it's also a good thing.
[45:54.240 --> 45:57.240]  And this is no joke.
[45:57.240 --> 46:01.240]  They would like me to secondly challenge Brian Skelter.
[46:01.240 --> 46:04.240]  Brian Skelter is one of the most loathed, hated people in the world.
[46:04.240 --> 46:09.240]  And so at a certain point, this is not a joke, by the way, being deadly serious here,
[46:09.240 --> 46:12.240]  Brian Skelter is going to be challenged by myself.
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.240]  And I don't know, Brian probably looks like a pretty big wimp to me.
[46:15.240 --> 46:18.240]  I'll give Brian two midgets.
[46:18.240 --> 46:21.240]  So I'll fight Brian with big, heavy gloves.
[46:21.240 --> 46:23.240]  He gets two extra midgets.
[46:23.240 --> 46:24.240]  He gets two.
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.240]  So that'll be my, you know, the handicap there in the match.
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.240]  Or maybe he wants to forego the midgets.
[46:31.240 --> 46:36.240]  Maybe he just thinks that he can, you know, because I mean, Cardiobasterly,
[46:36.240 --> 46:37.240]  I'm not in very good shape.
[46:37.240 --> 46:41.240]  I sit around too much, but I think I can beat Skelter in one round.
[46:41.240 --> 46:45.240]  I think I probably can beat the living snot out of him.
[46:45.240 --> 46:48.240]  In a loving way, in a sanctioned fight where he agrees to it,
[46:48.240 --> 46:50.240]  I would never assault Brian Skelter.
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.240]  The last thing I want is to assault Brian Skelter and turn him into a victim.
[46:54.240 --> 46:56.240]  Or maybe I'm a manager of midgets.
[46:56.240 --> 46:57.240]  He's a manager of midgets.
[46:57.240 --> 47:00.240]  And then we just have, who would be the heel though?
[47:00.240 --> 47:01.240]  Who would be the bad guy?
[47:01.240 --> 47:03.240]  I think Brian Skelter would need to be the bad guy.
[47:03.240 --> 47:05.240]  Or maybe I'd be the bad guy.
[47:05.240 --> 47:07.240]  You know what I'm doing right now?
[47:07.240 --> 47:09.240]  I don't really want to cover this news.
[47:09.240 --> 47:10.240]  I have a responsibility to do this.
[47:10.240 --> 47:13.240]  I'm really genuinely freaked out.
[47:13.240 --> 47:15.240]  And I've been coming to the grips with the fact that
[47:15.240 --> 47:18.240]  they really promise to bring in world government.
[47:18.240 --> 47:20.240]  And they've executed world government.
[47:20.240 --> 47:22.240]  And they promised to depopulate us.
[47:22.240 --> 47:23.240]  And they started it.
[47:23.240 --> 47:24.240]  And they had to start somewhere.
[47:24.240 --> 47:27.240]  And they had to go from just fluoride the dumbest down and make us infertile
[47:27.240 --> 47:32.240]  and give us cancer to just outright giving us a shot that kills a good percentage of people
[47:32.240 --> 47:35.240]  and then maims others and then kills them down the road.
[47:35.240 --> 47:38.240]  And it's all the literature and it's everywhere.
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.240]  And I do want to just run off the mountains and go fly fishing
[47:42.240 --> 47:44.240]  and just forget any of this ever happened.
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.240]  Here's the problem.
[47:45.240 --> 47:46.240]  They're not going to let you do that.
[47:46.240 --> 47:49.240]  I mean, you know with the contact tracers and all this
[47:49.240 --> 47:51.240]  that they're going to come to their political enemies' houses.
[47:51.240 --> 47:54.240]  They've already said we're going to Republican areas
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.240]  because they're the ones refusing.
[47:56.240 --> 47:58.240]  It's all being done day one.
[47:58.240 --> 48:00.240]  Strike forces.
[48:00.240 --> 48:01.240]  What are the terms?
[48:01.240 --> 48:03.240]  Strike forces.
[48:03.240 --> 48:05.240]  We're going to go door to door.
[48:05.240 --> 48:06.240]  We're going to hunt you down.
[48:06.240 --> 48:08.240]  These are quotes.
[48:08.240 --> 48:10.240]  We have all Bloomberg.
[48:10.240 --> 48:13.240]  We have administration officials saying we have every right to your personal data.
[48:13.240 --> 48:15.240]  Have you been inoculated or not?
[48:15.240 --> 48:17.240]  We paid for it after all.
[48:17.240 --> 48:18.240]  That's a quote.
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.240]  And we're going to come to your house whether you like it or not.
[48:22.240 --> 48:23.240]  I mean, these are quotes.
[48:23.240 --> 48:25.240]  Would you like me to play the video?
[48:25.240 --> 48:27.240]  We're going to hunt you down.
[48:27.240 --> 48:29.240]  You're like, oh, well, that's Australia.
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.240]  That's New Zealand.
[48:30.240 --> 48:31.240]  That's Spain.
[48:31.240 --> 48:32.240]  No, that's here.
[48:32.240 --> 48:33.240]  That's Canada.
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.240]  That's starting now.
[48:35.240 --> 48:38.240]  I mean, to play the head of the UN directive saying on a planetary scale,
[48:38.240 --> 48:39.240]  they're going to do this.
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.240]  It's all happening.
[48:43.240 --> 48:49.240]  And that's why signature reduction is so incredibly important, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:49.240 --> 48:55.240]  Signature reduction is beyond important because we want to stop this political takeover.
[48:55.240 --> 48:57.240]  We want to stop this authoritarian drive.
[48:57.240 --> 49:03.240]  But at the same time, we also want to frustrate your criminal operations at every level we can.
[49:03.240 --> 49:05.240]  So let me hit you with just some of these headlines.
[49:05.240 --> 49:11.240]  I'm going to drill back into this and tie it into the pedophile explosion and all the rest of it.
[49:11.240 --> 49:12.240]  But here it is.
[49:12.240 --> 49:20.240]  Mom 45 who got a job at John Hopkins Hospital dies after reaction to work mandated COVID vaccine.
[49:20.240 --> 49:23.240]  She said she didn't want it, but they made her take it.
[49:23.240 --> 49:28.240]  And then days that were taking the second shot, her family said on Facebook,
[49:28.240 --> 49:32.240]  she started having convulsions, was hospitalized, her brain swole up.
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.240]  They put her on a ventilator and she died.
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.240]  By the way, even the Times of Israel reports 80 plus percent.
[49:40.240 --> 49:44.240]  And guys, I know I sent that to you, but I think I lost it in my stack.
[49:44.240 --> 49:47.240]  Just reprint me that because I actually sent you the article.
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.240]  It's actually a photo of the Times of Israel where I don't have the actual number.
[49:51.240 --> 49:52.240]  It was like 84%, 85%.
[49:52.240 --> 50:00.240]  I forget of the people in the hospital with COVID and those dying of COVID have had the vaccine.
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.240]  So they're going, oh, the vaccine doesn't work.
[50:03.240 --> 50:04.240]  People are dying of COVID.
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.240]  No, the vaccine kills you.
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.240]  And then they say it's COVID.
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.240]  This is so diabolical, but excuse me.
[50:13.240 --> 50:20.240]  Mom 45 who got job at John Hopkins Hospital dies after reaction to work mandated COVID vaccine.
[50:20.240 --> 50:22.240]  You ought to read about her, ought to read her Facebook.
[50:22.240 --> 50:23.240]  But you better read it quick.
[50:23.240 --> 50:28.240]  Most people that die, they take their Facebooks down because, you know, you can't humanize the folks being killed.
[50:28.240 --> 50:31.240]  You've got to make sure you cover up the murder.
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.240]  Got to make sure you don't organize the people so that they don't know what's hitting them.
[50:35.240 --> 50:38.240]  Beautiful young Italian girl killed by vaccine.
[50:38.240 --> 50:40.240]  A bunch of big articles on this.
[50:40.240 --> 50:43.240]  We've got it up at infowars.com as well.
[50:43.240 --> 50:48.240]  Surgeon, the brain surgeon who operated on the young Italian vaccine victim says,
[50:48.240 --> 50:50.240]  you've never seen anything like this.
[50:50.240 --> 50:53.240]  The brain swole up so bad with thrombosis.
[50:53.240 --> 50:59.240]  I've never seen a brain affected by such an extensive severe thrombosis.
[50:59.240 --> 51:03.240]  So they, they, they remove the top of her head and she's just in there.
[51:03.240 --> 51:08.240]  They're, you know, they spring sailing on the brain so it doesn't get damaged too much when it's out the open.
[51:08.240 --> 51:15.240]  They put a plastic bag over it and then she survived a few days and just kept swelling and swelling and swelling and she died.
[51:15.240 --> 51:27.240]  And there's the Delta Pfizer shot studied in Israel and then it goes on to report that again, the vast majority of people again who were sick with COVID had the COVID shot.
[51:27.240 --> 51:30.240]  They don't look doing together, of course.
[51:30.240 --> 51:34.240]  So let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:34.240 --> 51:39.240]  Let's go to this next report surgeon who operated on young Italian vaccine victim.
[51:39.240 --> 51:42.240]  You have never seen anything like this continuing.
[51:42.240 --> 51:45.240]  Biden administration official. Absolutely.
[51:45.240 --> 51:49.240]  The government's business to know that's a quote, whether you've been vaccinated or not.
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.240]  See, they just broke down that whole wall of your medical privacy and they're going to share it with everybody.
[51:53.240 --> 52:01.240]  And that's just the way it is with restaurants, with everybody, with businesses, just a big gang of corporations, raping the living snot out of you with government.
[52:01.240 --> 52:04.240]  Another one.
[52:04.240 --> 52:15.240]  Video CNN doctors says it's time to start mandating. Yes. And France is saying they're all saying it's time to make you take an experimental deadly shot.
[52:15.240 --> 52:18.240]  By the way, I never played this two days ago. You guys had the clip.
[52:18.240 --> 52:34.240]  Pro dig it up for me. Pentagon says the poultry COVID injections coming. And then they admit, but we're waiting till it's FDA approved, which they'll probably never do because they got to keep it experimental and secret to cover up all the data.
[52:34.240 --> 52:44.240]  But oh, wait, I thought it was approved. Safe and effective. I've heard that 85 trillion times. Here is the Pentagon press briefing.
[52:44.240 --> 52:56.240]  What are you going to do regarding the COVID vaccine once the FDA fully approves it? Are there preparations in the works for making it mandatory once FDA approval does come through?
[52:56.240 --> 53:03.240]  I want to get ahead of the FDA right now. It's being used under emergency youth authorization, which makes it a voluntary vaccine.
[53:03.240 --> 53:14.240]  Should the FDA approve it, then I am certain that Pentagon leadership will take a look at what our options are going forward, including the potential option of making mandatory.
[53:14.240 --> 53:22.240]  But I'm not going to get too far ahead of process right now. It is an FDA. It is not FDA approved. And therefore it is still a voluntary vaccine.
[53:22.240 --> 53:31.240]  I would like to add that as we speak, almost 69% of DOD personnel have received at least one dose.
[53:31.240 --> 53:40.240]  And a lot of them have died. Okay, so that's enough. So there you go. And all over Twitter, all over Facebook, everywhere, I just see it. Alex Jones is lying. It's approved. It's safe.
[53:40.240 --> 53:48.240]  Nobody's getting hurt. Oh, nobody's. Nobody's getting getting hurt, huh? Young girl dies that we're taking vaccine.
[53:48.240 --> 53:56.240]  British rock star refuses to be part of government experiment. They call the public events now a government experiment site and everyone's in an experiment.
[53:56.240 --> 54:10.240]  I'll cover that next hour. But all over the world, bars can now fully reopen if they ask for vaccine cards or negative COVID test, making you be an indentured servant of the Hawaiian government, of the British government.
[54:10.240 --> 54:19.240]  This is all totally illegal with a digital ID to buy and sell. I mean, this is the mark of the beast, total control.
[54:19.240 --> 54:26.240]  And I'm going to get into these bills titled 666. One of them is already law. Wait to hear about what's going to happen there coming up.
[54:26.240 --> 54:33.240]  And of course, lockdowns are being reinstated all over the world. We told you that would happen. And now Biden's considering new lockdowns, new hysteria, new lies.
[54:33.240 --> 54:40.240]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the next hour. I'm going to open the phones up for calls. Michael Malist is going to be in studio, a really smart guy.
[54:40.240 --> 54:52.240]  Separately, don't forget, God gave us all the defenses we need in nature. The biggest thing people are deficient in is iodine. We have the purest, cleanest iodine for ingestion, both in a spray bottle, in into your mouth.
[54:52.240 --> 55:02.240]  Very same stuff as X2. It's the same thing. That's 60% off. And then we have 40% off on the dropper bottle because, again, we've got more of that.
[55:02.240 --> 55:07.240]  But we're going to run out of the spray bottle and it's 60% off in probably four or five days. We're going to run out of the other about two weeks.
[55:07.240 --> 55:13.240]  We're going to sell it all out until it sells out because I want you to get it. But the free shipping and double-patriot points on it is going to end this weekend.
[55:13.240 --> 55:21.240]  But we are going to run out of X2 spray and X2 dropper at 60% and 40% off, respectively, at infowarstore.com.
[55:21.240 --> 55:26.240]  But I'm going to keep them on sale until they run out. Experience it for yourself. No more excuses. And it funds the info war.
[55:26.240 --> 55:36.240]  And there's a bunch of other stuff that's going to end the sale this weekend that will no longer be on sale like Turboforce, Alpapower, Vazo Beach, Pollen Block, Ultimate Crill Oil, and others.
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.240]  Those are all going to go off sale this weekend. So take advantage of it now. We'll be back in hour number two.
[55:46.240 --> 55:53.240]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido for life.
[55:53.240 --> 55:58.240]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months. So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[55:58.240 --> 56:04.240]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so. If you don't have food, a month or so. But what's in that food? Iodine.
[56:04.240 --> 56:14.240]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate. And the food itself is lacking. That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine.
[56:14.240 --> 56:18.240]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposedly going to need to have because they want control.
[56:18.240 --> 56:28.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful. Our products are just as powerful. Experience clean iodine today. It's discounted 40% off of the dropper bottle, 60% off of the spray bottle.
[56:28.240 --> 56:34.240]  You take it to your mouth, pure atomic iodine, with free shipping, double patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[56:34.240 --> 56:39.240]  Don't wait any longer. Just like our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful. They don't want you to experience this.
[56:39.240 --> 56:46.240]  Get it today at infowarstore.com. Take action. Find out what you're missing. Get the missing link. Get X2.
[56:47.240 --> 56:55.240]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast. Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[56:55.240 --> 57:02.240]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[57:02.240 --> 57:08.240]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[57:08.240 --> 57:20.240]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[57:20.240 --> 57:27.240]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[57:27.240 --> 57:37.240]  So pray for us. Word of mouth. Tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[57:37.240 --> 57:51.240]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[57:51.240 --> 57:59.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:59.240 --> 58:08.240]  Human is a natural defense mechanism of the body and times are bad to lighten up and it's very important to do.
[58:08.240 --> 58:14.240]  So as dark as times are and as serious as are, hey, we know the Bible's real, we know the antichrist is real, we know how it all ends.
[58:14.240 --> 58:18.240]  So we've got to maintain positivity and not let the enemy get us down.
[58:18.240 --> 58:25.240]  But they are coming with the contact tracers and I told you yesterday I would break down what this is going to look like, how this is going to unfold.
[58:25.240 --> 58:31.240]  But it takes some real mental stress to make me actually focus on this and say all this.
[58:31.240 --> 58:33.240]  And I'm not being dramatic. I'm serious.
[58:33.240 --> 58:39.240]  So I'm going to be a big boy and I'm going to come back and tell you what I think they're going to do and what's going to unfold the next few years.
[58:39.240 --> 58:43.240]  And it's really horrible and I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, but the truth will set us free.
[58:43.240 --> 58:46.240]  Here's John Bowne's report. It's an important prelude to this.
[58:46.240 --> 58:53.240]  We now have major leaders in Canada saying they're using COVID to bring in martial law to silence dissent.
[58:53.240 --> 58:59.240]  They say it in national TV press conferences. They are going public with tyranny.
[58:59.240 --> 59:12.240]  And now Biden has launched the COVID tracking teams in the name of the Delta tracking teams, the Delta plus variant tracking teams coming door to door to harass the unvaccinated.
[59:12.240 --> 59:14.240]  This is the iron fist.
[59:14.240 --> 59:24.240]  I'm here to talk to you today about the Delta variant that causes COVID-19.
[59:24.240 --> 59:27.240]  Well, anyone who was not vaccinated is most at risk.
[59:27.240 --> 59:31.240]  Younger people are less likely to be vaccinated.
[59:31.240 --> 59:37.240]  That puts the entire cohort of younger people at greater risk.
[59:37.240 --> 59:41.240]  We need everyone to get vaccinated.
[59:41.240 --> 59:49.240]  Do this together. By July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to celebrate Independence Day.
[59:49.240 --> 59:53.240]  That will make this Independence Day something truly special.
[59:53.240 --> 59:59.240]  When I got vaccinated, the first thing on my mind was I can finally see my friends and go out to dinner.
[59:59.240 --> 1:00:01.240]  I feel more comfortable taking our children out and about.
[1:00:01.240 --> 1:00:02.240]  See my family.
[1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:04.240]  Hugging my grandchildren again.
[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:06.240]  Being out together, being fully vaccinated.
[1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:10.240]  Being vaccinated means I can walk at my college graduation.
[1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:12.240]  I was able to marry the girl of my dreams.
[1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:17.240]  We tend to use the word isolation for someone who is a case confirmed.
[1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:23.240]  We tend to use the word quarantine for someone who's at risk of being a case, usually a contact.
[1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:32.240]  So on that basis, we advise that all suspect cases are tested and all suspect cases are isolated in an appropriate medical facility.
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:39.240]  In low incidence areas, whether as sporadic cases or clusters, we advise that all contacts should be quarantined.
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:44.240]  Ideally, that quarantine should occur in a place other than the home.
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:53.240]  They did that with community workers, with public health workers, visiting the houses, checking on people, checking their health status every day and saying,
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:56.240]  how are you? Have you got a fever? Have you got a cough?
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:01.240]  And if a contact has developed a cough or a fever, they were taken immediately for testing.
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:11.240]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:14.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how sick these people are.
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.240]  Casting themselves as the heroes, the rest of us as the evil disease spreaders.
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:30.240]  And now, Biden and White House deploy Delta variant response teams across the U.S. to communities with low vaccination rates.
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:38.240]  And they're going to force their way into homes and, quote, force people to be tested with fraudulent machines that are 94% false positive.
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:47.240]  And it's far worse than that already in Europe, Canada, places like Australia, where they have been arresting people for a year, that protest online.
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:50.240]  Now you're under arrest in relation to incitement.
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:51.240]  Incitement?
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:54.240]  A young mother still in her pyjamas is cuffed.
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:57.240]  What on earth? Excuse me, what on earth?
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:01.240]  Slapped with a search warrant in front of her partner and young children.
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:03.240]  I think it's ultrasound in an hour.
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:04.240]  Yeah, she's pregnant.
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:15.240]  But Ballarat detectives were determined to question Zoe Buehler after the 28-year-old allegedly created this Freedom Day Facebook event, asking her friends to remember the 5th of September.
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:17.240]  I wasn't breaking any laws, by the way.
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:19.240]  You are, actually. You are pregnant.
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:21.240]  Well, that's why I'm arresting you.
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:22.240]  How can you arrest her?
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:24.240]  I'm arresting my two children.
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:36.240]  The former cleaner, turned candle maker, has posted that COVID is a hoax, and police alleged she was behind an anti-lockdown demonstration similar to those planned in major cities across the world this Saturday.
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:39.240]  They also censored medical treatments, medical doctors.
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:49.240]  This is a giant exercise in raping our freedoms, raping our speech, raping our bodies, enforcing their deadly gene therapies into us.
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:54.240]  I got mainstream news going. We don't know why they're doing that. I mean...
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:32.240]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:42.240]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:50.240]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:04:16.240]  It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:29.240]  Okay, so Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Lauren Buffett, and there's hundreds of these people that have been in the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times.
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:43.240]  We've done countless reports on it. We've shown you the articles on air where they say we're establishing a corporate system to help world government carry out an orderly dignified depopulation because there's too many people.
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:51.240]  And granted, you go to some areas that squalor, they're poor, it's falling apart, poor people are having 10 kids, I don't like it, it's not good.
[1:04:51.240 --> 1:05:06.240]  But then you look at Bill Gates and the globalist, they're the most exploitive, evil, horrible people that promote all these other evil globalist agendas of sexualizing children and pedophilia and the destruction of the family.
[1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:20.240]  And you realize this isn't the top eugenics of let's strengthen the race of humanity by promoting breeding of individuals with higher IQs or things like this.
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:27.240]  And of course that leads to hell. We know where that goes. That's why it's been rejected by the general public. We had major wars over it.
[1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:35.240]  But now it's back. And it's literally trying to sterilize our children. It's trying to force deadly things into our bodies.
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:40.240]  And so if we can put the headline up for today's show, it says it all right there.
[1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:49.240]  The globalists have triggered their planetary depopulation operation that they promised they were going to do.
[1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:54.240]  And so everybody's having this moment where they're going, wait a minute.
[1:05:54.240 --> 1:06:05.240]  I heard this from Alex Jones and I heard this from countless other quote, crazy right-wingers in the last 40, 50 years.
[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:12.240]  And we never checked into it because that's just preposterous. That's not, you know, they're not putting fluoride in the water to lower our IQs.
[1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:29.240]  And then you get Obama's White House Tsar, John P. Holdren, who co-wrote the big 1100-page textbook Ecoscience published in 1974 that is a Ph.D. level book for the elites on how to carry out world government and depopulation
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:36.240]  and how inoculations and fluoride in the water will be used to lower fertility and IQ.
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:46.240]  I mean, they tell you what they're doing. And I guess their argument is that if you don't care while they're doing this, you deserve it.
[1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:53.240]  And I've told you on that off-record discussions with globalists at the next to the highest level.
[1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:58.240]  I mean, head of the Kissinger Group, you know, heads of other major institutions.
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:09.240]  And I only talk about the Kissinger Group because the guy did it on record in front of my producer and tried to get me to go to, you know, New York and be seduced by the CFR and the rest of it.
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:13.240]  The other times it was even more bold, more bold.
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:21.240]  And most people get that speech and they bow down to it because they want the private jets and they want the money and they want the power and they want whatever,
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:28.240]  but they lose their humanity in the process. And they're very, very empty, unhappy people in my experience. They don't have joy.
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:33.240]  They don't have real empowerment and they're also not given discernment.
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:38.240]  So this is the new world order takeover. This is the world ID. This is the implantable microchip.
[1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:42.240]  Plosh Wabba said it. This is the banning small businesses.
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:49.240]  This is the persecuting and herding and attacking those that haven't been injected with this experimental garbage.
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:54.240]  This is the rollout and you see the areas that accept it. The lockdown never ends.
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:08:00.240]  Oh, sorry, the shots don't work. Got to take more. They've held everyone hostage.
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  And it's all been directed by a handful of Fortune 100 companies and the United Nations, and they've been very successful suppressing treatments.
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:12.240]  They've been very successful suppressing the truth. They've been very successful.
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:20.240]  And all over the world, they are coming and arresting people who they say have tested positive for COVID and taking them to government facilities and disappearing.
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:27.240]  This is footage out of Latin America. And now they're starting forced inoculations in Australia of schoolchildren and others.
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:32.240]  And it's illegal. But the government said, oh, it's for the good. Shut up.
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  So this is a revolution against your health privacy, a revolution against every bulwark, every speed hump, every impediment to absolute total tyranny by a group of self appointed globalists that say they're doing this to save the earth.
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:56.240]  But really what they're doing is doing it to get total control over humanity and do whatever they want with us because they enjoy that power.
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:05.240]  And so now you hear, oh, in Bloomberg and in BBC and in AP and hey, we should force people to take shots.
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:20.240]  And hey, children need to take it. They're little bug factories and oh, you all got to just keep wearing masks forever because they want to introduce this dystopia because the evil wants to promote pedophilia.
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:26.240]  They want access to children. That's what their spirit wants to destroy innocence.
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:34.240]  And just like you might enjoy a veal chop because it tastes so tender and good, they spiritually see your children as a veal chop.
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:39.240]  And they know we're organizing against them. They know we were destroying their networks.
[1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:55.240]  They know we were bringing them down and getting patriots and Christian nationalists elected all over the world that see the spiritual colonialism of this New World Order rainbow flag transhumanist takeover.
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:59.240]  The human cloning that Congress wouldn't even ban.
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:06.240]  It's going on. The human animal hybrids. It's all here and they want a license to do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:16.240]  And their microchip, just like Rockefeller told Aaron Russo when he was a big Hollywood producer making Eddie Murphy movies, he said, we're all going to have a chip that says, kiss my ass.
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:21.240]  I can go anywhere I want, do whatever I want. I'll be tax exempt. I'll be above the law.
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:28.240]  And now you see it with Hunter Biden and his dad and the rest of them. And now they're on TV saying on 60 Minutes, we're going to put chips in all the troops.
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  I'll say we're already putting chips in all the military years ago. Now they want to put brain chips on them. Now they want to give you behavioral vaccines.
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:42.240]  That just means something you're injected with. You can call shooting somebody with a gun a vaccine. You're injecting lead into them.
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:47.240]  They're injecting systems that go in and reprogram your very cells.
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:56.240]  And most importantly, they're killing and maiming people and getting away with it to see what else you'll accept.
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:06.240]  And so they're going to start rolling out the contact tracers as they've already done it in Europe, as they've already done it in Australia, as they've already done it in Latin America, where they come to your door.
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:13.240]  And they say, your neighbor said you were coughing. We've got a report. You were sick. No, I'm fine. You don't have a warrant got in my house.
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:21.240]  Well, under the emergency code, we don't need a warrant. Come outside. And they've got a little credit card reader machine. It's a total fraud.
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:28.240]  They stick. Lord knows what up your nose. They stick at the machine. Two minutes later, it says they can turn up to 40 cycles.
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:35.240]  She'll be basically 100% false positive. And oh, sorry, because the computer will tell them we're going to go at 40 cycles.
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.240]  You're a good little globalist and they'll come to your house and test you.
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:50.240]  And now they've got a perfect excuse to disappear you and get used to vans driving around, grabbing people and all the Democrats and all the leftists that went to college in Europe and Latin America and Africa and Asia everywhere.
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:58.240]  They go to these UN certified schools to learn how to be social workers, to be in AmeriCorps or to be in the Peace Corps.
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:06.240]  And now that's that civilian domestic army Obama talked about just as big, just as strong as the military. And it's not there to take your guns right away.
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:10.240]  It's not there to, no, no, it's there to save you. It's there to make sure you take the shot.
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:14.240]  It's there to see if you're sick and go in your home and take you out and take you away.
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:20.240]  And sure, that was all in the UN plans years ago. It was in the Rockefeller plan lockstep 11 years ago.
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:28.240]  But now, now it's operational, you see. And so Biden last week said in the press conference, yeah, we're going to go to Republican areas.
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:35.240]  They're making this political. This is not political. Of course, it's totally political. And so we're going to areas we have the zip codes.
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:40.240]  We know who's not been given shots and then the Health and Human Services Secretary said, I've got the clip. We'll play it next segment.
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:46.240]  We've got a database of who's had the shot and who hadn't. And we've integrated it in with the Census Bureau.
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.240]  And we're coming to your house because we know you didn't have it.
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:58.240]  I mean, this is government contact with you. And now, oh, it's a law enforcement legislation. We'll cover that next segment.
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:07.240]  Oh, and why not $2 billion for capital security, $2 billion additional dollars. Oh, you know what we're going to do now?
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:19.240]  We're going to set up at all 50 states starting in Florida and California, this new legislative police force that goes out and goes after people that are criticizing members of Congress or anybody else.
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:23.240]  And any criticism they're saying is radicalization and it's terrorism.
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  So they're creating a new domestic anti-terror force that literally works for the Democrats and has all been announced.
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:38.240]  See, we went off the edge of a cliff. We're free falling now. And lying about it to yourselves isn't going to make it any better.
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:46.240]  Admitting what's happening and organizing against it is. I'm going to explain this when we come back, but this is the heart of everything.
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:49.240]  I'm going to cover on the other side of this quick break. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:14:00.240]  infowars.com, newswars.com. Tomorrow's news today.

[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:12.240]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass. But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:27.240]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move. And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:47.240]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:54.240]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money. And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:20.240]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:31.240]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:44.240]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect sacredicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:54.240]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the Enforce Store. Never been a better time than right now. Super Male Vitality at EnforceStore.com.
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:00.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:02.240]  Let's go.
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:55.240]  So we are now under UN Global Control, the corporations that financed and created the UN, the Rockefeller system.
[1:17:55.240 --> 1:18:01.240]  And it is designed to bring in planetary world government, transhumanism and depopulation.
[1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:14.240]  And it needs a pretext to arrest people, disappear people, forcibly test people, put out our medical records, share it on giant databases, make you give your medical records to people at restaurants or at baseball games.
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  And they're saying, hey, we want to make it mandatory. Remember, oh, it'll never be mandatory. Listen to Alex Jones.
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:30.240]  And of course, it was always planned to be mandatory so that we wouldn't form opposition and say, hey, we don't want mandatory or, hey, your vaccine doesn't even work.
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:42.240]  I told you it wouldn't work. They call every cold COVID. You can't make a vaccine for all the cold viruses unless you make it for the protein, which is in your body, which then you get attacked.
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:56.240]  I mean, this is so 101. They knew what they did. They did it by design. And it's just such a giant crime. And it's so naked. It's so out in the open that I personally am completely blown away.
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:04.240]  I mean, I knew it was coming. I knew they said they'd do it. I know they've been caught doing thousands of illegal tests, legal tests on poor people all over the world.
[1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:19.240]  But now they hit the industrialized world with a depopulation weapon, which will then bankrupt everybody as they slowly die, which will then funnel all your money through the medical system back to the globalist.
[1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:26.240]  So it's all about control, all about centralizing the economy, making you obsolete, non-essential. They told you you're non-essential.
[1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:39.240]  Like in the science fiction movie, The Aliens Land, they say, you are obsolete. You will be eliminated. But they're telling you this like they're there to save you while they tell you you're obsolete.
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:52.240]  So they're announcing just, oh, $2 billion. Statutorily, it's illegal. Federal law says DC police can't be outside DC. We don't care. We're just doing it.
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:20:02.240]  We don't care it's illegal to open the borders up and let people smuggle kids in with no IDs and just give them whoever they want, but they're doing it.
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:11.240]  It's illegal to do this on every single front, but they're just doing it. So of course they're setting up with $2 million of your money. Capital police.
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:23.240]  Oh, who's that? Oh, that's the capital police. You're out in the middle of Kansas. Oh, who pulled me over? Oh, I'm the federal police, the federal police force.
[1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:31.240]  All tentacles of the FBI and the Justice Department. And what, they just busted another FBI agent being a pedophile like yesterday?
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:41.240]  It's like every couple of days now. And it's not that FBI agents are pedophiles. It's that pedophiles are taking everything over. It's a cult.
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:46.240]  We're going to get your kids. We're going to corrupt them. We're going to get them no matter what you do. We're coming for your children.
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:54.240]  Hey, don't come for my children. Oh, you're threatening us. We're victims. We're just a bunch of men that want your children.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:01.240]  It's not any problem. Our flags are just everywhere. We're just forcing it on you everywhere.
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:12.240]  So here it is, the HR666 Anti-Racism in Public Health Act. Oh my gosh. Well, I'm not for racism then.
[1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:27.240]  Because here, conduct, analyze data and administer research and grant program to address racism and the impact of health and well-being with all of your medical records from the CDC, the National Center for Anti-Racism.
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:31.240]  That's from the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL with your medical records.
[1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:39.240]  So the FBI, the Justice Department, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, they've already got all your records. They're already in all your iPhone apps and in your Twitter and Facebook.
[1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:42.240]  They're the moderators that read your private messages. You can trust them.
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:51.240]  Same folks that can listen in over the little digital assistance from Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and Amazon.
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:22:01.240]  The bill establishes within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a National Center for Anti-Racism and Health and a Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program.
[1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:16.240]  Among other activities, the new center must declare racism a public health issue, collect and analyze data. Oh, they get your medical records and administer research and grant programs to address racism and the impact of health and well-being.
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:23.240]  Because the health department was set up in New York first by Margaret Sanger to quote, exterminate black weeds. But now they really love you.
[1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:41.240]  Additionally, the bill specifically directs the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in coordination with the Department of Justice and other relevant stakeholders to carry out the Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program by conducting research and supporting
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:56.240]  officers and other activities pertaining to law enforcement, violence and public health. So, contact tracers, your medical records with the ADL, with the Southern Poverty Law Center, with Health and Human Services,
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:05.240]  interfacing your local health department, seamless surveillance control, legalizing the surveillance state they've already had for decades that's so illegal.
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:16.240]  They've committed all these crimes. They're pedophiles, folks, and they know it's all coming out. And so now they're just rushing to legalize it all, hoping that they don't all go to prison.
[1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:34.240]  And then that, of course, is House Resolution 666. Oh, here's another one, HR 6666. This became law. COVID-19 testing, reaching and contacting everyone, TRACE Act. And what do they call it?
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:49.240]  What is Saki? Jin Saki, again, not a bad drink, a bad person. What does she call it? Strike forces. Strike, strike forces. And I played you the clips, they're like, oh, we're going to hunt you down if you haven't had your shots.
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:24:02.240]  In England, in Australia, in New Zealand, they were, the billboards are, we're hunting you down. We're the tracers. And all the college kids that went to be bureaucrats who went to be social workers,
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:13.240]  they're now told, oh, the new job is contact tracers. Texas gave, what was it, $600 million to Google so they can run it and run the database and then send people to your house.
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  Oh, and Biden said last week, Republicans, because you're the bad people. You're the ones who'll take the shot, making it political. And then they come and here they are.
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:28.240]  Oh, the database that they know all about you. Whatever happened to warrants, whatever, oh, well, that's just the way it is now.
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:36.240]  And Tucker Carlson did a great job last night. He got into eugenics of this. Now, this is all eugenics laws through the health department and the media is like, oh my God, he's totally Alice Jones.
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:47.240]  Well, he reads laws on here from 1900, 1910, 1919. You know, he's reading the same damn law. He reads the same Supreme Court rulings about all this.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:54.240]  It's still on the books. The Supreme Court says they can come grab your daughter or your son and chop their balls off. No judge, no jury.
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:10.240]  You know, some of the books with the health departments in places like Maine and New York and Washington state that they can grab a woman or a man at any age and remove their uterus, their ovaries, their fallopian tubes or their testicles.
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:25.240]  And then Tucker Carlson read that on there and he's like, Alex Jones now because it's true. That's who these people are. And that's what's going on. And the bills are 666 to piss in our face.
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:32.240]  And we're coming for your children and we're going to corrupt them. We're going to have sex with them. But we're not pedophiles.
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:41.240]  I mean, it's just out of control. Margaret Sanger said kill the blacks, their weeds. The left will edit me saying that and say I said that.
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:52.240]  I said the Uighurs are being killed on a talk show and said that black people should care about everybody. And they said I was calling them the n-word. That's how they use ignorance to control people.
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:26:02.240]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:51.240]  If a war store.com is simply the best. If a war store.com beats out all the rest.
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:27:08.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:11.240]  If a war store.com beats out all the rest.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:30.240]  That's why the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine bromide, you name it, instead of iodine. Our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is deficient and the average person is deficient.
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:39.240]  And it's discounted right now with free shipping for 40% off in the dropper bottle. We have it for 60% off in the spray bottle. It's the exact same formula, but I want you to experience it yourself.
[1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:49.240]  If you've been on the fence about iodine, this is the best. Try it today. It takes about 15 days to kick in. It's exclusively available at infowarstore.com right now and it funds the M4.
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:29:15.240]  The way you fail is not taking action.
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:26.240]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:36.240]  Alright, Michael Mallis is coming up. Ladies and gentlemen, quite the iconic class, really smart guy. This podcast gets more and more popular all the time. I had a chance to be on it.
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:46.240]  I was up in New York a few weeks ago. They just dropped yesterday. He'll be in studio with us. This is also, I wrote a book on North Korea. Spent a lot of time there. He's childhood friends with Kim Jong-un.
[1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:56.240]  That's a joke. That is coming up, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, I forgot to get to all the 666 bills. Sorry, there's so many dealing with the globalist takeover.
[1:29:56.240 --> 1:30:07.240]  HR666, give all your medical records to the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Merge Justice Department over contact tracing, the SWAT team power to the bureaucrats.
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:19.240]  There's that. And then there's HR6666, COVID-19 testing, reaching and contacting everyone at 66666 coming in your house without warrants.
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:37.240]  And then, of course, you got Bill Gates's patent, 002020, 060606 for the attracting you with AI and then turning that into a cryptocurrency to pay you if you robotically follow orders the way you're supposed to.
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:49.240]  And then it continues, 100 more cops dispatched to Sydney to enforce a new lockdown inspired by the Delta variant. Oh, my gosh, a new variant. Oh, we're so scared.
[1:30:49.240 --> 1:31:01.240]  Just 25 under 18s died from COVID in England. And of course, most of those died in car accidents. Hundreds died from suicide and trauma.
[1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:12.240]  That was the plan. Big article on info wars.com. Rand Paul says he will enter this bill to scrap mask mandate, pointing out it's a farce and doesn't protect you and gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:27.240]  Fauci even offered a paper on that peer reviewed in 2008. But the cult loves seeing you like a slave. Camilla can't wait to get rid of face masks.
[1:31:27.240 --> 1:31:42.240]  That's the wife of Prince Charles sponsors abandoned Tokyo Olympics as spectators officially banned from the events just all showing you the alienness of this of humans bad can't be next to humans.
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:50.240]  Humans must be alone. Humans must be locked up. Humans are dirty humans are it's all a lie. The more people around the healthier you are.
[1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:59.240]  People that are locked up and on around people the ones that die and get sick and the studies all show people locked up in their houses are the ones that died including old people from depression.
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:02.240]  Because your body says I have no reason to be alive.
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:10.240]  Ever heard of cabin fever. Olympics will ban spectators of Japan declares state of emergency.
[1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:30.240]  And it goes on and on FDA and CDC reassure Americans that third covid jab is not needed yet as Pfizer seeks request emergency approval for booster shot for all of the hypochondriacs that want to go out and get more and more even though they're chasing the devil here and finding their doom.
[1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:40.240]  Oh but another fake poll 40% of Brits want mass mandates in place forever unvaccinated permanently banned from foreign travel. Hell just kill them.
[1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:44.240]  Just get rid of them all together.
[1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:52.240]  A lot of amazing amazing information. I'm going to play a really important piece.
[1:32:52.240 --> 1:33:06.240]  We're Tucker Carlson class might got into eugenics the whole history of this the Supreme Court and how serious all this journey is but just remember only way we reach new people as you telling friends family neighbors acquaintances total strangers about the show.
[1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:13.240]  Free World News dot TV right on the back of a card give it to folks and tell them here is a suppressed truth they don't want you to see.
[1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:22.240]  And at the same time please remember we're listening supported so by a book by a film by a t shirt by a water filtration system we have the highest rated out there.
[1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:28.240]  It's so important to do that water filters are 10% off right now and that's a big discount there's not much profit in those.
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:37.240]  They're already very competitive and then we have free shipping then it's this weekend double patriot points and X2 is selling out the good halogen pure iodine deep earth crystal but I want you to experience it.
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:46.240]  So it's 40% off for the dropper model it is 60% off for the spray bottle that's the exact same high quality deep earth iodine that is a great deal on that.
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:51.240]  Those are both selling out just like I told you X3 now is off sale because it's about to sell out.
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:34:00.240]  Well these are still on sale they're excellent info or store dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine and you keep the tip of the spear on the air which is all of us together.
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  Here is Tucker Carlson knocking it out of the park last night off historical documents here it is.
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:11.240]  Tony Fauci has declared them merely a political statement.
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  It's easy to get it's free and it's readily available so you know you've got to ask what is the problem get over it get over this political statement just get over it.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:35.240]  Get over it you don't have a right to disagree you must take this medicine this is a well trod road that we're on and it's a scary one we've seen this before more than a century ago.
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:43.240]  In the early 1900s officials in Boston of course decided to make an example of a Swedish born pastor called Henning Jacobson.
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:49.240]  Jacobson refused to take the government mandated smallpox vaccine and in his case he had good reason for refusing.
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:55.240]  He'd already taken that vaccine the same vaccine in Sweden as a child and he nearly died from it.
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:35:01.240]  Jacobson fought the mandate he took his case all the way to the Supreme Court and in the end the Supreme Court ruled against him.
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:13.240]  That was a brand new precedent then as now and it didn't take long for the government to use that new authority granted by the court to force other medical procedures on the American population.
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:23.240]  After the Jacobson decision the state of Virginia passed a law authorizing the involuntary sterilization of people that the state deemed to be quote feeble minded or mentally ill undesirable.
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  In a landmark decision Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes whom we revere most of the time ruled that the same legal framework that justified mandatory vaccination also permitted the government to sterilize people against their will.
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:41.240]  He was explicit about the connection here's the quote.
[1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:48.240]  The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes Holmes wrote.
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:36:01.240]  By 1930 dozens of American states were forcing women to undergo involuntary sterilization and in the end more than 60,000 American women were sterilized by the government against their will.
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:05.240]  That happened famously and we shouldn't be surprised by it.
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:14.240]  Things like that tend to happen when a distracted submissive population allows the government to dictate what medical procedures they get what drugs they take.
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:23.240]  This is a well known and a horrifying chapter in American history so you'd think the news media might point this out but just the opposite.
[1:36:23.240 --> 1:36:31.240]  Here's a clip from yesterday in which the saddest of the CNN anchors begs this administration to make vaccines mandatory.
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:47.240]  What about Kathleen Sebelius former secretary at HHS because she talks about the idea that maybe the administration shouldn't completely abandon the idea of not if not vaccine mandates at least encouraging some businesses or public places to require them.
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:59.240]  She says quote I'm trying to restrain myself but I kind of had it you know we're going to tiptoe around mandates it's like come on I'm kind of over that I want to make sure that people I deal with don't have it so I don't transmit it to my granddaughter.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:09.240]  So why not encourage if not governments to mandate it then some businesses if least require it.
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:21.240]  The media demanding force vaccinations that shouldn't surprise you they're not in the business to inform the public they're in the business for power they couldn't get jobs in finance but this gives them a little squat.
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:26.240]  That's literally why they have the jobs they do and they love their new power.
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:36.240]  What's interesting is that no other organized groups of sensible people who aren't emotionally damaged like your average cable news anchor none of them are saying anything either.
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  Why not veterans groups for example have remained silent as the Pentagon floats the idea of mandatory vaccinations for all soldiers.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:59.240]  Now there's zero scientific evidence that this could be necessary for any health related reason whatsoever but they're pushing forward at a briefing on Tuesday the Pentagon's top spokesman said that mandatory vaccinations for soldiers could be coming very soon.
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:11.240]  Should the FDA approve it then I am certain that Pentagon leadership will take a look at what our options are going forward including the potential option of making mandatory.
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:14.240]  Oh making it mandatory have you seen this movie before.
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:26.240]  Yes those of us who are older than 22 remember it well the Pentagon has four soldiers to take untested experimental vaccines before it happened in Iraq troops there had to take the anthrax vaccine.
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:27.240]  What happened.
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:31.240]  Many of those soldiers are now eligible for disability benefits through the VA look it up.
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:35.240]  Why because that vaccine caused serious long term complications.
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:41.240]  Those included infertility lupus paralysis.
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:44.240]  Michael Malice is coming up on the other side.
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:47.240]  He is in the studio with us.
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:52.240]  Do not spread this link free world news dot TV free world news dot TV.
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:56.240]  So we have free shipping double patriot points through this weekend.
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:05.240]  And our big loss leader is X2 in the in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60% off and your purchase funds the M4.
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:10.240]  But seriously the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:14.240]  You need to experience it for yourself takes two weeks to a month to kick in.
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:17.240]  Try it and tell me what you think you can't lose your fun in the info war.
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:23.240]  And again I can harp on this all day but just like our information is dead on from research.
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:30.240]  I'm telling you I couldn't do what I do without deep breath crystal iodine and X2.
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:33.240]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area.
[1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:37.240]  It's incredible what it did for libido is incredible when I don't take it.
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:39.240]  I feel the difference when I do take it.
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:40.240]  I'm so empowered.
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:47.240]  Get your ex who today discounted the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take under your tongue at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:52.240]  The globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful deep breath crystal iodine is.
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:54.240]  The world is awakening.
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:58.240]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:09.240]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:13.240]  And so even though it seems like the globalist are winning.
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:19.240]  The truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:22.240]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:26.240]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:28.240]  Realize humanity is winning.
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:33.240]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:34.240]  That is invincible.
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:38.240]  That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable.
[1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:39.240]  So don't trust in man.
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:48.240]  Trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:52.240]  We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:20.240]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.

[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:51.240]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:54.240]  They're 50% off right now and in FullWarStore.com.
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:00.240]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers in the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:04.240]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:06.240]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:08.240]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:10.240]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:11.240]  But what's in that food? Iodine.
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:18.240]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate and the food itself is lacking.
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:26.240]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine and governments are lowering the allowance you're supposedly getting to have because they want control.
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:29.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful. Our products are just as powerful.

[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Malis, best-selling author, hit podcaster, and more.
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:37.240]  He does a lot of stuff. He's in studio with us.
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:51.240]  Of course, he's been on the show for six, seven, eight years, but also he did two hit number one shows, number one, number two for Tim Pool, on his great broadcast, the great Tim Pool, and his farthest without, Michael Malis.com, Twitter, Michael Malis.
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:53.240]  And it is good to have you here with us in Austin.
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:56.240]  Alex, it is such a pleasure to be here.
[1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:00.240]  It's exciting to have you and your girlfriend and crew here once a dinner tonight.
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:03.240]  But you just watched part of that Tucker piece and you said, I'll talk about eugenics.
[1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:04.240]  Yeah.
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:12.240]  We can talk about a lot of stuff with you and about libertarianism, the police, the force inoculations, where you see society going, the exodus out of New York, you're moving here.
[1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:13.240]  Is that a secret?
[1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:14.240]  No, it's not a secret.
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:15.240]  Not anymore.
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:16.240]  And all of that going on.
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  But you went about eugenics first.
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:18.240]  It was great to have you, my friend.
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:19.240]  It's great to be here.
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:28.240]  One of the things I like to do is buy historical books because a lot of times what we are perceiving right now to be fact has been distorted through years of history.
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:31.240]  So not that long ago, I bought a book called The Case for Sterilization.
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:35.240]  It was a pro eugenics book. It was written in the 1930s, I believe.
[1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:38.240]  And I thought, all right, let's give these people the benefit of the doubt.
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:40.240]  You can download the Internet as public domain.
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:41.240]  Page one.
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:42.240]  Page one.
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:43.240]  This is an American book.
[1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:46.240]  They say, well, we don't agree with everything Hitler's doing.
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:58.240]  So the correlation between this, what you were talking about, you know, the early progressives in the early 20th century and later on, it was really did in many ways lead to Nazism and just horrific things.
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:02.240]  And speaking of New York, you have a, I sort of, I love New York.
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:05.240]  I, 357 Magnum, Stubnose Revolver New York meeting.
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:06.240]  I want to kill New York.
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  I want to flee New York.
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:08.240]  I hate New York.
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:09.240]  I don't even know.
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:10.240]  I'm such a New Yorker.
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:11.240]  I don't even know what guns are.
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:16.240]  So I, this is just like, I think it's more like the crime rates in New York that, you know, I love that shirt.
[1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:17.240]  Well, thank you.
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:18.240]  I love it too.
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:20.240]  I thought it'd be appropriate to wear.
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:25.240]  And I actually, I'm very, I love New York and I'm very, very saddened by what has happened to the city.
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:27.240]  I've lived there all my life.
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:29.240]  I don't know how to drive a car.
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:30.240]  And I didn't mean to interrupt.
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:34.240]  We'll get to that next segment, but one is you are historian.
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:35.240]  I know a lot of history.
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:36.240]  No more than I do is I've talked to you a lot.
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:37.240]  I'm a big admirer show.
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:38.240]  I watch all the time.
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:45.240]  I learn a lot of stuff from you, but people don't know the center of eugenics was London at first, then New York, then Berlin, Germany.
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:49.240]  So, so when you talk about progressives and eugenics, I mean, this is where Hitler got it.
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:50.240]  Explain that.
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:51.240]  Yeah.
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:52.240]  And that's absolutely accurate.
[1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:56.240]  This was the idea in the early 20th century, late 19th century that using science, right?
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:57.240]  And the science has settled.
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:02.240]  If we scientifically engineer a society, we can breed a better race.
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:09.240]  Now, Margaret Sanger often gets a bad rap because she talks about improving the race and people think it's a racist thing, meaning whites versus black.
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:20.240]  She means the human race, but they really had this idea that either voluntarily or through government, you could sit down and pick this is a quality person, which is not going to be us.
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:26.240]  And this is a bad quality person and they're going to breed and that way human beings are going to improve that way.
[1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:31.240]  And you can see how it would kind of make sense in one very basic way at the time.
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:35.240]  But the consequences of when you're picking who can have kids.
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:39.240]  And it's not like people that you and I would agree with, OK, this person's an unfit mother.
[1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:42.240]  It's really like people who are like politically undesirable.
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:45.240]  Maybe people have some kind of disease or illness.
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:51.240]  The number of kids that we have that need loving parents is just a complete.
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:52.240]  Oh, there's definitely a real problem.
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:58.240]  But who makes these people be in charge of the solution when it turns out I see documentaries on the whole eugenics movement.
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:00.240]  Most of them ended up in mental institutions and stuff.
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:02.240]  They were crazy control freaks.
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:03.240]  Some of the worst people.
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:04.240]  Yes.
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:08.240]  Again, you can't make one group in charge just like communism.
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:09.240]  It doesn't work.
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:16.240]  It is literally communism because the communist idea, another word for communism at the time was scientific socialism.
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:19.240]  So they were saying if you have freedom, freedom means chaos.
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:20.240]  No one's in charge.
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:21.240]  Everyone does what they want.
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.240]  You're going to have disastrous consequences.
[1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:27.240]  You and I are obviously both people who support the First Amendment, the concept behind it.
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:28.240]  And that chaos innovates.
[1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:29.240]  That chaos is beautiful.
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:30.240]  Right.
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:32.240]  Because sometimes when you have freedom, people are going to say things you don't like.
[1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:35.240]  And you got to nut up or deal with it or not.
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:37.240]  The same thing with kind of every other aspect.
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:39.240]  So they're saying, all right, we're going to decide.
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:43.240]  And the thing is what happens when you have governments in charge of this.
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:52.240]  And you have this in low key ways in like North Korea and these other places where people are encouraged to breed if they're of a certain class and they're discouraged in other class.
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:55.240]  If you take one population, you can do this kind of in a shorthand way.
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:48:01.240]  If I take this group which I like and I make sure that they have food and this group that I don't like, I serve them.
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.240]  Well, that's a kind of a backdoor eugenics way because I'm encouraging this group to reproduce because they have the calories.
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:07.240]  And these are not going to have kids.
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:08.240]  The kids are going to start to death.
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  So I don't think people appreciate when they talk about kind of the horrors of socialism, just how pervasive it is that nothing is outside their purview, including who you're sleeping with and whether you're produced.
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:25.240]  And just how far they're willing to push these issues.
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:26.240]  Well, here's an example.
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:32.240]  I pointed out that people in Western countries have higher IQs, whether they're black or white, than people in third world countries.
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:34.240]  That's not a statement saying they're inferior.
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:36.240]  They're getting lower calories when they're growing.
[1:48:36.240 --> 1:48:39.240]  So they do have lower IQs by the very extension of that.
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:41.240]  And we see this in Korea.
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  So North and South Korea have been separated since the 40s, which they've been a one nation for literally thousands of years, genetically identical.
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:53.240]  60 years in terms of human evolution is dropping the bucket.
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:49:00.240]  And we're seeing not only differences in terms of intelligence because of the severe malnutrition in North, but also differences in height.
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:04.240]  Now, anyone, you don't have to be a scientist, you don't have to be a biologist to understand.
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:10.240]  If you have two kids and this kid is going to get fed and is going to have, you know, a thriving environment and this kid doesn't have access.
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:16.240]  You can always tell the runt, like with pigs or cats, the one that's too little, that can't root or there's so many that there's not a tip for them.
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:18.240]  They're half the size of the others.
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:29.240]  Right. But the thing is when you have the person who has the genetic capacity, but then you're depriving nourishment from them, they end up becoming the runt, although they did not have to be that way.
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:37.240]  And when you have things like this in these totalitarian states, when government, which use food as a weapon, they admit the U.N. says they use food, they use food as a weapon.
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:42.240]  And I think Americans, you know, being someone who's born in the Soviet Union, I've done work with North Korea, as you mentioned earlier.
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:45.240]  I don't think Americans realize Venezuela.
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:46.240]  We don't talk about it.
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:48.240]  Venezuela is happening right now.
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:51.240]  The Chavez government makes sure that their goons get fed.
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:52.240]  I was just talking yesterday.
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:54.240]  I was on the trigonometry podcast we recorded.
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:56.240]  I won the co-host from Venezuela.
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:01.240]  And he's talking about how his cousin has to get rainwater to get water for his house.
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:03.240]  And people are stealing the rainwater from him.
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:10.240]  And I can imagine some people who have grown up in this country have been so blessed thinking to themselves, well, why don't they just go to the store and buy, you know, Poland spring?
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:15.240]  Like we are so lucky in this country, although things in many ways are bad.
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  What is it like being a historian, world traveler, group of Soviet Union to see the majority of millennials say they want communism?
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240]  I mean, that is insane.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:25.240]  It's not. I wouldn't say it's insane.
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:27.240]  I don't think they know what they're saying.
[1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:31.240]  And the reason why they don't know what they're saying is you cannot expect government schools.
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:38.240]  You cannot expect the New York Times, who has lots of millions of bodies of blood in their hands with the Ukrainian genocide.
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:43.240]  You can't expect CNN to explain to this population just how bad it was.
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:46.240]  And spoiler alert, my next book is going to be exactly on the subject.
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.240]  It will be out before the end of the year.
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:53.240]  And I'm sure we'll be back on to talk about assuming I don't burn this bridge today, which might happen.
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:57.240]  Well, we're just excited to, in fact, tell us, coming up the next hour, all the things you want to cover.
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.240]  Because I really, you're an exciting guy, smart guy, I'm a big fan.
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.240]  What do you want to cover in the next hour?
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:11.240]  I just want to talk about, I think, why the good guys are winning in this country, which I think a lot of people need to hear and don't appreciate.
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:17.240]  And I agree. I think all this tyranny is a reflex of action because the establishment's losing control.
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:21.240]  Yes, yes. You don't hit a kid who's listening to you.
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:23.240]  You hit a kid when they're acting out.
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:27.240]  And at a certain point, that kid's going to get big enough and you hit him, he's not going to care.
[1:51:27.240 --> 1:51:29.240]  And maybe that's a bad metaphor here.
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:30.240]  Oh, it's excellent.
[1:51:30.240 --> 1:51:31.240]  Yeah.
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:35.240]  That was just kind of, but you want to get into, like, just how it is, I think that they're losing.
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:36.240]  Yeah.
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:40.240]  Because back in the day, you had, talk radio was kind of, I think, where it started.
[1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:42.240]  Obviously, that's where you have your roots.
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:48.240]  When you have three networks, like they had in the 50s and 60s, for example, ABC, NBC, CBS, everyone came home.
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:50.240]  They would watch one of the three and they would basically have a consensus.
[1:51:50.240 --> 1:51:56.240]  Now, between the three networks, they were all hard left, you know, kind of had that as their ideology.
[1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:01.240]  I'm sure some people in the audience are old enough to remember 1964 when Barry Goldwater ran for president.
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:08.240]  They completely were in the position to destroy him because he had no mechanism to get his point of view out there elsewhere.
[1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:12.240]  Come 16 years later, you had Reagan because you had more mechanisms for conservatives.
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:16.240]  And I don't consider myself a conservative, by the way, to get their point of view out there.
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:18.240]  And Reagan knew that, got rid of the fairness doctrine.
[1:52:18.240 --> 1:52:23.240]  Yes. And that fairness doctrine, fairness, is there any more Orwellian word than fairness?
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:26.240]  Like, I'm in Washington. I'm going to decide what's fair.
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:32.240]  Well, my definition of fair is always going to be that which furthers my interest and the interest of corporate America.
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:34.240]  And it's never going to be the interest of the little guy.
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:42.240]  At the very least, I'm not even able to hear his voice because I'm getting my phone rang off the hook by lobbyists, prominent corporations, prominent other politicians, and so on and so forth.
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:44.240]  Stay there. Stay there. I'm going to break it in a minute.
[1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:49.240]  Well, people, because listeners are great, but they're ambassadors of freedom. And your show is so informative, funny, it's great.
[1:52:49.240 --> 1:52:54.240]  I watch it all the time. I mean, every show, I watch almost all of it. I miss some and get mad about it.
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:57.240]  How do people find your podcasts? How do they find your books? How do they find Michael Mallis?
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:00.240]  And then share it with others because we need to promote people that are smart.
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:02.240]  Sure. You go to twitter.com slash Michael Mallis.
[1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:05.240]  Anarchist Handbook was the last book and the show is called You're Welcome.
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:08.240]  It's at youtube.com slash Michael Mallis official.
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:09.240]  Folks really liked our last interview.
[1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:11.240]  It was so fun.
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:14.240]  You hit me with a lot of questions. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:21.240]  Well, that's the thing I think you have. People don't appreciate because there's this caricature of Alex Jones that you've been doing this for so long for so many years,
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:25.240]  that you really have a lot of arcane knowledge that other people are privy to.
[1:53:25.240 --> 1:53:32.240]  And that's the common people always give you, like when you run Rogan and you're on Tim and you run along things and sometimes in a provocative, performative way.
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:37.240]  But then when they search for you and what you're referring to, you're not completely just making things up.
[1:53:37.240 --> 1:53:38.240]  It's like, this is the headline.
[1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:41.240]  I'm going to travel right back with hour number three. Stay with us.
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:11.240]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:16.240]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it, but we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:18.240]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[1:54:18.240 --> 1:54:20.240]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:22.240]  I got to sell them at discount.
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:28.240]  And so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:30.240]  It won't be available for months.
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  So get it.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:38.240]  X2 is selling out at infowarstore.com for 40 and 60% off with double pay, trade points and free shipping.
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:40.240]  Because why? That's when you buy it.
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:42.240]  We need your funds or it'll be off air.
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:43.240]  It's an amazing product.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:46.240]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead.
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:47.240]  You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:48.240]  Hey, Alex.
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:49.240]  Welcome.
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:55.240]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people.
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:57.240]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:03.240]  Double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:05.240]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:09.240]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:11.240]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:13.240]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible.
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:16.240]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:19.240]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:28.240]  They shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:33.240]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:35.240]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:39.240]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:43.240]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:49.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:57.240]  Me and my Frankenstein.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:07.240]  Michael Malis is in the studio here.
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:10.240]  We're just talking about Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, you name it.
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:14.240]  The fact that they go, oh, Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones now or Joe Rogan's Alex Jones now.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:16.240]  No, that's not what's happening.
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:18.240]  Michael Malis is a big historian, author.
[1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:20.240]  He knows all the same stuff I know.
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:28.240]  The fact that we know New York was the headquarters of eugenics and that Hitler used New York laws as his, or the Nazis did as their defense at Nuremberg.
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:31.240]  That's not Michael Malis repeating what Alex Jones said.
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:38.240]  That's the history and the left tries to play this game like, oh, Jones is this cook and then try to say, oh, you know, don't repeat what he says.
[1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:40.240]  You're not repeating what I said.
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:43.240]  No, the thing I made the point is, let's suppose I didn't speak English, right?
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:47.240]  And I'm seeing you and how you perform and how you act and you're very animated and have a certain perspective.
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:50.240]  And then I watched CNN, the guys in the suit and talking very calmly.
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:56.240]  I would think that second CNN guy is respectable and knows he's talking about, and Alex is just a crazy person, right?
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:06.240]  But that is a technique that they use because if they present themselves in a certain way and we're trained since we're kids to perceive professionals as being educated, trust the experts, right?
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:08.240]  So, of course, it's a uniform.
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:13.240]  Right, it's exactly right. You trust the cop because he's wearing that uniform. You trust the firefighter, so on and so forth.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:21.240]  I'm the producer. I'm the reporter, the corporate journalist on these venues, spreading really depraved and malevolent ideas.
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:24.240]  But because I'm in a suit and I'm calm, look at Dan Rather.
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:31.240]  In 1994, when the Republicans took over Congress for the first time in 40 years, you would think that sometimes you'd want one of the parties to switch.
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:35.240]  First time in 40 years, he's saying the American people have thrown a temper tantrum tonight.
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:47.240]  So, a lot of times when they don't get their way, that air of professionalism and assertiveness drops and you realize that behind that smile, as Ayn Rand put it back in the day, there was something sinister and something evil.
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:58:00.240]  And the beautiful thing about social media is when you scratch these people and kind of tweet at them and they get upset, you really see that there is a really nasty sneer behind that veneer of calm professionalism.
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:05.240]  And they take themselves so seriously. Like, I never did all this on purpose as some master plan.
[1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:08.240]  It was when they sue me, they ask, where's the master plan? Who told you to say this or that?
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:11.240]  We didn't do a pre-interview, what we're about to talk about, we're just here talking.
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:20.240]  I have fun sometimes, and the common folks like that, because it's not an act, and they take that as more credible than me up here, perfectly looking into the camera, reading off a teleprompter.
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:31.240]  You can't fight for your values unless at the same time you're having a good time sometimes. No human being has that emotional feel and stamina without taking a break, recharging and enjoying themselves.
[1:58:31.240 --> 1:58:38.240]  And honestly, if you're not fighting for freedom and having fun at the same time, what's the point? What's the point of freedom if you're not enjoying life and thriving?
[1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:41.240]  Audrey, let me ask you a question and we're going to really kick into things next segment.
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:46.240]  Can we put Ron Skelter back on screen please? He puts this photo out himself.
[1:58:46.240 --> 1:58:51.240]  Now, how is this connected from reality? You have to put, because that's a horror movie cover, like a clown with his children.
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:55.240]  Have you not watched The Simpsons? They took 800 takes, this was the best one.
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:59:03.240]  Yeah. How is he not self-aware that he looks like a true nightmare vision?
[1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:08.240]  I don't know if you've seen this on what C-SPAN, they had him talking about it.
[1:59:08.240 --> 1:59:09.240]  Everybody attacked him.
[1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:19.240]  Yeah. And the thing, I had this thing on Instagram about the red pill versus the blue pill, while Brian Skelter is talking to America about Trump's misspellings on Twitter,
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:24.240]  they're also covering, not CNN specifically, they're covering it from Jeffrey Epstein and all his assaults.
[1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:30.240]  Which of these things is worse, that a president in your mind is illiterate or that there's an international network of people?
[1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:32.240]  I kind of like he made mistakes. It means he's being real.
[1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:40.240]  So what? I was Brooklyn's Spelling Bee Champion in 1986, you can look it up. If someone doesn't know how to spell, does it mean their ideas are wrong? What difference does it make?
[1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:49.240]  Exactly, but let's just go back to Brian Skelter here. What does his photo say to you? If you were just a Martian that came in, what does that look like?
[1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:56.240]  That looks like the most disingenuous, sneaky, and he's anti-free speech, he's anti-America, he also is a piece of garbage, but look at that.
[1:59:56.240 --> 2:00:01.240]  If you're Jeff Zucker, I guess because he looks like him, why would you try to put that out to the public?
[2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:10.240]  I'm an underwear model for Sheath Underwear, if you go to sheathunderwear.com, so I'm not in a position to make fun of people who aren't as attractive as me, so I'm going to have to defer from this question and leave it to you, sir.
[2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:13.240]  Well, I mean, just here, look at that, look at that photo.
[2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:19.240]  Look, honestly Alex, I think there's far worse things about Brian Skelter than how he-
[2:00:19.240 --> 2:00:22.240]  I know, but he just, he radiates-
[2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:24.240]  I don't think he's the worst one.
[2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:26.240]  He's the creepiest look I've ever seen.
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:30.240]  Oh, he's not, there's a lot creepier than that. You know who I think is much more sinister is Anderson Cooper.
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:31.240]  Oh, I totally agree.
[2:00:31.240 --> 2:00:32.240]  Yeah, he's a blue-
[2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:33.240]  He's a Vanderbilt.
[2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:39.240]  He's a Vanderbilt. I mean, you cut him, it bleeds blue, and for him to be like I'm a man to people, that's much more sinister.
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:42.240]  Oh, when you go online, it says he owns nothing, he gave it all to charity.
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:46.240]  He's just like Bill Gates with all tax exempt, the man's worth probably $500 billion.
[2:00:46.240 --> 2:01:01.240]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:20.240]  We love our innocent children. We are brothers and sisters together.
[2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:24.240]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:28.240]  And as crazier things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:31.240]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:36.240]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.240]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:43.240]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:47.240]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:02:16.240]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:26.240]  Michael Malice is in the ATX and he's moving here.
[2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:28.240]  I am. Can't wait.
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:31.240]  All right, buddy. Wow. Where do you want to start?
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:33.240]  We've already done a couple of assignments. You're on fire.
[2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:36.240]  I agree. We're winning.
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:39.240]  And this whole globalist attack is an exercise of raw power.
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:42.240]  They said in the Rockefeller Foundation documents 11 years ago, Operation Walk Step,
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:46.240]  they would try this to maintain control. You read their internal CFR stuff that leaks.
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:49.240]  They are in panic mode right now. So as bad as all this is,
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:51.240]  this was done through desperation. Elaborate on that.
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:54.240]  Well, I mean, let's just talk about American politics where it's much simpler.
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:58.240]  There's a 50-50 split in the Senate where there was just an article a day or two ago,
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:03.240]  I feel like Alex right now, where Biden campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy.
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:06.240]  That's DOA. It's been, we're already in July,
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:12.240]  but there's been very little progress about the Democratic agenda other than some kind of executive orders.
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:15.240]  So I think a lot of people who are conservatives who thought, okay,
[2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:19.240]  you're going to have Kamala Harris as a tie break vote in the Senate.
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:22.240]  They're going to get whatever they want on the left.
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:24.240]  That has not happened whatsoever.
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:26.240]  You had people like Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema,
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:30.240]  centrist Democrats from West Virginia and Arizona respectively are saying,
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:32.240]  we're not going to get rid of the filibuster.
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:35.240]  Here's the other thing. For a party that I'm not a fan of democracy to put it mildly,
[2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:40.240]  but for a party to call itself the Democratic Party and want to get rid of the filibuster
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:44.240]  and have a 50-50 rule and basically put forth whatever they do.
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:47.240]  Meanwhile, two years ago, they were talking about how much they like the Constitution
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:50.240]  and our nation's traditions and Trump's an assault on that.
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:55.240]  What you realize is people in power, and this applies to Republicans most certainly as much as the Democrats,
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:59.240]  will say whatever they need to say in order to further their agenda and maintain their power.
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:03.240]  So a lot of times people argue in social media with their friends or these kind of bigger names
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:08.240]  and try to engage with them and you have to realize you don't listen to what they're saying.
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:13.240]  What they're saying is, what do I need to say to get you to do what I want?
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:17.240]  And one day I'm going to be for the unions and then those union voters are going to vote for Reagan,
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:22.240]  be Reagan Democrats, and now I'm going to tell you all those union people are literate hicks and they're racist, right?
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:27.240]  I'll turn on a dime because now that group is no longer of use to furthering my agenda.
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:31.240]  And I'm sure you've seen this many times throughout your decades of doing this.
[2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:36.240]  I totally agree. Don't look at what they say. Look at what they do. That's the oldest trick in the book.
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:44.240]  And so what would you call this period of time we're in right now with the contact tracers and HR666
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:49.240]  to give them law enforcement power and all this other crazy stuff.
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:54.240]  Oh, $2 billion to open Capitol Police offices to watch the public around the country.
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:57.240]  I mean, it really is a metastasization.
[2:04:57.240 --> 2:05:01.240]  It's all people saying you're saying we're winning. We're winning hearts and minds.
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:06.240]  But is the empire striking back going to be successful in subduing the world?
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:11.240]  That's the question, right? So one of the things that, you know, if you were looking at Joe Biden,
[2:05:11.240 --> 2:05:17.240]  are you going to tell me that this man is a symbol of a healthy, strong, thriving empire?
[2:05:17.240 --> 2:05:21.240]  Or is this an empire on its last legs? If you look at historic like royal families,
[2:05:21.240 --> 2:05:27.240]  like by the end when these houses collapsed, you have this kind of drooling old man in charge who has, like...
[2:05:27.240 --> 2:05:32.240]  Why does history keep repeating with that? You'd think an elite in trouble would put a good whipper stamper in there.
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:37.240]  But this is as good as they could get through. I mean, they were panicking because they almost had Bernie Sanders.
[2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:42.240]  And they were like, crap, we've got to get Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg to fold and get behind Biden
[2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:50.240]  because they knew Biden and they're right. It's a reliable party hack, just like some people in the Republican Party.
[2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:55.240]  So what do you expect them to do next? What are they going to do about Trump, who's still leading the Republican Party,
[2:05:55.240 --> 2:06:00.240]  winning a lot of races for Republicans he endorses? Trump's talking about reinstatement. That really scares them.
[2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:05.240]  But, Alex, we already know. Like, right now we're hearing about this Delta variant and, you know, this Ligma variant,
[2:06:05.240 --> 2:06:13.240]  and immediately these things are DOA. People are saying, I tweeted this out and I got more likes than the World Health Organization.
[2:06:13.240 --> 2:06:20.240]  I said, I no longer care if I get COVID or somebody else does it. And if that has that perspective, and I think a lot of Americans
[2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:25.240]  like, we're over this crap. I'm not ruining my restaurant. I'm not ruining my neighborhood. I'm not wearing these dopey masks,
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:32.240]  which is like wearing a condom with two holes in it. And when they have, they're running out of bullets in the chamber.
[2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:40.240]  And that is something I think we should all be happy about. But they still have a lot of inertia because they've been at this for a long time.
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:47.240]  By the way, how long are you here? I'm here till Monday, my birthday. I know you gotta look at houses. There's a film crew.
[2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:54.240]  They're great filmmakers. They want me to go shooting and they've been asking for months. I've got a little piece of property outside Austin with a shooting range.
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:59.240]  Why don't I come back and we do that? We need to go shooting. Let's do that. That'd be a great video. Because you say you haven't gotten any guns yet.
[2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:04.240]  I have not gotten any guns. We're going to pop your cherry. Let's do it. I would love that. We got to get you out there.
[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:09.240]  What do you want to shoot first? I don't know from guns. I want you to educate me. You want to start with something that doesn't have a lot of recoil.
[2:07:09.240 --> 2:07:18.240]  I thought of.22..50 caliber Barrett. I'm a Brooklyn boy. All I know is getting shot and not how to shoot.
[2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:27.240]  The best thing to start shooting is to give you an idea about trajectory. I thought people were going to make fun of me, but no one thinks it's disrespectful to me.
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:32.240] .22 is a great, cheap ammo. It's really accurate. A couple hundred yards and it's a great thing to plank with.
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:40.240]  Isn't it like a girl's handgun for their purse? I mean, mafia uses.22s to execute people. Then it's fine.
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:46.240]  You don't get rifling on it and you can shoot somebody in the head and then it tends to not go through the other side. It bounces around.
[2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:50.240]  It's a very good assassination weapon. It's a good for killing people.
[2:07:50.240 --> 2:07:57.240]  Absolutely. You just walk around and it'll pop on the other side of the head. You don't want.380s and things. They don't have enough penetration.
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:08:01.240] .22 long rifle is actually a good thing. This will be the video. I want to hear all of that.
[2:08:01.240 --> 2:08:06.240]  Exactly. We'll go over it all. I want something hipster. I got some guys working for me. They're actually firearms experts.
[2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:10.240]  They actually trained the expert military. They trained the best.
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:16.240]  I would love that. This would be a lot of fun. There I am with my caffeine. They could laugh at me. What do you think happened with him?
[2:08:16.240 --> 2:08:21.240]  I think they killed him. Did you hear what the wife said? Did you talk about this in the show already?
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:22.240]  Go ahead.
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:24.240]  I don't know. I want to hear your perspective.
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:32.240]  She said that he was going to appeal and he was totally fine. He said they were threatening to kill him. He put out tweets saying if I'm killed, I was murdered.
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:38.240]  But I thought the wife later came out and said he definitely was not murdered. He did take his own life. Can we look into that?
[2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:42.240]  I didn't see that follow-up. They come and tell you we're going to kill you, honey.
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:49.240]  I'm not going to tell the name. There's a very famous musician, probably the most famous ever, who said he was more famous than Jesus.
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:56.240]  I actually got to know some folks and I learned the whole FBI thing about what happened in New York and everything else.
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:08:59.240]  They basically came and told them you're going to shut up and say this or you're next.
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:04.240]  All they got to do is break in your house a few times and the FBI comes by and says you don't want that to happen anymore. Keep your mouth shut.
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:08.240]  Do you know what the Stasi did in East Germany? They had something that is roughly translated to disintegration.
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:13.240]  So what they would do is they'd go to your house and take out your socks from your sock drawer and leave them on your bed.
[2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:19.240]  There's two possibilities. Either you're going crazy, why are these socks in my bed? Why does this keep happening? Or that's the way of telling you,
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:23.240]  we can get to you any time we want so you better stay in line. It's very easy.
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:32.240]  Oh, 100% or they'll call you up and say, hey, I saw you slip on your back porch and fall down the day. Too bad you don't fall down and die.
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:33.240]  You literally just fell on your porch.
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:37.240]  This was when Columbia was under the control of Pablo Escobar and the Nacroteres.
[2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:41.240]  There was a woman from Columbia Politician. I forget her name. She came to America to ask for help.
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:46.240]  She got a phone call and they said, this is where your daughter was at 8am. This is where she was at 10am.
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:51.240]  Your school yard daughter. This is where she was at 2pm. She got on that flight back to Bogota as soon as she could do.
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.240]  They did that to Dr. Group who was one of my best guests and he called me.
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:59.240]  He would talk for like two years and he said, go ahead and tell the story, but I can't come back on.
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:04.240]  And they called all his employees, his wife, everybody and said where they were, where they were at lunch.
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:09.240]  And he's just like, hey, I'm not scared, but my wife can't handle it. I get it. I mean, this is war.
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:13.240]  He was in the military, but he's like, he's not signed up for this. That's how bad this has got.
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:20.240]  And I'll even defend them in one perspective. If the choice is I go to your house and put a bullet on you or I pick up the phone and I scare you,
[2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:25.240]  I think I personally would rather the second one that I just get scared and they threaten me than they actually do something.
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:29.240]  Yeah. Well, they've done all that to me and it's not that I'm Mr. Tough Guy. I just can't live in fear.
[2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:33.240]  And so that's the way it is. And if they're going to try to kill me, then we got people. They're going to try to defend me.
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:34.240]  Yeah.
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:40.240]  And then I hold the whole establishment. Anything happens to me. They say I commit suicide, folks. You know what to do.
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:43.240]  Because I think killing Alex Jones might start the revolution.
[2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:47.240]  I don't think that I don't know how to respond to that.
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:52.240]  Well, if they kill me, I sure as hell didn't commit suicide. I want Darth Vader level medical treatment.
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:57.240]  I will never kill myself. I'm going to hold on to life to the very end.
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:00.240]  I'm just imagining you coming down there.
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:03.240]  Rex, I am your father.
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:09.240]  I mean, I'm, I mean, no, I'm going to, I mean, they tell me I got whatever I'm going to do the treatment to try to live.
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:11.240]  I'm all I try to get out of here.
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:17.240]  I'm just imagining you're building that Darth Vader suit walking around and getting the kids like, Mommy, what happened to Darth Vader?
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:25.240]  Well, you know, Dick Cheney, who was the longest lived person, which makes me think he's an alien, he lived almost two years with an external heart pump.
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:31.240]  So it's an artificial heart outside the body with no pulse. They say most people like go crazy and like freak out with no pulse.
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:33.240]  Cheney, almost two years, no pulse.
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:36.240]  Well, he would joke about that, that he was literally heartless.
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:43.240]  Like, literally, people look this up. This is Sonic Alex. This is not made up. Dick Cheney literally does not have a human heart in his body.
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:47.240]  I'll go, I don't want to die either. I mean, I'm not afraid of death, but I'm going to try to live as long as possible.
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:50.240]  So if they kill me, I was killed, not suicidal. We're right back in the mountains.
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:12:00.240]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:04.240]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:09.240]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:09.240]  But seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:14.240]  You need to experience it for yourself. It takes two weeks to a month to kick in. Try it and tell me what you think.
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:23.240]  You can't lose your fund in the M4. And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from research, I'm telling you.
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:32.240]  I couldn't do what I do without deep breath crystal iodine and X2. Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible.
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:38.240]  What it did for libido is incredible. When I don't take it, I feel the difference. When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:46.240]  Get your X2 today discounted in the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take it under your tongue at infowarstore.com.
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:14:12.240]  The globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful deep breath crystal iodine is.
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:30.240]  Michael Malish wants to talk about me. I do. And I want to talk about him because I literally do watch his podcast when it comes out every week, sometimes multiple times.
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:36.240]  And also like the comedy stuff you're doing, also like some of these scientific talks you do. I mean, you're doing a lot.
[2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:40.240]  And I want to get into your exodus out of New York, a microcosm of them losing.
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:47.240]  Because we were just talking about this during the break again, that they wanted 90% to take the injections. It's really like 50%.
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:55.240]  They admit they're failing. They admit people are refusing them and are not adopting this because if you're bringing a tyranny in, you need the vast majority to comply.
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:15:00.240]  If they've got 30, 40% that are completely not submitting and more every day saying no, this is actually a big failure for them.
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:08.240]  Here's another big failure. What COVID enabled them to do was to decentralize authoritarianism and basically make everyone a member of the secret police.
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:17.240]  They've seen reports over and over. People calling the cops in their neighbors. People calling someone in the subway or in the TSA when people aren't complying with these edicts.
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:22.240]  Now, I was in New York. This happened not that long ago. I'm not some kind of tough guy at all.
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:29.240]  These two construction workers were loading a truck and this Karen woman comes up to them and tells them, you need to put on a mask.
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:33.240]  And they're like, we're outside and she starts giving a lecture. I go, lady, you need to put on a muzzle.
[2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:38.240]  They laugh in her face, which is something she doesn't have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. And you know, her day is ruined.
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:48.240]  Increasingly, not only are people not saying yes to someone wagging some stranger, wagging their finger at them, but they're laughing at that person's face and returning it twice as hard.
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:55.240]  They have been trained to think, I'm the good guy. I will yell at Alex Jones and say, why aren't you wearing a mask?
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:16:04.240]  Everyone's going to stand up and applaud. And they haven't seen and all these other outlets having programmed them to be like, OK, what happens when that dude says go after yourself?
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:09.240]  What are you going to do then, sweetheart? And they have nothing. They really don't have a backup plan if there's pushback.
[2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:13.240]  And that is why I think you see it over and over on Twitter or the social media.
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:16.240]  And that's why it's important to push back on these people and not let them bully us.
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:23.240]  Yes, yes, yes. But you see it over and over people are like, oh my gosh, like I can't handle it like, you know, no one's listening to the plan.
[2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:28.240]  They're like, too bad. That is the reality. That's how you're going to have to deal with it going forward.
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:34.240]  Here's something I encourage people to do. It's play into their ignorance. Make them as emotionally distressed as possible.
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:41.240]  If someone comes up to you and says to put on a mask, whatever, just tell them with a straight face, play dumb, say, oh, I can't get it.
[2:16:41.240 --> 2:16:50.240]  I've never been to China. Let them think that you are this moron because now there it's going to further their belief that they're surrounded by morons who are putting their lives in danger.
[2:16:50.240 --> 2:16:53.240]  So that distress, hilarity ensues.
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:17:01.240]  What I do, I've seen them do to other people and I, but in, I go, you know, Fauci wrote a paper saying it gives you bacterial pneumonia and it's filthy.
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:06.240]  And you know, mask only work if they're a certain grade and they change them constantly and they change the gloves constantly.
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:09.240]  I go, oh, oh, but I thought you're for science. And then I go further.
[2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:15.240]  Well, you notice they're saying that people that have taken the vaccine are still getting COVID, which it was a fraud, you know that, right?
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:21.240]  And then by then they're just going, hey, hey, hey, and I'm like, listen, if you're wearing your stupid mask, you taking your shot, you're safe.
[2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:23.240]  Then leave me the hell alone. Don't you liberal.
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:24.240]  So there's too many people.
[2:17:24.240 --> 2:17:25.240]  Isn't there too many people on earth?
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:26.240]  You want me to die?
[2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:28.240]  I mean, that's what we're doing.
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:33.240]  If there's a website I use called minimally compliant mass.com because some you still have to wear the mask on the plane.
[2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:36.240]  These masks look like masks, but they completely let you breathe.
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:41.240]  And you know, at a certain point people are just going to have to look the other way because there's nothing they could do about it.
[2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:44.240]  Well, yeah, folks said I was a hypocrite selling these thin cloth masks.
[2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:45.240]  I'll tell them to.
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:46.240]  Okay, yeah.
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:47.240]  And I said, it's got info wars.com.
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:52.240]  I said, if they're going to make you do it in some places and you've got to do it, then you need to use it against them.
[2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:53.240]  Yes, exactly.
[2:17:53.240 --> 2:17:54.240]  Right.
[2:17:54.240 --> 2:18:00.240]  So this is kind of this passive resistance, which is a great way that Americans have historically given the finger to the state and the powers that be,
[2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:02.240]  which is something that could not be a bigger problem.
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:04.240]  Talk about New York because LA has a horrible vibe.
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:05.240]  I can't stand it.
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:06.240]  I hate it.
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:07.240]  I love the rest of California.
[2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:09.240]  New York, I've been there probably 50 times.
[2:18:09.240 --> 2:18:10.240]  I love it.
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:11.240]  Love the restaurants.
[2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:12.240]  Love the museums.
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:13.240]  What restaurant?
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:14.240]  They're closed now.
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:15.240]  The museums, yeah.
[2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:20.240]  Central Park's great, but now it literally feels like a cult there.
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:22.240]  And most folks are leaving.
[2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:23.240]  You're leaving.
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:24.240]  What has happened in New York?
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:25.240]  I have lived in New York all my life.
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:28.240]  Like I said earlier, I don't even know how to drive.
[2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:30.240]  And I was always ride or die.
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:33.240]  Like when people leave in New York, oh, you're too, you can't handle it.
[2:18:33.240 --> 2:18:34.240]  You're weak.
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:35.240]  This is great.
[2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:36.240]  I would defend the crowdedness.
[2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:37.240]  I defend the dirt.
[2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:42.240]  And now seeing what they've done to my beloved city is like watching my kid getting beaten in front of me.
[2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:47.240]  It hurts me to the fiber, to the basis of who I am as a person.
[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:48.240]  All my friends left.
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:53.240]  I'm so excited to be in Austin because I've got my crew here, my love and support from
[2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:55.240]  all the people who used to be in New York.
[2:18:55.240 --> 2:18:56.240]  I was the last one.
[2:18:56.240 --> 2:19:01.240]  At a certain point, you look around and you're like, it's kind of like a bad breakup.
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:03.240]  It's like, what am I fighting for anymore?
[2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:07.240]  All the places I used to like, these little boutiques that made New York unique and special,
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:08.240]  they couldn't survive.
[2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:09.240]  You know who survived?
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:11.240]  Amazon, Target, Walmart.
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:12.240]  I like those.
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:13.240]  Well, they thrived.
[2:19:13.240 --> 2:19:14.240]  They thrived.
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:15.240]  They thrived.
[2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:17.240]  Carol Roth had this great book called The War and Small Business.
[2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:21.240]  And she talked about how several trillions of dollars of wealth transfer from small and
[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:24.240]  medium businesses to places like Jeff Bezos and Target.
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:30.240]  Now, they serve a purpose, but I don't need to go to New York and have it become a gigantic
[2:19:30.240 --> 2:19:31.240]  mall of America.
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:32.240]  We have that already.
[2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:35.240]  But it was also a big tech and big boxes that led the lockdown because they'd already done
[2:19:35.240 --> 2:19:38.240]  the actuaries and studies knowing they would expand their market.
[2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:40.240]  Well, that's total monopoly.
[2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:45.240]  And also, we saw them cheering on when small businesses were looted and destroyed.
[2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:49.240]  And they were cheering on when Amazon, all these other big corporate entities, they were
[2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:53.240]  cheering on when the lockdowns continued to drovel these restaurants and other places
[2:19:53.240 --> 2:19:54.240]  and businesses out of business.
[2:19:54.240 --> 2:19:56.240]  And that, of course, goes to their benefit.
[2:19:56.240 --> 2:19:57.240]  You've still got to eat.
[2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:00.240]  If I can't go to the restaurant, I can't go to the store, well, these other places deliver
[2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:04.240]  and that just makes them wealthier and makes them more powerful because as these corporations
[2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:06.240]  get more money, it's not just nefarious.
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:08.240]  They make more money, more power to them in one sense.
[2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:10.240]  But that means they could get better lobbyists.
[2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:11.240]  That means they pay more taxes.
[2:20:11.240 --> 2:20:12.240]  That was my question.
[2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:16.240]  They get senators on the phone very, very easily.
[2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:18.240]  Would you call yourself a libertarian?
[2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:20.240]  I'm an anarchist without adjectives.
[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:23.240]  So, explain to me, and I'm going to cover this next segment because we've got three
[2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:25.240]  minutes left for this segment.
[2:20:25.240 --> 2:20:30.240]  I did a big libertarian, major anarchist leanings.
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:31.240]  I get all that.
[2:20:31.240 --> 2:20:37.240]  The problem is big corporations then have lobbied for libertarian ideas, but then they
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:40.240]  just exempt themselves from law and then they set up governmental systems.
[2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:42.240]  They get as big as government.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:45.240]  They act worse than government, then they team up and buy the government.
[2:20:45.240 --> 2:20:50.240]  And then so I'm sitting here watching this takeover that Heritage Foundation has helped
[2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:52.240]  do, and then I don't trust the government either.
[2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:56.240]  So what do you do caught between these two big power centers that are revolving doors
[2:20:56.240 --> 2:20:58.240]  incestuously screwing us over?
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:01.240]  That's something that I think is really important that you point out.
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:04.240]  That's something that I'm very happy that conservatives have come to appreciate.
[2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:07.240]  Long time, you and I are roughly about the same age.
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:11.240]  We remember when we were younger, the liberals would always attack the corporations.
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:12.240]  Corporate America.
[2:21:12.240 --> 2:21:13.240]  Occupy Wall Street.
[2:21:13.240 --> 2:21:14.240]  Corporate America is bad.
[2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:18.240]  Just like I was saying in an earlier segment, as soon as their corporations were serving
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:22.240]  their purposes and having their BLM stickers right away, the corporations are the good guys.
[2:21:22.240 --> 2:21:27.240]  The anarchist analysis is whenever you have government interference in the economy, it's
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:30.240]  always going to be hand in hand with corporate interests.
[2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:35.240]  It's always going to be hand in hand at the expense of the small business and little guy.
[2:21:35.240 --> 2:21:39.240]  And there's no other way because the little guy's not going to have that phone call.
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:42.240]  He's not going to have the ability to give the campaign contributions.
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:43.240]  So what is the answer?
[2:21:43.240 --> 2:21:50.240]  I mean, I really try now to only shop and support small boutiques and things.
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:52.240]  I wanted to go to the big box store because they got a bigger selection.
[2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:53.240]  It's quick.
[2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:54.240]  I get it.
[2:21:54.240 --> 2:21:55.240]  But they're so predatory now.
[2:21:55.240 --> 2:21:58.240]  I can't catch myself supporting big things anymore.
[2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:01.240]  They're predatory because they work hand in hand with the state.
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:04.240]  If you had a stateless society, a free society, a lot of this...
[2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:05.240]  They wouldn't have that enforcement.
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:06.240]  Right.
[2:22:06.240 --> 2:22:08.240]  Because corporations exist because of the will of the...
[2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:12.240]  Look at Twitter and all these other social media outlets where they have that exemption
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:14.240]  where they're not responsible.
[2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:17.240]  Whereas if I had my own little website, I'd be drawn out of business in five minutes.
[2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:20.240]  So this is inevitably what happens.
[2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:23.240]  The courts treat me completely different than other people.
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:24.240]  Of course.
[2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:28.240]  And that's the thing, when you talk about objective law, this is kind of this American idea that
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:32.240]  everyone's equal before the law, that's also complete nonsense because rich people will
[2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:34.240]  always have access to better lawyers.
[2:22:34.240 --> 2:22:36.240]  And they're going to come from a higher social class.
[2:22:36.240 --> 2:22:40.240]  So they're going to come off in a certain way very different from some poor person.
[2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:41.240]  Maybe that person's not educated.
[2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:43.240]  Plus, those judges on average are so political.
[2:22:43.240 --> 2:22:44.240]  Right.
[2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:45.240]  Like, if I'm a judge...
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:46.240]  Stay there.
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:47.240]  Let's come right back and talk about that.
[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:48.240]  And so much more.
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:55.240]  We'll stay with us.
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:47.240]  We'll see you next time.
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:55.240]  What are champions made of?
[2:23:55.240 --> 2:24:04.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:30.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:58.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:23.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:25:23.240 --> 2:25:51.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:26:20.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:46.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:27:12.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:41.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:28:10.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:39.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:28:39.240 --> 2:29:05.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:29:05.240 --> 2:29:31.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:29:31.240 --> 2:29:57.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:29:57.240 --> 2:30:23.240]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:30:23.240 --> 2:30:27.240]  Here's another example that will make people optimistic, which is just not being Pollyanna.
[2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:32.240]  30 years ago, people said sarcastically, oh, you don't like it.
[2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:33.240]  Build your own website.
[2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:39.240]  Now there's many outlets where for free or for cheap, you can have a website up and running.
[2:30:39.240 --> 2:30:46.240]  And now we see big tech and even the governor of Texas lobbying to shut down GAB because GAB is like what Facebook was three years ago.
[2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:51.240]  As long as you don't commit a crime and don't say kill somebody or deal drugs, you're allowed to be there.
[2:30:51.240 --> 2:30:54.240]  The governor is not a white supremacist, but they call him one and want him shut down.
[2:30:54.240 --> 2:30:57.240]  But the thing is, this is the point.
[2:30:57.240 --> 2:30:59.240]  They are lobbying to have this happen.
[2:30:59.240 --> 2:31:03.240]  If they had the power and the will to do it, they would have done it.
[2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:10.240]  So you always have to assume that there are people, whoever you're thinking about, who are going to want to deprive you of your freedoms and liberties.
[2:31:10.240 --> 2:31:15.240]  And you have to not engage with them necessarily because there's going to be somebody else who has these cockamamie ideas.
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:18.240]  But that's my question because I've already been the platformer.
[2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:21.240]  But put mechanism in place so they can't put their BS over on you.
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:22.240]  Sorry, Alex.
[2:31:22.240 --> 2:31:23.240]  No, I agree.
[2:31:23.240 --> 2:31:24.240]  So what are the mechanisms?
[2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:29.240]  We have the Democratic Party suing me, trying to find out what banks we use.
[2:31:29.240 --> 2:31:32.240]  I mean, these depositions, they don't ask me about the stuff they're suing me for.
[2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:33.240]  It's like, what are your bank accounts?
[2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:34.240]  How do we shut you down?
[2:31:34.240 --> 2:31:35.240]  How do we shut your satellites off?
[2:31:35.240 --> 2:31:41.240]  I mean, it's literally just scrambling to try to harass anybody we do business with.
[2:31:41.240 --> 2:31:42.240]  Very Hitlerian.
[2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:59.240]  Well, also, our legal system is designed, and this is another reason I'm an anarchist, to basically bleed people dry and have a draw out for years and never actually get to a resolution to make sure that people are paying lawyers out the wazoo and just basically having motion after motion.
[2:31:59.240 --> 2:32:04.240]  And if someone is wealthy enough, they can drive you into bankruptcy just by filing motions and motions.
[2:32:04.240 --> 2:32:05.240]  You're going to have to pay your lawyers.
[2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:07.240]  It's a really disturbing system.
[2:32:07.240 --> 2:32:11.240]  And hopefully, people will be more receptive to having free market alternatives to the legal system.
[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:23.240]  Well, I'm one of the only people, and you as well, that we're on air, and we've seen the democratization of information because of this, that really scares the system, that I can keep doing my show forever and not even get paid.
[2:32:23.240 --> 2:32:27.240]  So at a certain point, there's nothing they can do to stop me but kill me.
[2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:34.240]  What I want to ask you about is, I think in recent years, you were in Rogan recently, and he's been standing up for you pretty hardcore.
[2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:43.240]  Andrew Shelsey, you did his show, you did mine. Do you think that you were seeing a kind of, they did everything they could to kind of wipe you off the planet and take you off the Internet?
[2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:50.240]  Are you seeing a bit of a rehabilitation where you're not being regarded as this antichrist figure and more of someone who is like, okay, maybe he's a little weird?
[2:32:50.240 --> 2:32:52.240]  I want to say this.
[2:32:52.240 --> 2:32:57.240]  I don't want to thank my lucky stars, listeners supporting us, you know, everything that's happened.
[2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:04.240]  But I have seen the process I've been through make a lot of people that weren't paying attention actually hear what we're actually doing.
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:09.240]  And then they see what the media says we're doing versus what we actually do, and people get really mad about it.
[2:33:09.240 --> 2:33:16.240]  And so I almost want to say it's more of a cost to lab now, pretty avant-garde cutting edge.
[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:25.240]  And in fact, to the point of it, I never even imagined that or tried that, but in intellectual circles, that's basically what's happened now.
[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:28.240]  And two levels, I don't think I even deserve sometimes.
[2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:31.240]  So I've really hit a very special spot.
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:36.240]  And what's happening is, as all these things we predict to come true, just in all the white papers, it's not hard, you know, predict.
[2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:38.240]  It's like a restaurant has the thing on a menu.
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:39.240]  You order the food, it comes.
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:42.240]  I mean, they've got a menu of tyranny and agenda.
[2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:46.240]  So as all this stuff happens, I said what's happening, it's reached stratospheric.
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:51.240]  I went and got my haircut yesterday, and I had like six, seven people in there go, you're the Nostradamus guy.
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:53.240]  You're the guy that can tell the future.
[2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:55.240]  And I said, no, no, no, no, I know how tyranny works.
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:33:56.240]  This is easy.
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:33:58.240]  So instead, people love the villain.
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:33:59.240]  Well, people hate the system.
[2:33:59.240 --> 2:34:01.240]  So they said, I'm the villain.
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:03.240]  And so now it's the opposite.
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:06.240]  It's blown up with their face, quite frankly.
[2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:10.240]  Even assuming everything it said about you that is nefarious is true.
[2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:17.240]  You're not the one telling people like didn't Canada to quarantine children in their own room, lock them in a door for two weeks.
[2:34:17.240 --> 2:34:19.240]  They can't hug or see mom or dad.
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:25.240]  You're not the one telling people in Belgium to get cops on the back of horseback and clubbing old men.
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:30.240]  You can look us up on the Internet and women and women in the head, making them bloody because they're in a park.
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:35.240]  Is there any better example of a free Clydesdale horses running women over in England?
[2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:37.240]  I almost killed the woman.
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:38.240]  I did not see that.
[2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:40.240]  And this is all a Milgram experiment.
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:42.240]  Yes, yes, because this is what happened.
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:47.240]  World War One, the Washington took over the entire country, but they fight the Great War.
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:49.240]  I understand why they have to do that. This is a huge war.
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:55.240]  But then 15 years later, when you had FDR, he said, look, we did all this already during the Great War.
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:34:58.240]  And now it's the Great Depression, which is a far bigger threat to America than the Kaiser.
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:00.240]  We're going to take over the entire country again.
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:02.240]  So I tweeted this out before.
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:04.240]  There are a lot of people for better for worse.
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:12.240]  That's what you think of COVID had some very useful information about what Americans and people on the world are going to put up with from the state and from the corporate media.
[2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:22.240]  And if you go to after World War One, that basically the precursor of the FBI stage bombings her vodka turd anarchist as a pretext for the new the national police force we now have.
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:25.240]  Yeah, so many things were put into place.
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:33.240]  And can anyone listening this tell me with a straight face that it's impossible if they're going to say you have to stay in your home and not work to fight climate change.
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:35.240]  You can imagine it being said right now.
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:37.240]  They're already saying they want climate lockdowns.
[2:35:37.240 --> 2:35:38.240]  I didn't even know that song.
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:42.240]  And that's the thing. You're not no Stradamus. It's like these people aren't that clever.
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:52.240]  You know, if they say ABC, they're going to say well, that's what's frustrating is, is that it's it is every tool book of a tyrant to cartoon level.
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:54.240]  I mean, they're like throwing everything they've got.
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:55.240]  Yeah. Yeah.
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:35:59.240]  And maybe that's why Kamala Harris is laughing so much because it's all a cartoon to her.
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:02.240]  It really is crazy because we like you said.
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:05.240]  But the thing is, and here's what people need to appreciate.
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:08.240]  They have Ayn Rand, who's a great writer that everyone should be familiar with.
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:09.240]  She was on Donahue in 97.
[2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:15.240]  Now you can look at the clip on YouTube and he says to her, why are you so contemptuous of these people?
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:17.240]  Why didn't you just say, I disagree?
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:23.240]  And she goes, because I look at them because they don't hesitate to sacrifice entire nations.
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:25.240]  They're not they're perfectly fine.
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:33.240]  The crown jewels of New York of America, excuse me, are where the cities people call you move to New York, you go in LA Hollywood and look what they've done.
[2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:40.240]  They don't care if they take out things that are of value even to them just as long as they maintain their hold on power.
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:42.240]  Because if they don't have their power, what are they going to have?
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:43.240]  They're not going to be charming.
[2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:44.240]  It's Scorched Earth.
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:47.240]  Let's talk about Scorched Earth when we come back with Michael Malus.
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:48.240]  Stay with us.
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:49.240]  Thank you.
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:52.240]  I never had a marketing plan for Imple Wars.
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:56.240]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund her operation.
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:37:01.240]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you that you loved so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:03.240]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:04.240]  It's very, very simple.
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:05.240]  It's instinctive.
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:06.240]  It's spiritual.
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:07.240]  It's what I do.
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:09.240]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:16.240]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:18.240]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.240]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:23.240]  But we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.240]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:27.240]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:29.240]  I got to sell them at discount.
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:35.240]  And so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:37.240]  It won't be available for months.
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:38.240]  So get it.
[2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:45.240]  X2 is selling out at infowarstore.com for 40 and 60% off with double-patriot points and free shipping.
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:46.240]  Because why?
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:47.240]  That's when you buy it.
[2:37:47.240 --> 2:37:49.240]  We need your funds or it'll be off air.
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:50.240]  It's an amazing product.
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:54.240]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:57.240]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:38:00.240]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:05.240]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:11.240]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:18.240]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements.
[2:38:18.240 --> 2:38:23.240]  Because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:25.240]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:29.240]  I want to keep fighting the globalists but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:40.240]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:45.240]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:47.240]  All of it empowers humanity.
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:49.240]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:51.240]  Thank you so much.
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:39:00.240]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:09.240]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:16.240]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:24.240]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:28.240]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:41.240]  We've got a private label for them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:49.240]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global assistance.
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:52.240]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:59.240]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:02.240]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:08.240]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes, you don't have water, you die in a week or so, you don't have food a month or so.
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:16.240]  But what's in that food? Iodine. But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate and the food itself is lacking.
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:24.240]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine and governments are lowering the allowance you're supposedly going to need to have because they want control.
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:28.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful.
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:39.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:08.240]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:14.240]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:17.240]  Michael Malis and his crew are here with us.
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:29.240]  Michael Malis will also be on with me tomorrow on a special transmission that airs at 4pm central at infowars.com.
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:32.240]  Michael Malis is here with us for this little segment and one more.
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:34.240]  And then we've got Stu Peters taking over.
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:39.240]  Always does a great job in the fourth hour on Friday ahead of Owen Schreuer and the war room.
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:42.240]  And that is at 3pm central time today.
[2:41:42.240 --> 2:41:47.240]  It's 8am. We have Harrison Smith and American Journal as well.
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:56.240]  Please don't forget this weekend is the last time you can get free shipping and double patriot points for the foreseeable future.
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:42:02.240]  We've got a whole laundry list of great products that are on sale, but the biggest one is deep earth crystal atomic iodine.
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:04.240]  Most people are deficient in it.
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:07.240]  Over 2 billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:09.240]  This is really the missing link.
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:12.240]  The opposite of fluoride, the opposite of bromine, it's the good allergen.
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:19.240]  It's 60% off of the spray bottles, the same stuff in your mouth, but it aerosolizes and the dropper is 40% off.
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:23.240]  Infowarsstore.com, it is selling out, but I'm going to keep it on sale until it sells out.
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:31.240]  The rest of the sales on the storeable food and on the water filtration and everything else is going to be ending because the supplies are not there.
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:33.240]  But not because I don't want the supplies to not be there.
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:35.240]  It's because the economy is breaking down.
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:45.240]  We don't get a lot of in. That's why some of our best selling products have been sold out for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 months or have been discontinued because some of these companies have gone out of business or they've been bought up.
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.240]  It's been a huge consolidation.
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:49.240]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:51.240]  We are funded by you.
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:43:00.240]  Infowarsstore.com, get a book and a t-shirt while you're at it as well because certainly we've proven Infowars is changing the debate worldwide, really giving the globalists a run for their money.
[2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:02.240]  And that's all thanks to your support.
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:03.240]  So thank you so much.
[2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:06.240]  I've been asking a lot of questions. You got a lot of places you want to go.
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:08.240]  What else is on your radar?
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:11.240]  What else are you wanting to impart to the planet?
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:16.240]  I'm curious what you think is going to happen with Trump's lawsuit and you think he's got a shot.
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:19.240]  I'm sure you talked about it and the legal system is obviously very complicated.
[2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:21.240]  You know, you're not an attorney.
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:32.240]  But do you think this is something that is going to have legs and maybe it has legs in terms of not just legal in terms of legal success, but in terms of galvanizing people and having them have a different perspective.
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:36.240]  I've been sued more than 40 times by the Democrats to try to bankrupt and shut us down.
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:39.240]  We've gotten 34 of them thrown out.
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:40.240]  Oh, well.
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:45.240]  But I mean, we're talking the folks at Bankrupt and Remington, that's just coming after me.
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:47.240]  But did you see what just happened?
[2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:53.240]  They sued Remington and as a response, they gave him like 10,000 memes that were just complete.
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:56.240]  Jokes had nothing to do with it because Remington's like, what do we have to do with the shooting?
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:43:58.240]  That's not how the legal system works.
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:00.240]  Yeah, they said, give us the same law firm.
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:04.240]  Yeah, Kostkov and Kostkov, they said Senator Blumenthal basically runs it.
[2:44:04.240 --> 2:44:08.240]  And they said, they said to us, they go, give us the standard marketing.
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:10.240]  And I go, there isn't any marketing.
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:12.240]  Do we have a marketing meeting before this?
[2:44:12.240 --> 2:44:13.240]  No, sir.
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:16.240]  I mean, you said, seriously, I've got an underwear line now.
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:17.240]  Oh, that was it.
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:19.240]  So the marketing meeting was about your underwear.
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:22.240]  I mean, seriously, folks, but they, but see, they're also calculated.
[2:44:22.240 --> 2:44:25.240]  They think we're up here like masterminding everything.
[2:44:25.240 --> 2:44:37.240]  Well, I think, I think a lot of that is projection because so much what people don't appreciate is what is presented as fact by the corporate press is in reality a carefully constructed narrative designed to keep some very unpleasant people in power.
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:44.240]  So by the time you're seeing it on some kind of network, there's been a lot of meetings, there's a lot of producers are like, what message, what narrative do we want to put forward?
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:48.240]  Which is why you're going to have the same message across different outlets.
[2:44:48.240 --> 2:44:52.240]  But that, so they assume everyone else is going to do the same kind of project.
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:53.240]  And that's it.
[2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:56.240]  The average global is writing things is about 80 years old.
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:58.240]  They don't get how things work.
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:01.240]  I had a judge want to say, what is a meme?
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:04.240]  And I said, it's like a joke.
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:05.240]  It's like a cartoon.
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:08.240]  It's like a way to express something, not using words.
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:10.240]  Sometimes an image.
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:14.240]  That is the most boomer definition of a meme I've ever heard.
[2:45:14.240 --> 2:45:15.240]  What would you call a meme?
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:22.240]  A meme is an image with captions on it that has a comedic effect or some other emotional effect.
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:25.240]  Am I a boomer?
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:28.240]  You are totally a boomer, Alex.
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:31.240]  Sorry, okay.
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:32.240]  You're a boomer.
[2:45:32.240 --> 2:45:33.240]  I'm not a boomer.
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:35.240]  I know what a meme is.
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:36.240]  I know what a meme is.
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:40.240]  Two spaces after a period when you type?
[2:45:40.240 --> 2:45:41.240]  No.
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:42.240]  Then you're not a boomer.
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:43.240]  Okay.
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:44.240]  Let me explain what I'm saying.
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:47.240]  A meme is whatever you want it to be.
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:49.240]  And a meme is something people share.
[2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:50.240]  Yes.
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:52.240]  To me, it's like graffiti on the Roman walls.
[2:45:52.240 --> 2:45:53.240]  But it has a certain structure.
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:55.240]  It's a picture with a caption on it.
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:56.240]  That is a meme.
[2:45:56.240 --> 2:45:57.240]  What is this meme?
[2:45:57.240 --> 2:45:59.240]  I like this meme, Joe Rugger.
[2:45:59.240 --> 2:46:00.240]  Is that a meme?
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:01.240]  Who's that with him?
[2:46:01.240 --> 2:46:02.240]  I don't know why they put it up.
[2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:03.240]  I like it.
[2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:05.240]  I don't know who that is on the right.
[2:46:05.240 --> 2:46:07.240]  That's the original podcaster.
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:08.240]  Oh, okay.
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:09.240]  Oh, is that Adam Curry?
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:10.240]  Yep.
[2:46:10.240 --> 2:46:11.240]  I just had him on my show a couple weeks ago.
[2:46:11.240 --> 2:46:12.240]  I love Adam.
[2:46:12.240 --> 2:46:13.240]  He was here.
[2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:14.240]  I love Adam.
[2:46:14.240 --> 2:46:15.240]  He's been on the show many times.
[2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:16.240]  A smart dude.
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:19.240]  But then his Patreon people or whatever said, if you ever go back on his show, boy, you're finished.
[2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:20.240]  Oh, geez.
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:23.240]  So he won't even talk to me unless it's secretly over the fence.
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:26.240]  But it's kind of cool to be that black sheep.
[2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:27.240]  Yeah, but I mean...
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:28.240]  He did defend me on the show, by the way.
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:29.240]  I'm not attacking Adam Curry.
[2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:30.240]  No, no, no.
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:32.240]  I mean, Ruben has a site called Locals.
[2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:34.240]  I'm on malice.locals.com.
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:37.240]  I find a better alternative to Patreon because what I didn't like about Patreon, there was
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:41.240]  lawsuits, is overnight you could be vanished and your entire income is destroyed and a
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:44.240]  lot of people have seen that happen without any warning.
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:48.240]  Well, I just want my enemies to know that I'm gonna continue on no matter how many
[2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:49.240]  lawsuits they file.
[2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:50.240]  And you're not gonna kill yourself.
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:51.240]  And I'm not gonna kill myself.
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:52.240]  Okay, let's continue.
[2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:55.240]  So how do you think Biden's gonna end?
[2:46:55.240 --> 2:46:57.240]  Because there's so many videos I can't even plan.
[2:46:57.240 --> 2:46:59.240]  New ones of him not even knowing what planet he's on.
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:00.240]  It's definitely...
[2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:02.240]  You watched him in the debate.
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:03.240]  He had a few problems.
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:04.240]  He clearly had some cognitive decline.
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:06.240]  He is on another planet now.
[2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:07.240]  I'm looking...
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:11.240]  I really, really hope, as someone who's a troll and appreciates the humorous and absurd
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:15.240]  life, that he does run in 2024 because at that point he'd be literally disintegrating
[2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:17.240]  and be watching his jaw fall off.
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:18.240]  It'll be like...
[2:47:18.240 --> 2:47:20.240]  And they'll keep saying, oh, what a genius.
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:21.240]  Did you see a state of the union?
[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:23.240]  No, his jaw fell off to the Trump.
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:24.240]  Exactly.
[2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:25.240]  Right.
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:27.240]  Did you see a state of the union which they called something else?
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:28.240]  And they literally...
[2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:31.240]  We had a compilation of going, the baritone of that voice, the delivery.
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:33.240]  No one has ever been a speaker this good.
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:35.240]  He is the greatest speaker in history.
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:37.240]  It was like cartoonish what they're saying.
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:41.240]  But the thing is, they have to do this because who are you gonna believe?
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:44.240]  Your own lying eyes or the folks over at MSNBC.
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:49.240]  So they put him in, they dragged his carcass over the finish line and now it's their job
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:53.240]  to maintain this kind of semblance of authority and decency.
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:56.240]  Whereas anyone who looks at it for two seconds, I feel bad for the guy.
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:00.240]  I don't think as far as politicians go, he's a particularly evil one.
[2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:03.240]  There's some really, really malevolent authoritarians out there.
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:05.240]  I think he's just the party hack of the Democratic Party.
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:06.240]  Yeah, he just wants money.
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:07.240]  Yeah.
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:08.240]  He's a placeholder.
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:09.240]  He's a placeholder.
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:10.240]  He's a placeholder for black.
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:11.240]  Exactly.
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:14.240]  I mean, when people tell me that they think he's a Marxist, this guy doesn't have any
[2:48:14.240 --> 2:48:16.240]  political philosophy of his own whatsoever.
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:17.240]  He's just there to be reliable.
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:19.240]  He's a corrupt, ambulance-chasing lawyer.
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:20.240]  Yes, exactly.
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:24.240]  And frankly, I'd rather have that than someone who's an ideologue and authoritarian.
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:25.240]  Let me ask you this.
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:26.240]  Yes, sir.
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:30.240]  What is the left doing with the critical race theory and all this?
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:31.240]  I mean, we know what they're doing.
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:35.240]  They're declaring all their enemies and they have a conquered race so they can get rid of it.
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:38.240]  But denial of evolution is a form of white supremacy.
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:39.240]  Okay?
[2:48:39.240 --> 2:48:41.240]  So, birdwatching is white supremacy.
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:43.240]  French cuisine is white supremacy.
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:48.240]  I mean, again, it's reached absurdist levels and it's only getting worse.
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:49.240]  What is happening here?
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:53.240]  Because if you have a useful tool, right, and no one wants to be called a white supremacist,
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:58.240]  that's an absolutely horrible position that all these people don't even think about, let
[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:04.240]  alone countenance for a second, if I can persuade people that this is white supremacist,
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:06.240]  I don't have to have an argument about it.
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:09.240]  And this has been an effective tool for a long time, but now it's reached the point where
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:10.240]  it's just frothing at the mouth.
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:13.240]  So, it's beyond calling somebody a conspiracy theorist, meaning I don't want to debate you.
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:14.240]  It's just, oh, you're just racist.
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:16.240]  Well, it's not just racist.
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:18.240]  They tried racist for a long time.
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:19.240]  It didn't work.
[2:49:19.240 --> 2:49:20.240]  Trump got elected.
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:21.240]  So, then I have to escalate the notch.
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:25.240]  The reason why it's absurd is a lot of us will often have something that they're maybe
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:26.240]  accidentally racist.
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:29.240]  Like, if you have someone who's an immigrant, you might say something offensive to their
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:31.240]  culture and we don't want to do that, right?
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:35.240]  But at the same time, no one is worried that there are clothed white supremacists.
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:38.240]  No one goes to bed is accidentally going to be a member of the clan.
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:41.240]  This is something that takes intent and it takes an eye on you.
[2:49:41.240 --> 2:49:42.240]  It's like Monty Python.
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:45.240]  The fridge or the Spanish Inquisition.
[2:49:45.240 --> 2:49:51.240]  Yeah, the point being, at a certain point, you were speaking earlier to why they're losing,
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:53.240]  these are not effective tools.
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:49:57.240]  It is effective to say, hey, when you do X, Y, and Z, you're offending people.
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:49:58.240]  You shouldn't do it.
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:49:59.240]  All of us would listen.
[2:49:59.240 --> 2:50:00.240]  Like, I don't want to offend people.
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:01.240]  I want to be a nice guy.
[2:50:01.240 --> 2:50:05.240]  If you tell people, if you like this autobahn, then you're a white supremacist.
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:09.240]  At that point, it's like, we're not even having a conversation because that's not even a hypothesis.
[2:50:09.240 --> 2:50:11.240]  I'm going to take seriously for one moment.
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:12.240]  And you just said it.
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:13.240]  Calling everyone racist didn't work.
[2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:15.240]  So they just turned it up to 11.
[2:50:15.240 --> 2:50:16.240]  Right.
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:17.240]  Exactly.
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:19.240]  And it's just like, no one is a crypto Nazi.
[2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:23.240]  No one is at home secretly wanting Anne Frank to be murdered other than literal Nazis.
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:28.240]  This is not a concern that, especially in this country, people are worried about.
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:31.240]  You know, I know a lot of folks that immigrated from Eastern Europe.
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:32.240]  I can't tell you immigrated from Eastern Europe.
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:33.240]  How young were you?
[2:50:33.240 --> 2:50:34.240]  I was too.
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:35.240]  But we spoke Russian at home.
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:37.240]  So English is my second language, so cut me some slack.
[2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:39.240]  We finally got a Russian.
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:40.240]  Russian collusion.
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:41.240]  I'm a Russian troll.
[2:50:41.240 --> 2:50:42.240]  Yeah, you got it.
[2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:43.240]  It's happening.
[2:50:43.240 --> 2:50:44.240]  So they're right.
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:45.240]  We're conspiring.
[2:50:45.240 --> 2:50:46.240]  Oh my gosh.
[2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:47.240]  I finally found one.
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:48.240]  Hold on.
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:49.240]  Putin's in the earpiece.
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:50.240]  What's he saying?
[2:50:50.240 --> 2:50:51.240]  Assassinate Alex.
[2:50:51.240 --> 2:50:52.240]  He's a good guy.
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:53.240]  I'm not going to do it, Uncle Vlad.
[2:50:53.240 --> 2:50:54.240]  Exactly.
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:56.240]  What do you make of what Russia is doing with its Christian nationalism?
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:50:58.240]  A lot of folks think, oh, that's fake.
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:00.240]  I mean, I know a lot of people that live in Russia have talked to them.
[2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:02.240]  They say that it's 100% real.
[2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:03.240]  Yeah.
[2:51:03.240 --> 2:51:04.240]  I'm not that informed about what's going on.
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:05.240]  I'm boosting around Russia.
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:07.240]  You're not getting orders from Putin?
[2:51:07.240 --> 2:51:08.240]  I didn't say that.
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:09.240]  I've said too much.
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:14.240]  I was supposed to go there for two years in a row for my birthday with my buddy, Chris,
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:17.240]  who's another podcaster, to just see where I came from.
[2:51:17.240 --> 2:51:19.240]  And that has not been able to happen.
[2:51:19.240 --> 2:51:20.240]  We should go to Russia together.
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:21.240]  Would you be able to go?
[2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:24.240]  Well, I mean, I got, like two years ago, I was going to go to make a joke about the
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:28.240]  Russiagate stuff three years ago, and then they gave me the visa.
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:30.240]  But then they indicted Roger Stone.
[2:51:30.240 --> 2:51:31.240]  And he goes, dude, this isn't a joke.
[2:51:31.240 --> 2:51:32.240]  I wouldn't make a joke.
[2:51:32.240 --> 2:51:33.240]  OK.
[2:51:33.240 --> 2:51:34.240]  So I was like, I'm not going to go now.
[2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:35.240]  But now I do want to go.
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:38.240]  Now I want to go to Russia with Michael Malin.
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:40.240]  So we're right back.
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:43.240]  So we have free shipping, double patriot points through this weekend.
[2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:51.240]  And our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60% off
[2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:53.240]  and your purchase funds the M4.
[2:51:53.240 --> 2:51:57.240]  Seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because
[2:51:57.240 --> 2:51:58.240]  of lack of iodine.
[2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:00.240]  You need to experience it for yourself.
[2:52:00.240 --> 2:52:02.240]  Takes two weeks to a month to kick in.
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:03.240]  Try it and tell me what you think.
[2:52:03.240 --> 2:52:05.240]  You can't lose your fun in the M4.
[2:52:05.240 --> 2:52:10.240]  And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from
[2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:17.240]  research, I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without deep breath crystal iodine and
[2:52:17.240 --> 2:52:18.240]  X2.
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:21.240]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible.
[2:52:21.240 --> 2:52:23.240]  What it did for libido is incredible.
[2:52:23.240 --> 2:52:25.240]  When I don't take it, I feel the difference.
[2:52:25.240 --> 2:52:27.240]  When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:32.240]  Get your X2 today, discounted the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle to take it under
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:34.240]  your tongue at infowarstore.com.
