[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.680 --> 00:26.760]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.760 --> 00:33.480]  President-presidential candidate Ralph Nader is joining us later in the broadcast for a
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.440]  longer half-hour interview. He joined us a few weeks ago to give us a different
[00:38.440 --> 00:42.960]  perspective on what's happening with the staged elections with the two-party
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.000]  dictatorships that we have here in the United States. Then we're going to have
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.360]  Steve Quailon, always interesting, always informative to get his take on where he
[00:53.360 --> 01:00.640]  sees things going. Just a broadcast note, I will be on coast-to-coast AM for three
[01:00.640 --> 01:06.480]  hours tomorrow night for the full interview segment of the radio show to
[01:06.480 --> 01:15.680]  16 million listeners. And we hope that folks will tune in for that. But as I was
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.440]  saying, we have Ralph Nader coming up in about 30 minutes and then Steve Quail
[01:20.440 --> 01:25.480]  and I want to attempt to, in the third and fourth hour today, have opened up
[01:25.480 --> 01:31.120]  phones to get everybody's take on what's happening with the economy, the amazing
[01:31.120 --> 01:37.120]  developments in Pakistan, also over into the Caucasus, in Georgia, ongoing
[01:37.120 --> 01:43.680]  activities there and developments, and of course the domestic police state. I mean,
[01:43.680 --> 01:48.280]  we are so conditioned to accept it. Even those of us in the know that the Army
[01:48.280 --> 01:53.040]  announces last week, yeah, we're going to deploy combat brigades of the U.S. to
[01:53.040 --> 01:59.160]  quote, deal with the American people. A declaration of open war by North Com, the
[01:59.160 --> 02:04.720]  private banking military command center in Colorado Springs against the
[02:04.720 --> 02:09.040]  American people. Blackwater signing agreements to not do foreign deployments
[02:09.040 --> 02:13.480]  for other governments. Blackwater worldwide, no longer U.S. company, but to
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.040]  come here and suppress the American people as well. But because they stick
[02:18.040 --> 02:22.800]  American flags on their uniforms, everyone bows down, well, not everyone, but a
[02:22.800 --> 02:29.480]  group of idiots bow down and worship them, basically. I want to go over the
[02:29.480 --> 02:35.000]  news, the financial news. First today, it's very serious on a daily basis,
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.680]  obviously. Bank of China buys into Rothschild Bank. That is out of Shanghai
[02:43.680 --> 02:51.840]  daily. CNBC reports Paulson Bernanke to urge Congress not to delay on the
[02:51.840 --> 03:03.360]  parasite feeding known as a bailout. Fed acted like a liquidity drug dealer, also
[03:03.360 --> 03:11.840]  reports CNBC. Now the report here, Chadwick, the next crisis is being formed
[03:11.840 --> 03:18.880]  now. We're going to go over all this. Another report here on the economy. Only
[03:18.880 --> 03:25.760]  28% of the American people in a major poll support federal bailout plan. That's
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.760]  the Rasmussen poll, very respected. Also, another report here out of the
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.640]  Associated Press. Many economists skeptical about the bailout. In fact, the
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.960]  majority of economists say that this will only make the economic situation worse.
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.360]  Well, yes, for the American people and this country, but not for the
[03:44.360 --> 03:50.520]  international crime syndicate. This is called bone picking. They're going to
[03:50.520 --> 03:55.360]  bring us down. That's already a foregone conclusion. Might as well gut it wide
[03:55.360 --> 04:01.760]  open and suck out every drop, break open every bone, and gobble out the marrow.
[04:01.760 --> 04:10.520]  Don't leave anything on the 110-degree Savannah. Break it open. Get the marrow
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.240]  out like a good hyena. Also, one of the editors of the Huffington Post finally
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.320]  did a story about the Bush-Nazi connection that the BBC and others have
[04:19.320 --> 04:23.520]  covered. It's mainline news and the New York Times back in the 40s and 50s. Not
[04:23.520 --> 04:28.720]  like it's some secret. Now they're setting up the same thing today and she
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.240]  got a bunch of threats and people talk about how she should be arrested. Yep,
[04:34.240 --> 04:39.120]  remember our government supported Paul Pot. They supported Mao. They
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.280]  supported Hitler. It's not our government. So we'll come back and get it all
[04:44.280 --> 04:47.920]  financial news. Tell you about some of the other important news we've got for you
[04:47.920 --> 04:53.080]  as well. Very important broadcasts lined up today and I'm really honored to be
[04:53.080 --> 05:00.080]  here. Websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, infowars.net, prisoners.us.
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.680]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to
[05:05.680 --> 05:10.760]  grounds here and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did. Truth Rising is
[05:10.760 --> 05:15.520]  a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to
[05:15.520 --> 05:23.560]  tell their story. Whitman, EVA director on the AT made a statement that the air
[05:23.560 --> 05:28.680]  was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as
[05:28.680 --> 05:33.040]  brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He
[05:33.040 --> 05:36.720]  had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand
[05:36.720 --> 05:42.280]  off and you get three, two, one and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an
[05:42.280 --> 05:46.600]  emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at

[05:56.440 --> 06:01.040]  going to commit more acts and bring in martial law. You ever have one of those

[07:01.080 --> 07:05.160]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length
[07:05.160 --> 07:08.120]  here recently and she was talking about the Great Depression. We were talking
[07:08.120 --> 07:12.080]  about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty. We're in these
[07:12.080 --> 07:15.240]  you know really kind of perilous times. No one knows where we're headed or where
[07:15.240 --> 07:18.360]  we might end up. And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those
[07:18.360 --> 07:21.840]  days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs
[07:21.840 --> 07:24.680]  and they could grow gardens and can their food. But how difficult it was for
[07:24.680 --> 07:27.800]  people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the
[07:27.800 --> 07:30.800]  landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens in the
[07:30.800 --> 07:34.240]  livestock. So it's a lot different for them. Well we know one thing's certain
[07:34.240 --> 07:37.720]  right now. We're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global
[07:37.720 --> 07:41.600]  food shortage. Now what can you do to prepare? Do what I did. Sell some toys off
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.280]  in the garage. Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company. Get

[08:01.120 --> 08:06.480]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information
[08:06.480 --> 08:13.200]  war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:19.800 --> 08:26.160]  Momentarily I will get into more of the financial news and begin detailing it. We
[08:26.160 --> 08:30.960]  also have stories like this one. Magazine promotes sterilization for women in their
[08:30.960 --> 08:38.240]  20s and this is one of the largest teen and young women magazines in the UK
[08:38.240 --> 08:43.160]  that's given to teenage girls. You know the beautiful supermodels they're
[08:43.160 --> 08:48.600]  going out and getting sterilized. See that's what is so dangerous about the
[08:48.600 --> 08:53.360]  fad-driven culture. People think that subcultures and Hollywood culture,
[08:53.360 --> 09:00.920]  fashion culture, is just generated organically from different artists. But
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.280]  it isn't. Most of it is a corporate lead designed and hatched and in fact it's
[09:06.280 --> 09:09.880]  even come out in the Washington Post going back 10 years ago and other major
[09:09.880 --> 09:13.840]  publications and I had some of the writers on about going to big computer
[09:13.840 --> 09:19.480]  conferences with the Fortune 500 CEOs there saying we want people being and
[09:19.480 --> 09:24.440]  planted with chips in movies and we want to promote body modification and nose
[09:24.440 --> 09:28.960]  rings and I'm not getting into your nose ring. I know it's a precious accoutrement
[09:28.960 --> 09:33.360]  you know that accentuates who you are and is a message to everyone. Believe me I
[09:33.360 --> 09:39.040]  don't care. I'm telling you that they do and it's also the police are then trained
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.760]  to alert on those you know trendy hip-hop outfits and the body piercings and
[09:44.760 --> 09:52.360]  the tattoos. They're trained to alert on you as an enemy gang. Okay that's their
[09:52.360 --> 09:56.160]  basic programming and then you're just taught that it's trendy but but now
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.040]  they're being taught all over women's magazines. There's been several stories
[10:00.040 --> 10:05.240]  by Steve Watson and Paul Watson on this. The latest ones from Paul Watson dealing
[10:05.240 --> 10:12.880]  with telling women it's so cool. It's so radical. It's what everybody's doing. Go
[10:12.880 --> 10:16.360]  get sterilized and then there's always other mainstream articles with you know
[10:16.360 --> 10:21.080]  beautiful 25 year old supermodels getting sterilized and then they get the big
[10:21.080 --> 10:28.120]  contracts oh my gosh you got sterilized how sexy and people hear well that's the
[10:28.120 --> 10:30.960]  cool thing and they get little I'm sterilized tattoos and it's like
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.680]  absolutely I care about earth and in PETA a lot of their top people are getting
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.400]  sterilized because humans are bad. It's about devaluing human life so the
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.880]  global criminal state can have its way with us. It has nothing to do with the
[10:46.880 --> 10:49.840]  environment in fact it's the new world order that is actually hurting the
[10:49.840 --> 10:53.720]  environment with the genetic engineering and a list of a hundred plus other
[10:53.720 --> 10:58.920]  things but that's the bottom line there ladies and gentlemen we'll be getting
[10:58.920 --> 11:04.160]  into that report but I wanted to say something personally about myself
[11:04.160 --> 11:09.080]  sometimes I catch rebroadcast of my radio show or I click on different
[11:09.080 --> 11:15.240]  YouTube clips where people put my words the video and taken as a snapshot by
[11:15.240 --> 11:25.720]  itself you know it sounds pretty wild but reality is wild but it even makes me
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.680]  you know step back sometimes but but when I think about it the the mindset I
[11:30.680 --> 11:39.080]  get in regardless of what you think about Alex Jones the things I talk about
[11:39.080 --> 11:47.320]  here on this radio broadcast the issues I discuss here on this radio show are
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.720]  documented and real and most cases things are actually worse in hindsight
[11:53.720 --> 11:59.280]  than what we originally say on an issue so things are generally worse than
[11:59.280 --> 12:05.920]  we're even portraying and exposing here our limited perspective our limited
[12:05.920 --> 12:13.240]  individual intellects and consciousness is is is it cannot grasp the wet than
[12:13.240 --> 12:20.840]  breadth the depth of what we face as a society and it freaks me out you know
[12:20.840 --> 12:24.600]  I'm somebody who's mission oriented and dedicated to what I do so I stay
[12:24.600 --> 12:31.120]  focused on the task and that's why I actually tend to work so hard is not
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.880]  just to get the job done but also because anytime I get calm and anytime I
[12:35.880 --> 12:42.480]  get centered I don't like what I see in fact my understanding expands in the
[12:42.480 --> 12:48.120]  vistas and the horizons widen when I'm calm say sitting in a chair in my
[12:48.120 --> 12:53.720]  house at 1 a.m. in the morning after I finish I'm interviewing I've had some
[12:53.720 --> 13:00.280]  coffee at 10 p.m. and I'm awake and I can truly stare into the abyss well as
[13:00.280 --> 13:07.000]  I believe Nietzsche said the abyss stares back at you and begins to change you
[13:07.840 --> 13:16.760]  and I do catch myself fluxing shimmering switching over you know
[13:16.760 --> 13:25.720]  briefly for instances into evil as I grasp of the evil and I'm really going
[13:25.720 --> 13:31.960]  to attempt not to do that because it's very easy to slip into it just studying
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.520]  the enemy it's very dangerous and and I have to be honest with you that's why
[13:36.520 --> 13:43.880]  reporters have higher levels of divorce drinking drugs fistfights physical
[13:43.880 --> 13:48.960]  altercations especially old-fashioned gumshoe type muckraking reporters if you
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.840]  study history and look at even modern statistics but that's why they say old
[13:53.840 --> 14:00.560]  fashioned beat reporters are very similar to cops and then that's why in the
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.640]  old movies and you know they don't and in novels but then in real historical
[14:05.640 --> 14:11.240]  novels nonfiction you know you see that relationship between the reporters in
[14:11.240 --> 14:17.240]  the cops because what happens is the police get changed by what they see
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.960]  being in the muck being in the dirt being in with the scum and the drug
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.280]  dealers and the and the hookers and the corrupt judges and the other corrupt
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.360]  cops you get into it and you dance with the devil the devil doesn't change he
[14:31.360 --> 14:39.520]  changes you it's the same thing with me I mean it freaks me out to be able to
[14:39.520 --> 14:46.200]  have top Stanford and Harvard professors on and and and scientist and then
[14:46.200 --> 14:52.960]  toxicologist in you know the the head EPA toxicologist who a poison
[14:52.960 --> 14:59.920]  specialist chemist who wants the sodium fluoride and the other poisonous
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.240]  compounds they put in the water under that name out and the EPA won't do it
[15:03.240 --> 15:06.360]  and he's got the majority of the EPA scientists wanting to do it and they
[15:06.360 --> 15:13.240]  won't stop I mean even the government is basically good and doesn't want fluoride
[15:13.240 --> 15:16.720]  in the water and it doesn't stop because those on top are in control and
[15:16.720 --> 15:23.480]  they're not going to stop and look I know the police are out late at night
[15:23.480 --> 15:27.480]  dealing with dangerous people another scum all over the place I know society's
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.520]  degenerating I know police have to go in and see horrible things in people's
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.880]  houses how long was a carpet cleaner for four months and got a chance to see
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.760]  that that's why I quit I couldn't go into flee infested places where drug addicts
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.400]  have been pissing all over the floor you know because some landlord's selling and
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.680]  I mean I just can't do it so I can't imagine what cops see dad and dad I
[15:48.680 --> 15:52.440]  understand then you get a view of everyone is scum and trash and against
[15:52.440 --> 15:58.040]  you because frankly a lot of society is and then see I start getting that view
[15:58.040 --> 16:05.280]  of the public the police then my family I just can't get the dirt out of my
[16:05.280 --> 16:12.040]  brain is what I'm saying I just I've seen so much ladies and gentlemen and I
[16:12.040 --> 16:16.560]  know I'm gonna see a lot more and I it is not even the New World Order that
[16:16.560 --> 16:27.920]  where is our main threat it is us we've met the enemy and it's it's us oh yeah
[16:27.920 --> 16:33.720]  the worst of us are in control the worst aspects of man put criminal ruthless
[16:33.720 --> 16:38.840]  sadistic people with no conscience into control
[16:41.040 --> 16:47.520]  then there's just everybody else trying to survive now it flips me out to know
[16:47.520 --> 16:50.800]  dying corn Halliburton really do run giant child kidnapping rings they don't
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.760]  even get in trouble doing it it freaks me out to know most the cocaine and
[16:54.760 --> 17:02.000]  heroin shipped into our country I know it's a complex issue I know because
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.880]  it's illegal it creates a black market that the criminal element gravitates
[17:05.880 --> 17:09.760]  towards it so the police can point at and say yeah but look what everything else
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.520]  that surrounds drugs and look at how bad these people are yeah look at how it
[17:14.520 --> 17:22.040]  corrupts you you can't change that you just become it and the the social
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.160]  engineers did that on purpose they wrote books on how to do it when they took
[17:25.160 --> 17:29.840]  over China 150 years ago with opium I mean go read about that go learn about
[17:29.840 --> 17:34.880]  that that's happening here and then I realize that everything we're trying to
[17:34.880 --> 17:40.320]  stop everything we've warned people about is now coming true because the new
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.320]  order said they do it and then they keep their promises and if you think bad
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.240]  things have happened so far and you think things have been crazy planes flying
[17:49.240 --> 17:55.320]  into buildings buildings collapsing wars sneak attacks on Russian
[17:55.320 --> 18:00.760]  territories dollar plunging economy falling apart we've seen nothing yet
[18:00.760 --> 18:06.040]  and so I get psyched up to deal with this that's what happens I get psyched up I
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.200]  get fired up to come on the air and face it down and deal with it and try to
[18:11.200 --> 18:18.120]  motivate people to fight it and I know I come off like a wild man but I mean it
[18:18.120 --> 18:23.080]  is wild and what we're dealing with is wild what we're going up against is
[18:23.080 --> 18:29.720]  well it's just out of control it's bad and the people running things I mean
[18:29.720 --> 18:35.680]  Zbigniew Brzezinski bragged how when he was running the Carter administration
[18:35.680 --> 18:39.920]  they supported the Kermit Rouge and Pol Pot killing two million people
[18:39.920 --> 18:47.200]  conservatively anybody who could read anybody who had glasses anybody that I
[18:47.200 --> 18:50.320]  mean they just took whole families out millions of them and killed them they
[18:50.320 --> 18:53.880]  killed about a third the population of that little country and our criminal
[18:53.880 --> 18:59.400]  government it's not our government I I I you know and it's not that I revoke and
[18:59.400 --> 19:02.960]  rescind my citizenship or I'm an American and I know it's the opposite of
[19:02.960 --> 19:09.160]  that they're not American they don't represent me they're illegitimate and
[19:09.160 --> 19:13.880]  to know they put Mao in who killed conservatively the Chinese government
[19:13.880 --> 19:18.800]  admits 65 million their real numbers closer to 85 million I mean try to get
[19:18.800 --> 19:25.640]  your mind around 85 million people in 20 years and it turns out Rockefeller
[19:25.640 --> 19:31.960]  Brothers Foundation Carnegie Endowment the CIA and others funded all that stuff
[19:31.960 --> 19:39.040]  and you bragged that you did it it's not even a hidden and then I think I'm
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.440]  going head up against these people when they when there's there's no quarter
[19:44.440 --> 19:48.640]  there's no bad there's no stopping there's no but I can't get into it I
[19:48.640 --> 19:52.160]  can't go along with it I'm past the Florida return there's no way getting

[24:07.480 --> 24:15.280]  scheduled to have Ralph Nader on in about 10 minutes then Steve Quayle on the
[24:15.280 --> 24:21.520]  23rd of September 2008
[24:25.240 --> 24:29.400]  the mainline economist is saying this is gonna fully bankrupt the economy and
[24:29.400 --> 24:35.160]  kill the dollar got a stack of news on that front they're dumping hundreds of
[24:35.160 --> 24:40.120]  billions of dollars a day into the market they promised multi trillion
[24:40.120 --> 24:44.000]  dollar payouts on 700 billion every defined print now Paul's and saying
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.840]  they're gonna bail out foreign banks as well they're actually taking all this
[24:49.840 --> 24:53.480]  money as they get it the last trillion bucks they put in the last year and a
[24:53.480 --> 24:58.000]  half they go in and basically leverage the market short the market play games
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.760]  there I'm gonna get more into the economy after Ralph Nader leaves us with
[25:02.760 --> 25:07.040]  Steve Quayle but I wanted to just briefly like three minutes bring Ted up
[25:07.040 --> 25:13.560]  today because you don't have to be left behind in all of this they're not gonna
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.120]  be able to suppress gold's price forever you saw it shot up its biggest one
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.680]  time gain in one day over 80 bucks in one day that another 30 bucks it's
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.640]  gained total it's staying right up near 900 going back and forth between 888
[25:26.640 --> 25:33.960]  and 900 today and Ted has been able to get gold and silver at the price it was
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.000]  before that so you can save some money and really get an unprecedented deal on
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.840]  some select gold and silver coins but as all the economists are saying this is
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.920]  gonna kill the dollar whether it's this month or two years from now this is
[25:49.920 --> 25:53.520]  gonna be really bad this is this is the establishment looting what they can at
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.040]  the end Ted Anderson we got about three minutes in this segment but a lot's
[25:57.040 --> 26:00.720]  happening today there's a lot and I really can't go into it because we have
[26:00.720 --> 26:03.680]  such a short time period but I was reading that article in Bloomberg by
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.120]  Nelson and Warshat I mean I was just amazed as far as you know I mean they
[26:09.120 --> 26:15.480]  were talking about the the largest the largest foreign exchange company out
[26:15.480 --> 26:20.360]  there right now they deal with 15 billion in assets is saying that the
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.520]  United States dollars toast because they're pumping in this bailout and I
[26:25.520 --> 26:28.040]  don't know why they're turning that direction they just simply don't get
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.440]  with these numbers you always say billion when it's trillion well this is
[26:32.440 --> 26:37.920]  what they're doing what they deal with the 15 15 billion dollar hedge fund and
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.760]  uh... and it and it's kind it's the largest one in New York City and it's
[26:42.760 --> 26:46.640]  just a it it just flat out amazes me that they're allowing this to happen that's
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.600]  right in fact you don't even have to tune in here now to hear it you know that the
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.200]  information about international banks looting us and me that's the British
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.360]  that's the u.s. headlines there admitting a lot of people are admitting the good
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.800]  news here ted uh... is that only twenty percent of the american people in a
[27:02.800 --> 27:08.360]  major ross muson poll very scientific agree with the uh... sellout the rob
[27:08.360 --> 27:14.240]  out bailout plan but uh... doesn't matter if only twenty eight percent
[27:14.240 --> 27:17.760]  are for it the establishment doesn't care what the people want
[27:17.760 --> 27:20.840]  to tell about the golden silver offer today so people can get out of the
[27:20.840 --> 27:22.440]  dollar or at least
[27:22.440 --> 27:24.840]  hedge their back a little bit of uh... insurance
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.440]  well again alex gold today's highs nine oh five fifty u.s. me if i could hold my
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.000]  prices from that eight seventy level that are locked in a yet and yes i can

[27:42.480 --> 27:44.120]  great buy to get into

[27:51.920 --> 27:55.160]  there is no question in my mind and there shouldn't be in anybody who's
[27:55.160 --> 27:56.960]  listening to the show by now
[27:56.960 --> 27:59.480]  as to whether or not there's trouble in the economy

[33:03.800 --> 33:24.400]  thank you for joining us for the next half hour we are joined of course by the
[33:24.400 --> 33:30.720]  anti-corporate corruption crusader Ralph Nader sometime I really ought to go
[33:30.720 --> 33:34.120]  through his bio I know everybody knows who Ralph Nader is but some people may
[33:34.120 --> 33:38.360]  not know the full or even part of the history of this interesting individual
[33:38.360 --> 33:44.480]  he is running for president as a independent and I wanted to get him on
[33:44.480 --> 33:49.960]  today to talk about his campaign and you know why he is running and why it's
[33:49.960 --> 33:58.240]  important obviously more than ever now people are listening to his message but
[33:58.240 --> 34:01.960]  I want people to get a chance to really hear from Ralph Nader today and support
[34:01.960 --> 34:09.040]  his campaign because the military industrial complex completely controls
[34:09.040 --> 34:15.520]  the Republican Democratic Party now that is more clear today than ever and we
[34:15.520 --> 34:18.520]  now even have Ron Paul coming out they had a great press conference a few
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.240]  weeks to go together of course at the McKinney Congress from Ron Paul Ralph
[34:22.240 --> 34:26.160]  Nader and others saying they've got to you know everybody's just got the support
[34:26.160 --> 34:31.120]  outside voices because those are the true voices the American people on every
[34:31.120 --> 34:37.680]  issue the Congress does what is unpopular and unconstitutional same with
[34:37.680 --> 34:43.280]  the president just right down the line never before has it been so obvious with
[34:43.280 --> 34:47.520]  Congress with a 9% approval rating so I want to go over that today and I've got
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.880]  a few questions of my own for Ralph Nader and we're only 40-something days out
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.280]  from the election ladies and gentlemen a Ralph Nader thanks for spending time
[34:57.280 --> 35:02.040]  with us today a pleasure Alex you've got the floor instead of me throwing
[35:02.040 --> 35:06.200]  questions out what do you think is most important for the listeners to be
[35:06.200 --> 35:11.480]  informed about and and not just informed how do they take action to try to
[35:11.480 --> 35:18.080]  continue to expand a movement to resist what is clearly corporate fascism
[35:18.080 --> 35:23.680]  looting the entire economy now in the final phase of just completely
[35:23.680 --> 35:29.680]  imploding the nation well the vote for Nader Gonzalez to put it in a nutshell
[35:29.680 --> 35:33.920]  we're the only candidacy and we're number three now with six seven eight
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.680]  percent in the polls on 45 state ballots we're the only candidacy that predicted
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.120]  this Wall Street implosion the crooks on Wall Street for 20 years I've been
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.060]  warning about this even by naming the companies you know the bank city bank and
[35:48.060 --> 35:54.120]  Merrill Lynch and AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and I testified and wrote and
[35:54.120 --> 36:00.280]  articles and had press conferences nobody listened nobody listened because
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.240]  corporations are running our government and our government officials are on
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.480]  leave from Wall Street and other corporate executive positions to run the
[36:08.480 --> 36:11.520]  Department of Treasury Department of Defense Department of Agriculture
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.880]  Interior and many other departments and we don't have a government that
[36:16.880 --> 36:20.640]  represents it that stands for the working stiff in this country that stands for
[36:20.640 --> 36:24.520]  the people who do all the hard work that stands for the people who pay all the
[36:24.520 --> 36:30.480]  bills the consumers the taxpayers and that's why on our website we have good
[36:30.480 --> 36:34.400]  information on what to do with this Wall Street meltdown I mean it could have
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.280]  been prevented with comprehensive regulation instead at Clinton and his
[36:39.280 --> 36:45.440]  the banking buddy Robert Rubin rammed through Congress in 1999 with both party
[36:45.440 --> 36:51.560]  support the financial deregulation in other words they took the federal cop
[36:51.560 --> 36:56.400]  off the Wall Street crime beat and then they the companies were off to the races
[36:56.400 --> 37:00.920]  using other people's money these executives pension monies for workers
[37:00.920 --> 37:05.840]  and mutual funds and small favors and people have a few shares in these so
[37:05.840 --> 37:10.000]  called blue ribbon companies and they drove them into the ground and then
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.440]  before the the crash occurred they made sure that these bosses got huge
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.880]  executive compensation packages and so when they quit or were pushed out of
[37:21.880 --> 37:27.280]  places like Citibank and Merrill Lynch and AIG and so on they took away 10 20
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.760]  30 40 50 million bucks and what we're saying is now that Wall Street is
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.880]  melted down and drained and looted trillions of dollars of worker money
[37:36.880 --> 37:42.520]  pension money small investors what we have to do is have the following of
[37:42.520 --> 37:48.600]  quick sequence no bailouts without taxpayer equity that is if the taxpayer
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.680]  in Washington is going to bail out these crooks these corporations and
[37:53.680 --> 37:59.080]  absorb the assets and try to resell them if they come back to profit if these
[37:59.080 --> 38:03.800]  companies come back to profit the taxpayer gets made whole and gets part of
[38:03.800 --> 38:07.960]  the profit a dividend yeah exactly that's what happened with the Chrysler
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.760]  bailout 1979 the Treasury Department under Jimmy Carter insisted in return for
[38:13.760 --> 38:16.920]  this what now looks like a quaint billion and a half dollar loan
[38:16.920 --> 38:21.920]  guaranteed or Chrysler with the taxpayer would have stock warrants and they got
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.640]  stock warrants and when Chrysler turned around made money the stock warrants
[38:25.640 --> 38:29.040]  were sold by the U.S. Treasury and the taxpayer had 400 million dollars in
[38:29.040 --> 38:32.000]  profit well Mr. Nader I want to get into your plan to fix this and I think you've
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.800]  got a great plan here it is sensible but here is very quickly well I mean let's
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.000]  go into that but first yeah let me just throw this out what about criminal
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.840]  charges what about punishing people or they're going to continue to do this this
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.640]  is only intensifying the orgy of looting there's no discussion of
[38:48.640 --> 38:52.480]  indictments no discussion of investigations just bailouts and we
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.120]  also see them changing the bankruptcy laws and changing laws so they could
[38:57.120 --> 39:03.120]  dilute pensions in the last six years so we see premeditated preparation for
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.440]  this plan theft coming can you speak to that and then give us your your plan to
[39:06.440 --> 39:10.440]  fix it you're absolutely right there's no talk in Washington which is in a
[39:10.440 --> 39:16.640]  flurry trying to bail out these crooks of prosecution and conviction in fact
[39:16.640 --> 39:21.160]  these guys got off with huge golden parachutes and they're probably in the
[39:21.160 --> 39:27.040]  Bahamas or in Hawaii sending themselves it is amazing isn't it that this
[39:27.040 --> 39:32.480]  was a corporate crime fraud and abuse spectacular in Wall Street with
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.560]  trillions of dollars and there's no talk of law and order prosecution
[39:37.560 --> 39:43.000]  conviction and imprisonment of these crooks and of course you put a lot of
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.040]  corporate crooks in prison and prison reform will come because they can't
[39:47.040 --> 39:52.200]  stand the quality of the food so you're right right at the top should be that
[39:52.200 --> 39:56.720]  that's what deterrence is that's what creative punishment is all about that's
[39:56.720 --> 40:02.840]  what the people of America expect they expect that when guys at the top are
[40:02.840 --> 40:10.080]  crooks and they lie steel and and and and deceive people that they have to make
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.640]  they have to pay the time they have to do the time they have to be prosecuted so
[40:14.640 --> 40:18.800]  I urge your listeners just to contact your members of Congress now we're
[40:18.800 --> 40:23.720]  having hearings and say hey what about the corporate crime enforcement component
[40:23.720 --> 40:29.400]  of this but no bailouts without taxpayer equity without cracking down on the
[40:29.400 --> 40:35.840]  corporate crooks without ending any golden parachutes without requiring you
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.200]  got to require disgorgement they got to pay back their old gotten gains you got
[40:40.200 --> 40:43.800]  to give shareholders control over the company yes that they own you know
[40:43.800 --> 40:47.360]  shareholders could have stopped if they never would have allowed the these
[40:47.360 --> 40:53.440]  obscene pay packages and this reckless speculation with their money
[40:53.440 --> 41:01.800]  and finally we need two ways to reduce the speculation one is to make the
[41:01.800 --> 41:05.960]  speculators use more of their own money that's called margin accounts now they
[41:05.960 --> 41:10.960]  can borrow a buck and and and and speculate on a buck but what if they
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.560]  have to put 50 cents of their own money in the buck they'd be more careful well
[41:15.560 --> 41:19.080]  I'm sure we just banned naked shorting I mean they don't put any money up but
[41:19.080 --> 41:22.400]  yeah yeah that can be bad but I'm just talking about your run of the mill
[41:22.400 --> 41:28.080]  speculation with pension money for example and finally and you like this
[41:28.080 --> 41:33.400]  one you go into a store your listeners going to store in most of the states
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.880]  where you're heard and they have to pay sales tax when they buy clothing
[41:37.880 --> 41:44.520]  appliances some some states even food medicine but today someone on Wall
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.160]  Street can buy a hundred million dollars of Exxon derivatives or Pfizer
[41:49.160 --> 41:55.800]  derivatives or GM derivatives and not pay a dime so it's unfair that the
[41:55.800 --> 42:01.760]  speculators pay no sales tax the working steps the workers pay sales tax on
[42:01.760 --> 42:07.720]  necessities the speculators pay no sales tax on speculation so Nader Gonzales on
[42:07.720 --> 42:14.080]  boatnader.org you can see up are demanding a securities derivative
[42:14.080 --> 42:20.840]  speculation tax which if it's less than 1% on the 500 trillion dollars of
[42:20.840 --> 42:27.160]  transactions this year trillion dollars it would raise a lot of money and the
[42:27.160 --> 42:32.520]  federal income tax on more workers can be significantly reduced in return so
[42:32.520 --> 42:37.640]  taxes speculators for you tax honest labor that's why we think our website is
[42:37.640 --> 42:41.640]  the most honest presidential website ever and we list very clearly on the
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.920]  issues page of boatnader.org all the changes most of them supported by
[42:46.920 --> 42:49.760]  majority the American people that are on our table
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.360]  Nader Gonzales and are off the table McCain and Obama. Well I would challenge
[42:54.360 --> 43:00.120]  listeners who think they may know Ralph Nader just from what they've seen on
[43:00.120 --> 43:03.720]  corporate media go to the website watch 30 minute speeches hour-long speeches
[43:03.720 --> 43:08.480]  they're dynamic but it's also chop full of facts and information from
[43:08.480 --> 43:12.080]  somebody who is informed it's been many hours a day studying this guy's telling
[43:12.080 --> 43:15.880]  you the truth right down the line it's so refreshing and also you can see the
[43:15.880 --> 43:19.920]  press conference and the speeches with you and Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney and
[43:19.920 --> 43:23.600]  action plans and you know regardless of where the campaign goes people should
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.640]  support it donate to it get involved because people need to know that there
[43:28.640 --> 43:33.680]  is an alternative to the one-party dictatorship of the two Siamese twins
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.880]  that we are dealing with here now now I want to get your view on what's gonna
[43:39.880 --> 43:42.560]  happen in the short term and long term and then go through some other things
[43:42.560 --> 43:45.840]  that are happening and tell folks how to get involved with the campaign also we
[43:45.840 --> 43:48.880]  have a lot of listeners on AM and FM and shortwave and satellite we don't have
[43:48.880 --> 43:51.840]  internet we need to give out if you have one or get your staff in the break
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.080]  coming up in five minutes to give us a toll-free number for folks that want to
[43:55.080 --> 43:58.760]  call and support the campaign that way because about 30 of our audience doesn't
[43:58.760 --> 44:01.920]  have internet so they can also get involved in the campaign so we don't
[44:01.920 --> 44:05.920]  leave them out right that that's very very considerate of people don't have
[44:05.920 --> 44:13.720]  internet yeah they have the phone numbers 202-471-5833 and I'll repeat it
[44:13.720 --> 44:21.160]  202-471-5833 for contributions you can give up to $2,300 and every
[44:21.160 --> 44:26.360]  $2,300 we'll put a full-time person in one of the states to get out the vote for
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.680]  Nader Gonzalez so if you want a full-time person in your state to get out the
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.920]  vote and we know how to show them to get out the vote just to send $2,300
[44:35.920 --> 44:41.080]  obviously if you can't afford that you send 10, 20, 50, 100, 300 whatever you
[44:41.080 --> 44:47.360]  can afford the website to get informed about why we stand with you for you by
[44:47.360 --> 44:53.000]  you is votenader.org and in the 10 days from September 17th Constitution Day
[44:53.000 --> 44:58.280]  Alex we're having Constitution Day and people want to know about our
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.680]  Constitution pledge and take the pledge because as we speak Bush and Secretary
[45:03.680 --> 45:08.240]  Treasury Paulson is tearing the Constitution out by its roots by
[45:08.240 --> 45:14.800]  demanding that Congress give the White House $700 billion bailout blank check
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.360]  okay that was my next question was the police state and the engineered collapse
[45:19.360 --> 45:23.120]  the Bill of Rights but before we get into that the pledge the Constitution pledge
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.440]  dot com that you want to take the Constitution pledge Constitution pledge.com
[45:28.440 --> 45:34.240]  it's amazing this bill I have on my desk it's four pages in four pages Bush is
[45:34.240 --> 45:38.640]  demanding that Congress give him a blank check for a $700 billion bailout
[45:38.640 --> 45:43.040]  immunity for the government officials like Secretary Treasury for many lawsuits
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.880]  for whatever he does no judicial review to our courts he knocks out the courts
[45:47.880 --> 45:53.200]  and he tells Congress give me all your constitutional authority I King George
[45:53.200 --> 45:58.800]  will bail out the Wall Street crooks folks we're talking to Ralph Nader live
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.040]  Mr. Nader hold on one second because this is so huge what you're saying I
[46:03.040 --> 46:07.720]  don't want to just just just you know move past this I want to focus people in
[46:07.720 --> 46:11.640]  the White House was in the LA Times quotes a Bush saying yeah we're not
[46:11.640 --> 46:15.480]  following the checks and balances and Bloomberg financial had the headline
[46:15.480 --> 46:20.640]  Bush given dictatorial power I want to explain to people we have the former
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.840]  head of Goldman Sachs who's bailing himself out literally the Fox guarding
[46:25.840 --> 46:29.560]  the henhouse we've never seen anything like this a conflict of interest like
[46:29.560 --> 46:36.440]  this we've never seen looting this makes in Ron all of you all of that look like
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.520]  a joke can you bring this into perspective what we're witnessing what
[46:41.520 --> 46:49.120]  we're witnessing Alex is basically the criminal collapse of the trustees of the
[46:49.120 --> 46:53.360]  people's money which we call Wall Street the banks investment banks brokerage
[46:53.360 --> 46:58.600]  firms you name it people are going to feel this for months and months they're
[46:58.600 --> 47:01.880]  not going to be able to pay their mortgage monthly they're not going to be
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.200]  able to buy the necessities of life interest rates of course are very low
[47:07.200 --> 47:14.640]  on their little savings banks some get less than 1% and these trustees turned
[47:14.640 --> 47:22.680]  criminals recklessly speculating in ways that would stagger the imagination in
[47:22.680 --> 47:27.520]  terms of how thin the financial paper is as this pass one firm to another and
[47:27.520 --> 47:32.160]  then sent overseas their towns in norway northern Norway that are near
[47:32.160 --> 47:36.680]  bankruptcy because they bought these collateral collateralized home mortgages
[47:36.680 --> 47:41.600]  trusting Wall Street without adequate disclosure you know when prosecutors said
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.720]  all these complex financial deals here's what they come down to lion
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.080]  cheating and stealing that's it so these corporate crooks go to wash Wall Street
[47:52.080 --> 47:59.440]  I summed it up this way this morning socialist Superman is sweeping down on
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.360]  New York City from Washington DC to bail out the casino gambling corporate
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.440]  crooks on Wall Street which is spewing forth more and more kryptonite how much
[48:11.440 --> 48:15.800]  can the taxpayer pay before the rubber band snaps well that's the point I wanted
[48:15.800 --> 48:21.440]  to make is that is that they're taking the the the bailout money that's been
[48:21.440 --> 48:25.840]  coming in the hundreds of millions a week and then they said oh Wall Street's
[48:25.840 --> 48:30.280]  banned shorting but only against 740 something of their institutions then
[48:30.280 --> 48:35.160]  declaring open season on the real economy the manufacturing economy for GM
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.360]  General Electric and now they're out rating everything else I mean this is
[48:39.360 --> 48:43.400]  what what appears to be they're pulling out all the stops they know it's all
[48:43.400 --> 48:48.920]  going down Ralph Nader and they are just in a orgy of theft right and listen to
[48:48.920 --> 48:54.280]  that the taxpayers never asked never consulted there's no national direct
[48:54.280 --> 48:57.920]  referendum the way Mike Ravel was proposing which is rooted in our
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.200]  Constitution and Declaration of Independence in terms of authority so the
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.440]  taxpayer is in the dark the taxpayers never consulted the taxpayers never
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.600]  represented by members of Congress who are now being asked to give a $700
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.920]  billion blank check to George W. Bush King George and the taxpayer will pay
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.600]  and pay until the taxpayer has a say we're running we're running a number
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.880]  three presidential race Nader Gonzalez to give the taxpayer the worker and the
[49:27.880 --> 49:33.240]  consumer through their votes power to control their government and take it
[49:33.240 --> 49:37.820]  away from these giant corporations who have now become our government now
[49:37.820 --> 49:42.720]  Nader the Ross music poll says 28% support federal bailout there's a
[49:42.720 --> 49:47.360]  Zogby only showing 31% so the point here is the people don't support it it's
[49:47.360 --> 49:51.640]  criminal it's international and then they say people that don't want to bail out
[49:51.640 --> 49:56.920]  they're calling us socialists when this is the big banks basically stealing our
[49:56.920 --> 50:00.920]  birthright and indebting all of us and then they run around calling themselves
[50:00.920 --> 50:05.440]  conservatives how big a joke is that it's a huge job reminds me my daddy when
[50:05.440 --> 50:10.000]  I was 10 years old he asked me at dinner table why will capitalism always
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.560]  survive and I tried some answers but his answer was because capitalism will
[50:16.560 --> 50:21.520]  always require socialism to bail it out to save it and that that's Wall Street
[50:21.520 --> 50:27.320]  requiring Washington to save it and the tragedy is that the taxpayer gets no
[50:27.320 --> 50:31.440]  equity here if the taxpayer is going to pay the bill to bail out these
[50:31.440 --> 50:37.240]  corporations well why didn't he get 15 20 30 40% shares of these corporations
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.560]  come around in a better day and make money the taxpayer not only gets made
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.720]  whole but actually makes a profit that's what happened on the Chrysler bailout
[50:45.720 --> 50:50.360]  1979 $480 profit mr. and we got a break final segment with

[55:35.840 --> 55:40.360]  getting in the it's really having an effect and you're exposing the fraudulent
[55:40.360 --> 55:44.360]  system of how this private corporation keeps any third party or any other voice
[55:44.360 --> 55:48.520]  out of the debates even preliminary debates so we never get to vote for

[56:07.800 --> 56:12.160]  want me ralph nader to be on the stage with mccain and obama absolutely but
[56:12.160 --> 56:15.760]  however that's how absurd the situation is and i didn't want to leave the
[56:15.760 --> 56:19.880]  impression that we would not welcome smaller contributions folks five ten
[56:19.880 --> 56:23.320]  twenty thirty forty dollars whatever you can afford

[56:38.200 --> 56:39.120]  pack money
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.280]  we run a presidential campaign
[56:41.280 --> 56:46.280]  that the reformers would be very proud of absolutely and uh... i tell you uh...
[56:46.280 --> 56:50.240]  i've got a chance to meet josh brolin backstage if you had to add one year
[56:50.240 --> 56:52.440]  rallies and also shamp in and others
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.680]  he's got the big w movie coming out so
[56:54.680 --> 56:56.840]  what i have a hitters uh... as well
[56:56.840 --> 56:57.840]  uh... supporting
[56:57.840 --> 57:00.120]  the campaign cindy uh... she and and and
[57:00.120 --> 57:03.440]  so many others were about mariella rage against the machine
[57:03.440 --> 57:05.720]  absolutely great guy got a chance to interview him
[57:05.720 --> 57:06.880]  uh... backstage
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.600]  uh... now now
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.040]  we're going to break your moment but i don't know if you saw at the army times
[57:12.040 --> 57:12.920]  announced
[57:12.920 --> 57:16.200]  that they will put combat brigades on the streets of america they're being called
[57:16.200 --> 57:16.960]  back
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.160]  was uh... just calmly announced
[57:19.160 --> 57:22.360]  uh... they're saying the quote deal with rioting and in civil unrest and they
[57:22.360 --> 57:26.000]  said we hope that troops don't have to shoot americans that was actually a
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.080]  quote in there
[57:27.080 --> 57:29.480]  so i think we really are seeing
[57:29.480 --> 57:32.600]  uh... dictatorship of the executive people say oh well
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.400]  i will be saved by mccain or obama but they represent the same interest of
[57:36.400 --> 57:37.920]  the world
[57:37.920 --> 57:41.360]  well i i think mccain is a bit uh... more of a
[57:41.360 --> 57:43.560]  a candidate for perpetual war
[57:43.560 --> 57:46.960]  i mean it's a given what he's gone through vietnam i have no understanding
[57:46.960 --> 57:50.720]  why he's so aggressive belligerence like he's looking for enemies abroad
[57:50.720 --> 57:53.360]  uh... you asked about the depression coming
[57:53.360 --> 57:57.160]  there may be a depression coming if we don't say two hundred billion dollars in
[57:57.160 --> 57:59.200]  american lives every year
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.400]  and bring again get our troops out of iraq and put it rebuilding the public
[58:03.400 --> 58:05.640]  works you know the public transit the
[58:05.640 --> 58:09.680]  sewage system upgrades in city after city town after sound drinking water
[58:09.680 --> 58:13.640]  schools clinics libraries all the things that are crumbling and reducing the
[58:13.640 --> 58:14.840]  quality of life
[58:14.840 --> 58:17.200]  in our city can produce good jobs
[58:17.200 --> 58:18.400]  they cannot be
[58:18.400 --> 58:21.680]  exported to china so that's two hundred billion there
[58:21.680 --> 58:25.280]  another two hundred three hundred billion can be saved by getting rid of
[58:25.280 --> 58:30.040]  these corporate subsidies on the backs of taxpayer another three hundred and so
[58:30.040 --> 58:33.680]  billion can be saved from the bloated wasteful military budget
[58:33.680 --> 58:35.680]  that i've walked up there
[58:35.680 --> 58:37.360]  in the other places
[58:37.360 --> 58:39.320]  in the north
[58:39.320 --> 58:45.760]  then
[58:45.760 --> 58:54.720]  city
[58:54.560 --> 58:58.680]  again
[58:58.680 --> 59:01.980]  are
[59:01.980 --> 59:07.980]  People know that not 11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David Boncafella, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R.
[59:07.980 --> 59:09.980]  And we sit down and shout out.
[59:09.980 --> 59:16.980]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:16.980 --> 59:22.980]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:22.980 --> 59:26.980]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:26.980 --> 59:29.980]  I don't think what the topic is is just an intro. It's not 11.
[59:29.980 --> 59:33.980]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:33.980 --> 59:36.980]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:36.980 --> 59:41.980]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[59:41.980 --> 59:47.980]  Please rise. Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:47.980 --> 59:57.980]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:00:17.980 --> 1:00:23.980]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.980 --> 1:00:29.980]  The first station is just joining us. Ralph Anderson with us for the last half hour is about to leave us in five minutes.
[1:00:29.980 --> 1:00:33.980]  He was just getting into ways to save money. Hundreds of billions a year without the war.
[1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:36.980]  He was going down the list, talking about the economy.
[1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:40.980]  What if we gave these trillions to the American people their own money back to stimulate the economy?
[1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:44.980]  That would fix it overnight, but all the money, all the funds are going out of the country.
[1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:48.980]  Please continue with your ideas to stop the depression.
[1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:52.980]  Yeah, Alex, I was saying that America needs to be repaired.
[1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:58.980]  You know, everybody who lives in towns and cities around the country sees crumbling schools and bridges
[1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:05.980]  and public transit systems need to be modernized and underneath the roads and sewage treatment systems
[1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:08.980]  need to be upgraded, drinking water, purification.
[1:01:08.980 --> 1:01:15.980]  All these improve the quality of life, create good jobs in your own community that can't be exported to Communist China
[1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:19.980]  or other fascist dictatorships. Where do we get the money?
[1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:24.980]  Well, we're spending $14 million an hour, as we speak, 24 hours a day in Iraq.
[1:01:24.980 --> 1:01:30.980]  If we get out of Iraq and the plan is on our website dot votenater.org.
[1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:37.980]  Votenater.org on six-month negotiated withdrawal of all U.S. military and corporate forces from Iraq.
[1:01:37.980 --> 1:01:44.980]  That's $200 million right there, and a lot fewer wounded or fatally wounded soldiers.
[1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:50.980]  We can get rid of all these taxpayer subsidies to big corporations called Corporal Welfare.
[1:01:50.980 --> 1:01:54.980]  That's another two, three hundred billion dollars back into the community.
[1:01:54.980 --> 1:01:59.980]  We can reduce that bloated wasteful military budget that President Eisenhower warned us about.
[1:01:59.980 --> 1:02:03.980]  In 1916, his farewell address, remember he used the phrase,
[1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:08.980]  watch out for the military industrial complex, and General Douglas MacArthur also warned about
[1:02:08.980 --> 1:02:14.980]  the insatiable demand for more and more military budgets for Lockheed Martin.
[1:02:14.980 --> 1:02:16.980]  Well, sir, that was my next question.
[1:02:16.980 --> 1:02:21.980]  Is the Army Times reporting they're going to send military brigades to, quote, deal with the American people?
[1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:25.980]  It looks like the establishment is planning for some total collapse.
[1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:29.980]  What should we do from your perspective if we go into a full-bore depression
[1:02:29.980 --> 1:02:34.980]  and they try to basically suspend our basic bill of rights and constitution?
[1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:36.980]  We got to take back our members of Congress.
[1:02:36.980 --> 1:02:37.980]  That's the first step.
[1:02:37.980 --> 1:02:40.980]  They're the ones who we can vote in and out.
[1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:44.980]  We have to organize Congresswatchdog groups in every congressional district.
[1:02:44.980 --> 1:02:49.980]  Why can't we have 2,000 people in every congressional district which has 630,000 folks?
[1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:55.980]  Organize a Congresswatchdog club just the way they have a bowling club or they have a birdwatches club.
[1:02:55.980 --> 1:03:03.980]  Raise enough money for two full-time staff, champion the people's interest on the senators and representatives.
[1:03:03.980 --> 1:03:06.980]  Once you control Congress, you can control the executive branch,
[1:03:06.980 --> 1:03:10.980]  because Congress is really the most powerful branch of the three branches.
[1:03:10.980 --> 1:03:13.980]  And the executive is just openly saying it has no power, basically.
[1:03:13.980 --> 1:03:14.980]  Right, yeah.
[1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:19.980]  In Congress, you know, these guys want to escape their responsibility under the Constitution,
[1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:24.980]  whether it's impeachment or declaration of war or controlling the tax dollars.
[1:03:24.980 --> 1:03:30.980]  But if the people control Congress, Congress becomes very, very powerful and accountable to them.
[1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.980]  We've got to get active Ralph Nader in closing.
[1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:34.980]  We're going to give out the website and the phone number.
[1:03:34.980 --> 1:03:36.980]  Remember, folks that want to get involved and support you.
[1:03:36.980 --> 1:03:38.980]  And please give that out in just a moment.
[1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:43.980]  In closing, we can stop this, but all of this from the evidence we have,
[1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:50.980]  it's an engineered collapse is taking place in the military industrial complex is eating America.
[1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:52.980]  Do you agree that that's what they're attempting to do?
[1:03:52.980 --> 1:03:57.980]  Yeah, these giant corporations, no more allegiance to the United States of America.
[1:03:57.980 --> 1:03:59.980]  They're eating the heart and soul out of America.
[1:03:59.980 --> 1:04:07.980]  And as we speak, they're lobbying on Capitol Hill with King George W. Bush to tear our Constitution out by its roots.
[1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:09.980]  So let me give you the phone numbers and everything, folks.
[1:04:09.980 --> 1:04:15.980]  You want to support the Ralph Nader, Matt Gonzalez, independent presidential ticket, which is now number three.
[1:04:15.980 --> 1:04:18.980]  It's going at six, seven, eight percent in various states.
[1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:26.980]  And if we were on the debate, we'd have a three-way race.
[1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:30.980]  Here it is, the phone number, 202-471-5833.
[1:04:30.980 --> 1:04:33.980]  That's 202-471-5833.
[1:04:33.980 --> 1:04:36.980]  The website, votenader.org.
[1:04:36.980 --> 1:04:40.980]  And the Constitution Pledge is constitutionpledge.com.
[1:04:40.980 --> 1:04:45.980]  Ralph Nader, I want to have you back on in the next month as the campaign unfolds.
[1:04:45.980 --> 1:04:48.980]  And also talk more about the Constitution Pledge, a great idea.
[1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:51.980]  Thank you for spending time with us, and we'll talk to you again soon.
[1:04:51.980 --> 1:04:52.980]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:04:52.980 --> 1:04:53.980]  Thank you, listeners.
[1:04:53.980 --> 1:04:55.980]  You bet. Thank you, listeners.

[1:05:09.980 --> 1:05:17.980]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites, and your doctor would never know it.
[1:05:17.980 --> 1:05:22.980]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only one percent of all cases.
[1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:24.980]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.

[1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:06.980]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:06.980 --> 1:06:10.980]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:06:10.980 --> 1:06:12.980]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:15.980]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:15.980 --> 1:06:23.980]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:30.980]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:30.980 --> 1:06:34.980]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.980 --> 1:06:53.980]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[1:07:04.980 --> 1:07:09.980]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[1:08:06.980 --> 1:08:12.980]  Okay, that was an interview with Ralph Nader for the next hour.
[1:08:12.980 --> 1:08:16.980]  We are joined by Steve Quayle, who has been exposing the New World Order,
[1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:23.980]  writing about the Global Crime Syndicate, doing radio programs for, I don't know, close to 20 years.
[1:08:23.980 --> 1:08:31.980]  And he is our guest here. We're hopefully a little bit into the next hour that we're gonna have open phones
[1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:35.980]  in the third and fourth hour today.
[1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:39.980]  I have a lot of economic news, a lot of New World Order news.
[1:08:39.980 --> 1:08:43.980]  Stuff like magazine promotes sterilization for women in their 20s.
[1:08:43.980 --> 1:08:48.980]  That's what they're promoting, teenage girls, how it's so stylish, just a sickening culture of death.
[1:08:48.980 --> 1:08:53.980]  But Steve Quayle's been talking about the derivatives, implosion, what's gonna happen to the markets,
[1:08:53.980 --> 1:08:59.980]  how they would claim it was a bailout to loot the treasury for more than a decade that I've been listening to him.
[1:08:59.980 --> 1:09:03.980]  And he's also an author as well, writing on these subjects.
[1:09:03.980 --> 1:09:11.980]  And so he is with us today, discussing what he sees happening in the short term, midterm, and the long term.
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:14.980]  And Steve, it's great to have you here with us. Thanks for coming on.
[1:09:14.980 --> 1:09:20.980]  Well, thank you, Alex. This is one of the last shows that I wanted to do, as most people have heard by now.
[1:09:20.980 --> 1:09:27.980]  I pretty much left the radio broadcasting arena, and I was grateful to have this last time with you to give you a heads up.
[1:09:27.980 --> 1:09:32.980]  We're watching the destruction of our currency. We're just watching the destruction of our sovereignty.
[1:09:32.980 --> 1:09:36.980]  Well, let me stop you. You know, I'm the king of interruptions because I want to get through a pointer.
[1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:41.980]  Please do. Why are you, I mean, you really think this is, I mean, this is the vibe I can deal with.
[1:09:41.980 --> 1:09:46.980]  You really think, and I've heard, you've already quit the show, basically, and you're just saying,
[1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:48.980]  that's it, folks, I'm heading for the hills.
[1:09:48.980 --> 1:09:51.980]  Well, pretty much so, but again, it's not just simply that.
[1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:59.980]  I really believe that we are at the point now in history where the warnings of the watchmen to the degree they've been heated have been heated.
[1:09:59.980 --> 1:10:03.980]  That's what I believe my ministry has been the last 15 years on the radio.
[1:10:03.980 --> 1:10:07.980]  I've covered the six books. I've tried to call attention to both the natural and the supernatural,
[1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:12.980]  and I am convinced, Alex, that people have lost track that this isn't just a battle of terrestrial evil,
[1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:16.980]  but as you have so eloquently detailed that these are Luciferians.
[1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:21.980]  These are people that worship the prince of power of the wickedness of the air.
[1:10:21.980 --> 1:10:26.980]  These are the people that absolutely have orchestrated all the events from 9-11 through.
[1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:29.980]  They use everyone. They use all the intelligence agencies,
[1:10:29.980 --> 1:10:34.980]  and they are a part of natural, meaning beyond the natural, in their intelligence and wisdom.
[1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:39.980]  In essence, we're fighting against fallen angels, we're fighting against demons, we're fighting against men,
[1:10:39.980 --> 1:10:44.980]  as you have so detailed in so many of your productions that literally worship Lucifer,
[1:10:44.980 --> 1:10:49.980]  and now we're at the point in history where judgment is on the United States of America.
[1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:52.980]  Well, I mean, here's an example, and I'm going to give you the floor.
[1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:56.980]  I want you to run through what's happened with Steve there.
[1:10:56.980 --> 1:10:57.980]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[1:10:57.980 --> 1:10:59.980]  Okay, I don't know either.
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:01.980]  I want to run through it, run through the economy,
[1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:04.980]  and you've written on this, written books on this and detailed it,
[1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:07.980]  and I want to talk about that and why you think we're down to the wire now,
[1:11:07.980 --> 1:11:12.980]  which is very upsetting for me because I respect your analysis and your opinion,
[1:11:12.980 --> 1:11:16.980]  and your acumen, your gravitas in analyzing what's happening.
[1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:26.980]  But take last week this Damien individual, Damien Hearst,
[1:11:26.980 --> 1:11:34.980]  who sells a group of paintings for over 100 million pounds,
[1:11:34.980 --> 1:11:37.980]  or over 200 million dollars,
[1:11:37.980 --> 1:11:41.980]  and it's things like a jar of maggots for, you know, 3 million pounds,
[1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:47.980]  or a devil skull, you know, for over, you know, 50 million pounds,
[1:11:47.980 --> 1:11:54.980]  or just horrible things, and the hottest art right now is goblins eating babies,
[1:11:54.980 --> 1:11:58.980]  and cans of feces of the artist, and all these people,
[1:11:58.980 --> 1:12:01.980]  and this is what the Saudi princes and the New York elites,
[1:12:01.980 --> 1:12:04.980]  and all these people are snatching up and greedily buying.
[1:12:04.980 --> 1:12:07.980]  So even people don't believe in the devil and believe in evil.
[1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:09.980]  The point is the elites do.
[1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:12.980]  Now, you and I know it's all real, but the elites, they believe in it,
[1:12:12.980 --> 1:12:15.980]  and just the open manifestation of wickedness.
[1:12:15.980 --> 1:12:17.980]  Go ahead.
[1:12:17.980 --> 1:12:22.980]  Well, I think, Alex, you've just detailed why the judgment of Almighty God is coming upon the land.
[1:12:22.980 --> 1:12:25.980]  It's because of King's wicked leaders, wicked rulers,
[1:12:25.980 --> 1:12:27.980]  to bring about his judgment, and he judges them.
[1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:29.980]  He judges nations.
[1:12:29.980 --> 1:12:31.980]  In time, he judges individuals in eternity,
[1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:35.980]  but when you're talking about Damien, by the way, Damien is a transliteration of the word demon.
[1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:36.980]  Did you know that?
[1:12:36.980 --> 1:12:38.980]  Yes, I did.
[1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:40.980]  And so, don't you find it interesting?
[1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:44.980]  This is how the Illuminati pays off a lot of their supporters
[1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:46.980]  and a lot of their agents.
[1:12:46.980 --> 1:12:49.980]  They can pay them off at the gaming tables in the different casinos of the world,
[1:12:49.980 --> 1:12:51.980]  or they can buy their art,
[1:12:51.980 --> 1:12:53.980]  from the powers that be, you know,
[1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:56.980]  build this guy, lift this guy up, support his artwork.
[1:12:56.980 --> 1:12:58.980]  But I think what art is, is a reflection.
[1:12:58.980 --> 1:13:00.980]  If you look at the Renaissance, by the way,
[1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:03.980]  I majored in art history in college, one of my minors,
[1:13:03.980 --> 1:13:05.980]  and when you look at just the whole history of art,
[1:13:05.980 --> 1:13:10.980]  whether you take it back to the cave paintings of Altamira's Pain or Lascaux, France,
[1:13:10.980 --> 1:13:13.980]  and all the way forward to the different periods of art.
[1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:18.980]  It's a reflection of the soul that the cavemen wanted big fat bovine,
[1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:21.980]  you know, big fat animals to eat, that was their desire,
[1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:24.980]  or it was little pictures of their children happy around the fire.
[1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:27.980]  Well, now we look into the elite's minds and its buckets of maggots.
[1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:28.980]  You got it.
[1:13:28.980 --> 1:13:31.980]  And I think that's, I think quite candidly,
[1:13:31.980 --> 1:13:33.980]  that's exactly what our economy has become.
[1:13:33.980 --> 1:13:34.980]  Should I take the economy first?
[1:13:34.980 --> 1:13:36.980]  Because I think this is critical.
[1:13:36.980 --> 1:13:37.980]  Well, you know what?
[1:13:37.980 --> 1:13:39.980]  I mean, sure, finish up with the art and then go to the economy.
[1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:40.980]  Okay.
[1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:42.980]  Well, first of all, art is a reflection.
[1:13:42.980 --> 1:13:43.980]  Look at the movies now.
[1:13:43.980 --> 1:13:46.980]  You've got pedophile movies, you've got little girls being raped movies,
[1:13:46.980 --> 1:13:48.980]  by the way, that one isn't doing very well.
[1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:52.980]  You've got the sickness and the psycho nonsense of Hollywood
[1:13:52.980 --> 1:13:57.980]  trying to redefine marriage, redefine relationship, redefine everything.
[1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:03.980]  And that's the global elite's robbing and divesting people of their history,
[1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:05.980]  and I believe of their godly heritage.
[1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:10.980]  We're seeing every single policy that's been put into place by the powers that be,
[1:14:10.980 --> 1:14:13.980]  and you know I equate the powers that be with the devils that are,
[1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:18.980]  to absolutely destroy the American family, the American infrastructure,
[1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:21.980]  the American military, everything that is going on.
[1:14:21.980 --> 1:14:23.980]  And by the way, there are power fights, as you know,
[1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:26.980]  going on in the American military, like most people simply won't believe it,
[1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:30.980]  because they're too caught up, mesmerized by devil vision,
[1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:33.980]  programmed to think only that the world will go on forever,
[1:14:33.980 --> 1:14:36.980]  as long as you have your iPod, your new computer,
[1:14:36.980 --> 1:14:38.980]  and whatever your new download.
[1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:40.980]  But what people are missing, in my opinion,
[1:14:40.980 --> 1:14:44.980]  that's why I really believe that was time for me to leave the air,
[1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:47.980]  is the fact that we are, as New York Sun put it,
[1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:50.980]  we were only 500 trades away from meltdown.
[1:14:50.980 --> 1:14:53.980]  Paulson, and this is art too, remember this, money,
[1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:57.980]  they've changed the actual form and shape of our currency numerous times
[1:14:57.980 --> 1:15:00.980]  throughout the illustrious career of the United States.
[1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:02.980]  And you and others said they were,
[1:15:02.980 --> 1:15:04.980]  a dover decade you said and wrote,
[1:15:04.980 --> 1:15:07.980]  they were preparing us to go into the Amaro,
[1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:09.980]  and now they've admitted that.
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:11.980]  Well, absolutely, and how much hell did you catch
[1:15:11.980 --> 1:15:13.980]  when you started talking about that, Mio,
[1:15:13.980 --> 1:15:15.980]  we don't know what we're talking about.
[1:15:15.980 --> 1:15:18.980]  The bottom line is, is we have no what we're talking about, Alex,
[1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:21.980]  and that's why it's so critical to get this,
[1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:24.980]  not only information out, but I think the lateness of the hour,
[1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:27.980]  because as you know, you've gone through a transition to your own thinking.
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:29.980]  I have, you thought if we could wake up enough people,
[1:15:29.980 --> 1:15:32.980]  if we could get enough people to see the great evil,
[1:15:32.980 --> 1:15:35.980]  that possibly maybe things could change,
[1:15:35.980 --> 1:15:38.980]  but unfortunately, we've gone on a crash course, in my opinion,
[1:15:38.980 --> 1:15:41.980]  totally, totally defying Heaven,
[1:15:41.980 --> 1:15:44.980]  totally embracing every form of wicked perversion,
[1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:48.980]  and Alex, it should make everybody vomit when you talk about
[1:15:48.980 --> 1:15:52.980]  politicians and the world's elite sacrificing children.
[1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:54.980]  We're not making that up.
[1:15:54.980 --> 1:15:56.980]  This isn't, you know, just boom talk for the radio.
[1:15:56.980 --> 1:15:58.980]  This really goes on.
[1:15:58.980 --> 1:16:02.980]  And when you see that within two miles of the White House,
[1:16:02.980 --> 1:16:05.980]  there are eight pedophile houses of ill repute,
[1:16:05.980 --> 1:16:07.980]  where little boys and girls are raped.
[1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:09.980]  Look, that was all for Winfrey. That's not enough.
[1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:12.980]  So if everybody, you know, believes what they see on TV,
[1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:14.980]  then they at least pay attention to that.
[1:16:14.980 --> 1:16:17.980]  The point is, we're at a critical meltdown,
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:21.980]  and I believe we are literally weeks away from seeing this thing implemented.
[1:16:21.980 --> 1:16:23.980]  The Chinese and Russians are in our back door.
[1:16:23.980 --> 1:16:25.980]  You've got to ask yourself this,
[1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:28.980]  why would the United States knowingly provoke the Russians
[1:16:28.980 --> 1:16:30.980]  to move into Venezuela, Cuba,
[1:16:30.980 --> 1:16:32.980]  and this all has to do with the finances?
[1:16:32.980 --> 1:16:35.980]  Russian and China the other day said the world needs a new world,
[1:16:35.980 --> 1:16:37.980]  global currency, to see that story.
[1:16:37.980 --> 1:16:39.980]  The dollar is dead.
[1:16:39.980 --> 1:16:41.980]  Absolutely, no, and it's not just the Russians and Chinese.
[1:16:41.980 --> 1:16:44.980]  Wall Street Journal said we need a new world order to fix this.
[1:16:44.980 --> 1:16:46.980]  Right, and the currency, though, remember,
[1:16:46.980 --> 1:16:51.980]  currency is basically a reflection of either the sovereignty,
[1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:54.980]  the well-being, or the sickness of the country.
[1:16:54.980 --> 1:16:56.980]  Nobody wants to live in Tanzania.
[1:16:56.980 --> 1:16:58.980]  And they're saying the dollar is on live support,
[1:16:58.980 --> 1:17:00.980]  and they're about to pull the plug,
[1:17:00.980 --> 1:17:02.980]  and then this bailout was the White House putting nails in it.
[1:17:02.980 --> 1:17:04.980]  Absolutely, and what most people don't understand,
[1:17:04.980 --> 1:17:07.980]  we literally went to a socialist,
[1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:09.980]  even Chavez of Venezuela said,
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:12.980]  look, you guys basically out-socialized me.
[1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:14.980]  What you've done is the greatest nationalization
[1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:16.980]  in the history of the world.
[1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:18.980]  You may challenge that in Russia or China's control.
[1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:20.980]  It's a national socialism.
[1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:22.980]  It's socialism for the elite, not even the people.
[1:17:22.980 --> 1:17:24.980]  It's the worst form of it.
[1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:26.980]  Right, and see again, the idea is,
[1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:28.980]  this is Robin Hood on steroids.
[1:17:28.980 --> 1:17:30.980]  The middle class, Alex, in my opinion,
[1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:32.980]  is decimated and destroyed.
[1:17:32.980 --> 1:17:34.980]  Very soon, they're pulling, they're going to pull a plug,
[1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:37.980]  and you and I have talked about the Surveillance Society,
[1:17:37.980 --> 1:17:41.980]  until what new thermal scanning feature
[1:17:41.980 --> 1:17:45.980]  from attack satellites can they come up with next?
[1:17:45.980 --> 1:17:48.980]  We are absolutely, in my opinion,
[1:17:48.980 --> 1:17:51.980]  based on everything I know, we're at that point now,
[1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:53.980]  where the warnings no longer,
[1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:56.980]  how do I say this, are taking effect to the degree
[1:17:56.980 --> 1:17:58.980]  that anything can be stopped.
[1:17:58.980 --> 1:18:00.980]  The best you can do, the proverbs say,
[1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:02.980]  nations be destroyed, what shall the righteous do?
[1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:04.980]  And the answer is, you do what you can do
[1:18:04.980 --> 1:18:06.980]  to resist evil, even unto death.
[1:18:06.980 --> 1:18:08.980]  But the point is, is that there's a,
[1:18:08.980 --> 1:18:10.980]  and I know that this is kind of difficult,
[1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:12.980]  for some people wrap their minds around,
[1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:18.980]  but there is a world, a global event scheduled to happen.
[1:18:18.980 --> 1:18:20.980]  I believe it's false World War III,
[1:18:20.980 --> 1:18:22.980]  I believe we're just staging for that.
[1:18:22.980 --> 1:18:24.980]  Now, the Russians did move nuclear weapons
[1:18:24.980 --> 1:18:26.980]  into Venezuela, the Russians did move
[1:18:26.980 --> 1:18:28.980]  nuclear weapons into Cuba.
[1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:30.980]  How do I know, because of people that monitor that stuff,
[1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:32.980]  tell me that stuff?
[1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:34.980]  They're clearly moving, they've got nuclear bombers
[1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:36.980]  landing and moving ships in.
[1:18:36.980 --> 1:18:38.980]  Right, and you know,
[1:18:38.980 --> 1:18:42.980]  31 broadcasts of mine, listen seriously,
[1:18:42.980 --> 1:18:44.980]  my guest host was on, and he was picking up
[1:18:44.980 --> 1:18:46.980]  to the people that listened to just open channel military
[1:18:46.980 --> 1:18:48.980]  sources of Mayday from a sub-hunter
[1:18:48.980 --> 1:18:51.980]  off the Atlantic coast, when a Tupolov-160
[1:18:51.980 --> 1:18:53.980]  supersonic bomber was coming in so low,
[1:18:53.980 --> 1:18:55.980]  that everyone was missing on Earth radar,
[1:18:55.980 --> 1:18:57.980]  and some girl who was,
[1:18:57.980 --> 1:19:00.980]  and she was a female, that was on the east coast,
[1:19:00.980 --> 1:19:02.980]  just wasn't paying attention to the panic column,
[1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:04.980]  pretty soon, my guest host was on the air,
[1:19:04.980 --> 1:19:07.980]  said, listen, if anybody out there is listening to this broadcast,
[1:19:07.980 --> 1:19:09.980]  you better scramble jets, we've got a bogey coming in,
[1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:11.980]  hot and fast, well, the result is,
[1:19:11.980 --> 1:19:13.980]  within five minutes, everything was up in the air,
[1:19:13.980 --> 1:19:17.980]  but you see, meaning we scrambled our entire eastern fleet
[1:19:17.980 --> 1:19:19.980]  of jets to intercept what could have been
[1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:23.980]  a very nasty situation, but we're lied to continually, Alex,
[1:19:23.980 --> 1:19:25.980]  we don't hear of these things, and you and I know
[1:19:25.980 --> 1:19:27.980]  that the Illuminati is like puppet masters,
[1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:30.980]  they will use whoever, wherever, whenever,
[1:19:30.980 --> 1:19:33.980]  and they can use cutouts to control whoever,
[1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:35.980]  or wherever they want.
[1:19:36.980 --> 1:19:39.980]  Let's come back and talk about what the economic collapse
[1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:41.980]  will look like if it happens,
[1:19:41.980 --> 1:19:43.980]  how, from your sources and your research,
[1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:45.980]  how you believe they'll try to stage
[1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:49.980]  a global conflict that PNAC and others call for,
[1:19:49.980 --> 1:19:52.980]  and what we individually should be doing
[1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:55.980]  to prepare ourselves what potentially may be right around the corner.
[1:19:55.980 --> 1:19:58.980]  Steve Quayle is our guest, stay with us.
[1:19:59.980 --> 1:20:01.980]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:20:01.980 --> 1:20:03.980]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:05.980]  I can't find my wallet!
[1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:08.980]  Sound familiar? Why not save time looking for lost things

[1:20:59.980 --> 1:21:01.980]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel
[1:21:01.980 --> 1:21:03.980]  are taking a huge bite out of budgets
[1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:05.980]  for individuals and businesses.
[1:21:05.980 --> 1:21:07.980]  But there is something you can do.

[1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:18.980]  and reduces emissions.
[1:21:18.980 --> 1:21:20.980]  Average improvement in fuel economy
[1:21:20.980 --> 1:21:23.980]  typically ranges from 8% to 20% or more,

[1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:33.980]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:36.980]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:38.980]  Everything they have built over the centuries,
[1:22:38.980 --> 1:22:40.980]  the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:22:40.980 --> 1:22:41.980]  the power they have established,
[1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:43.980]  the poisoning of the masses,
[1:22:43.980 --> 1:22:45.980]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:47.980]  we will undo through the authority
[1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:49.980]  that has now been delegated to us.

[1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:01.980]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:23:01.980 --> 1:23:03.980]  The forces of globalism are destroying
[1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:05.980]  national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:07.980]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:23:07.980 --> 1:23:09.980]  The first time in modern history,
[1:23:09.980 --> 1:23:11.980]  the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:23:11.980 --> 1:23:13.980]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[1:23:13.980 --> 1:23:15.980]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[1:23:15.980 --> 1:23:17.980]  of the New World Order master plan.

[1:24:25.980 --> 1:24:29.980]  All they want us to do is
[1:24:29.980 --> 1:24:31.980]  keep on killing one another
[1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:33.980]  Top Rankers
[1:24:35.980 --> 1:24:37.980]  Top Rankers
[1:24:37.980 --> 1:24:41.980]  All you Skeletons
[1:24:41.980 --> 1:24:43.980]  Even those the highest levels that serve
[1:24:43.980 --> 1:24:45.980]  the New World Order are deceived
[1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:49.980]  They believe they're going to be given incredible power
[1:24:49.980 --> 1:24:53.980]  Life extension technologies
[1:24:53.980 --> 1:24:55.980]  if they build their world government
[1:24:55.980 --> 1:24:59.980]  and cull at least 80% of the world's population
[1:25:05.980 --> 1:25:07.980]  But the energy source, the dark force
[1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:09.980]  that controls the New World Order
[1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:11.980]  plans to betray them all
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:13.980]  Doesn't matter if you're black,
[1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:15.980]  Hispanic, white, old, young
[1:25:17.980 --> 1:25:21.980]  The New World Order is coming for you and your family
[1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:23.980]  They put poison in your water, poison in your vaccines
[1:25:23.980 --> 1:25:25.980]  They spray your skies
[1:25:25.980 --> 1:25:27.980]  The cancer, the diabetes
[1:25:29.980 --> 1:25:31.980]  The disease is spreading amongst us
[1:25:31.980 --> 1:25:33.980]  We are dying
[1:25:33.980 --> 1:25:35.980]  Everything else is window dressing
[1:25:37.980 --> 1:25:39.980]  You better get your head straight
[1:25:39.980 --> 1:25:41.980]  Get them screwed on
[1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:43.980]  Alright Steve Quill, quick segment, long segment
[1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:45.980]  Coming back after this break
[1:25:45.980 --> 1:25:49.980]  But continue with the economic implosion
[1:25:49.980 --> 1:25:51.980]  why it was engineered, how it was engineered
[1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:53.980]  Give us the big picture
[1:25:53.980 --> 1:25:57.980]  I think the thing that's obvious now is that
[1:25:57.980 --> 1:25:59.980]  when whoever was responsible for the derivatives
[1:25:59.980 --> 1:26:01.980]  knew behind the scenes
[1:26:01.980 --> 1:26:05.980]  ultimately that you would increase your debt
[1:26:05.980 --> 1:26:09.980]  at a magnitude that would so supersede the underlying asset base
[1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:13.980]  that you could intentionally sell the pile of manure
[1:26:13.980 --> 1:26:15.980]  Alex, so many different ways and packages
[1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:19.980]  so many different cute mathematical formulas
[1:26:19.980 --> 1:26:23.980]  that no one would ever come to grips with the fact that
[1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:25.980]  basically what was being sold was non-existent
[1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:29.980]  the financial promises for future payoff
[1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:31.980]  because most of the derivatives are what are called
[1:26:31.980 --> 1:26:33.980]  mark to mark
[1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:35.980]  meaning they have a computer model
[1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:37.980]  or a computer program that determines the value
[1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:41.980]  they never would publicly say
[1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:43.980]  and because everyone was so bound up in this
[1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:45.980]  what I call cohesive collective greed
[1:26:45.980 --> 1:26:49.980]  how you can have a market for debt
[1:26:49.980 --> 1:26:53.980]  when the debt is so astronomically exceeding assets
[1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:55.980]  by the way the derivatives true
[1:26:55.980 --> 1:26:58.980]  derivatives debt is a quad
[1:26:58.980 --> 1:27:01.980]  trillion dollars, that's a thousand trillion
[1:27:01.980 --> 1:27:03.980]  and what's fascinating about this is people
[1:27:03.980 --> 1:27:05.980]  don't realize that the borrower becomes
[1:27:05.980 --> 1:27:07.980]  a servant to the lender
[1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:10.980]  but in all the bailout talk there's no help
[1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:13.980]  there's no help for the people that got suckered in
[1:27:13.980 --> 1:27:15.980]  look I don't care how smart you are
[1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:18.980]  if you've got a trap and you bait it with the correct bait
[1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:20.980]  people are going to swallow the bait
[1:27:20.980 --> 1:27:22.980]  and so there were times as you know
[1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:25.980]  with the no dock loans and people who were making ten dollars an hour
[1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:29.980]  were borrowing enough money to buy a three hundred thousand dollar house
[1:27:29.980 --> 1:27:32.980]  well that's not only irresponsible
[1:27:32.980 --> 1:27:36.980]  of the lenders, it's also incredibly sinister
[1:27:36.980 --> 1:27:38.980]  because what happens is
[1:27:38.980 --> 1:27:40.980]  exactly, but I mean you're right
[1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:42.980]  the media is blaming the poor schmoes
[1:27:42.980 --> 1:27:44.980]  that got lured in and told us the American dream
[1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:47.980]  and the news channels told them it's the thing to do
[1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:49.980]  and from the local real estate agent
[1:27:49.980 --> 1:27:52.980]  right up to the brokers, right up to the banks
[1:27:52.980 --> 1:27:54.980]  they engage in a criminal conspiracy together
[1:27:54.980 --> 1:27:57.980]  and that shows you what a corrupt society does
[1:27:57.980 --> 1:28:00.980]  and then the media blames us, go ahead
[1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:03.980]  well the media blames us because they're controlled by the same
[1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:06.980]  evil entities that control the banking
[1:28:06.980 --> 1:28:09.980]  I mean come on let's face it, you know the thing is
[1:28:09.980 --> 1:28:12.980]  is that you've done, who owns the Federal Reserve
[1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:15.980]  all that stuff is good to know that
[1:28:15.980 --> 1:28:19.980]  but right now it's irrelevant, what is relevant is that people can't pay their bills
[1:28:19.980 --> 1:28:23.980]  they cannot feed their families on the same level they could before
[1:28:23.980 --> 1:28:26.980]  where they're once with joy in the certainty of the future
[1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:29.980]  I mean I've talked to people that just in the four stocks
[1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:32.980]  like Freddie Mac and some of the bank stocks have lost
[1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:34.980]  two million dollars in the last two weeks
[1:28:34.980 --> 1:28:37.980]  those are people that have listened to my show
[1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:40.980]  and wouldn't listen to the underlying reason
[1:28:40.980 --> 1:28:42.980]  to get out of the stock market
[1:28:42.980 --> 1:28:44.980]  and how many times have you and I heard
[1:28:44.980 --> 1:28:46.980]  on every talking head channel
[1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:49.980]  great time to buy, housing markets have bottomed out
[1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:51.980]  blah blah blah blah blah
[1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:54.980]  the bottom line is not one of those talking heads
[1:28:54.980 --> 1:28:57.980]  those dumb hyenas are the jackals
[1:28:57.980 --> 1:28:59.980]  national television get the fact
[1:28:59.980 --> 1:29:02.980]  and if they do they're guys like Peter Schiff that definitely get it
[1:29:02.980 --> 1:29:03.980]  and others that get it
[1:29:03.980 --> 1:29:05.980]  but I'm talking to commentators
[1:29:05.980 --> 1:29:07.980]  there's a disconnect because they've been programmed
[1:29:07.980 --> 1:29:09.980]  to present to the American public that, gee
[1:29:09.980 --> 1:29:11.980]  if you just buy stocks, just buy a house
[1:29:11.980 --> 1:29:13.980]  everything will people swell
[1:29:13.980 --> 1:29:17.980]  meanwhile we watch people packing up their bags out of Lehman
[1:29:17.980 --> 1:29:21.980]  and we're talking about the destruction of the American employment base
[1:29:21.980 --> 1:29:26.980]  and I am still, I guess that the fact that people will get away
[1:29:26.980 --> 1:29:29.980]  or allow the government to get away with lying about their economic indicators
[1:29:29.980 --> 1:29:31.980]  look at the price of gas
[1:29:31.980 --> 1:29:33.980]  stay there, stay there, long segment Steve Quayle
[1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:35.980]  long segment, man this guy knows this stuff
[1:29:35.980 --> 1:29:38.980]  we're really honored to have him Steve Quayle on with us
[1:29:38.980 --> 1:29:40.980]  that's exactly the analogy I use
[1:29:40.980 --> 1:29:42.980]  because our minds are basically on the truth
[1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:45.980]  we have the same picture about them baiting the trap
[1:29:45.980 --> 1:29:47.980]  and that's exactly what they're doing
[1:29:47.980 --> 1:29:50.980]  Steve Quayle's our guest, we're gonna come back and more into this
[1:29:50.980 --> 1:29:54.980]  we're on the march, the empires on the run
[1:29:54.980 --> 1:29:57.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:03.980]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[1:30:03.980 --> 1:30:07.980]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:30:07.980 --> 1:30:09.980]  the enemies struck America on September 11th
[1:30:09.980 --> 1:30:11.980]  but who is the enemy?
[1:30:11.980 --> 1:30:12.980]  bin Laden
[1:30:12.980 --> 1:30:13.980]  this is his MO
[1:30:13.980 --> 1:30:16.980]  we have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:19.980]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:30:19.980 --> 1:30:23.980]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:30:23.980 --> 1:30:26.980]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:30:26.980 --> 1:30:30.980]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[1:30:30.980 --> 1:30:34.980]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:30:34.980 --> 1:30:36.980]  Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:30:36.980 --> 1:30:38.980]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:39.980]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[1:30:39.980 --> 1:30:41.980]  the Israeli intelligence network
[1:30:41.980 --> 1:30:42.980]  warnings and war games
[1:30:42.980 --> 1:30:43.980]  the shadow government
[1:30:43.980 --> 1:30:44.980]  and much much more

[1:33:08.980 --> 1:33:11.980]  this was all carefully engineered
[1:33:11.980 --> 1:33:13.980]  we didn't just pop up this week
[1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:15.980]  or last month or a year ago
[1:33:15.980 --> 1:33:18.980]  or even five or ten years ago telling you this
[1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:21.980]  the global crime syndicate international making cartel
[1:33:21.980 --> 1:33:24.980]  has done this over and over again
[1:33:24.980 --> 1:33:26.980]  and then two years ago
[1:33:26.980 --> 1:33:28.980]  there's a lot of wealth in Austin

[1:33:31.980 --> 1:33:34.980]  more than Manhattan, more than San Francisco

[1:33:36.980 --> 1:33:38.980]  the money is moving in here
[1:33:38.980 --> 1:33:40.980]  for some reason
[1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:42.980]  but
[1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:45.980]  people in business contacts we have
[1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:48.980]  the money, and I mean billionaires and above
[1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:50.980]  not the guy that lives in a million dollar house
[1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:53.980]  he thinks Rich got on the street and he's got a big boat
[1:33:53.980 --> 1:33:57.980]  that the working class thinks is the elite
[1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.980]  but individuals that are on the inside
[1:33:59.980 --> 1:34:01.980]  they are freaked out and scared
[1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:03.980]  most of them and they have been on the Cook Islands
[1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:05.980]  Australia, New Zealand
[1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:08.980]  armored compounds in Costa Rica
[1:34:08.980 --> 1:34:12.980]  most of Hollywood's been quietly moving out of the country
[1:34:12.980 --> 1:34:15.980]  this is not a joke, this is not a game
[1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:17.980]  and it was
[1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:19.980]  because the elite created
[1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:22.980]  thousands, over a thousand trillion
[1:34:22.980 --> 1:34:24.980]  and that's what all our other experts tell us
[1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:27.980]  economists, Nobel Prize winners on the show
[1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:29.980]  it's a quadrillion at least
[1:34:29.980 --> 1:34:31.980]  and they've created
[1:34:31.980 --> 1:34:33.980]  liquidity, liquid money
[1:34:33.980 --> 1:34:36.980]  that's only worth something until people know it's a scam
[1:34:36.980 --> 1:34:39.980]  and so they bought the roads, the bridges
[1:34:39.980 --> 1:34:41.980]  the infrastructure, the water districts
[1:34:41.980 --> 1:34:44.980]  the media companies, the defense companies
[1:34:44.980 --> 1:34:47.980]  that's why they can come into a city water district
[1:34:47.980 --> 1:34:50.980]  and say we're a German company, we'll pay you ten times, twenty times
[1:34:50.980 --> 1:34:52.980]  what it's worth
[1:34:52.980 --> 1:34:54.980]  the city officials here in Austin
[1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:56.980]  they'll come in and want to buy up
[1:34:56.980 --> 1:34:58.980]  they'll say we'll guarantee all these loans, we'll give you
[1:34:58.980 --> 1:35:00.980]  these hundreds of millions
[1:35:00.980 --> 1:35:03.980]  okay it's a billion, okay we'll hire your whole family
[1:35:03.980 --> 1:35:05.980]  we'll do this and that
[1:35:05.980 --> 1:35:07.980]  just shut down that little power plant
[1:35:07.980 --> 1:35:10.980]  so that our power plants have a monopoly
[1:35:10.980 --> 1:35:12.980]  it's just
[1:35:12.980 --> 1:35:14.980]  it's like the game risk
[1:35:14.980 --> 1:35:16.980]  it is global domination
[1:35:16.980 --> 1:35:18.980]  cold bloodedly
[1:35:18.980 --> 1:35:20.980]  and they engineered it
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:23.980]  they told the public, you know, leverage your house
[1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:25.980]  you know, sit there
[1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:27.980]  and turn them over
[1:35:27.980 --> 1:35:30.980]  sell them, get a bigger house, then flip it
[1:35:30.980 --> 1:35:33.980]  and the suckers laughed and giggled and smirked
[1:35:33.980 --> 1:35:35.980]  and I've had them in Austin
[1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:37.980]  so I've been talking like this intensely for six years
[1:35:37.980 --> 1:35:39.980]  since we got the IMF and World Bank documents
[1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:41.980]  saying how they do it
[1:35:41.980 --> 1:35:43.980]  and I'll be at an outside cafe eating
[1:35:43.980 --> 1:35:45.980]  and one of them will walk by and make a smart mouth comment
[1:35:45.980 --> 1:35:47.980]  or you know, they'll call in
[1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:49.980]  and make a comment and they'll email
[1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:52.980]  and you know, Steve, the good news is
[1:35:52.980 --> 1:35:54.980]  a lot of these yuppies and know-it-alls
[1:35:54.980 --> 1:35:56.980]  and people that think they're members of the establishment
[1:35:56.980 --> 1:35:58.980]  that aren't, they're not laughing now
[1:35:58.980 --> 1:36:00.980]  are they Steve?
[1:36:00.980 --> 1:36:03.980]  I would say one thing interesting about Austin too
[1:36:03.980 --> 1:36:05.980]  people don't realize there are
[1:36:05.980 --> 1:36:08.980]  men and women in Austin who are on the good side
[1:36:08.980 --> 1:36:10.980]  that are absolutely without equal
[1:36:10.980 --> 1:36:12.980]  that bought us another couple months Alex
[1:36:12.980 --> 1:36:14.980]  beyond a disaster
[1:36:14.980 --> 1:36:16.980]  when the CERN had been collider
[1:36:16.980 --> 1:36:18.980]  it's not the end of the world when that thing goes on
[1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:20.980]  and without going into the detail
[1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:22.980]  there's a wonderful series on my show with Tom Horne
[1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:24.980]  about stargates and everything
[1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:27.980]  but there are some phenomenally brave men and women
[1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:30.980]  and I'm talking women that have absolutely
[1:36:30.980 --> 1:36:33.980]  continued to fight these entities behind the scenes
[1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:35.980]  we haven't even talked about that
[1:36:35.980 --> 1:36:38.980]  it was basically the word is sabotage
[1:36:38.980 --> 1:36:40.980]  you notice it didn't really turn on
[1:36:40.980 --> 1:36:42.980]  and they kept it secret
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:44.980]  and there's all these main line physicists saying
[1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:46.980]  it creates strange list of particles
[1:36:46.980 --> 1:36:48.980]  in fact let's get into that some
[1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:50.980]  but I'm sorry Steve go ahead
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:52.980]  well no I'm just saying you brought up Austin
[1:36:52.980 --> 1:36:54.980]  I gotta tell you something Austin is more
[1:36:54.980 --> 1:36:56.980]  than and it's fascinating that
[1:36:56.980 --> 1:36:59.980]  what I would say the good guys are in the middle of the bad guys
[1:36:59.980 --> 1:37:01.980]  but for those who are without equal
[1:37:01.980 --> 1:37:03.980]  I want to say thank you for buying us
[1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:05.980]  a couple more months you know Alex
[1:37:05.980 --> 1:37:08.980]  most people can't deal and don't want to deal with quantum physics
[1:37:08.980 --> 1:37:10.980]  and what may happen with stargates
[1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:12.980]  and black holes and everything else
[1:37:12.980 --> 1:37:14.980]  but the thing that I think that people got to understand
[1:37:14.980 --> 1:37:16.980]  if the big money
[1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:18.980]  who are the quintessential Luciferian
[1:37:18.980 --> 1:37:21.980]  double-worshipping haters of mankind
[1:37:21.980 --> 1:37:23.980]  are putting all their bucks and technology into it
[1:37:23.980 --> 1:37:25.980]  what is it they want to open up
[1:37:25.980 --> 1:37:27.980]  and what is it they want to come through
[1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:29.980]  whether you call it a stargate or a
[1:37:29.980 --> 1:37:32.980]  Jacob Latter whatever you want to call it
[1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:34.980]  the bottom line is that there is big money
[1:37:34.980 --> 1:37:37.980]  in this and the whole idea and you brought it up
[1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:39.980]  they want everyone dead but them
[1:37:39.980 --> 1:37:42.980]  1900 technology by Max Planck
[1:37:42.980 --> 1:37:44.980]  made a bombs in the 40s
[1:37:44.980 --> 1:37:46.980]  and hydrogen bombs in the 50s
[1:37:46.980 --> 1:37:48.980]  and I've had all these physicists, scientists on
[1:37:48.980 --> 1:37:50.980]  and even the Hadron designers
[1:37:50.980 --> 1:37:52.980]  say yeah it could destroy the earth
[1:37:52.980 --> 1:37:54.980]  but so what and then they came out and said
[1:37:54.980 --> 1:37:56.980]  oh look it didn't destroy the earth
[1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:58.980]  everything's fine they don't tell you over the next five years
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:00.980]  they're going to turn it up what five, six, seven thousand
[1:38:00.980 --> 1:38:02.980]  times the strength it is
[1:38:02.980 --> 1:38:04.980]  running these heavy particles together
[1:38:04.980 --> 1:38:06.980]  in this giant cyclotron
[1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:08.980]  and you know the point is
[1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:10.980]  is they put a god of destruction
[1:38:10.980 --> 1:38:12.980]  Shiva over it
[1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:14.980]  this is religious craziness
[1:38:14.980 --> 1:38:16.980]  absolutely and I think it's important
[1:38:16.980 --> 1:38:18.980]  because it's also
[1:38:18.980 --> 1:38:20.980]  out of the ashes of the phoenix arrives
[1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:22.980]  the new entity when you're putting
[1:38:22.980 --> 1:38:24.980]  the goddess Shiva the destroyer
[1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:26.980]  as your quote-unquote
[1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:28.980]  patron demoness
[1:38:28.980 --> 1:38:30.980]  of the Hadron collider come on ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:32.980]  now to tell you something I believe
[1:38:32.980 --> 1:38:34.980]  God in his mercy gives us
[1:38:34.980 --> 1:38:36.980]  phenomenal neon signs and I'm saying
[1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:38.980]  do you see this do you see this
[1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:40.980]  it can't be real it can't be real
[1:38:40.980 --> 1:38:42.980]  but again Alex you know
[1:38:42.980 --> 1:38:44.980]  I obviously haven't been to Austin a lot of years
[1:38:44.980 --> 1:38:46.980]  but I can tell you this
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:48.980]  that in the last couple weeks
[1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:50.980]  and for the record the Hadron
[1:38:50.980 --> 1:38:52.980]  was interfered with
[1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:54.980]  for all our sakes okay
[1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:56.980]  I've had physicists I've interviewed
[1:38:56.980 --> 1:38:58.980]  Nobel Prize winning physicists
[1:38:58.980 --> 1:39:00.980]  the thing is is that they take this whole
[1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:02.980]  attitude you know they used to be opposed
[1:39:02.980 --> 1:39:04.980]  to God now they're trying to create
[1:39:04.980 --> 1:39:06.980]  God in their image
[1:39:06.980 --> 1:39:08.980]  they're trying to realize or they're trying
[1:39:08.980 --> 1:39:10.980]  to actualize it's better work
[1:39:10.980 --> 1:39:12.980]  the bringing forth into our dimension
[1:39:12.980 --> 1:39:14.980]  all these things that God forbid
[1:39:14.980 --> 1:39:16.980]  to interfere with our dimension
[1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:18.980]  and very soon you mark my words on this
[1:39:18.980 --> 1:39:20.980]  whether it's just coming summer
[1:39:20.980 --> 1:39:22.980]  or prior to the summer a late
[1:39:22.980 --> 1:39:24.980]  winter when things start to happen in the skies
[1:39:24.980 --> 1:39:26.980]  above us people are going to start to panic
[1:39:26.980 --> 1:39:28.980]  now let's let's get to something that I think
[1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:30.980]  people need to understand I've been getting
[1:39:30.980 --> 1:39:32.980]  calls from people all over the country about
[1:39:32.980 --> 1:39:34.980]  the prison camps going
[1:39:34.980 --> 1:39:36.980]  into operation remember all the time you and I've spent
[1:39:36.980 --> 1:39:38.980]  over the decade on that whole thing
[1:39:38.980 --> 1:39:40.980]  and I've got to share with you
[1:39:40.980 --> 1:39:42.980]  there's one that somebody called
[1:39:42.980 --> 1:39:44.980]  me a truck driver who made deliveries to this place
[1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:46.980]  and it's in Pasco, Washington
[1:39:46.980 --> 1:39:48.980]  area on US Highway 95 between
[1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:50.980]  mile marker 56 and 60
[1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:52.980]  between Pasco I guess in Ritzville
[1:39:52.980 --> 1:39:54.980]  the place will hold 200,000
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:56.980]  people and this thing has
[1:39:56.980 --> 1:39:58.980]  just been initiated
[1:39:58.980 --> 1:40:00.980]  and then they're beginning to activate it
[1:40:00.980 --> 1:40:02.980]  and I'm hearing that from people all over
[1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:04.980]  the country well they have the civilian inmate
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:06.980]  labor camp program where
[1:40:06.980 --> 1:40:08.980]  24 of these are operational
[1:40:08.980 --> 1:40:10.980]  and now there's a series of youtube videos
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:12.980]  I think they're up on
[1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:14.980]  infowars.com I've sent them to the guys two nights
[1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:16.980]  ago where
[1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:18.980]  folks are going to these and they're like going oh my
[1:40:18.980 --> 1:40:20.980]  god it's true well yeah it's army.mil
[1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:22.980]  folks they're not making it up it's on
[1:40:22.980 --> 1:40:24.980]  the army website and there are the barbed
[1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:26.980]  wire there there's the place to hold
[1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:28.980]  hundreds of thousands per facility
[1:40:28.980 --> 1:40:30.980]  there are the
[1:40:30.980 --> 1:40:32.980]  watchtowers I mean
[1:40:32.980 --> 1:40:34.980]  we're not joking around about this
[1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:36.980]  no and here's the thing
[1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:38.980]  let me just run through kind of run through five points
[1:40:38.980 --> 1:40:40.980]  yeah go ahead I think okay first of all
[1:40:40.980 --> 1:40:42.980]  bailout won't work it's obvious
[1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:44.980]  that there's already talk and closed door
[1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:46.980]  sessions that Bush is probably going to declare some kind
[1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:48.980]  of national economic emergency they're already having
[1:40:48.980 --> 1:40:50.980]  secret sessions of Congress you've got it
[1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:52.980]  and the army under north com now
[1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:54.980]  is going to be handling civil unrest
[1:40:54.980 --> 1:40:56.980]  as economy implodes you saw the story you put it up
[1:40:56.980 --> 1:40:58.980]  I put it up the potential for civil war
[1:40:58.980 --> 1:41:00.980]  is is so great
[1:41:00.980 --> 1:41:02.980]  and that's a time for you know the gun
[1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:04.980]  confiscation to begin by the way when people say
[1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:06.980]  oh we don't have enough men to do that
[1:41:06.980 --> 1:41:08.980]  they have and and Alex this was told
[1:41:08.980 --> 1:41:10.980]  to me by an active duty four-star general
[1:41:10.980 --> 1:41:12.980]  that under color of agreement
[1:41:12.980 --> 1:41:14.980]  in this country Bivouac
[1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:16.980]  placed strategically placed in
[1:41:16.980 --> 1:41:18.980]  different the military bases that were closed
[1:41:18.980 --> 1:41:20.980]  to the public and are not u.s. military
[1:41:20.980 --> 1:41:22.980]  bases but nato bases 300 I think
[1:41:22.980 --> 1:41:24.980]  and 43,000
[1:41:24.980 --> 1:41:26.980]  troops here already
[1:41:26.980 --> 1:41:28.980]  assigned their details I don't want to explain
[1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:30.980]  how this works this is actually all public under
[1:41:30.980 --> 1:41:32.980]  north com just what's public's incredible
[1:41:32.980 --> 1:41:34.980]  over the last 15 years
[1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:36.980]  that's what really started warning was 15 years
[1:41:36.980 --> 1:41:38.980]  ago when people in military were told this
[1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:40.980]  they give them the questionnaires will you fire on americans
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:42.980]  those that say no or sent overseas
[1:41:42.980 --> 1:41:44.980]  are given the inoculations
[1:41:44.980 --> 1:41:46.980]  and then are let out in three to five years those
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:48.980]  that say yes our sheet depth put into
[1:41:48.980 --> 1:41:50.980]  contractor positions then brought back
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:52.980]  in reconstituted under military
[1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:54.980]  operations they also plan
[1:41:54.980 --> 1:41:56.980]  to use another 200,000 mercenaries
[1:41:56.980 --> 1:41:58.980]  which are now already been paid under
[1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:00.980]  the contracts blackwater alone
[1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:02.980]  is one billion go ahead Steve
[1:42:02.980 --> 1:42:04.980]  well and I think this is something
[1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:06.980]  that people need to understand up in Montana
[1:42:06.980 --> 1:42:08.980]  Alex I'm getting eyewitness phone calls
[1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:10.980]  daily and people running in I'm talking
[1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:12.980]  even sheriff's running into
[1:42:12.980 --> 1:42:14.980]  you know the infamous blackwater vans
[1:42:14.980 --> 1:42:16.980]  with the guys in their Hawaiian
[1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:18.980]  shirts and and and
[1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:20.980]  spider like sunglasses and
[1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:22.980]  and all up and down the board the rumor is
[1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:24.980]  and this is coming from people on the inside
[1:42:24.980 --> 1:42:26.980]  is that our borders are northern border
[1:42:26.980 --> 1:42:28.980]  with canada's would be shut down so people
[1:42:28.980 --> 1:42:30.980]  can flee out of this country when this
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:32.980]  economic emergency goes now the red lit
[1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:34.980]  can I explain what the red list is
[1:42:34.980 --> 1:42:36.980]  because I'm the originator of that
[1:42:36.980 --> 1:42:38.980]  well the red and blue lists yeah they always
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:40.980]  have a list go ahead yeah well they've always
[1:42:40.980 --> 1:42:42.980]  had a list okay look at what they're doing in
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:44.980]  the iraqi search the red list
[1:42:44.980 --> 1:42:46.980]  the blue list the green list the red lists are
[1:42:46.980 --> 1:42:48.980]  people to be terminated 30 days upon that
[1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:50.980]  instigation initiation
[1:42:50.980 --> 1:42:52.980]  of quote-unquote civil war marshal off
[1:42:52.980 --> 1:42:54.980]  the man who gave this to me was murdered
[1:42:54.980 --> 1:42:56.980]  Alex he was ahead of a federal
[1:42:56.980 --> 1:42:58.980]  agency over the entire western
[1:42:58.980 --> 1:43:00.980]  united states I won't tell which agency
[1:43:00.980 --> 1:43:02.980]  I won't tell his name
[1:43:02.980 --> 1:43:04.980]  he gave me the numbers and then this is
[1:43:04.980 --> 1:43:06.980]  years ago in fact then now it's
[1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:08.980]  doubled I think there are 3 million people
[1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:10.980]  scheduled for termination
[1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:12.980]  okay well if this guy ends up murdered
[1:43:12.980 --> 1:43:14.980]  because the information he puts out then
[1:43:14.980 --> 1:43:16.980]  I'd say hey somebody didn't want that news
[1:43:16.980 --> 1:43:18.980]  out but you know what people don't care
[1:43:18.980 --> 1:43:20.980]  it's the same thing that the U.S.
[1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:22.980]  is doing in iraq with the search
[1:43:22.980 --> 1:43:24.980]  identifying through all the technology
[1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:26.980]  who the bad guys are is going to be used
[1:43:26.980 --> 1:43:28.980]  against them that's hit teams you know
[1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:30.980]  you got it and again this is something
[1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:32.980]  there is evidence already right now
[1:43:32.980 --> 1:43:34.980]  that the spetsnaughts and GRU
[1:43:34.980 --> 1:43:36.980]  active orders have been
[1:43:36.980 --> 1:43:38.980]  given out and I want to explain how this
[1:43:38.980 --> 1:43:40.980]  works and you've read Luna
[1:43:40.980 --> 1:43:42.980]  you've read the Golitsyn
[1:43:42.980 --> 1:43:44.980]  yeah these are killer teams
[1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:46.980]  and when Putin said
[1:43:46.980 --> 1:43:48.980]  to Bush at the Olympics
[1:43:48.980 --> 1:43:50.980]  the war is on
[1:43:50.980 --> 1:43:52.980]  he wasn't talking about the war in Georgia
[1:43:52.980 --> 1:43:54.980]  he's talking about the third world war
[1:43:54.980 --> 1:43:56.980]  and I think this is something that
[1:43:56.980 --> 1:43:58.980]  the people have got to understand world war 3
[1:43:58.980 --> 1:44:00.980]  is the ultimate blood
[1:44:00.980 --> 1:44:02.980]  sacrifice of billions of
[1:44:02.980 --> 1:44:04.980]  men women and children to
[1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:06.980]  Lucifer and
[1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:08.980]  they bloody well
[1:44:08.980 --> 1:44:10.980]  everybody had bloody well understand
[1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:12.980]  that you and I have not been
[1:44:12.980 --> 1:44:14.980]  flapping our guns to
[1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:16.980]  basically try and warn and alert people
[1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:18.980]  all these years a decade and a half
[1:44:18.980 --> 1:44:20.980]  for me to basically
[1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:22.980]  just say oh gee everything's going to work
[1:44:22.980 --> 1:44:24.980]  out now. Paulson right now as we're speaking
[1:44:24.980 --> 1:44:26.980]  has been
[1:44:26.980 --> 1:44:28.980]  before congress making his fleet
[1:44:28.980 --> 1:44:30.980]  now ladies and gentlemen Goldman Sachs
[1:44:30.980 --> 1:44:32.980]  had an unlimited bank account
[1:44:32.980 --> 1:44:34.980]  with the treasury. Goldman Sachs
[1:44:34.980 --> 1:44:36.980]  is the exchange stabilization fund
[1:44:36.980 --> 1:44:38.980]  one fifth of it and so now
[1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:40.980]  we've got don't you find it interesting Alex
[1:44:40.980 --> 1:44:42.980]  we have this contrived financial
[1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:44.980]  crisis and it doesn't matter what the
[1:44:44.980 --> 1:44:46.980]  crisis is it doesn't have to be a nuclear
[1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:48.980]  weapon in multiple cities although
[1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:50.980]  that's what PDD 51 says
[1:44:50.980 --> 1:44:52.980]  is economic crisis or any other crisis
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:44:54.980]  the COG
[1:44:54.980 --> 1:44:56.980]  shadow government takes full public
[1:44:56.980 --> 1:44:58.980]  control and now they're introducing to
[1:44:58.980 --> 1:45:00.980]  the public going oh yeah
[1:45:00.980 --> 1:45:02.980]  army brigades are coming
[1:45:02.980 --> 1:45:04.980]  to deal with the American people oh yeah the president runs
[1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:06.980]  everything now oh yeah
[1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:08.980]  they're just announcing it
[1:45:08.980 --> 1:45:10.980]  well not only are they announcing but
[1:45:10.980 --> 1:45:12.980]  but they're but they're activating it
[1:45:12.980 --> 1:45:14.980]  so the question is notice the army
[1:45:14.980 --> 1:45:16.980]  announcement of the 1st of October
[1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:18.980]  where it goes active notice that
[1:45:18.980 --> 1:45:20.980]  all of the National Guard is out of the country
[1:45:20.980 --> 1:45:22.980]  how many times Alex a decade ago did we
[1:45:22.980 --> 1:45:24.980]  talk about that stuff
[1:45:24.980 --> 1:45:26.980]  that they would come when all the National Guard
[1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:28.980]  those loyal to the foundational principles
[1:45:28.980 --> 1:45:30.980]  of this country those who are
[1:45:30.980 --> 1:45:32.980]  men and women of the community would be out of
[1:45:32.980 --> 1:45:34.980]  country and they'd be helpless to help
[1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:36.980]  those in the country and why are we now
[1:45:36.980 --> 1:45:38.980]  right about that because it came from sources
[1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:40.980]  inside who didn't like
[1:45:40.980 --> 1:45:42.980]  what was happening
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:44.980]  that's why coming up in about
[1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:46.980]  an hour I'm going to play clips from Donahue
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:48.980]  the militia being attacked in 1994
[1:45:48.980 --> 1:45:50.980]  14 years ago
[1:45:50.980 --> 1:45:52.980]  and everything they say in here is coming true
[1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:54.980]  or has come true so absolutely
[1:45:54.980 --> 1:45:56.980]  I tell folks what the insiders
[1:45:56.980 --> 1:45:58.980]  were telling us 20 years ago
[1:45:58.980 --> 1:46:00.980]  why I went on the air 13 years ago
[1:46:00.980 --> 1:46:02.980]  why you went on the air 15 16
[1:46:02.980 --> 1:46:04.980]  years ago why there was this huge
[1:46:04.980 --> 1:46:06.980]  flux of real conservatives
[1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:08.980]  of real patriots in to resist
[1:46:08.980 --> 1:46:10.980]  the new world order because
[1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:12.980]  we were told we were told by
[1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:14.980]  good sources and it turned out it was all true
[1:46:14.980 --> 1:46:16.980]  right now what's happening Steve
[1:46:16.980 --> 1:46:18.980]  well again let's break it down
[1:46:18.980 --> 1:46:20.980]  first of all we were told what would happen economically
[1:46:20.980 --> 1:46:22.980]  we were told that we would be surrounded by enemies
[1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.980]  and Alex there is nobody
[1:46:24.980 --> 1:46:26.980]  the United States is going to be
[1:46:26.980 --> 1:46:28.980]  seen as the pariah nation of the world
[1:46:28.980 --> 1:46:30.980]  we were set up the globalist stage 9-11
[1:46:30.980 --> 1:46:32.980]  to blame it on our government
[1:46:32.980 --> 1:46:34.980]  absolutely day one we were set up for the torture
[1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:36.980]  to come out the CIA
[1:46:36.980 --> 1:46:38.980]  released the photos it's all about
[1:46:38.980 --> 1:46:40.980]  blaming it all on America that out of
[1:46:40.980 --> 1:46:42.980]  our fall rises the one world government
[1:46:42.980 --> 1:46:44.980]  right this is basically page by
[1:46:44.980 --> 1:46:46.980]  page of the communist manifesto
[1:46:46.980 --> 1:46:48.980]  doesn't matter if you're dealing with the public schools
[1:46:48.980 --> 1:46:50.980]  people wonder why johnny stab and george
[1:46:50.980 --> 1:46:52.980]  or mary and uh...
[1:46:52.980 --> 1:46:54.980]  jill are plotting to
[1:46:54.980 --> 1:46:56.980]  assassinate their little friend june
[1:46:56.980 --> 1:46:58.980]  the bottom line is that the
[1:46:58.980 --> 1:47:00.980]  the whole country this whole world
[1:47:00.980 --> 1:47:02.980]  in my opinion suffers from the same
[1:47:02.980 --> 1:47:04.980]  malady it's called sin
[1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:06.980]  and sin is rebellion against god and now
[1:47:06.980 --> 1:47:08.980]  the deal is i'm saying this with no
[1:47:08.980 --> 1:47:10.980]  apologies my message
[1:47:10.980 --> 1:47:12.980]  has gone forth for
[1:47:12.980 --> 1:47:14.980]  fifteen years and now
[1:47:14.980 --> 1:47:16.980]  it's simply this it is
[1:47:16.980 --> 1:47:18.980]  repent get right with jesus
[1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:20.980]  you cannot make it in your own
[1:47:20.980 --> 1:47:22.980]  strength no matter how tough you are someone's
[1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:24.980]  tougher and the toughest guy listening to this
[1:47:24.980 --> 1:47:26.980]  show today i don't care if he's in black ops
[1:47:26.980 --> 1:47:28.980]  special ops well you know
[1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:30.980]  outer space operations whatever
[1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:32.980]  the bottom line is the smallest
[1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:34.980]  virus can take the toughest
[1:47:34.980 --> 1:47:36.980]  man down and by the way i've been talking
[1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:38.980]  as you know alex i did before anybody
[1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:40.980]  even knew about some of these
[1:47:40.980 --> 1:47:42.980]  viruses i said look they're being generated
[1:47:42.980 --> 1:47:44.980]  bio labs are being mixed ebola
[1:47:44.980 --> 1:47:46.980]  smallpox ebola pox
[1:47:46.980 --> 1:47:48.980]  and and people didn't even want to be bothered
[1:47:48.980 --> 1:47:50.980]  with it the bird flu i interviewed
[1:47:50.980 --> 1:47:52.980]  with the i interviewed two of the cuban
[1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:54.980]  scientists that were held in cuban prisons
[1:47:54.980 --> 1:47:56.980]  and and the bottom line is that they said
[1:47:56.980 --> 1:47:58.980]  yeah we're affecting birds and we're taking
[1:47:58.980 --> 1:48:00.980]  them out on ships and releasing them off
[1:48:00.980 --> 1:48:02.980]  the coast united states well people didn't believe
[1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:04.980]  that well see the problem is
[1:48:04.980 --> 1:48:06.980]  is i tell people it's not
[1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:08.980]  too late if you act now
[1:48:08.980 --> 1:48:10.980]  but what you've got to do is act in the
[1:48:10.980 --> 1:48:12.980]  context of you're going to be under siege
[1:48:12.980 --> 1:48:14.980]  the financial system will collapse
[1:48:14.980 --> 1:48:16.980]  because it's engineered to collapse
[1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:18.980]  they'd be the uh...
[1:48:18.980 --> 1:48:20.980]  chinese and everybody
[1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:22.980]  are already dumping dollars
[1:48:22.980 --> 1:48:24.980]  i want you to stop there i want you to stop there i want to come back and keep you
[1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:26.980]  fifteen can we keep you fifteen minutes
[1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:28.980]  the next hour i know you're busy
[1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:30.980]  here okay uh... but i want to walk through this
[1:48:30.980 --> 1:48:32.980]  but i want to go back to something you said
[1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:34.980]  i know a lot of you've been spiritually blinded
[1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:36.980]  by the fluoride the mercury that's done by design
[1:48:36.980 --> 1:48:38.980]  we're on a planet in the middle of space
[1:48:38.980 --> 1:48:40.980]  there are dimensions all around us the mathematics
[1:48:40.980 --> 1:48:42.980]  has proven it
[1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:44.980]  and i want you to know something folks
[1:48:44.980 --> 1:48:46.980]  the the enemy tells you there's no god
[1:48:46.980 --> 1:48:48.980]  the enemy holds up these fake preachers
[1:48:48.980 --> 1:48:50.980]  to make christianity look bad they do all these things
[1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:52.980]  to blind you but the elites
[1:48:52.980 --> 1:48:54.980]  are religious they worship a very dark
[1:48:54.980 --> 1:48:56.980]  god
[1:48:56.980 --> 1:48:58.980]  they they they are into darkness and death
[1:48:58.980 --> 1:49:00.980]  and misery and what steve was just saying
[1:49:00.980 --> 1:49:02.980]  the things that are coming whether it's this month
[1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:04.980]  or two years from now
[1:49:04.980 --> 1:49:06.980]  the things that are coming are so horrible
[1:49:06.980 --> 1:49:08.980]  that you better realize
[1:49:08.980 --> 1:49:10.980]  that you better get your heart right with the creator
[1:49:10.980 --> 1:49:12.980]  and and and for those of you that don't
[1:49:12.980 --> 1:49:14.980]  believe in this
[1:49:14.980 --> 1:49:16.980]  you have to understand you have to get your heart right
[1:49:16.980 --> 1:49:18.980]  because if you have the fearful attitude
[1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:20.980]  and you're afraid of losing your body
[1:49:20.980 --> 1:49:22.980]  you're going to make decisions
[1:49:22.980 --> 1:49:24.980]  that lend up making you lose your life
[1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:26.980]  it's when you have the attitude
[1:49:26.980 --> 1:49:28.980]  and are focused
[1:49:28.980 --> 1:49:30.980]  and dialed into what's really going on
[1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.980]  then you'll have
[1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:34.980]  basically like it's night time it's dark
[1:49:34.980 --> 1:49:36.980]  people can't see
[1:49:36.980 --> 1:49:38.980]  that's what the sermon is it's like having night vision
[1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:40.980]  goggles you need to get
[1:49:40.980 --> 1:49:42.980]  dialed into the creator of the universe
[1:49:42.980 --> 1:49:44.980]  because then you're going to get your night vision
[1:49:44.980 --> 1:49:46.980]  goggles is that a good analogy steve
[1:49:46.980 --> 1:49:48.980]  that's good analogy but again the bottom line
[1:49:48.980 --> 1:49:50.980]  is you know it's interesting that Alex
[1:49:50.980 --> 1:49:52.980]  you can say any name in the world
[1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:54.980]  you can talk about anything you can worship the god
[1:49:54.980 --> 1:49:56.980]  as Jesus don't say Jesus don't say
[1:49:56.980 --> 1:49:58.980]  yeah don't say Jesus
[1:49:58.980 --> 1:50:00.980]  never say Jesus I mean
[1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:02.980]  you know it and make fun of Jesus
[1:50:02.980 --> 1:50:04.980]  and the deal is is that I got news
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:06.980]  for everybody if they'll read the book of revelation
[1:50:06.980 --> 1:50:08.980]  I even hear people this is amazing me
[1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:10.980]  well they won't accept Jesus but they quote
[1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:12.980]  book of revelation I said you know what the
[1:50:12.980 --> 1:50:14.980]  book of revelation starts with
[1:50:14.980 --> 1:50:16.980]  this is the revelation that God gave
[1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:18.980]  his servant John concerning
[1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:20.980]  Jesus Christ the revelation is
[1:50:20.980 --> 1:50:22.980]  of Jesus and how Jesus
[1:50:22.980 --> 1:50:24.980]  is going to fix this up I got to tell you
[1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:26.980]  in in the Illuminous circles they do
[1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:28.980]  they will call him the Nazarene
[1:50:28.980 --> 1:50:30.980]  they will call him every disparaging
[1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:32.980]  name in the world but they cannot say the name
[1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:34.980]  of Jesus or they won't say it
[1:50:34.980 --> 1:50:36.980]  it's it's where they're Alex
[1:50:36.980 --> 1:50:38.980]  this is a meltdown it's a
[1:50:38.980 --> 1:50:40.980]  supernatural diabolically
[1:50:40.980 --> 1:50:42.980]  wicked plan and our days
[1:50:42.980 --> 1:50:44.980]  are numbered and I fear the
[1:50:44.980 --> 1:50:46.980]  number is very very short
[1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:48.980]  well it's certainly
[1:50:48.980 --> 1:50:50.980]  the
[1:50:50.980 --> 1:50:52.980]  pains of birth what's being born

[1:50:56.980 --> 1:50:58.980]  collapse on the other side

[1:52:02.980 --> 1:52:04.980]  along with hundreds
[1:52:04.980 --> 1:52:06.980]  of my fellow troops I went to grounds here
[1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:08.980]  and we knew what to do
[1:52:08.980 --> 1:52:10.980]  or at least we thought we did
[1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:12.980]  and it was amazing as a breakthrough
[1:52:12.980 --> 1:52:14.980]  9-11 film that finally
[1:52:14.980 --> 1:52:16.980]  gives first responders a platform
[1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:18.980]  to tell their story
[1:52:18.980 --> 1:52:20.980]  Whitman
[1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:22.980]  EPA director
[1:52:22.980 --> 1:52:24.980]  on the 18 made a statement
[1:52:24.980 --> 1:52:26.980]  that the air
[1:52:26.980 --> 1:52:28.980]  was safe to breathe
[1:52:28.980 --> 1:52:30.980]  this film follows the growing momentum
[1:52:30.980 --> 1:52:32.980]  of 9-11 truth as brave souls
[1:52:32.980 --> 1:52:34.980]  take action against their global masters
[1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:36.980]  he had his hand over the radio
[1:52:36.980 --> 1:52:38.980]  while he was getting a countdown
[1:52:38.980 --> 1:52:40.980]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[1:52:56.980 --> 1:52:58.980]  they're going to commit more acts
[1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:00.980]  and bring in martial law
[1:53:00.980 --> 1:53:02.980]  do you want to pay for the government bailout
[1:53:02.980 --> 1:53:04.980]  of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
[1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:06.980]  you may have no choice
[1:53:06.980 --> 1:53:08.980]  obviously taxpayers are on the hook
[1:53:08.980 --> 1:53:10.980]  for over 6 trillion
[1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:12.980]  that's right, trillion dollars in mortgages
[1:53:12.980 --> 1:53:14.980]  held by these two corporations
[1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:16.980]  the part that most people don't realize
[1:53:16.980 --> 1:53:18.980]  is that this bailout can have significant
[1:53:18.980 --> 1:53:20.980]  adverse effects on their 401Ks
[1:53:20.980 --> 1:53:22.980]  and IRAs
[1:53:22.980 --> 1:53:24.980]  unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout
[1:53:24.980 --> 1:53:26.980]  with your personal retirement funds
[1:53:26.980 --> 1:53:28.980]  you need to act now
[1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:30.980]  the solution is to fund a self-directed IRA
[1:53:30.980 --> 1:53:32.980]  with gold and silver

[1:56:04.980 --> 1:56:06.980]  it could get very serious
[1:56:06.980 --> 1:56:08.980]  I keep saying with the economy, the dollar
[1:56:08.980 --> 1:56:10.980]  I kind of like to
[1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:12.980]  hope for the best, but prepare for the worst

[1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.980]  1-800-409-5633
[1:56:50.980 --> 1:56:52.980]  or eFoodsDirect.com
[1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:54.980]  okay Steve, we lost your line there
[1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:56.980]  we've got you for another 20 minutes
[1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:58.980]  give out your website
[1:56:58.980 --> 1:57:00.980]  all the great radio archives
[1:57:00.980 --> 1:57:02.980]  and all the great work you're doing
[1:57:02.980 --> 1:57:04.980]  how do folks check that out?
[1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:06.980]  it's www.stevecoyolquyle.com
[1:57:06.980 --> 1:57:08.980]  and I really want to draw their attention Alex
[1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:10.980]  to the last
[1:57:10.980 --> 1:57:12.980]  it's just right down under the guest information
[1:57:12.980 --> 1:57:14.980]  and I did a bunch of two hours specials
[1:57:14.980 --> 1:57:16.980]  and as I stated on the air
[1:57:16.980 --> 1:57:18.980]  I wanted to do this last show with you
[1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:20.980]  because I wanted to get across to the people
[1:57:20.980 --> 1:57:22.980]  the lateness of the hour
[1:57:22.980 --> 1:57:24.980]  and you know, again, God bless you
[1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:26.980]  because I even said to George Norrie
[1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:28.980]  when I said I don't know where Alex gets his energy
[1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:30.980]  but God bless him, I wish I had some of it
[1:57:30.980 --> 1:57:32.980]  but you know the thing is
[1:57:32.980 --> 1:57:34.980]  is that where we're at right now
[1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:36.980]  Alex is a full scale
[1:57:36.980 --> 1:57:38.980]  this is what people don't understand
[1:57:38.980 --> 1:57:40.980]  full scale implementation
[1:57:40.980 --> 1:57:42.980]  of the destruction of the United States
[1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:44.980]  if it's true that the
[1:57:44.980 --> 1:57:46.980]  soviet special forces have been
[1:57:46.980 --> 1:57:48.980]  given the go ahead
[1:57:48.980 --> 1:57:50.980]  in other words they've been activated
[1:57:50.980 --> 1:57:52.980]  then I can tell you point blank
[1:57:52.980 --> 1:57:54.980]  that you can expect fireworks
[1:57:54.980 --> 1:57:56.980]  in the Caribbean, by the way
[1:57:56.980 --> 1:57:58.980]  we are going to get into it in the Caribbean
[1:57:58.980 --> 1:58:00.980]  with Chavez and crew
[1:58:00.980 --> 1:58:02.980]  the oil centers on Aruba Curacao
[1:58:02.980 --> 1:58:04.980]  and Bonaire
[1:58:04.980 --> 1:58:06.980]  people don't understand how critical the Caribbean
[1:58:06.980 --> 1:58:08.980]  facilities are to our national security
[1:58:08.980 --> 1:58:10.980]  and right now
[1:58:10.980 --> 1:58:12.980]  because I don't know what
[1:58:12.980 --> 1:58:14.980]  genius in the Pentagon decided to go and put
[1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:16.980]  rockets in the Ukraine, Poland
[1:58:16.980 --> 1:58:18.980]  and radar etc.
[1:58:18.980 --> 1:58:20.980]  but Putin is not
[1:58:20.980 --> 1:58:22.980]  to be toyed with just because America
[1:58:22.980 --> 1:58:24.980]  has lost its will
[1:58:24.980 --> 1:58:26.980]  in my opinion in the political realm
[1:58:26.980 --> 1:58:28.980]  to recognize the reality of the hour
[1:58:28.980 --> 1:58:30.980]  doesn't mean the Russians have
[1:58:30.980 --> 1:58:32.980]  final phase, stay there let's come back and talk about
[1:58:32.980 --> 1:58:34.980]  we're in the final phase of
[1:58:34.980 --> 1:58:36.980]  war criminal activity ladies and gentlemen
[1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:38.980]  I mean you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:58:38.980 --> 1:58:40.980]  back in 70 seconds
[1:58:42.980 --> 1:58:44.980]  thank you for listening to GCN
[1:58:44.980 --> 1:58:46.980]  be sure to visit GCNLive.com
[1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:48.980]  today
[1:58:50.980 --> 1:58:52.980]  a day unlike any other
[1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:54.980]  in the long course of American history
[1:58:54.980 --> 1:58:56.980]  a terrorist act of war
[1:58:56.980 --> 1:58:58.980]  against this country
[1:58:58.980 --> 1:59:00.980]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[1:59:00.980 --> 1:59:02.980]  but who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.980 --> 1:59:04.980]  this is his ammo
[1:59:06.980 --> 1:59:08.980]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11
[1:59:08.980 --> 1:59:10.980]  film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:59:10.980 --> 1:59:12.980]  ties to intelligence networks
[1:59:12.980 --> 1:59:14.980]  inside the United States
[1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:16.980]  some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[1:59:16.980 --> 1:59:18.980]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:59:18.980 --> 1:59:20.980]  in and on the U.S.
[1:59:20.980 --> 1:59:22.980]  I'm aware that some
[1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:24.980]  Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:59:24.980 --> 1:59:26.980]  in Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:59:26.980 --> 1:59:28.980]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:59:28.980 --> 1:59:30.980]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[1:59:30.980 --> 1:59:32.980]  the Israeli intelligence network
[1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:34.980]  warnings and war games
[1:59:34.980 --> 1:59:36.980]  the shadow government and much much more

[1:59:46.980 --> 1:59:48.980]  either you are with us
[1:59:48.980 --> 2:00:16.980]  be sure to reach the commissioners
[2:00:16.980 --> 2:00:23.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.980 --> 2:00:28.980]  Every generation faces their own wars and financial calamities.
[2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:37.980]  But the configuration and the confluence of different elements of the witness coming together today and in the very near future,
[2:00:37.980 --> 2:00:43.980]  not on the horizon, close at hand, will surely dwarf anything that's been seen in past history.
[2:00:43.980 --> 2:00:52.980]  And quite a bit has been seen in history for anyone that's even done a basic perusal of the last century, the 20th century.
[2:00:52.980 --> 2:00:58.980]  Steve Quayle is our guest. You were talking about the jumping off point, the jump point, the flash point, a quickening,
[2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:05.980]  going to a whole new level, the new order pulling out all the stops and revealing itself. Please continue, Steve Quayle.
[2:01:05.980 --> 2:01:09.980]  Well, as you know, Alex, you've commented on too, you've gotten feedback from some of the Illuminers.
[2:01:09.980 --> 2:01:13.980]  They say, we don't care. We don't care what you tell. We don't care what you know.
[2:01:13.980 --> 2:01:21.980]  And what's the most disheartening thing for me is when those in that level of power tell me point blank that you don't get it, Steve.
[2:01:21.980 --> 2:01:24.980]  Enough people aren't getting it and it's too late.
[2:01:24.980 --> 2:01:31.980]  And I tell them this, it may be too late for those people, but it's not too late for you guys to turn around and repent.
[2:01:31.980 --> 2:01:36.980]  Now, here's what I think is going to happen, okay? The stock and bond markets are going to collapse and they're going to rob all...
[2:01:36.980 --> 2:01:43.980]  Now, listen to this, Alex, all of their pensions and their 401Ks. I warn people, get out, get out, get out when you can while you can.
[2:01:43.980 --> 2:01:49.980]  Guess what? I was just a fear monger. All this bailout money is creating hyperinflation of the dollar.
[2:01:49.980 --> 2:01:58.980]  If people don't realize, look, when the Treasury admits to pumping in $700 billion, the numbers that I'm hearing just to shore up Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion.
[2:01:58.980 --> 2:02:02.980]  Now, they're not creating $100 bills. They're just doing it by computer entry.
[2:02:02.980 --> 2:02:06.980]  But the bottom line is China, Russia, all of the people in the world that used to look up to this country,
[2:02:06.980 --> 2:02:11.980]  if you were as good as an American dollar 100 bill, the $100 bill, you didn't care what currency your country had.
[2:02:11.980 --> 2:02:17.980]  You wanted an American $100 bill. Now, those same people that used to welcome it with open arms, they hiss at it.
[2:02:17.980 --> 2:02:24.980]  I guess you've heard the story. You can't even use a U.S. currency in India. The Taj Mahal rejected automatically.
[2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:28.980]  Food shortages and energy shortages are going to drive the majority into poverty.
[2:02:28.980 --> 2:02:35.980]  This winter, this winter, economic, emergency, martial law, camps, and work gangs are going to be activated.
[2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:39.980]  That's when the risk of this starts and civil war breaks out.
[2:02:39.980 --> 2:02:43.980]  And in the midst of all that, this is exactly how the Russian war broke out.
[2:02:43.980 --> 2:02:52.980]  I spent 15 years of my life reading, writing, interviewing spies, ex-spies on Russian war policy.
[2:02:52.980 --> 2:02:55.980]  This is going by the book. This is going by the book.
[2:02:55.980 --> 2:03:01.980]  And listen, Tatiana Karajna, basically, she was interviewed by Rick Wilde at truenews.com.
[2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:06.980]  She said that 9-11 was designed by men controlling over $300 trillion,
[2:03:06.980 --> 2:03:10.980]  and that Americans would literally be naked in the streets when they figured it out.
[2:03:10.980 --> 2:03:16.980]  Alex, I'm listening to crying men, crying women. I'm not making fun. It makes tears well up in my eyes.
[2:03:16.980 --> 2:03:24.980]  People that call me and say, my whole life is wiped out before me because, quote-unquote, my stockbroker said it's a good time to buy.
[2:03:24.980 --> 2:03:30.980]  These rallies that you're seeing are nothing more than black box computer entries using the futures,
[2:03:30.980 --> 2:03:32.980]  meaning you can control a lot of money.
[2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:37.980]  Let me stop you there. Remember, and I use this one example because this is one of the few that came out,
[2:03:37.980 --> 2:03:43.980]  remember the Secretary of the Army before that white, or Thomas White, was the head of Enron on the West Coast.
[2:03:43.980 --> 2:03:46.980]  They had fake computer programs and energy trading.
[2:03:46.980 --> 2:03:52.980]  They showed the news and showed the inspectors, and they just made the numbers up out of their head every day,
[2:03:52.980 --> 2:03:55.980]  stealing millions a day from Californians. Go ahead.
[2:03:55.980 --> 2:03:58.980]  Right. A double set of books, and that's exactly what's going on.
[2:03:58.980 --> 2:04:01.980]  Everything, and boy, somebody says, well, you can't make that statement.
[2:04:01.980 --> 2:04:05.980]  I'll tell you what, when the people behind the scenes tell me everything, I'll quote them.
[2:04:05.980 --> 2:04:09.980]  Everything that you are seeing, we are seeing, we are hearing in numbers.
[2:04:09.980 --> 2:04:11.980]  You know Clayton Williams, a Texas oilman?
[2:04:11.980 --> 2:04:12.980]  Yep.
[2:04:12.980 --> 2:04:19.980]  People, oil companies are going on his property and drilling without even getting leases or discussing service damages.
[2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:23.980]  That's the kind of stuff going on in Texas, just criminality by the corporations.
[2:04:23.980 --> 2:04:28.980]  All the rules are out the door, folks, because they know this is it.
[2:04:28.980 --> 2:04:31.980]  This is the mass looting.
[2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:38.980]  And then the foreigners that used to loan us $3 billion a day on the last Treasury international capital flow or the tick report,
[2:04:38.980 --> 2:04:41.980]  people, they're backing out. They're no longer funding us.
[2:04:41.980 --> 2:04:44.980]  They're making America pay in kind.
[2:04:44.980 --> 2:04:48.980]  By the way, Russia and China have already demanded payment in kind, not in U.S. dollars.
[2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:50.980]  Stay there. I want to hear more about this with Steve Coyle.
[2:04:50.980 --> 2:04:53.980]  We'll give out his website as well and a phone number if you want to contact him.

[2:06:09.980 --> 2:06:15.980]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:06:15.980 --> 2:06:18.980]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:06:18.980 --> 2:06:26.980]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:34.980]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:06:41.980 --> 2:06:44.980]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:06:44.980 --> 2:06:46.980]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[2:07:00.980 --> 2:07:05.980]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights on toll booths and scanning the freeways

[2:08:08.980 --> 2:08:13.980]  I meant to ask Steve during the break, why don't we just try to take him to the bottom of the hour?
[2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:16.980]  I know he wanted to come on early today because he has some work.
[2:08:16.980 --> 2:08:18.980]  He's got to get done getting himself prepared.
[2:08:18.980 --> 2:08:21.980]  But Steve, can you do two more segments where this goes another 20 minutes?
[2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:22.980]  Sure. Thank you.
[2:08:22.980 --> 2:08:25.980]  You bet. Don't thank you no longer if you can.
[2:08:25.980 --> 2:08:30.980]  We've got callers that want to talk to you at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:08:30.980 --> 2:08:34.980]  Whatever issue the caller brings up, of course, Steve Quayle can comment on.
[2:08:34.980 --> 2:08:39.980]  Steve, you were continuing with just absolute spot on.
[2:08:39.980 --> 2:08:42.980]  I study this stuff every day, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:46.980]  What you're hearing from him is absolutely spot on what's going on.
[2:08:46.980 --> 2:08:54.980]  Then I want to ask you about Bob Woodward three weeks ago saying the Pentagon has super weapons as big as the Manhattan Project and their technological scale and development.
[2:08:54.980 --> 2:09:00.980]  I've got my sources in the military and they say it's a cocktail of directed energy weapons and other things.
[2:09:00.980 --> 2:09:07.980]  But before you leave us, give us your take on what those are, radiation guns in space, whatever they are.
[2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:09.980]  First of all, let me just share this.
[2:09:09.980 --> 2:09:21.980]  Probably the two things that are the most closely guarded or have been closely held secrets in the military establishment are sophistication and space travel, which is way beyond the space shuttle.
[2:09:21.980 --> 2:09:29.980]  Alex, from my sources, we're 100 years ahead, 100 years ahead of where most people think we are now.
[2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:35.980]  When you're talking about Stargate, you're talking about things that go back into history and antiquity.
[2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:42.980]  When you're talking about all the great citadels of the ancient world and all of the underground labyrinths,
[2:09:42.980 --> 2:09:47.980]  there are people in your area that literally fight the things that go bump in the night.
[2:09:47.980 --> 2:09:57.980]  And when I say this, all of the mythology of the world, all of the oral traditions of the tribes, it doesn't matter where you find them in any place on the globe,
[2:09:57.980 --> 2:10:05.980]  have a reference to a time when the gods fought amongst themselves and all of the weaponry that was used.
[2:10:05.980 --> 2:10:12.980]  Stargate technology, probably one of the closest held secrets there are, some of the ways that the weapons...
[2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:19.980]  Let me give you a good example. One general told me, he said, we got stuff that makes atom bombs seem like firecrackers.
[2:10:19.980 --> 2:10:21.980]  They have dimensional warp weapons.
[2:10:21.980 --> 2:10:25.980]  Well, it slipped out. They have anti-matter weapons. They have radiation guns. They have microwave guns.
[2:10:25.980 --> 2:10:27.980]  You're saying they have teleportation.
[2:10:27.980 --> 2:10:28.980]  Yes, they do.
[2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:33.980]  I know they're working on teleportation of weapons devices, a teleportation of flesh.
[2:10:33.980 --> 2:10:37.980]  Yep. And then let me tell you this. I'm also going to tell you something.
[2:10:37.980 --> 2:10:44.980]  They have totally mastered complete invisibility. I'm not talking like the invisible man, but anything can be masked.
[2:10:44.980 --> 2:10:45.980]  It's just the same thing.
[2:10:45.980 --> 2:10:50.980]  Well, I remember when that was classified, you were talking about 15 years ago. Now they admit it's a suit, like in Predator,
[2:10:50.980 --> 2:10:53.980]  where it shows whatever's on the other side of it. They have tanks that have it.
[2:10:53.980 --> 2:10:59.980]  Yeah, this is even beyond that. This is basically a form of energy that bends light waves.
[2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:04.980]  So there is no reflection of light. So the thing absolutely can be totally silent.
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:11.980]  We've got weapons that can literally hang in suspended animation, electro-providically, until they're needed.
[2:11:11.980 --> 2:11:14.980]  We have space-based weapons platforms.
[2:11:14.980 --> 2:11:20.980]  And I know this is going to be too hard for most people to believe, but there are absolute...
[2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:25.980]  We have bases throughout the planet, especially on Mars.
[2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:32.980]  And you know, it's kind of funny because even one of the head designers for Boeing or Skunkworks made this statement.
[2:11:32.980 --> 2:11:40.980]  He said, if the American people ever knew that we've already got interstellar travel, they'd be completely blown away.
[2:11:40.980 --> 2:11:47.980]  I forget his name, but here's the thing. The weapons are there, the technology there, and the supernatural nature.
[2:11:47.980 --> 2:11:50.980]  How much more advanced is Russia from your information?
[2:11:50.980 --> 2:11:54.980]  Russia is incredibly advanced in the area of Tesla physics.
[2:11:54.980 --> 2:12:00.980]  They took a lot of Tesla's work, and when the West was just finding out about Tesla, they took it a big way.
[2:12:00.980 --> 2:12:07.980]  As a matter of fact, took it in a big direction. Russia has a lot of weapons that they know, but they're all fighting.
[2:12:07.980 --> 2:12:13.980]  Our intelligence organizations, our military secret organizations are all fighting for the ancient technology,
[2:12:13.980 --> 2:12:16.980]  which is basically weaponry and teleportation.
[2:12:16.980 --> 2:12:23.980]  And when I say teleportation, Alex, it's not so much that you get beamed, it's that you walk through a gateway into dimensions.
[2:12:23.980 --> 2:12:32.980]  And when we're talking about quarks and black holes and the God particle and gravity and its effect on all of the dynamics of the universe,
[2:12:32.980 --> 2:12:35.980]  we're talking about the intelligence that God ever had.
[2:12:35.980 --> 2:12:40.980]  Well, it was Arthur C. Clark that said that the calculator a hundred years ago would have been magic.
[2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:43.980]  So magic is just things that people don't understand.
[2:12:43.980 --> 2:12:49.980]  And here's the thing, Steve. I don't have the cooks and the quacks and the people that make stuff up on.
[2:12:49.980 --> 2:12:53.980]  I mean, you have predicted so much, you've had sources, you've been right.
[2:12:53.980 --> 2:12:58.980]  So often that's what really freaks me out when you get into all this and say your military sources are telling you that.
[2:12:58.980 --> 2:13:04.980]  And then I have enough of the information to know that, I mean, I've had the former head of the army on,
[2:13:04.980 --> 2:13:07.980]  who is also the head of army intelligence before that.
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:11.980]  I mean, the head of the army, the head of special forces as well,
[2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:16.980]  and it's now mainstream news that they were killing goats with their minds.
[2:13:16.980 --> 2:13:21.980]  And you can laugh at that, but that's special forces. And that's 20 years ago.
[2:13:21.980 --> 2:13:28.980]  Absolutely. And I mean, one of the things that I'm really trying to get people to recognize, Alex, is that there is protection, you know.
[2:13:28.980 --> 2:13:33.980]  But the Bible is a wonderful, wonderful presentation of God's love to his people.
[2:13:33.980 --> 2:13:38.980]  And I want to share this with everybody else is thinking about killing it, how to kill, how to kill more effectively.
[2:13:38.980 --> 2:13:45.980]  You know, there's still a God is pleading with all of his creation, you know, come unto me, all you that are heavy laden, I'll give you a rest.
[2:13:45.980 --> 2:13:50.980]  The word that's disappeared, you know, this is an amazing word, the true word, love.
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:58.980]  There is no love. I'm not talking stupid, syrupy love, but I'm talking the love of God is the most, how should I say this,
[2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:04.980]  avoided subject in the world, especially in the world of the Illuminati.
[2:14:04.980 --> 2:14:09.980]  See, the Illuminati, the lightbearers, if you will, the lightbringers have one prime directive.
[2:14:09.980 --> 2:14:20.980]  And that is to kill every single human being that was creating the image and likeness of living God and to substitute a transhuman insert.
[2:14:20.980 --> 2:14:28.980]  And that's what they say. That's why they race around butchering the genetic code, hurting the planet while getting more power to kill us in the name of saving it.
[2:14:28.980 --> 2:14:35.980]  Absolutely. And see, the deal is that the Antichrist, the book of Daniel, makes war by continually talking about peace.
[2:14:35.980 --> 2:14:43.980]  Well, right, doesn't that sound familiar? You know, we're in a time period now where the dimensional shift, and I'm going to share something, Alex,
[2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:49.980]  but I want people to hear it because they may never hear this again, and I would hope you'll keep it up as it starts to unfold.
[2:14:49.980 --> 2:15:00.980]  The bottom line is, is when you're screwing with the fabric of literally matter and energy, the very barriers that God created to keep us from basically flipping out,
[2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:07.980]  freaking out with all the stuff that's out there, when they tear a rift in that, or if you will, a portal, a window, and this stuff comes charging through,
[2:15:07.980 --> 2:15:10.980]  then I think you're going to see the time that Jesus spoke of when he said,
[2:15:10.980 --> 2:15:15.980]  men's hearts failing them for fear of looking after those things or looking after those things coming upon the earth.
[2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:24.980]  And weather modification, weather warfare, the biggest story going on right before everybody's eyes and they don't get it is the weather wars that are taking place.
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:33.980]  Zignu Brzezinski, oh, we all know him, by the way, that's the man behind Obama, said that the time would come when one nation would make war on another nation
[2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:37.980]  using weather warfare and weather modification and blame it on...
[2:15:37.980 --> 2:15:45.980]  Well, it was also in the April issue of Army Times, 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen at Pentagon Press Conference,
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:50.980]  in the main press conference room of the, forget which ring, in the Pentagon.
[2:15:50.980 --> 2:15:55.980]  So he also said we have tectonic weapons, weather weapons, tsunami weapons,
[2:15:55.980 --> 2:16:00.980]  and then you have Dick Cheney in the PNAC document saying we'll use ray specific bio weapons.
[2:16:00.980 --> 2:16:07.980]  And I was the first guy to bring that out almost 15 years ago when Wutar Basant in South Africa had developed the breakthrough.
[2:16:07.980 --> 2:16:10.980]  He was tried and set free, but when I...
[2:16:10.980 --> 2:16:14.980]  Yeah, because he gave it to Israel, why are they killing so many microbiologists?
[2:16:14.980 --> 2:16:21.980]  Well, they're killing the microbiologists because the microbiologists, some of them were some of the premier microbiologists in the world,
[2:16:21.980 --> 2:16:29.980]  and they were involved in preliminary steps or even intermediary steps in developing some of the things.
[2:16:29.980 --> 2:16:35.980]  They're the only ones that could come up with the antidote or the antivirus to counter it.
[2:16:35.980 --> 2:16:37.980]  So they're all being off-terminated.
[2:16:37.980 --> 2:16:40.980]  They also knew how to track it some of them back to the engine.
[2:16:40.980 --> 2:16:43.980]  They could point the fingers at those behind it.
[2:16:43.980 --> 2:16:46.980]  And listen, I've got to tell you something. This is the biggest story.
[2:16:46.980 --> 2:16:50.980]  And you know, you carried it, I carried it, I start detailing them on my website.
[2:16:50.980 --> 2:16:53.980]  We've got so many, and these are not, you know, people say,
[2:16:53.980 --> 2:16:58.980]  well, in any given population you'll have so many people die that are this profession.
[2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:04.980]  No, no, ladies and gentlemen, these are not only just the U.S., these are some of the Russian-defecting bioscientists, too.
[2:17:04.980 --> 2:17:05.980]  So the point is...
[2:17:05.980 --> 2:17:09.980]  It's all the key people in tracking treatment and production.
[2:17:09.980 --> 2:17:14.980]  And for some reason, a message has been sent in Russia and the U.S. all over.
[2:17:14.980 --> 2:17:16.980]  And folks, I'm not joking. This has been in the Washington Post.
[2:17:16.980 --> 2:17:20.980]  They cut their guts open, string their intestines all over the walls,
[2:17:20.980 --> 2:17:23.980]  carve pentagrams in their backs when they do that.
[2:17:23.980 --> 2:17:25.980]  And you'll see all these cases.
[2:17:25.980 --> 2:17:29.980]  A large portion of these hundreds that have been killed are satanically butchered.
[2:17:29.980 --> 2:17:32.980]  You got it. I think that you're talking about Bernard Schwartz.
[2:17:32.980 --> 2:17:36.980]  Well, that was a Virginia case, but I've seen a bunch of others now where they're doing that.
[2:17:36.980 --> 2:17:41.980]  Oh, absolutely. But I just want to say this, that was in the CIA's backyard, okay?
[2:17:41.980 --> 2:17:42.980]  Interesting.
[2:17:42.980 --> 2:17:48.980]  And again, do you remember when, oh, good night, the head of Ministry of Defense was murdered?
[2:17:48.980 --> 2:17:49.980]  I went public and...
[2:17:49.980 --> 2:17:53.980]  Dr. David Kelly had a port down by a weapons lab, yeah.
[2:17:53.980 --> 2:17:56.980]  Right. And from the very first...
[2:17:56.980 --> 2:18:01.980]  Actually, I think when I got wind of that, Alex, I was on George North doing a Coast to Coast show.
[2:18:01.980 --> 2:18:06.980]  It's now admitted that he basically was murdered. They saw five guys in black uniforms run away from the body.
[2:18:06.980 --> 2:18:09.980]  They say, dot of slit wrist, no blood there. Go ahead.
[2:18:09.980 --> 2:18:16.980]  Yeah. But the point is, you see, even to get critical thinking in America to take place once again,
[2:18:16.980 --> 2:18:23.980]  it's like, it's so hard and I'm frustrated and I am frustrated because, again, we're seeing right now.
[2:18:23.980 --> 2:18:26.980]  We're seeing the implementation. And this is what I don't know.
[2:18:26.980 --> 2:18:29.980]  We've got to start getting people to think, change from practical.
[2:18:29.980 --> 2:18:32.980]  We want them to be practical, but to tactical, okay?
[2:18:32.980 --> 2:18:40.980]  If you knew that every single statement, every single plan, every single plot, theme or blueprint,
[2:18:40.980 --> 2:18:43.980]  was to basically destroy you and your family.
[2:18:43.980 --> 2:18:48.980]  I think people would basically say, it's time for me to get involved, not just cheer you on, Alex,
[2:18:48.980 --> 2:18:49.980]  or not just cheer me on.
[2:18:49.980 --> 2:18:54.980]  No, no, that's it. I mean, I had a top, you know, researcher, scientist.
[2:18:54.980 --> 2:18:56.980]  He works with a team of scientists on yesterday.
[2:18:56.980 --> 2:19:03.980]  It's a fact. It's not just sodium fluoride. It's this particularly deadly type that they know attacks the body
[2:19:03.980 --> 2:19:05.980]  and does all these horrible things. And it's a fact.
[2:19:05.980 --> 2:19:08.980]  And that's only one thing they're doing, Steve.
[2:19:08.980 --> 2:19:13.980]  And I can't believe the police and others, some of them, I know a lot of them are waking up,
[2:19:13.980 --> 2:19:16.980]  think that we're the bad guys because they're manuals.
[2:19:16.980 --> 2:19:20.980]  Tell them, if somebody talks about about the UN, they're a terrorist.
[2:19:20.980 --> 2:19:21.980]  Right. Well, the UN sucks.
[2:19:21.980 --> 2:19:26.980]  It's the most criminal organization in the world. They're the most destructive force,
[2:19:26.980 --> 2:19:28.980]  the most impotent group of crooks.
[2:19:28.980 --> 2:19:30.980]  And people say, that's who's going to rule the world?
[2:19:30.980 --> 2:19:36.980]  No, basically, what they are doing, Alex, what has been done is, right out of the Communist National...
[2:19:36.980 --> 2:19:37.980]  The UN's another cutout.
[2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:43.980]  Yeah. And it's just basically get the people to be villain, you know, vilify the people,
[2:19:43.980 --> 2:19:48.980]  get the powers that be to destroy the people, and then destroy the powers that be.
[2:19:48.980 --> 2:19:51.980]  It's basically a multi-level assassination.
[2:19:51.980 --> 2:19:53.980]  Well, that's a Trotsky version.
[2:19:53.980 --> 2:19:55.980]  You got it. And then, by the way...
[2:19:55.980 --> 2:20:00.980]  Stay there, stay there, stay there, Steve. This is powerful info. Call straight ahead.
[2:20:00.980 --> 2:20:07.980]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:20:07.980 --> 2:20:11.980]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:12.980]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:12.980 --> 2:20:13.980]  This is his MO.
[2:20:13.980 --> 2:20:16.980]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:20:16.980 --> 2:20:23.980]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:20:23.980 --> 2:20:30.980]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:20:30.980 --> 2:20:34.980]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:20:34.980 --> 2:20:41.980]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:20:41.980 --> 2:20:46.980]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[2:20:46.980 --> 2:20:53.980]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:20:53.980 --> 2:21:17.980]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:17.980 --> 2:21:25.980]  I just found this cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies. The bond market continues to slump. J.P. Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[2:21:25.980 --> 2:21:32.980]  Housing sales fell 6.6 percent. Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle of the class.
[2:21:32.980 --> 2:21:38.980]  Investors cast out on investment banks credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:45.980]  The U.S. dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies in countries that previously financed the U.S. are now seeking safer alternatives.
[2:21:45.980 --> 2:21:51.980]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report bubble leaking. Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[2:21:51.980 --> 2:22:00.980]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[2:22:00.980 --> 2:22:07.980]  They say you can't predict the stock market. If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.

[2:24:00.980 --> 2:24:15.980]  Steve's agreed to stay with us for much of the hour. We're going to let him go at about 45 after.
[2:24:15.980 --> 2:24:21.980]  I know we have Marine Buddy, Mick, Dave, Tim, and others we're going to get to here in just a moment.
[2:24:21.980 --> 2:24:24.980]  You were finishing up your point, Steve Quayle.
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:31.980]  Well, Alex, the thing is that we are right there in time now where the destruction of everyone in one way or another.
[2:24:31.980 --> 2:24:36.980]  You were talking about the fluoride. Let me tell you the biggest story I kept trying to bring out.
[2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:45.980]  People said, oh, you're full of it. That's their response to anything that would challenge their mental capacities is the excretive pharmaceuticals.
[2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:50.980]  What people don't understand is even the excretive pharmaceuticals, i.e. anybody taking prescription drugs
[2:24:50.980 --> 2:24:54.980]  that go into the water systems that are reprocessed, that go into their bodies.
[2:24:54.980 --> 2:24:59.980]  I mean, these guys and devils have it planned pretty well.
[2:24:59.980 --> 2:25:05.980]  And now the story's coming out that there's too much estrogen in the water that the fish are turning hermaphroditic.
[2:25:05.980 --> 2:25:11.980]  And there's hundreds of different types of plastic, but they choose the two types that they know have estrogen
[2:25:11.980 --> 2:25:16.980]  and feminize the boys and over-feminize the girls and make them get breast cancer.
[2:25:16.980 --> 2:25:19.980]  And they knew and they picked the very plastic.
[2:25:19.980 --> 2:25:22.980]  Right. And the outrage is silent.
[2:25:22.980 --> 2:25:26.980]  Now, obviously, people are getting more aware of it.
[2:25:26.980 --> 2:25:31.980]  And I've been telling people, since I went on talk radio, do not drink any water unless it's filtered.
[2:25:31.980 --> 2:25:34.980]  Do not drink any water unless it's purified.
[2:25:34.980 --> 2:25:37.980]  I'm talking through and not not standard water.
[2:25:37.980 --> 2:25:41.980]  I remember Alex getting people from public water were saying, oh, you're scaring the masses.
[2:25:41.980 --> 2:25:46.980]  No, I'm trying to save their bloody lives while you guys are trying to kill their bloody lives, you know?
[2:25:46.980 --> 2:25:50.980]  Listen, it's time for educated fury.
[2:25:50.980 --> 2:25:55.980]  This whole situation that's going on in the economic realm, listen, the economy is everything.
[2:25:55.980 --> 2:25:58.980]  Jesus said the love of money is a root of all evil.
[2:25:58.980 --> 2:26:03.980]  These guys use money and their money to bring about power, but their power always ends up in one vein.
[2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:05.980]  And you and I both know what that is.
[2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:08.980]  It's the destruction of the middle class.
[2:26:08.980 --> 2:26:14.980]  In other words, we have been, and this is a new war, excuse me, a new war, but also a new word.
[2:26:14.980 --> 2:26:16.980]  We have been horrificated, okay?
[2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:25.980]  In other words, we have been fornicated, horrified by these entities that have sucked the very life out of us,
[2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:29.980]  and now basically when the life has gone, Alex, you go on to the trash heap of history.
[2:26:29.980 --> 2:26:30.980]  That's right.
[2:26:30.980 --> 2:26:39.980]  The public with millions of simulated murders and violence on TV and everything has just been totally conditioned to corruption.
[2:26:39.980 --> 2:26:40.980]  And the video game industry.
[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:42.980]  And have had our consciences seared.
[2:26:42.980 --> 2:26:44.980]  Yeah, and the video game industry.
[2:26:44.980 --> 2:26:49.980]  But notices too, originally video games start out, you know, Pac-Man, then they go up,
[2:26:49.980 --> 2:26:54.980]  and now they're getting into the same area that even they've left the standard field of fire,
[2:26:54.980 --> 2:26:57.980]  meaning armies, wars on terrestrial.
[2:26:57.980 --> 2:27:00.980]  Now we're into interplanetary stuff, but we're also into interdimensional.
[2:27:00.980 --> 2:27:03.980]  We're fighting the ghosts, the goblins, the ghouls.
[2:27:03.980 --> 2:27:09.980]  We're fighting everything that comes up out of the earth or comes on the earth from outer space.
[2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:16.980]  I think the point is now, and you've talked about it, we're now so ripe for a false flag event because of the economy.
[2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:23.980]  And the thing is, is that we're going to see, in my opinion, somebody is going to do something with Iran.
[2:27:23.980 --> 2:27:27.980]  And while I would say this, sir, you should step down.
[2:27:27.980 --> 2:27:28.980]  You're unfit for command.
[2:27:28.980 --> 2:27:39.980]  To underestimate your enemy or to even under, how do I say this, under listen to or not hear what's being said is a tragedy,
[2:27:39.980 --> 2:27:42.980]  and it's a failure of leadership on an unparalleled level.
[2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:45.980]  So I would have to say to that man, are you nuts?
[2:27:45.980 --> 2:27:50.980]  Are you basically, are you taking a little bit of wacky tabacky to make it through the day?
[2:27:50.980 --> 2:27:53.980]  Something's wrong, Alex. We are being totally encircled.
[2:27:53.980 --> 2:28:00.980]  Now, again, Steve Quayle is our guest. The United States had criminal forces within it, orchestrate and carry out the 9-11 attacks.
[2:28:00.980 --> 2:28:08.980]  Then that was meant to come out, but only, as I said, day one on the day of the event, seven years ago, to be blamed on the U.S. government.
[2:28:08.980 --> 2:28:14.980]  Then the United States orchestrates a sneak attack on Russian territory, so internationally we're even seen as more criminal.
[2:28:14.980 --> 2:28:22.980]  The CIA releases the torture photos and videos, admittedly to CBS, to further demonize the United States.
[2:28:22.980 --> 2:28:30.980]  The engineered collapse of the country is now being carried out, and our name is being collapsed,
[2:28:30.980 --> 2:28:36.980]  so that when we are fully brought down into a depression, release bioweapons, atomic attack, whatever it may be,
[2:28:36.980 --> 2:28:43.980]  then everybody says we deserve that. You can see this, the New World Order are masters of betrayal,
[2:28:43.980 --> 2:28:49.980]  and they move from nation to nation, betraying those nations, they always betray their host nation as well.
[2:28:49.980 --> 2:28:56.980]  Betrayal is a sacrament for them. For folks watching in PrisonPlanet.tv, I decided to go ahead and go live.
[2:28:56.980 --> 2:29:00.980]  This interview was so important. We're an hour plus into it with Steve Quayle.
[2:29:00.980 --> 2:29:06.980]  He'll be with us all the rest of the hour. He said he'd do it, and we'll take your phone calls when we get back.
[2:29:06.980 --> 2:29:13.980]  In fact, for infowargs.com, stream listeners, I'm going to skip this break right now,
[2:29:13.980 --> 2:29:18.980]  and we will come back for everybody else on the other side with Steve Quayle. Stay with us.
[2:29:18.980 --> 2:29:23.980]  Steve, I don't want to waste any of this time. We're going to come back in three minutes to the full AM and FM
[2:29:23.980 --> 2:29:28.980]  shortwave audience, but right now we're on the Internet with tens of thousands listening and watching.
[2:29:28.980 --> 2:29:35.980]  So let's continue with the setup of America. Everything to position us, use our treasure, use our currency,
[2:29:35.980 --> 2:29:40.980]  use our inventions, use our labor to build the world government. They wrap it in American flag domestically,
[2:29:40.980 --> 2:29:45.980]  so we went along with it. Now we're at the point where we're being sucked dry. Now the betrayal.
[2:29:45.980 --> 2:29:51.980]  Well, the betrayal, and it's interesting because you can't use the word betrayal without including the word treachery.
[2:29:51.980 --> 2:29:56.980]  And I remember Alex and interviewing some of the Russian spies I talked to. They used to say to me,
[2:29:56.980 --> 2:30:01.980]  and I'm not making fun. I mean, one of them said, oh, Steve, we had everybody on our payroll,
[2:30:01.980 --> 2:30:06.980]  and the guy literally talked like that. And I said, what did you mean by that? And he said, simple.
[2:30:06.980 --> 2:30:12.980]  He said, what was amazing to us is how cheap we could buy your leaders. Now, Alex, that pissed me off.
[2:30:12.980 --> 2:30:21.980]  Okay, sorry for the word, but it did. And I said to this gentleman, I said, are you absolutely pulling my leg
[2:30:21.980 --> 2:30:26.980]  or was it that cheap? And he said, oh, no. He says, and of course, when we can't buy, we blackmail.
[2:30:26.980 --> 2:30:33.980]  What most people don't understand is that in this world of aluminumism, when someone is even thought
[2:30:33.980 --> 2:30:39.980]  maybe to toe the line, they'll be blackmailed, they'll be compromised, whatever, they'll be photographed, whatever.
[2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:45.980]  And that's why you see such strange behavior. One minute, someone's saying, oh, I'm calling for an inquest
[2:30:45.980 --> 2:30:50.980]  in this next minute. Well, everything's fine. The point is, whom they can't blackmail and bribe, they kill.
[2:30:50.980 --> 2:30:55.980]  And that's the same story that we're dealing with daily. Now, here's where we're at, in my opinion.
[2:30:55.980 --> 2:31:02.980]  And we are no longer at, Alex, we're not warning about what's coming. Everything you and I have warned about is here.
[2:31:02.980 --> 2:31:06.980]  Everything you and Warren and I have warned about is being implemented.
[2:31:06.980 --> 2:31:13.980]  And it's only going to get more intense from here before, you know, before the tyranny would go up and down,
[2:31:13.980 --> 2:31:17.980]  you know, back and forth. Now it's just an escalation.
[2:31:17.980 --> 2:31:24.980]  Well, absolutely. Can I say this? It's going to go up and down. And what's really hard for people to understand
[2:31:24.980 --> 2:31:31.980]  is there are factions in the Illuminati. There are some incredibly brave men and women fighting this stuff.
[2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:36.980]  But then you get into the supernatural realm and there comes a point where if a nation says to God,
[2:31:36.980 --> 2:31:41.980]  leave us alone, God says, I'll leave you alone and I'll take my hand of protection away.
[2:31:41.980 --> 2:31:47.980]  And that's where I believe we are in the United States of America. I am so worried and I mean this.
[2:31:47.980 --> 2:31:54.980]  Look, the bottom line is you don't do talk radio for 15 years and not learn a few things.
[2:31:54.980 --> 2:32:01.980]  What I'm really, really troubled by is the continual denial, even people listening to your show.
[2:32:01.980 --> 2:32:07.980]  My show, our shows, what more information can you, Alex Jones, give them?
[2:32:07.980 --> 2:32:10.980]  What more information can I give them, like we're talking off the air?
[2:32:10.980 --> 2:32:14.980]  It's one thing to have a thousand, five thousand, ten thousand, but you know,
[2:32:14.980 --> 2:32:18.980]  the Congress should be inundated with millions of people saying stop the bailout.
[2:32:18.980 --> 2:32:21.980]  It's not helping the American people. It's putting the taxpayer...
[2:32:21.980 --> 2:32:25.980]  It's putting a millstone around our neck. Here we go. We're going back into the full audience right now
[2:32:25.980 --> 2:32:27.980]  with Steve Quayle going to the phone calls.
[2:32:34.980 --> 2:32:40.980]  Maureen in Virginia, you're on the air with Steve Quayle. Thank you for holding welcome.
[2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:44.980]  Hi, it's an honor to be able to talk to either or both of you.
[2:32:44.980 --> 2:32:51.980]  Steve, I only heard your show three times in my life each time you had Mike McQuitty on.
[2:32:51.980 --> 2:32:57.980]  Please tell the people what Mike McQuitty said about God setting up cities of refuge.
[2:32:57.980 --> 2:33:02.980]  And I know for a fact this is happening because he called me away from my house
[2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:04.980]  to another area to do the same thing.
[2:33:04.980 --> 2:33:08.980]  Well, first of all, I think that's really an important, timely point.
[2:33:08.980 --> 2:33:14.980]  God never, never does anything except He doesn't reveal it to the people that are going to be judged.
[2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:19.980]  He also provides a place of escape throughout the land, Alex, and what the caller is talking about.
[2:33:19.980 --> 2:33:24.980]  People have been spoken to in dreams and visions, in prayer,
[2:33:24.980 --> 2:33:27.980]  to prepare for an onslaught of God's children.
[2:33:27.980 --> 2:33:30.980]  People are going to be running from the cities for their very lives.
[2:33:30.980 --> 2:33:34.980]  And I believe that my ministry as a watchman is over,
[2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:43.980]  but I believe my ministry as someone who's going to be taking care of a lot of the fleeing, frightened flock is just beginning.
[2:33:43.980 --> 2:33:47.980]  So I would just tell the caller that, Mike, and God bless him.
[2:33:47.980 --> 2:33:49.980]  Do you remember two of the statements he made?
[2:33:49.980 --> 2:33:53.980]  He said, once the bleeding in America starts, it won't stop.
[2:33:53.980 --> 2:33:58.980]  And, you know, I live with that statement in my mind almost every day with no exaggeration.
[2:33:58.980 --> 2:34:01.980]  Once the bleeding starts, in other words, Alex, once all the killing starts
[2:34:01.980 --> 2:34:04.980]  and all the revolutionary things, it's going to go on and on.
[2:34:04.980 --> 2:34:09.980]  Yeah, once the veneer of civilization peels away, once the shooting starts,
[2:34:09.980 --> 2:34:13.980]  once the implosion starts, it won't be just New Orleans.
[2:34:13.980 --> 2:34:15.980]  The whole country could become like New Orleans.
[2:34:15.980 --> 2:34:18.980]  Absolutely, and I would tell seriously when somebody says,
[2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:20.980]  what's the most important thing to do to survive?
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:22.980]  I say, are you worried about this life or the next?
[2:34:22.980 --> 2:34:24.980]  Because both are an issue.
[2:34:24.980 --> 2:34:27.980]  It doesn't do any good to rail against the New World Order just to go to hell.
[2:34:27.980 --> 2:34:31.980]  And, you know, that's a funny thing because I've talked to literally special forces guys
[2:34:31.980 --> 2:34:35.980]  that go into the bowels of the earth and everything that people have seen or read
[2:34:35.980 --> 2:34:39.980]  in Dante's Inferno or, you know, any of the Hollywood projections.
[2:34:39.980 --> 2:34:44.980]  I asked one special operations guy, probably one of the bravest men in the world.
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:46.980]  I mean, I don't know how you could be braver.
[2:34:46.980 --> 2:34:50.980]  I said, so explain to me what you encounter when you go and deal with the stuff underground.
[2:34:50.980 --> 2:34:53.980]  He said, have you ever seen the movie The Cave or Descent?
[2:34:53.980 --> 2:34:56.980]  I said, no, I have now, but I haven't at the time.
[2:34:56.980 --> 2:35:01.980]  He said, go look at those two movies, The Cave and the Descent, and then multiply it by a thousand.
[2:35:01.980 --> 2:35:04.980]  And I said, boy, my brother, and I said, you guys are on a different planet.
[2:35:04.980 --> 2:35:08.980]  You, your bravery and your love for the Lord is so exemplary.
[2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:10.980]  I mean, it blew me away, Alex.
[2:35:10.980 --> 2:35:12.980]  So this is pretty wild stuff.
[2:35:12.980 --> 2:35:14.980]  Maureen, thank you for the call.
[2:35:14.980 --> 2:35:15.980]  I'll stop.
[2:35:15.980 --> 2:35:16.980]  Okay.
[2:35:16.980 --> 2:35:17.980]  We're going to go and order the callers here.
[2:35:17.980 --> 2:35:19.980]  Buddy in Ohio, you're on the year, buddy.
[2:35:19.980 --> 2:35:20.980]  Go ahead.
[2:35:20.980 --> 2:35:24.980]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to say I appreciate everything you're doing, man.
[2:35:24.980 --> 2:35:26.980]  I just got a couple of quick questions.
[2:35:26.980 --> 2:35:29.980]  I was just wondering, me and my next door neighbor were talking the other day,
[2:35:29.980 --> 2:35:32.980]  and we were just wondering all this whole golden situation,
[2:35:32.980 --> 2:35:35.980]  if there's still any gold in Fort Knox or...
[2:35:35.980 --> 2:35:38.980]  No, they haven't had an audit in that in what, more than 40 years,
[2:35:38.980 --> 2:35:43.980]  and the gold reserves have been basically handed over to the private banks looted long ago.
[2:35:43.980 --> 2:35:45.980]  Steve Quayle, you want to answer that question?
[2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:46.980]  You nailed it, Alex.
[2:35:46.980 --> 2:35:49.980]  There is no gold in Fort Knox.
[2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:54.980]  It's been loaned out in the gold-loaning program, especially during the Clinton years,
[2:35:54.980 --> 2:35:58.980]  followed up by every president that basically came on.
[2:35:58.980 --> 2:36:00.980]  They looted the gold.
[2:36:00.980 --> 2:36:03.980]  The point is that it was given to central banks, loaned to banks,
[2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:05.980]  and then the banks sold the gold.
[2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:08.980]  That was re-loaned to the people they sold it to and on and on and on.
[2:36:08.980 --> 2:36:11.980]  What's going to be interesting though, the colonies know this,
[2:36:11.980 --> 2:36:15.980]  China, with its 20,000 reported tons of gold,
[2:36:15.980 --> 2:36:19.980]  and Russia, with its close to trillion dollars worth of gold,
[2:36:19.980 --> 2:36:25.980]  is talking there, talking amongst themselves about forming their own Asian currency.
[2:36:25.980 --> 2:36:29.980]  If they did that, the US dollar would be dead upon their announcement of it.
[2:36:29.980 --> 2:36:32.980]  I believe that was a direct threat to the monetary authorities.
[2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:37.980]  Well, they've been saying the last few weeks that they may create a regional currency over there
[2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:40.980]  and absolutely backed by oil and gold,
[2:36:40.980 --> 2:36:43.980]  and China already holds most of the debt here,
[2:36:43.980 --> 2:36:46.980]  the largest portion, a portion of that,
[2:36:46.980 --> 2:36:50.980]  so certainly that is just unprecedented changes are coming.
[2:36:50.980 --> 2:36:54.980]  I would think that the Pentagon should have a financial battalion
[2:36:54.980 --> 2:36:57.980]  because basically, you know, they own everything,
[2:36:57.980 --> 2:37:01.980]  and I think they're now taking a look at buying a major portion
[2:37:01.980 --> 2:37:03.980]  in gold and sacks or something.
[2:37:03.980 --> 2:37:05.980]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:37:05.980 --> 2:37:07.980]  Anything else, buddy?
[2:37:07.980 --> 2:37:10.980]  Yes, I was just wondering, is there any other like information,
[2:37:10.980 --> 2:37:13.980]  any new information on the Barry Jennings thing?
[2:37:13.980 --> 2:37:17.980]  No, Barry Jennings, who reported bombs going off and dead bodies,
[2:37:17.980 --> 2:37:21.980]  a deputy emergency manager there in New York and Building 7,
[2:37:21.980 --> 2:37:24.980]  died, that is confirmed by his boss, by the spokesman.
[2:37:24.980 --> 2:37:27.980]  We put their names in the articles we put out,
[2:37:27.980 --> 2:37:29.980]  and people still don't believe it,
[2:37:29.980 --> 2:37:32.980]  but the family will not say why he died,
[2:37:32.980 --> 2:37:34.980]  and there's no obituary or no report of it,
[2:37:34.980 --> 2:37:36.980]  and we're trying to investigate it.
[2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:39.980]  Thank you so much. Appreciate your call.
[2:37:39.980 --> 2:37:45.980]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mick and PA for Steve Quayle.
[2:37:45.980 --> 2:37:46.980]  Go ahead, Mick.
[2:37:46.980 --> 2:37:50.980]  Oh, first of all, I'd like Mr. Jones and Mr. Quayle.
[2:37:50.980 --> 2:37:55.980]  I view you two as gifts from God to his people,
[2:37:55.980 --> 2:38:00.980]  and don't think there aren't millions out here who feel the same way.
[2:38:00.980 --> 2:38:05.980]  I would like to ask you, I'm sure you must have researched this at one time,
[2:38:05.980 --> 2:38:09.980]  but since God is so much more powerful than Satan,
[2:38:09.980 --> 2:38:13.980]  and Revelation says our battle is against the principalities and powers,
[2:38:13.980 --> 2:38:15.980]  not the flesh,
[2:38:15.980 --> 2:38:21.980]  it might not be a good idea if all your listeners,
[2:38:21.980 --> 2:38:23.980]  before and after your program,
[2:38:23.980 --> 2:38:26.980]  is one unified voice up to God,
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:30.980]  pray for the forces of good and against the forces of evil.
[2:38:30.980 --> 2:38:33.980]  I agree, but can we pray for America?
[2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:35.980]  Hold on one second.
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:39.980]  Can we pray for America that's aborted more than 50 million babies?
[2:38:39.980 --> 2:38:41.980]  That's the larger question,
[2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:44.980]  or does this country and this world and all this decadence,
[2:38:44.980 --> 2:38:49.980]  and people buying five million dollar buckets of maggots,
[2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:51.980]  literally from art displays,
[2:38:51.980 --> 2:38:54.980]  does that need to be protected as well,
[2:38:54.980 --> 2:38:57.980]  or do we just pray for the good people?
[2:38:57.980 --> 2:38:59.980]  Steve Quayle comments on that.
[2:38:59.980 --> 2:39:01.980]  I want to share this with you.
[2:39:01.980 --> 2:39:03.980]  Alex, you have them that pray for you,
[2:39:03.980 --> 2:39:05.980]  and I have them that pray for me.
[2:39:05.980 --> 2:39:07.980]  I can tell you this,
[2:39:07.980 --> 2:39:09.980]  I specifically, in a time of prayer,
[2:39:09.980 --> 2:39:13.980]  the Lord said you cannot stop my judgment upon the country, Steve,
[2:39:13.980 --> 2:39:16.980]  but pray for those who have hearing ears,
[2:39:16.980 --> 2:39:19.980]  and seeing eyes to see and to repent and come to me.
[2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:21.980]  Alex, I don't believe it.
[2:39:21.980 --> 2:39:24.980]  I believe that there is a time when God gives space to repent,
[2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:26.980]  and when that space is up and the time is up,
[2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:28.980]  people want, you nailed it, Alex.
[2:39:28.980 --> 2:39:33.980]  You can't ask God to bless evil and to keep wickedness going.
[2:39:33.980 --> 2:39:35.980]  You cannot, it's unfathomable,
[2:39:35.980 --> 2:39:37.980]  but most people have got to understand
[2:39:37.980 --> 2:39:40.980]  that they need to, first of all, get right with Jesus.
[2:39:40.980 --> 2:39:42.980]  Repentance is an individual thing, first and foremost,
[2:39:42.980 --> 2:39:44.980]  and then they go to their family level,
[2:39:44.980 --> 2:39:47.980]  and they work out, but you can't stop what's going to happen.
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:49.980]  And I get accused, you'll love this, Alex.
[2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:51.980]  I get accused of trying to stop all this.
[2:39:51.980 --> 2:39:55.980]  I said, no, I'm just trying to buy time for as many people to come
[2:39:55.980 --> 2:39:57.980]  to the saving knowledge of Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:39:57.980 --> 2:40:00.980]  get right with God, and get their family out of harm's way.
[2:40:00.980 --> 2:40:02.980]  It's amazing that our critics must love death
[2:40:02.980 --> 2:40:06.980]  because all we're trying to do, Alex, is save people's lives.
[2:40:06.980 --> 2:40:09.980]  Well, you know, there's a lot of people who also cop out.
[2:40:09.980 --> 2:40:10.980]  Right.
[2:40:10.980 --> 2:40:12.980]  And then there's a lot of fake Christians
[2:40:12.980 --> 2:40:14.980]  in these big $50 million churches with helicopter pads
[2:40:14.980 --> 2:40:18.980]  and swimming pools and shopping malls and thumb scanners
[2:40:18.980 --> 2:40:20.980]  to get into the church.
[2:40:20.980 --> 2:40:22.980]  They're all running around saying,
[2:40:22.980 --> 2:40:24.980]  oh, no, we're not supposed to fight evil.
[2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:26.980]  We're not supposed to warn anybody.
[2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:27.980]  I think it's great.
[2:40:27.980 --> 2:40:28.980]  George Bush is of the Lord.
[2:40:28.980 --> 2:40:29.980]  He'll save us.
[2:40:29.980 --> 2:40:30.980]  Sarah Palin will save us.
[2:40:30.980 --> 2:40:32.980]  You know, there's that delusional church lady
[2:40:32.980 --> 2:40:34.980]  with the diamonds all over.
[2:40:34.980 --> 2:40:37.980]  And, you know, they're not outwarning anybody.
[2:40:37.980 --> 2:40:39.980]  They're not outfighting the abortion clinics.
[2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:42.980]  And the world sees those fake Christians.
[2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:45.980]  And then that is a bad testament against it.
[2:40:45.980 --> 2:40:47.980]  And of course, none of that's by mistake.
[2:40:47.980 --> 2:40:48.980]  No.
[2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:51.980]  And then the deal is that Jesus, that God says his name
[2:40:51.980 --> 2:40:53.980]  is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles
[2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:55.980]  through the people that supposedly believe in him.
[2:40:55.980 --> 2:40:58.980]  But that doesn't dismiss the fact that he's holy.
[2:40:58.980 --> 2:40:59.980]  He's faithful.
[2:40:59.980 --> 2:41:00.980]  He's righteous.
[2:41:00.980 --> 2:41:01.980]  He's just.
[2:41:01.980 --> 2:41:03.980]  And he's given us space to repent.
[2:41:03.980 --> 2:41:05.980]  Now, I want to say something about those churches, Alex.
[2:41:05.980 --> 2:41:08.980]  Those pastors, so many of those pastors,
[2:41:08.980 --> 2:41:10.980]  it will not surprise me that they will drop dead
[2:41:10.980 --> 2:41:13.980]  in their pulpits literally when the fence comes
[2:41:13.980 --> 2:41:15.980]  upon this earth that are coming.
[2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:17.980]  It will not surprise me when people go up to the pastor
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:20.980]  and scream, maybe even drag someone from behind the pulpits
[2:41:20.980 --> 2:41:22.980]  and say, why did you lie to us?
[2:41:22.980 --> 2:41:25.980]  The whole world is seduced, okay?
[2:41:25.980 --> 2:41:28.980]  The whole world is under this power of seduction.
[2:41:28.980 --> 2:41:31.980]  And it's the continual prompting and warning
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:33.980]  of the watchman, like yourself.
[2:41:33.980 --> 2:41:35.980]  Everybody who's doing it, and I think we're the only two,
[2:41:35.980 --> 2:41:38.980]  I'm just saying, we're doing it and others who are doing it.
[2:41:38.980 --> 2:41:40.980]  The bottom line is to make people think,
[2:41:40.980 --> 2:41:42.980]  look, how can you ask God?
[2:41:42.980 --> 2:41:46.980]  I go nuts when I see God bless America, okay?
[2:41:46.980 --> 2:41:50.980]  I say to people, you should put us to the God bless America.
[2:41:50.980 --> 2:41:52.980]  God grant America repentance,
[2:41:52.980 --> 2:41:55.980]  because without repentance, there could be no turning to the Lord.
[2:41:55.980 --> 2:41:57.980]  Without any turning to the Lord, there could be no restoration.
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:42:00.980]  And I am so sick of this, and boy, now you got me going.
[2:42:00.980 --> 2:42:05.980]  I am so sick of how dare anybody claim to be a man of the cloth,
[2:42:05.980 --> 2:42:08.980]  maybe some cloth, but certainly not a holy cloth,
[2:42:08.980 --> 2:42:12.980]  and have a $50 million church and still have homeless people,
[2:42:12.980 --> 2:42:17.980]  still have people that are absolutely languishing in the ghettos.
[2:42:17.980 --> 2:42:21.980]  I mean, look, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, and you're right.
[2:42:21.980 --> 2:42:25.980]  What the world sees a biblical Christianity by design, okay?
[2:42:25.980 --> 2:42:30.980]  Our contemporary Christianity is no way and anyway related to biblical Christianity.
[2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:32.980]  So what they're doing, the Illuminati,
[2:42:32.980 --> 2:42:34.980]  is getting people to blame the Christians.
[2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:37.980]  You just made the analogy, neuro-linguistic programming.
[2:42:37.980 --> 2:42:40.980]  George Bush is a Christian, so he claims no he isn't.
[2:42:40.980 --> 2:42:42.980]  He's no longer talking about Jesus.
[2:42:42.980 --> 2:42:44.980]  Jesus said, if you don't confess me before a man,
[2:42:44.980 --> 2:42:47.980]  I won't confess you before my father, which is in heaven.
[2:42:47.980 --> 2:42:52.980]  The church ladies with the lipstick and the diamond rings and all that stuff,
[2:42:52.980 --> 2:42:53.980]  it's irrelevant.
[2:42:53.980 --> 2:42:57.980]  But what is relevant is that the world sees somebody who's starting more,
[2:42:57.980 --> 2:43:03.980]  who's doing all these things, and it's the perfect, perfect introduction of the destruction.
[2:43:03.980 --> 2:43:04.980]  Absolutely.
[2:43:04.980 --> 2:43:06.980]  Let's talk to Mick.
[2:43:06.980 --> 2:43:08.980]  Mick, anything else I interrupted you there?
[2:43:08.980 --> 2:43:14.980]  Yeah, on the earthly level, they've corrupted our government, obviously, with money.
[2:43:14.980 --> 2:43:19.980]  They've got some may hold over the head of all these corrupt congressmen,
[2:43:19.980 --> 2:43:24.980]  and I'm sure many congressmen don't even want to go along with this,
[2:43:24.980 --> 2:43:28.980]  but they feel like they have to, or they'll be toppled by the media
[2:43:28.980 --> 2:43:30.980]  and the forces of evil behind the media.
[2:43:30.980 --> 2:43:37.980]  What do you think is the idea if congressmen could somehow engineer a short period of atonement,
[2:43:37.980 --> 2:43:39.980]  where all congressmen...
[2:43:39.980 --> 2:43:45.980]  The problem is, you just said it, the leadership, the leadership is totally bought and paid for,
[2:43:45.980 --> 2:43:48.980]  and they control what congress does.
[2:43:48.980 --> 2:43:52.980]  But if there was a period of atonement, like 30, 60, 90 days,
[2:43:52.980 --> 2:43:54.980]  where you could make Congress say to Congress,
[2:43:54.980 --> 2:43:59.980]  okay, whatever your sins are in the past, come up, confess them, you're forgiven,
[2:43:59.980 --> 2:44:01.980]  and then get to the forces behind them.
[2:44:01.980 --> 2:44:04.980]  Yeah, but the corporate media wouldn't allow that.
[2:44:04.980 --> 2:44:08.980]  They're not going to stop the demonization. I appreciate your call.
[2:44:08.980 --> 2:44:12.980]  But I do agree, when some congressman's been doing good stuff and fighting the New World Order,
[2:44:12.980 --> 2:44:17.980]  there's not many of them, and then they take something and magnify it, make a crooked toenail a big deal,
[2:44:17.980 --> 2:44:19.980]  people should reject that.
[2:44:19.980 --> 2:44:24.980]  Well, they should, and look at Alex, all of our efforts to back and support Ron Paul and stuff,
[2:44:24.980 --> 2:44:29.980]  but the bottom line is, with all our efforts, still it was the mediation,
[2:44:29.980 --> 2:44:34.980]  that's the media and vilification combined. The mediation of Ron Paul,
[2:44:34.980 --> 2:44:37.980]  they absolutely made him persona non grata.
[2:44:37.980 --> 2:44:41.980]  And you know, still, in view of everybody who's panicked over the money,
[2:44:41.980 --> 2:44:45.980]  he's the only bloody guy running that understands a problem.
[2:44:45.980 --> 2:44:48.980]  Nobody understands a problem better than Ron Paul.
[2:44:48.980 --> 2:44:53.980]  Absolutely. Let's go ahead and take another call. Thank you, Mick.
[2:44:53.980 --> 2:44:58.980]  Dave in Colorado, you're on the air.
[2:44:58.980 --> 2:45:02.980]  I said, thank you for taking a second.
[2:45:02.980 --> 2:45:06.980]  Yeah, your phone's got a problem there. We're going to have to let you go in a moment.
[2:45:06.980 --> 2:45:09.980]  If you can't get that straightened out there, Dave, anything else, Dave?
[2:45:09.980 --> 2:45:10.980]  Can you hear me?
[2:45:10.980 --> 2:45:12.980]  Yes, I can. Go ahead, Dave, you're on air.
[2:45:12.980 --> 2:45:17.980]  Okay. Do you know you, Chris Mullins, have you ever heard of him?
[2:45:17.980 --> 2:45:24.980]  Yes, I've interviewed you, Chris Mullins. He wrote, I believe, Secrets of the Federal Reserve about 40, 50 years ago.
[2:45:24.980 --> 2:45:29.980]  And he's very elderly now.
[2:45:29.980 --> 2:45:36.980]  Yeah, he was in an assisted living home, and he was kidnapped.
[2:45:36.980 --> 2:45:42.980]  And I heard Jack McClam talking about it the other night,
[2:45:42.980 --> 2:45:49.980]  and a witness had seen the person who took him out of the home.
[2:45:49.980 --> 2:45:56.980]  They said he looked like a healer who just walked out of the Ozarks.
[2:45:56.980 --> 2:45:57.980]  I don't understand.
[2:45:57.980 --> 2:45:59.980]  Yeah, I don't know about that either, Alex.
[2:45:59.980 --> 2:46:04.980]  Yeah, I'll have to call him. And it's also hard to talk to listeners when their radios are jacked up in the background.
[2:46:04.980 --> 2:46:07.980]  I don't mean to be mean, but I can barely understand what you're saying,
[2:46:07.980 --> 2:46:09.980]  because you've got the radio turned up, listeners.
[2:46:09.980 --> 2:46:15.980]  And once you're on the show, whether you can't really talk and listen to it,
[2:46:15.980 --> 2:46:19.980]  I know that he's been in and out of nursing homes and in health problems.
[2:46:19.980 --> 2:46:21.980]  Last time we interviewed him was about two years ago.
[2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:23.980]  And I know folks are having trouble getting in touch with him.
[2:46:23.980 --> 2:46:24.980]  I'll call Jack McClam.
[2:46:24.980 --> 2:46:28.980]  In fact, before I forget what you go tell, try to call Jack McClam with the bottom of it.
[2:46:28.980 --> 2:46:31.980]  We need to get Jack McClam on anyways, all this police state stuff happening.
[2:46:31.980 --> 2:46:33.980]  So let's get Jack McClam on.
[2:46:33.980 --> 2:46:35.980]  That's a good reminder to have him on.
[2:46:35.980 --> 2:46:37.980]  But we'll try to look into that.
[2:46:37.980 --> 2:46:39.980]  Thank you for the heads up, Dave.
[2:46:39.980 --> 2:46:42.980]  Tim and Georgia, you're on the air with Steve Coyle. Go ahead, Tim.
[2:46:42.980 --> 2:46:50.980]  Hey, Alex, you looked at the text of the bill before Congress, I guess, the bailout bill.
[2:46:50.980 --> 2:46:53.980]  Yes, I've scanned over it and seen the analysis of it.
[2:46:53.980 --> 2:46:57.980]  And it basically says they'll fund any foreign banks, loot whoever they want.
[2:46:57.980 --> 2:47:04.980]  It gives total anonymity and liability protection, a pardon to all the criminals that have done it, to Paulson.
[2:47:04.980 --> 2:47:08.980]  Listen to this, this is Section 8, word for word.
[2:47:08.980 --> 2:47:15.980]  The decisions by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion
[2:47:15.980 --> 2:47:20.980]  and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.
[2:47:20.980 --> 2:47:21.980]  That's the text of it.
[2:47:21.980 --> 2:47:28.980]  Yeah, they're giving themselves total liability protection to Robb and Steele
[2:47:28.980 --> 2:47:32.980]  and do whatever they want and Congress is signing over its authority.
[2:47:32.980 --> 2:47:39.980]  It's a martial law declaration because the Treasury and the Federal Reserve literally dominates the entire government
[2:47:39.980 --> 2:47:42.980]  and they're just admitting that in the mainstream news.
[2:47:42.980 --> 2:47:43.980]  That has been reported.
[2:47:43.980 --> 2:47:49.980]  Bloomberg says the president is now a dictator under that and Congress has not passed that yet.
[2:47:49.980 --> 2:47:52.980]  We need to story ourselves on infowars.com or prison plan.
[2:47:52.980 --> 2:47:55.980]  I know I've curtain to go in today. We need one about this.
[2:47:55.980 --> 2:47:58.980]  I've got it here, but give folks the subsection again.
[2:47:58.980 --> 2:48:01.980]  Is that the House or the Senate version?
[2:48:01.980 --> 2:48:04.980]  I don't know which one. I have to scroll up and look.
[2:48:04.980 --> 2:48:06.980]  Well, that'll matter because those will change.
[2:48:06.980 --> 2:48:09.980]  There's been several different packages.
[2:48:09.980 --> 2:48:13.980]  This is the one that was sent to Congress late yesterday.
[2:48:13.980 --> 2:48:15.980]  Yeah, Sunday was written up in secret.
[2:48:15.980 --> 2:48:19.980]  Do you have the bill number?
[2:48:19.980 --> 2:48:23.980]  I've got it in articles. I can dig it out, but if you've got it, it really helped.
[2:48:23.980 --> 2:48:26.980]  The bill number. No, it's not listed there.
[2:48:26.980 --> 2:48:32.980]  It says legislative proposal for Treasury authority to purchase mortgage-related assets.
[2:48:32.980 --> 2:48:35.980]  Yeah, that would be the one they're wanting Congress to introduce,
[2:48:35.980 --> 2:48:37.980]  but you're going to find congressmen have introduced that.
[2:48:37.980 --> 2:48:44.980]  We need to find the copy of who's introduced it and then what section is that?
[2:48:44.980 --> 2:48:47.980]  No, no, you read the section. You read it.
[2:48:47.980 --> 2:48:49.980]  I think it's section eight.
[2:48:49.980 --> 2:48:53.980]  Can you do that for me? Can you just look at it and tell me the section?
[2:48:53.980 --> 2:48:54.980]  Yes, it's section eight.
[2:48:54.980 --> 2:48:56.980]  Okay, thank you. I appreciate your call.
[2:48:56.980 --> 2:49:00.980]  That's in the news that they're doing that, so that's all been announced.
[2:49:00.980 --> 2:49:02.980]  Steve, just write out in the open.
[2:49:02.980 --> 2:49:04.980]  It's insane what you just announced.
[2:49:04.980 --> 2:49:12.980]  It's a dictatorial takeover of all the finances of the country and there is no oversight.
[2:49:12.980 --> 2:49:17.980]  There is no accountability. This is absolutely the end.
[2:49:17.980 --> 2:49:21.980]  We should play the doors the end at this point because if people don't understand,
[2:49:21.980 --> 2:49:25.980]  this is a power play and if you wanted to engineer a power play,
[2:49:25.980 --> 2:49:28.980]  you'd put a set of circumstances, would you not?
[2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:31.980]  That's right. You issue the credit, you wrote the people in, you tell them to it,
[2:49:31.980 --> 2:49:34.980]  you make them think that it's their fault, you tie them in,
[2:49:34.980 --> 2:49:38.980]  then you give all these private banks absolute dictatorial control over the nation
[2:49:38.980 --> 2:49:43.980]  to steal, to do whatever they want in any way and give them total liability,
[2:49:43.980 --> 2:49:47.980]  protection from any criminal or civil prosecution.
[2:49:47.980 --> 2:49:50.980]  They've committed all these crimes, they've told you on the news,
[2:49:50.980 --> 2:49:54.980]  everybody's going to be investigated because this is all engineered and by design.
[2:49:54.980 --> 2:49:56.980]  In fact, queue up, this is the end.
[2:49:56.980 --> 2:50:01.980]  We're going to skip this break as well for M4Wars.com listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers,
[2:50:01.980 --> 2:50:04.980]  but if everybody else will be back in three minutes, great point.
[2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:09.980]  That's in the news and now such earth-shattering things are happening every day.
[2:50:09.980 --> 2:50:13.980]  I'm just like, oh yeah, they have liability protection and no one can challenge them
[2:50:13.980 --> 2:50:15.980]  and Congress is signing over its authority.
[2:50:15.980 --> 2:50:19.980]  That's admitted to be in there and the caller did the research and called in with the section.
[2:50:19.980 --> 2:50:24.980]  I mean, that's how used to corruption we've gotten to where we just now pretty much just accepted.
[2:50:24.980 --> 2:50:28.980]  Here we go with Steve Cuell.
[2:50:28.980 --> 2:50:29.980]  Every week.
[2:50:29.980 --> 2:50:33.980]  You know, Steve, that's a key point is that we've just gotten to the point now where,
[2:50:33.980 --> 2:50:36.980]  you know, that's been in the news since last Saturday, then Sunday,
[2:50:36.980 --> 2:50:40.980]  that they're going to give themselves total liability protection from all their crimes
[2:50:40.980 --> 2:50:45.980]  and then I don't even hardly mention it on air because I'm so punch-drunk from the corruption
[2:50:45.980 --> 2:50:50.980]  where we just live with it so much in the know that now everything we've said is coming true
[2:50:50.980 --> 2:50:53.980]  and we're not even tuning our own horns saying, look, we were right.
[2:50:53.980 --> 2:50:56.980]  We're just kind of like, you know, because it's one thing to know it's coming.
[2:50:56.980 --> 2:50:59.980]  It's another thing to see it.
[2:50:59.980 --> 2:51:00.980]  Steve, your comments.
[2:51:00.980 --> 2:51:02.980]  It's being implemented, Alex.
[2:51:02.980 --> 2:51:05.980]  I mean, this is the end of all financial freedom.
[2:51:05.980 --> 2:51:11.980]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, now under the same law or under the same bill or a previous bill,
[2:51:11.980 --> 2:51:15.980]  every single credit card purchase is going to be made available to the IRS.
[2:51:15.980 --> 2:51:19.980]  Every single eBay purchase is going to be made available to the IRS,
[2:51:19.980 --> 2:51:21.980]  both sales and purchases.
[2:51:21.980 --> 2:51:26.980]  Every single thing, this one of the secret weapons that Woodward was talking about, Alex,
[2:51:26.980 --> 2:51:31.980]  is they have the ability now with a specific thermal sensing program
[2:51:31.980 --> 2:51:38.980]  to tell your thermal image from my thermal image in, let's say, a stadium filled with 50,000 people
[2:51:38.980 --> 2:51:42.980]  and that's one of the things that's already been inferred by the Woodward comment.
[2:51:42.980 --> 2:51:47.980]  And that was told to me by William Colby's former bodyguard,
[2:51:47.980 --> 2:51:50.980]  a guy that wrote the book The Secret Man, Frank Dukes, who they wrote.
[2:51:50.980 --> 2:51:54.980]  No, no, I remember you years ago saying that they have thermal imaging biometrics
[2:51:54.980 --> 2:51:58.980]  where they can kill somebody out of a crowd and now they have satellites
[2:51:58.980 --> 2:52:04.980]  that can tell your biometric shadow integrated with your walk, your gate in a crowd
[2:52:04.980 --> 2:52:06.980]  so they can target you and kill you.
[2:52:06.980 --> 2:52:10.980]  Absolutely. And see, the point, all that stuff is good,
[2:52:10.980 --> 2:52:14.980]  but everything that they have, it should be followed up with a statement
[2:52:14.980 --> 2:52:16.980]  that they can target you and kill you.
[2:52:16.980 --> 2:52:20.980]  That's right, what can it be used for for evil aims?
[2:52:20.980 --> 2:52:24.980]  You got it. And there is no, and this is the thing that people have got to understand,
[2:52:24.980 --> 2:52:28.980]  there is no redemptive purpose in it and they can say,
[2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:34.980]  well, it can find breast tumors, they have that equipment already.
[2:52:34.980 --> 2:52:36.980]  But we're not going to get that, yeah.
[2:52:36.980 --> 2:52:41.980]  Yeah, but the point is that all of this stuff is pointing to this, is that, look,
[2:52:41.980 --> 2:52:47.980]  if you control an entire person's well-being, it's like the food situation, Alex.
[2:52:47.980 --> 2:52:50.980]  The UN wants everybody to live on 1200 calories a day.
[2:52:50.980 --> 2:52:52.980]  So what do they show throughout the world?
[2:52:52.980 --> 2:52:55.980]  They show fat Americans, obese Americans, and basically saying,
[2:52:55.980 --> 2:52:59.980]  these people are borrowing all our money to sit and watch TV and get fat.
[2:52:59.980 --> 2:53:01.980]  That's it in a nutshell.
[2:53:01.980 --> 2:53:06.980]  Again, every single view, every single perception, every single image
[2:53:06.980 --> 2:53:10.980]  that's shown to the world is in a worse case scenario.
[2:53:10.980 --> 2:53:15.980]  It's like this, it's like the KGB, FSB, is now basically showing to the world
[2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:19.980]  their reason for taking out the United States, and it'll basically boil down to this.
[2:53:19.980 --> 2:53:22.980]  United States flooded the world with worthless money.
[2:53:22.980 --> 2:53:26.980]  The United States consumed more than anybody else in the world.
[2:53:26.980 --> 2:53:28.980]  And they've been setting that up and promoting in the media.
[2:53:28.980 --> 2:53:30.980]  Let's finish up with that right now. Here we go.
[2:53:30.980 --> 2:53:32.980]  Absolutely.
[2:53:32.980 --> 2:53:54.980]  At least of this phase of the Ponzi scheme.
[2:54:02.980 --> 2:54:22.980]  Won't you picture what will be?
[2:54:41.980 --> 2:54:43.980]  Steve Quills, our guest, taking your phone calls.
[2:54:43.980 --> 2:54:49.980]  I googled 2008 bailout, or bailout 2008, one of the top links,
[2:54:49.980 --> 2:54:53.980]  Dirty Secrets of the Bailout, 32 words that none dare utter.
[2:54:53.980 --> 2:54:57.980]  And this is from the Huffington Post, and rightfully so, it's gotten 5,000 digs.
[2:54:57.980 --> 2:55:01.980]  We'll get it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:55:01.980 --> 2:55:07.980]  Steve Quills' website as well, because it gives you the bill.
[2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:09.980]  I did link through, the bill is there.
[2:55:09.980 --> 2:55:13.980]  And it is decisions by the Secretary of Pursuant of the Authority of this Act
[2:55:13.980 --> 2:55:16.980]  are non-reviewable, can't even review them.
[2:55:16.980 --> 2:55:18.980]  Forgive me, you know.
[2:55:18.980 --> 2:55:22.980]  And committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law
[2:55:22.980 --> 2:55:24.980]  or any administrative agency.
[2:55:24.980 --> 2:55:27.980]  And Congress is going to sign this blank check over,
[2:55:27.980 --> 2:55:29.980]  which they don't even have the authority to do.
[2:55:29.980 --> 2:55:31.980]  This is mass treason.
[2:55:31.980 --> 2:55:33.980]  It would be one thing if they said, here's a trillion bucks,
[2:55:33.980 --> 2:55:35.980]  but we're going to have oversight.
[2:55:35.980 --> 2:55:39.980]  But see, notice Bush says with PDD 51, they have no oversight.
[2:55:39.980 --> 2:55:42.980]  So it's all just criminal rogue government.
[2:55:42.980 --> 2:55:48.980]  And we will get this up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, ASAP.
[2:55:48.980 --> 2:55:55.980]  Okay, but the headline is, Dirty Secrets of the Bailout, 32 words that none dare utter.
[2:55:55.980 --> 2:55:57.980]  Huffington Post by Jason Lincoln.
[2:55:57.980 --> 2:55:59.980]  John Jason.
[2:55:59.980 --> 2:56:01.980]  And by the way, that came out last night.
[2:56:01.980 --> 2:56:05.980]  Okay, Steve, finishing up on that.
[2:56:05.980 --> 2:56:10.980]  I think it's obvious now, it's in our total, total phase.
[2:56:10.980 --> 2:56:13.980]  And if anybody can put this into perspective,
[2:56:13.980 --> 2:56:18.980]  I'm told by people in that level of banking over the weekend,
[2:56:18.980 --> 2:56:20.980]  how heated the discussions have been,
[2:56:20.980 --> 2:56:24.980]  how absolutely threatened the international bank communities.
[2:56:24.980 --> 2:56:27.980]  By the way, Alex, even certain factions of the Illuminati,
[2:56:27.980 --> 2:56:30.980]  the ones that were told it would work out different now,
[2:56:30.980 --> 2:56:32.980]  are starting to get, uh, perious.
[2:56:32.980 --> 2:56:33.980]  I use that word.
[2:56:33.980 --> 2:56:35.980]  And so the thing is, is that, uh...
[2:56:35.980 --> 2:56:37.980]  Yeah, there's a lot of suckers in the mid strata
[2:56:37.980 --> 2:56:39.980]  who've been believing the Kool-Aid.
[2:56:39.980 --> 2:56:40.980]  Absolutely.
[2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:44.980]  But what people don't understand is simply this.
[2:56:44.980 --> 2:56:47.980]  It's now a question you've got to do,
[2:56:47.980 --> 2:56:53.980]  you've got to basically prepare for the absolute worst, okay?
[2:56:53.980 --> 2:56:55.980]  That's where we're at right now.
[2:56:55.980 --> 2:56:58.980]  They have to prepare for the absolute worst.
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:01.980]  And they have to be practical, they have to be tactical,
[2:57:01.980 --> 2:57:05.980]  and we're at the point in time, Alex,
[2:57:05.980 --> 2:57:09.980]  where there's no room for dilly-dallying any longer.
[2:57:09.980 --> 2:57:11.980]  If people want to continue to listen to you,
[2:57:11.980 --> 2:57:13.980]  or me for entertainment, well, they'll listen to you,
[2:57:13.980 --> 2:57:16.980]  they won't listen to me, because I won't be there,
[2:57:16.980 --> 2:57:17.980]  and I'm not going to be there.
[2:57:17.980 --> 2:57:19.980]  The point is, is that they have to realize
[2:57:19.980 --> 2:57:21.980]  that what we've warned them about food,
[2:57:21.980 --> 2:57:24.980]  about the nuclear biological chem necessity of repair,
[2:57:24.980 --> 2:57:26.980]  all these things are critical.
[2:57:26.980 --> 2:57:28.980]  All these things are critical.
[2:57:28.980 --> 2:57:29.980]  I'm just...
[2:57:29.980 --> 2:57:31.980]  Sometimes I'm at a loss for words,
[2:57:31.980 --> 2:57:33.980]  because I know how to say it,
[2:57:33.980 --> 2:57:34.980]  but I don't want to say it with a word.
[2:57:34.980 --> 2:57:36.980]  Well, no, it's also that you don't...
[2:57:36.980 --> 2:57:37.980]  It's hard to...
[2:57:37.980 --> 2:57:40.980]  We've intellectually known all this was being set up.
[2:57:40.980 --> 2:57:43.980]  But to see them do it, and to keep seeing them do everything
[2:57:43.980 --> 2:57:45.980]  they say they do, we know now they're going to do
[2:57:45.980 --> 2:57:48.980]  the other things they said, which includes killing
[2:57:48.980 --> 2:57:50.980]  more than 80% of us, and that's on record.
[2:57:50.980 --> 2:57:52.980]  And I just feel sorry for all of you
[2:57:52.980 --> 2:57:54.980]  that served the system and laughed and giggled,
[2:57:54.980 --> 2:57:57.980]  and my detractors all still laugh and giggle
[2:57:57.980 --> 2:58:00.980]  and say the dollar's not devalued, the economy's not in trouble.
[2:58:00.980 --> 2:58:02.980]  Now, Steve, do five more minutes.
[2:58:02.980 --> 2:58:05.980]  Back in 70 seconds, we're going into the final hour right now.
[2:58:05.980 --> 2:58:08.980]  Take a few final calls for Steve Cuell. Stay with us.

[2:59:15.980 --> 2:59:18.980]  Join the info war today.
[2:59:21.980 --> 2:59:23.980]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:23.980 --> 2:59:27.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:37.980 --> 2:59:38.980]  Look, it's simple.
[2:59:38.980 --> 2:59:40.980]  The global tyrants had to destroy the United States,
[2:59:40.980 --> 2:59:43.980]  the Bill of Rights Constitution, the Second Amendment.
[2:59:43.980 --> 2:59:46.980]  The internet that they had dubbed the World Wide Wiretap
[2:59:46.980 --> 2:59:48.980]  to control and regulate and track our every movement
[2:59:48.980 --> 2:59:50.980]  has been turned against them.
[2:59:50.980 --> 2:59:53.980]  Double-edged sword cuts both ways.
[2:59:53.980 --> 2:59:56.980]  And they're going to lose if they continue to allow us
[2:59:56.980 --> 2:59:58.980]  to be above ground and to be operating
[2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:00.980]  against their enemy operation.
[3:00:00.980 --> 3:00:03.980]  Enemies of life, enemies of decency, enemies of honor.
[3:00:03.980 --> 3:00:05.980]  It's the forces of evil, people in every agency,
[3:00:05.980 --> 3:00:08.980]  every government, every society,
[3:00:08.980 --> 3:00:10.980]  versus the forces of good.
[3:00:10.980 --> 3:00:12.980]  And we also, people, every government,
[3:00:12.980 --> 3:00:14.980]  every agency, every society.
[3:00:14.980 --> 3:00:16.980]  And all of you have to shine now
[3:00:16.980 --> 3:00:18.980]  against this tyranny like never before.
[3:00:18.980 --> 3:00:20.980]  Steve Quayle says he is bugging out, getting out of things.
[3:00:20.980 --> 3:00:22.980]  And I know he's taken multi-year hiatus,
[3:00:22.980 --> 3:00:24.980]  or six-month hiatus as before,
[3:00:24.980 --> 3:00:26.980]  but he says this is it.
[3:00:26.980 --> 3:00:28.980]  He's really out of there.
[3:00:28.980 --> 3:00:30.980]  He's just done so much work, but his website
[3:00:30.980 --> 3:00:32.980]  will still stand as a testament to all the work
[3:00:32.980 --> 3:00:34.980]  and research and a lot of shocking stuff
[3:00:34.980 --> 3:00:36.980]  that just kept coming true over the years.
[3:00:36.980 --> 3:00:38.980]  I'll use this here in just a few minutes.
[3:00:38.980 --> 3:00:40.980]  I don't want to keep him too much longer.
[3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:42.980]  I've got some other news we're going to be covering.
[3:00:42.980 --> 3:00:44.980]  We'll give out his website for you.
[3:00:44.980 --> 3:00:46.980]  But who do we gotten up to here in the calls?
[3:00:46.980 --> 3:00:48.980]  I've got Mark, Steve, Phillip, Maddie, Bill.
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:50.980]  Mark's next.
[3:00:50.980 --> 3:00:52.980]  Mark's next.
[3:00:52.980 --> 3:00:54.980]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[3:00:54.980 --> 3:00:56.980]  Go ahead.
[3:00:56.980 --> 3:00:58.980]  Hey, good morning, Alex and Steve.
[3:00:58.980 --> 3:01:00.980]  Thank you both for your great service
[3:01:00.980 --> 3:01:02.980]  to God and country through the years here.
[3:01:02.980 --> 3:01:04.980]  I want to ask you, Steve,
[3:01:04.980 --> 3:01:06.980]  how do you get this thing going
[3:01:06.980 --> 3:01:08.980]  to the head-run collider
[3:01:08.980 --> 3:01:10.980]  and what it's truly being used for
[3:01:10.980 --> 3:01:12.980]  on its largest purpose, which is
[3:01:12.980 --> 3:01:14.980]  to open up, I assume,
[3:01:14.980 --> 3:01:16.980]  a very large gateway to a dimension
[3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:18.980]  which will allow evil
[3:01:18.980 --> 3:01:20.980]  the host of the other dimensions.
[3:01:20.980 --> 3:01:22.980]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:24.980]  We don't know what it does,
[3:01:24.980 --> 3:01:26.980]  but they admit it can open up to other dimensions.
[3:01:26.980 --> 3:01:28.980]  And that's what they say.
[3:01:28.980 --> 3:01:30.980]  Then they laugh at the public and say,
[3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:32.980]  oh, there's no problem.
[3:01:32.980 --> 3:01:34.980]  They're going to change, let's, particles
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:36.980]  that'll absorb the earth over time,
[3:01:36.980 --> 3:01:38.980]  a cocktail of things,
[3:01:38.980 --> 3:01:40.980]  and they're going to be doing thousands of experiments.
[3:01:40.980 --> 3:01:42.980]  So there's a low probability each test,
[3:01:42.980 --> 3:01:44.980]  but with all the other experiments,
[3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:46.980]  with what they admit, that's when it becomes dangerous.
[3:01:46.980 --> 3:01:48.980]  But go ahead.
[3:01:48.980 --> 3:01:50.980]  Yes, Alex, and Steve has said
[3:01:50.980 --> 3:01:52.980]  in other venues
[3:01:52.980 --> 3:01:54.980]  in recent times that
[3:01:54.980 --> 3:01:56.980]  actually
[3:01:56.980 --> 3:01:58.980]  there will be demonic entities,
[3:01:58.980 --> 3:02:00.980]  other entities of hell
[3:02:00.980 --> 3:02:02.980]  through this stargate
[3:02:02.980 --> 3:02:04.980]  or gateway or black hole,
[3:02:04.980 --> 3:02:06.980]  however one would want to term it.
[3:02:06.980 --> 3:02:08.980]  And what I'm most curious about,
[3:02:08.980 --> 3:02:10.980]  and I think it would be very helpful
[3:02:10.980 --> 3:02:12.980]  knowledge to us all,
[3:02:12.980 --> 3:02:14.980]  is what Steve may know,
[3:02:14.980 --> 3:02:16.980]  what Steve may extrapolate,
[3:02:16.980 --> 3:02:18.980]  visualize, be inspired
[3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:20.980]  to actually realize up to this point
[3:02:20.980 --> 3:02:22.980]  in time how these creatures
[3:02:22.980 --> 3:02:24.980]  that are being let through here
[3:02:24.980 --> 3:02:26.980]  into our dimension,
[3:02:26.980 --> 3:02:28.980]  into our physical world
[3:02:28.980 --> 3:02:30.980]  personally.
[3:02:30.980 --> 3:02:32.980]  I don't do a lot of speculating here on the show,
[3:02:32.980 --> 3:02:34.980]  and the scientists
[3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:36.980]  that have said it could open other dimensions,
[3:02:36.980 --> 3:02:38.980]  they don't know what's in them,
[3:02:38.980 --> 3:02:40.980]  all sorts of things, and black holes,
[3:02:40.980 --> 3:02:42.980]  atomic reactions, things like that,
[3:02:42.980 --> 3:02:44.980]  and that's really, you know...
[3:02:44.980 --> 3:02:46.980]  Right, Alex, what the caller's referring to though,
[3:02:46.980 --> 3:02:48.980]  let me share this, and I won't speculate
[3:02:48.980 --> 3:02:50.980]  either what he's referring to is information
[3:02:50.980 --> 3:02:52.980]  I passed up, given to me
[3:02:52.980 --> 3:02:54.980]  by people
[3:02:54.980 --> 3:02:56.980]  in the world of special operations
[3:02:56.980 --> 3:02:58.980]  to deal with this stuff, but let me just say this,
[3:02:58.980 --> 3:03:00.980]  whatever it is,
[3:03:00.980 --> 3:03:02.980]  if they're worshiping the goddess of destruction,
[3:03:02.980 --> 3:03:04.980]  it's not going to be good for us, okay?
[3:03:04.980 --> 3:03:06.980]  And the thing is, is that
[3:03:06.980 --> 3:03:08.980]  I just want to commend my listener that
[3:03:08.980 --> 3:03:10.980]  he's obviously listened intently.
[3:03:10.980 --> 3:03:12.980]  For everybody who wants to know about this stuff,
[3:03:12.980 --> 3:03:14.980]  I can't wait to get
[3:03:14.980 --> 3:03:16.980]  a book published, I'm not pitching a book,
[3:03:16.980 --> 3:03:18.980]  but I put everything I know about it.
[3:03:18.980 --> 3:03:20.980]  Oh, I want you to pitch books, you got a lot of great books
[3:03:20.980 --> 3:03:22.980]  and materials.
[3:03:22.980 --> 3:03:24.980]  Yeah, excuse me, it's at the printer,
[3:03:24.980 --> 3:03:26.980]  and the cover design's being done right now
[3:03:26.980 --> 3:03:28.980]  is called Long Walkers,
[3:03:28.980 --> 3:03:30.980]  L-O-N-G-W-A-L-K-E-R-S.
[3:03:30.980 --> 3:03:32.980]  That's a special operations command name
[3:03:32.980 --> 3:03:34.980]  for the things that they deal with
[3:03:34.980 --> 3:03:36.980]  that are of giant stature.
[3:03:36.980 --> 3:03:38.980]  Long Walkers, the return of the Nephilim.
[3:03:38.980 --> 3:03:40.980]  So, to the caller and to others,
[3:03:40.980 --> 3:03:42.980]  I am, you know, anxious.
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:44.980]  I'm like a dog with a new piece of
[3:03:44.980 --> 3:03:46.980]  a big, meaty bone.
[3:03:46.980 --> 3:03:48.980]  I want to get that thing up,
[3:03:48.980 --> 3:03:50.980]  because what I did incorporate it into
[3:03:50.980 --> 3:03:52.980]  a fictional novel,
[3:03:52.980 --> 3:03:54.980]  the actual stuff I know
[3:03:54.980 --> 3:03:56.980]  is integrated in the novel.
[3:03:56.980 --> 3:03:58.980]  Okay, fire out the website and the phone number.
[3:03:58.980 --> 3:04:00.980]  Yeah, it's SteveQuayle.com,
[3:04:00.980 --> 3:04:02.980]  SteveQuayle,
[3:04:02.980 --> 3:04:04.980]  phone numbers,
[3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:06.980]  406-586-4840.
[3:04:06.980 --> 3:04:08.980]  406-586-4840.
[3:04:08.980 --> 3:04:10.980]  All right, give that number out again.
[3:04:10.980 --> 3:04:12.980]  406-586-4840.
[3:04:12.980 --> 3:04:14.980]  All right, I'm going to say bye to
[3:04:14.980 --> 3:04:16.980]  Steve here
[3:04:16.980 --> 3:04:18.980]  for folks watching at
[3:04:18.980 --> 3:04:20.980]  PrisonPlanet.tv and on the Internet.
[3:04:20.980 --> 3:04:22.980]  Thanks for watching.
[3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:24.980]  I'll see you next time.
[3:04:24.980 --> 3:04:52.980]  I'll see you next time.
[3:04:54.980 --> 3:04:56.980]  Stay with us.
[3:05:36.980 --> 3:05:38.980]  Yeah, that's one, but it gets filled
[3:05:38.980 --> 3:05:40.980]  up with stuff, too.
[3:05:40.980 --> 3:05:42.980]  I've got a few.
[3:05:42.980 --> 3:05:44.980]  The best thing to do is to CC
[3:05:44.980 --> 3:05:46.980]  Aaron at infowars.com, because I
[3:05:46.980 --> 3:05:48.980]  read that, and so does Aaron.
[3:05:48.980 --> 3:05:50.980]  There's just so much spam.
[3:05:50.980 --> 3:05:52.980]  Yes, sir.
[3:05:52.980 --> 3:05:54.980]  Okay, I'll do that, because again,
[3:05:54.980 --> 3:05:56.980]  what I want, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:05:56.980 --> 3:05:58.980]  I want all of you to keep Alex in prayer,
[3:05:58.980 --> 3:06:00.980]  intercessors to keep him prayer.
[3:06:00.980 --> 3:06:02.980]  He's on the front line, and ladies and gentlemen,
[3:06:02.980 --> 3:06:04.980]  again, do, do,
[3:06:04.980 --> 3:06:06.980]  do put into effect
[3:06:06.980 --> 3:06:08.980]  all the recommendations that you've
[3:06:08.980 --> 3:06:10.980]  heard on Alex's show through all the guests,
[3:06:10.980 --> 3:06:12.980]  because we're there. It's no longer
[3:06:12.980 --> 3:06:14.980]  warning, Alex. It's in movement.
[3:06:14.980 --> 3:06:16.980]  I hear you, SteveQuayle. Thanks for spending
[3:06:16.980 --> 3:06:18.980]  time with us today. Thank you. Bye-bye.
[3:06:18.980 --> 3:06:20.980]  All right, there goes Steve Quayle.
[3:06:20.980 --> 3:06:22.980]  He gets into the economy. He gets into
[3:06:22.980 --> 3:06:24.980]  bioweapons. He gets into so much that's
[3:06:24.980 --> 3:06:26.980]  documented and privable, and the fact
[3:06:26.980 --> 3:06:28.980]  that the Hedrick Lotter can go into other
[3:06:28.980 --> 3:06:30.980]  dimensions, that's been reported.
[3:06:30.980 --> 3:06:32.980]  We don't know what's in those dimensions.
[3:06:32.980 --> 3:06:34.980]  He gets into
[3:06:34.980 --> 3:06:36.980]  a lot of really sexy stuff, as they call it.
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:38.980]  I tend to stick to what I, you know,
[3:06:38.980 --> 3:06:40.980]  some of the things that I can prove a
[3:06:40.980 --> 3:06:42.980]  little bit more inside the box.
[3:06:42.980 --> 3:06:44.980]  But, you know, we bring guest on, like Steve,
[3:06:44.980 --> 3:06:46.980]  because he's a really good guy, and he believes
[3:06:46.980 --> 3:06:48.980]  what he's saying, and a lot of what he's talked
[3:06:48.980 --> 3:06:50.980]  about, unfortunately, has come
[3:06:50.980 --> 3:06:52.980]  true over the years.
[3:06:52.980 --> 3:06:54.980]  And that's basically
[3:06:54.980 --> 3:06:56.980]  where I will
[3:06:56.980 --> 3:06:58.980]  leave that.
[3:06:58.980 --> 3:07:00.980]  But it's up to you to research it all for yourself.
[3:07:00.980 --> 3:07:02.980]  Also, I believe Steve believes what he's saying.
[3:07:02.980 --> 3:07:04.980]  But as Bill Cooper said,
[3:07:04.980 --> 3:07:06.980]  he was brought into army intelligence, and
[3:07:06.980 --> 3:07:08.980]  they told him UFOs were real, and it was all
[3:07:08.980 --> 3:07:10.980]  government operations, and they were in
[3:07:10.980 --> 3:07:12.980]  league with them, and then later he thought
[3:07:12.980 --> 3:07:14.980]  they'd given him disinfo to then go out
[3:07:14.980 --> 3:07:16.980]  and tell others about it. So we know that's
[3:07:16.980 --> 3:07:18.980]  also part of the disinformation system
[3:07:18.980 --> 3:07:20.980]  of the New World Order, is to go out
[3:07:20.980 --> 3:07:22.980]  and put this information out.
[3:07:22.980 --> 3:07:24.980]  So that's why I stick to what we can prove.
[3:07:24.980 --> 3:07:26.980]  Particle beams, a lot of this stuff,
[3:07:26.980 --> 3:07:28.980]  what we know is there. We talked about
[3:07:28.980 --> 3:07:30.980]  the infrared, knowing somebody's
[3:07:30.980 --> 3:07:32.980]  hate signature in a crowd, to be able to kill them.
[3:07:32.980 --> 3:07:34.980]  Their shadow from satellites, then have
[3:07:34.980 --> 3:07:36.980]  a global hawk launch a missile at them.
[3:07:36.980 --> 3:07:38.980]  That's all real and true. Here we go back into
[3:07:38.980 --> 3:07:50.980]  the main show.
[3:07:50.980 --> 3:07:52.980]  Alright, very interesting
[3:07:52.980 --> 3:07:54.980]  discussion with Steve Quayle.
[3:07:54.980 --> 3:07:56.980]  About 95% of that can be documented.
[3:07:56.980 --> 3:07:58.980]  The other 5% is pretty wild.
[3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:00.980]  God knows what's true, but
[3:08:00.980 --> 3:08:02.980]  we'll
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:04.980]  continue to cover it all
[3:08:04.980 --> 3:08:06.980]  and bring you all the interesting people
[3:08:06.980 --> 3:08:08.980]  that are provoking here.
[3:08:08.980 --> 3:08:10.980]  What I do know is that a listener is
[3:08:10.980 --> 3:08:12.980]  absolutely right. I'd seen all the blurbs
[3:08:12.980 --> 3:08:14.980]  in the articles and read that there was
[3:08:14.980 --> 3:08:16.980]  amnesty for all the crux
[3:08:16.980 --> 3:08:18.980]  and a pardon for them and that it gave
[3:08:18.980 --> 3:08:20.980]  dictatorial power to the Treasury
[3:08:20.980 --> 3:08:22.980]  and to the President, quote, got rid of checks
[3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:24.980]  and balances.
[3:08:24.980 --> 3:08:26.980]  And I'd seen earlier bailout bills
[3:08:26.980 --> 3:08:28.980]  they brought forward. I hadn't seen this. I've
[3:08:28.980 --> 3:08:30.980]  now been on the bell.
[3:08:30.980 --> 3:08:32.980]  It says decisions by the Secretary
[3:08:32.980 --> 3:08:34.980]  pursuant to the authority of the act
[3:08:34.980 --> 3:08:36.980]  are non-renewable,
[3:08:36.980 --> 3:08:38.980]  reviewable. See, that word's so evil
[3:08:38.980 --> 3:08:40.980]  I can't even pronounce it right. Decisions
[3:08:40.980 --> 3:08:42.980]  by the Secretary pursuant to the authority
[3:08:42.980 --> 3:08:44.980]  of this act are non-reviewable.
[3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:46.980]  No one can look at it
[3:08:46.980 --> 3:08:48.980]  even. I mean, that's it. You can't even talk
[3:08:48.980 --> 3:08:50.980]  about it. And committed to agency direction
[3:08:50.980 --> 3:08:52.980]  and may not be reviewed by any
[3:08:52.980 --> 3:08:54.980]  court of law or any administrative
[3:08:54.980 --> 3:08:56.980]  agency. That's this part right here.
[3:08:56.980 --> 3:08:58.980]  And you can go down here and click
[3:08:58.980 --> 3:09:00.980]  through and
[3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:02.980]  read deeper
[3:09:02.980 --> 3:09:04.980]  into it. You can also read
[3:09:04.980 --> 3:09:06.980]  McClatchy newspaper saying the same thing about it.
[3:09:06.980 --> 3:09:08.980]  You can read the Wall Street Journal
[3:09:08.980 --> 3:09:10.980]  talking about it. The New York Times
[3:09:10.980 --> 3:09:12.980]  talking about it.
[3:09:12.980 --> 3:09:14.980]  You can go to the bill
[3:09:14.980 --> 3:09:16.980]  itself
[3:09:16.980 --> 3:09:18.980]  right here.
[3:09:18.980 --> 3:09:20.980]  And
[3:09:20.980 --> 3:09:22.980]  there is just so much in this.
[3:09:22.980 --> 3:09:24.980]  It's just amazing. We need to get our own
[3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:26.980]  stories up on the site to integrate in
[3:09:26.980 --> 3:09:28.980]  that they're bringing in the military. We haven't
[3:09:28.980 --> 3:09:30.980]  even done a story yet about how last week
[3:09:30.980 --> 3:09:32.980]  the Army Times reported, hey,
[3:09:32.980 --> 3:09:34.980]  full brigades of the Army are going to
[3:09:34.980 --> 3:09:36.980]  patrol America for riots and civil
[3:09:36.980 --> 3:09:38.980]  insurrection. I mean, what are
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:40.980]  regular Army? We always told
[3:09:40.980 --> 3:09:42.980]  you this. We always told you
[3:09:42.980 --> 3:09:44.980]  Northcom would be the instrument, but now
[3:09:44.980 --> 3:09:46.980]  it's happening.
[3:09:46.980 --> 3:09:48.980]  You know, I don't know about particle
[3:09:48.980 --> 3:09:50.980]  beams and stargates or any matter bombs
[3:09:50.980 --> 3:09:52.980]  though the military admits they've been working on those.
[3:09:52.980 --> 3:09:54.980]  All I know is
[3:09:54.980 --> 3:09:56.980]  this stuff's real and this is happening.
[3:09:56.980 --> 3:09:58.980]  And this is no longer
[3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:00.980]  a realm of
[3:10:00.980 --> 3:10:02.980]  speculation or fiction here.
[3:10:02.980 --> 3:10:04.980]  This is the balloon going up
[3:10:04.980 --> 3:10:06.980]  and this is hard core
[3:10:06.980 --> 3:10:08.980]  serious.
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:10.980]  I'm going to take a few final calls and I've got
[3:10:10.980 --> 3:10:12.980]  some clips I'm going to play
[3:10:12.980 --> 3:10:14.980]  from
[3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:16.980]  a Donahue program back in
[3:10:16.980 --> 3:10:18.980]  94. Yesterday I played the first couple
[3:10:18.980 --> 3:10:20.980]  segments.
[3:10:20.980 --> 3:10:22.980]  Well, I'm going to preface those when we
[3:10:22.980 --> 3:10:24.980]  go to them here in a minute.
[3:10:24.980 --> 3:10:26.980]  But right now let's go ahead and take
[3:10:26.980 --> 3:10:28.980]  a few more calls.
[3:10:28.980 --> 3:10:30.980]  Who's up next, John?
[3:10:30.980 --> 3:10:32.980]  Steven Utah.
[3:10:32.980 --> 3:10:34.980]  You're on the air, Steve.
[3:10:34.980 --> 3:10:36.980]  Go ahead.
[3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:38.980]  Hi, go ahead.
[3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:40.980]  Yeah, I've been talking and trying
[3:10:40.980 --> 3:10:42.980]  to get this information out
[3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:44.980]  there. When I talk about the
[3:10:44.980 --> 3:10:46.980]  economy, I'm told
[3:10:46.980 --> 3:10:48.980]  that, you know, we
[3:10:48.980 --> 3:10:50.980]  almost lost everything
[3:10:50.980 --> 3:10:52.980]  and it's a good thing that
[3:10:52.980 --> 3:10:54.980]  the government's bailing out
[3:10:54.980 --> 3:10:56.980]  these banks. It's helping us.
[3:10:56.980 --> 3:10:58.980]  And then also
[3:10:58.980 --> 3:11:00.980]  this is just a cycle.
[3:11:00.980 --> 3:11:02.980]  And the combat brigades are coming to save us.
[3:11:02.980 --> 3:11:04.980]  Yeah, we'll
[3:11:04.980 --> 3:11:06.980]  just with the economy
[3:11:06.980 --> 3:11:08.980]  that bail out buying
[3:11:08.980 --> 3:11:10.980]  the banks. This is
[3:11:10.980 --> 3:11:12.980]  the cycle. This is a good thing.
[3:11:12.980 --> 3:11:14.980]  Oh, it's a good thing
[3:11:14.980 --> 3:11:16.980]  I've been hearing that. It's good.
[3:11:16.980 --> 3:11:18.980]  Not only did they say it would never
[3:11:18.980 --> 3:11:20.980]  happen and it was all conspiracy theories,
[3:11:20.980 --> 3:11:22.980]  but now it's a good thing.
[3:11:22.980 --> 3:11:24.980]  Yeah, it's saving us.
[3:11:24.980 --> 3:11:26.980]  And that's the thing with
[3:11:26.980 --> 3:11:28.980]  your guess this afternoon.
[3:11:28.980 --> 3:11:30.980]  We've been,
[3:11:30.980 --> 3:11:32.980]  you know, we've been
[3:11:32.980 --> 3:11:34.980]  pretty much taught
[3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:36.980]  that wrong is right
[3:11:36.980 --> 3:11:38.980]  and it's pretty much the norm.
[3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:40.980]  It's illegal to smoke marijuana,
[3:11:40.980 --> 3:11:42.980]  but it's not illegal to abort babies.
[3:11:42.980 --> 3:11:44.980]  That's right.
[3:11:44.980 --> 3:11:46.980]  It's kind of
[3:11:46.980 --> 3:11:48.980]  confusing.
[3:11:48.980 --> 3:11:50.980]  Oh, no, abortion is a precious right
[3:11:50.980 --> 3:11:52.980]  is sexy and cool
[3:11:52.980 --> 3:11:54.980]  like the news is reporting.
[3:11:54.980 --> 3:11:56.980]  I'm going to cover that before the show ends.
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:11:58.980]  I hear you. It's good to talk to you.
[3:11:58.980 --> 3:12:00.980]  Steve Phillip in Texas.
[3:12:00.980 --> 3:12:02.980]  You're on the air.
[3:12:02.980 --> 3:12:04.980]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[3:12:04.980 --> 3:12:06.980]  Yes, I can. Okay.
[3:12:06.980 --> 3:12:08.980]  Yeah, excuse me. I got this out.
[3:12:08.980 --> 3:12:10.980]  That's all right, sir. Go ahead.
[3:12:10.980 --> 3:12:12.980]  Okay, I heard the
[3:12:12.980 --> 3:12:14.980]  woman call in earlier and she was
[3:12:14.980 --> 3:12:16.980]  talking about
[3:12:16.980 --> 3:12:18.980]  she moved from where she was
[3:12:18.980 --> 3:12:20.980]  to somewhere else.
[3:12:20.980 --> 3:12:22.980]  And I heard the same thing.
[3:12:22.980 --> 3:12:24.980]  It was some years ago.
[3:12:24.980 --> 3:12:26.980]  I kept hearing the gathering
[3:12:26.980 --> 3:12:28.980]  in my mind for two weeks like a song
[3:12:28.980 --> 3:12:30.980]  you couldn't get rid of.
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:32.980]  And I turned on the radio and the first thing
[3:12:32.980 --> 3:12:34.980]  I heard was David J. Smith said
[3:12:34.980 --> 3:12:36.980]  the gathering.
[3:12:36.980 --> 3:12:38.980]  So it is, it is true.
[3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:40.980]  And so I moved from where I was to Texas.
[3:12:40.980 --> 3:12:42.980]  No, I know.
[3:12:42.980 --> 3:12:44.980]  Pastor David J. Smith says that back in the
[3:12:44.980 --> 3:12:46.980]  80s, early 80s,
[3:12:46.980 --> 3:12:48.980]  in Arkansas,
[3:12:48.980 --> 3:12:50.980]  and God told him, moved to Texas,
[3:12:50.980 --> 3:12:52.980]  moved to Waukes-a-Hatchee and started a
[3:12:52.980 --> 3:12:54.980]  magazine and radio show and exposed
[3:12:54.980 --> 3:12:56.980]  the coming New World Order.
[3:12:56.980 --> 3:12:58.980]  And he did it.
[3:12:58.980 --> 3:13:00.980]  That's like 25 years ago.
[3:13:00.980 --> 3:13:02.980]  I know to a lot of people it sounds
[3:13:02.980 --> 3:13:04.980]  crazy, but I heard it.
[3:13:04.980 --> 3:13:06.980]  That's all I can tell you.
[3:13:06.980 --> 3:13:08.980]  Well, and look what popped up in Austin, Texas.
[3:13:08.980 --> 3:13:10.980]  Right in the middle of Texas and all the
[3:13:10.980 --> 3:13:12.980]  stuff that's been generated out of here.
[3:13:12.980 --> 3:13:14.980]  Something to it, I guess.
[3:13:14.980 --> 3:13:16.980]  Well, I'm from Texas, so.
[3:13:16.980 --> 3:13:18.980]  Yeah, and the way I understand it,
[3:13:18.980 --> 3:13:20.980]  he's got certain spots he set aside
[3:13:20.980 --> 3:13:22.980]  for his people.
[3:13:22.980 --> 3:13:24.980]  And he's preparing his people.
[3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:26.980]  And a lot of people that believe
[3:13:26.980 --> 3:13:28.980]  that they're going to be taken up
[3:13:28.980 --> 3:13:30.980]  before all the trial and tribulation,
[3:13:30.980 --> 3:13:32.980]  that's a bunch of bulls.
[3:13:32.980 --> 3:13:34.980]  It's nowhere in there.
[3:13:34.980 --> 3:13:36.980]  It says the Antichrist Wages War on the Saints.
[3:13:36.980 --> 3:13:38.980]  It describes it all.
[3:13:38.980 --> 3:13:40.980]  The other Christians believe the Antichrist
[3:13:40.980 --> 3:13:42.980]  is Jesus.
[3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:44.980]  And no, Jesus is about to arrive.
[3:13:44.980 --> 3:13:46.980]  And well, the first one, you know,
[3:13:46.980 --> 3:13:48.980]  is Beelzebub.
[3:13:48.980 --> 3:13:50.980]  I mean, again, this is even a religious show
[3:13:50.980 --> 3:13:52.980]  that we have guests on that cover that
[3:13:52.980 --> 3:13:54.980]  because the elites also believe in it.
[3:13:54.980 --> 3:13:56.980]  They just believe in the bad guy.
[3:13:56.980 --> 3:13:58.980]  I don't want you to think that
[3:13:58.980 --> 3:14:00.980]  I think I'm such a great white.
[3:14:00.980 --> 3:14:02.980]  But when I was little and I was
[3:14:02.980 --> 3:14:04.980]  in church,
[3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:06.980]  this minister was telling about
[3:14:06.980 --> 3:14:08.980]  the people being taken up.
[3:14:08.980 --> 3:14:10.980]  And God said in my heart,
[3:14:10.980 --> 3:14:12.980]  don't believe in that's not true.
[3:14:12.980 --> 3:14:14.980]  Yeah.
[3:14:14.980 --> 3:14:16.980]  And so I've known ever since I was little.
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:18.980]  And then I've learned since then
[3:14:18.980 --> 3:14:20.980]  that it has to happen. Me too.
[3:14:20.980 --> 3:14:22.980]  I remember as the preacher saying that
[3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:24.980]  and voice telling me it was a lie.
[3:14:24.980 --> 3:14:26.980]  I remember knowing that was a lie.
[3:14:26.980 --> 3:14:28.980]  I remember knowing the preacher was a lowdown
[3:14:28.980 --> 3:14:30.980]  with a little money grubber.
[3:14:30.980 --> 3:14:32.980]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[3:14:32.980 --> 3:14:34.980]  I got to go here.
[3:14:34.980 --> 3:14:36.980]  I'm going to try to get to Matty and Bill and Scott
[3:14:36.980 --> 3:14:38.980]  after I play some of these clips.
[3:14:38.980 --> 3:14:40.980]  We've got the YouTube video
[3:14:40.980 --> 3:14:42.980]  of this posted
[3:14:42.980 --> 3:14:44.980]  upon infowars.com.
[3:14:44.980 --> 3:14:46.980]  In fact, let me just
[3:14:46.980 --> 3:14:48.980]  go here and pull up
[3:14:48.980 --> 3:14:50.980]  the video page itself.
[3:14:50.980 --> 3:14:52.980]  So I can give you the headline
[3:14:52.980 --> 3:14:54.980]  for people out there that are watching right now
[3:14:54.980 --> 3:14:56.980]  on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:14:56.980 --> 3:14:58.980]  If you want to
[3:15:00.980 --> 3:15:02.980]  No, I can't find it.
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:04.980]  I had them. I had the clips.
[3:15:04.980 --> 3:15:06.980]  Well, it
[3:15:06.980 --> 3:15:08.980]  doesn't matter.
[3:15:08.980 --> 3:15:10.980]  Pardon me?
[3:15:10.980 --> 3:15:12.980]  Well, I know there's clips.
[3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:14.980]  I need the headline
[3:15:14.980 --> 3:15:16.980]  of the article.
[3:15:16.980 --> 3:15:18.980]  John, what's the headline on the article
[3:15:18.980 --> 3:15:20.980]  that has the YouTube clips posted?
[3:15:20.980 --> 3:15:22.980]  American Militia Media Spin.
[3:15:22.980 --> 3:15:24.980]  America Militia Media Spin
[3:15:24.980 --> 3:15:26.980]  infowars.com
[3:15:26.980 --> 3:15:28.980]  and you will get it.
[3:15:28.980 --> 3:15:30.980]  Now, the thing about this video is
[3:15:30.980 --> 3:15:32.980]  and there's a whole bunch of other ones similar.
[3:15:32.980 --> 3:15:34.980]  They were demonizing the militia and the media
[3:15:34.980 --> 3:15:36.980]  from sitting and blaming on the militia.
[3:15:36.980 --> 3:15:38.980]  The militia was made up of former military people
[3:15:38.980 --> 3:15:40.980]  intelligence who were told the military
[3:15:40.980 --> 3:15:42.980]  is getting ready for gun confiscations.
[3:15:42.980 --> 3:15:44.980]  We're training for gun confiscations.
[3:15:44.980 --> 3:15:46.980]  The troops are being given questionnaires
[3:15:46.980 --> 3:15:48.980]  for gun confiscations. They're going to bankrupt
[3:15:48.980 --> 3:15:50.980]  the economy and they got documents
[3:15:50.980 --> 3:15:52.980]  and we got documents.
[3:15:52.980 --> 3:15:54.980]  I came on the scene right after this in 94
[3:15:54.980 --> 3:15:56.980]  and a lot of people woke up
[3:15:56.980 --> 3:15:58.980]  because they were getting the core documents
[3:15:58.980 --> 3:16:00.980]  and they were learning about the secret
[3:16:00.980 --> 3:16:02.980]  FEMA camps that are now on the mainstream news
[3:16:02.980 --> 3:16:04.980]  and they were talking about all this
[3:16:04.980 --> 3:16:06.980]  and discussing all of this
[3:16:06.980 --> 3:16:08.980]  and so
[3:16:08.980 --> 3:16:10.980]  they came out and tried to warn people
[3:16:10.980 --> 3:16:12.980]  and the first two parts we played yesterday
[3:16:12.980 --> 3:16:14.980]  Donnie Hughes laughing at them saying
[3:16:14.980 --> 3:16:16.980]  you're cavemen that live in the woods,
[3:16:16.980 --> 3:16:18.980]  you got secret guns, you're gun nuts, you're crazy
[3:16:18.980 --> 3:16:20.980]  and they just walk through the gun confiscations
[3:16:20.980 --> 3:16:22.980]  going on in the inner cities.
[3:16:22.980 --> 3:16:24.980]  They walk through the police state.
[3:16:24.980 --> 3:16:26.980]  They say what's going to come in the decades to come.
[3:16:26.980 --> 3:16:28.980]  They lay it all out beautifully.
[3:16:28.980 --> 3:16:30.980]  So we're going to go ahead and play three minutes of that now
[3:16:30.980 --> 3:16:32.980]  and play several parts of this.
[3:16:32.980 --> 3:16:34.980]  This is part three, four
[3:16:34.980 --> 3:16:36.980]  and five.
[3:16:36.980 --> 3:16:38.980]  Here we go with that audio.
[3:16:38.980 --> 3:16:40.980]  You better be living right between
[3:16:40.980 --> 3:16:42.980]  in your family. You better love all God's children
[3:16:42.980 --> 3:16:44.980]  regardless of color. Absolutely.
[3:16:44.980 --> 3:16:46.980]  On the Liberty, the description
[3:16:46.980 --> 3:16:48.980]  on the Liberty Bell and it's nothing. Also listen.
[3:16:48.980 --> 3:16:50.980]  Listen. Also
[3:16:50.980 --> 3:16:52.980]  I said irrespective
[3:16:52.980 --> 3:16:54.980]  of the guns, throw the guns away, throw the
[3:16:54.980 --> 3:16:56.980]  uniforms away, throw the rank away.
[3:16:56.980 --> 3:16:58.980]  You're the army of the Lord because you know I've seen
[3:16:58.980 --> 3:17:00.980]  I've seen Biblical
[3:17:00.980 --> 3:17:02.980]  things happen among these people.
[3:17:02.980 --> 3:17:04.980]  Really? Yes. In a chance. A fellowship.
[3:17:04.980 --> 3:17:06.980]  Really? Unity? Order?
[3:17:06.980 --> 3:17:08.980]  They come to the Lord, do they? They sure do.
[3:17:08.980 --> 3:17:10.980]  I want to tell you something. Here's a bulletin for you.
[3:17:10.980 --> 3:17:12.980]  They are not throwing their guns away and you can
[3:17:12.980 --> 3:17:14.980]  quote me. But you can challenge the observation
[3:17:14.980 --> 3:17:16.980]  if you want and this audience wants to
[3:17:16.980 --> 3:17:18.980]  and when we come back in just a moment.
[3:17:18.980 --> 3:17:30.980]  Music
[3:17:30.980 --> 3:17:32.980]  Sir, I just briefly like to know
[3:17:32.980 --> 3:17:34.980]  like what do you do for jobs? Do you have
[3:17:34.980 --> 3:17:36.980]  normal jobs? You work? Yes, I do.
[3:17:36.980 --> 3:17:38.980]  You're all employed? Absolutely.
[3:17:38.980 --> 3:17:40.980]  And legally
[3:17:40.980 --> 3:17:42.980]  and that was
[3:17:42.980 --> 3:17:44.980]  that was a rotten thing to say.
[3:17:44.980 --> 3:17:46.980]  No, no.
[3:17:46.980 --> 3:17:48.980]  We're not TV commentators.
[3:17:48.980 --> 3:17:50.980]  I would have hoped you would see it
[3:17:50.980 --> 3:17:52.980]  as an attempt by the host to clarify
[3:17:52.980 --> 3:17:54.980]  your rather nebulous
[3:17:54.980 --> 3:17:56.980]  answers. Alright, your grievances
[3:17:56.980 --> 3:17:58.980]  on the record. Yes. Well, you're telling
[3:17:58.980 --> 3:18:00.980]  us we should be afraid of our government. Why
[3:18:00.980 --> 3:18:02.980]  shouldn't we be afraid of you and your
[3:18:02.980 --> 3:18:04.980]  dictating Christian
[3:18:04.980 --> 3:18:06.980]  rules? No, no.
[3:18:06.980 --> 3:18:08.980]  No, no.
[3:18:10.980 --> 3:18:12.980]  What you should be afraid of is comments
[3:18:12.980 --> 3:18:14.980]  like Senator Sam Nunn said on
[3:18:14.980 --> 3:18:16.980]  June 1, 1994
[3:18:16.980 --> 3:18:18.980]  in the New York Times when he said
[3:18:18.980 --> 3:18:20.980]  I think the American people
[3:18:20.980 --> 3:18:22.980]  would welcome a Russian military
[3:18:22.980 --> 3:18:24.980]  force for peacekeeping purposes.
[3:18:24.980 --> 3:18:26.980]  That's what you should be afraid of. Those are the questions
[3:18:26.980 --> 3:18:28.980]  you should ask. You're afraid of the
[3:18:28.980 --> 3:18:30.980]  Ruskies? You're still afraid of Russia?
[3:18:30.980 --> 3:18:32.980]  Why do we need Russian peacekeeping
[3:18:32.980 --> 3:18:34.980]  forces in the United States?
[3:18:34.980 --> 3:18:36.980]  That's what I think we ought to ask.
[3:18:36.980 --> 3:18:38.980]  You're an old cold warrior.
[3:18:38.980 --> 3:18:40.980]  It's over. It's over.
[3:18:40.980 --> 3:18:42.980]  If something bad certainly could happen to
[3:18:42.980 --> 3:18:44.980]  us. Senator Sam Nunn want to bring him here.
[3:18:44.980 --> 3:18:46.980]  Ask him. One of you said
[3:18:46.980 --> 3:18:48.980]  that you're going to make a better world for us.
[3:18:48.980 --> 3:18:50.980]  I don't want to live in that world that you're making.
[3:18:52.980 --> 3:18:54.980]  My friend, you don't know
[3:18:54.980 --> 3:18:56.980]  the world. So you're just
[3:18:56.980 --> 3:18:58.980]  hearing what you hear today. You don't
[3:18:58.980 --> 3:19:00.980]  know us. What world are we making?
[3:19:00.980 --> 3:19:02.980]  You don't know what we believe in. All we are
[3:19:02.980 --> 3:19:04.980]  is public servants. We train every weekend.
[3:19:04.980 --> 3:19:06.980]  You know what we train for? We train in
[3:19:06.980 --> 3:19:08.980]  first aid. We train in compass work. We train
[3:19:08.980 --> 3:19:10.980]  in search and rescue. We're there
[3:19:10.980 --> 3:19:12.980]  in case of a natural disaster that we
[3:19:12.980 --> 3:19:14.980]  can come out and serve and effectively
[3:19:14.980 --> 3:19:16.980]  help people. If a child is lost in the woods
[3:19:16.980 --> 3:19:18.980]  we can have 500 men out there in the woods
[3:19:18.980 --> 3:19:20.980]  helping to find that lost child and serve that
[3:19:20.980 --> 3:19:22.980]  sheriff. We're public servants.
[3:19:22.980 --> 3:19:24.980]  That's all we are.
[3:19:28.980 --> 3:19:30.980]  On September 11th,
[3:19:30.980 --> 3:19:32.980]  2001, along with
[3:19:32.980 --> 3:19:34.980]  you know what I've known is
[3:19:34.980 --> 3:19:36.980]  I was in there listening to the radio.
[3:19:36.980 --> 3:19:38.980]  It's like a minute and a half to light on the Internet.
[3:19:38.980 --> 3:19:40.980]  It got a lot lower once that clip started playing
[3:19:40.980 --> 3:19:42.980]  than me.
[3:19:42.980 --> 3:19:44.980]  No, they're coming out the same levels.
[3:19:44.980 --> 3:19:46.980]  That's weird.
[3:19:46.980 --> 3:19:48.980]  Whatever. Now it doesn't matter.
[3:19:48.980 --> 3:19:50.980]  I always play at the right levels.
[3:19:50.980 --> 3:19:52.980]  No, I hear you.
[3:19:52.980 --> 3:19:54.980]  We're public servants.
[3:20:00.980 --> 3:20:02.980]  On September 11th,
[3:20:02.980 --> 3:20:04.980]  2001, along with
[3:20:04.980 --> 3:20:06.980]  hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to
[3:20:06.980 --> 3:20:08.980]  Ontario and we knew what to do.
[3:20:08.980 --> 3:20:10.980]  At least we thought we did.
[3:20:10.980 --> 3:20:12.980]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11
[3:20:12.980 --> 3:20:14.980]  film that finally gives first responders
[3:20:14.980 --> 3:20:16.980]  a platform to tell their story.
[3:20:16.980 --> 3:20:18.980]  Whitman,
[3:20:18.980 --> 3:20:20.980]  EPA director
[3:20:20.980 --> 3:20:22.980]  on the AT made a statement
[3:20:22.980 --> 3:20:24.980]  that the air
[3:20:24.980 --> 3:20:26.980]  was safe to breathe.
[3:20:26.980 --> 3:20:28.980]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11
[3:20:28.980 --> 3:20:30.980]  truth as brave souls throughout
[3:20:30.980 --> 3:20:32.980]  the world take action against their global
[3:20:32.980 --> 3:20:34.980]  masters. He had his hand over
[3:20:34.980 --> 3:20:36.980]  the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:20:36.980 --> 3:20:38.980]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1,
[3:20:38.980 --> 3:20:40.980]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:20:42.980 --> 3:20:44.980]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:20:54.980 --> 3:20:56.980]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:20:56.980 --> 3:20:58.980]  they're going to commit more acts
[3:20:58.980 --> 3:21:00.980]  and bring in martial law.
[3:21:00.980 --> 3:21:02.980]  As many people know,
[3:21:02.980 --> 3:21:04.980]  ever since president Nixon took us off the gold standard,
[3:21:04.980 --> 3:21:06.980]  the US dollar has been
[3:21:06.980 --> 3:21:08.980]  devaluating. What people don't know, however,
[3:21:08.980 --> 3:21:10.980]  is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[3:21:10.980 --> 3:21:12.980]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios
[3:21:12.980 --> 3:21:14.980]  from losing value? The answer to all of this
[3:21:14.980 --> 3:21:16.980]  is gold and silver. They've both maintained
[3:21:16.980 --> 3:21:18.980]  their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[3:21:18.980 --> 3:21:20.980]  If you had had $100,000
[3:21:20.980 --> 3:21:22.980]  in cash and $100,000
[3:21:22.980 --> 3:21:24.980]  in gold and silver back in
[3:21:24.980 --> 3:21:26.980]  1913 and kept them both until
[3:21:26.980 --> 3:21:28.980]  now, your cash would actually
[3:21:28.980 --> 3:21:30.980]  have the buying power of only $4,800.
[3:21:30.980 --> 3:21:32.980]  But your gold and silver
[3:21:32.980 --> 3:21:34.980]  would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[3:21:34.980 --> 3:21:36.980]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[3:21:36.980 --> 3:21:38.980]  Call me, John Ballman,

[3:21:56.980 --> 3:21:58.980]  extension 169.
[3:22:44.980 --> 3:22:46.980]  If the body has the proper nutrition,
[3:22:46.980 --> 3:22:48.980]  it will heal itself.
[3:22:48.980 --> 3:22:50.980]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow
[3:22:50.980 --> 3:22:52.980]  this crop to grow in the US?
[3:22:52.980 --> 3:22:54.980]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[3:22:54.980 --> 3:22:56.980]  Call 908-691-2608
[3:22:56.980 --> 3:22:58.980]  or go to hempusa.org
[3:22:58.980 --> 3:23:26.980]  today.
[3:23:46.980 --> 3:23:48.980]  Nonetheless, it was the Trockman family
[3:23:48.980 --> 3:23:50.980]  who was the first person there.
[3:23:50.980 --> 3:23:52.980]  Long before any other people
[3:23:52.980 --> 3:23:54.980]  were out for the first part.
[3:23:54.980 --> 3:23:56.980]  Just because of people like you are,
[3:23:56.980 --> 3:23:58.980]  we have to bring the Russians
[3:23:58.980 --> 3:24:00.980]  because we have to keep peace here.
[3:24:10.980 --> 3:24:12.980]  What do we show our children?
[3:24:12.980 --> 3:24:14.980]  We have to show our children
[3:24:14.980 --> 3:24:16.980]  how to keep peace without weapons.
[3:24:16.980 --> 3:24:18.980]  It's about time.
[3:24:18.980 --> 3:24:20.980]  What are you doing?
[3:24:22.980 --> 3:24:24.980]  You're just damaging the next generation.
[3:24:24.980 --> 3:24:26.980]  And you're damaging the life
[3:24:26.980 --> 3:24:28.980]  of your children in the first place.
[3:24:28.980 --> 3:24:30.980]  If you joined us late,
[3:24:30.980 --> 3:24:32.980]  I might be able to help you here.
[3:24:32.980 --> 3:24:34.980]  She said
[3:24:34.980 --> 3:24:36.980]  that it's okay to bring Russian troops here
[3:24:36.980 --> 3:24:38.980]  and they're applauding.
[3:24:38.980 --> 3:24:40.980]  You're applauding that troops are being brought here
[3:24:40.980 --> 3:24:42.980]  and equipment is carrying
[3:24:42.980 --> 3:24:44.980]  deadly nerve gas here.
[3:24:44.980 --> 3:24:46.980]  We have documented evidence of this
[3:24:46.980 --> 3:24:48.980]  being brought here.
[3:24:48.980 --> 3:24:50.980]  We have confirmation from military sources
[3:24:50.980 --> 3:24:52.980]  on the subject and you're clapping.
[3:24:52.980 --> 3:24:54.980]  Sometimes I wonder because I was asked this question
[3:24:54.980 --> 3:24:56.980]  among the thousands of phone calls
[3:24:56.980 --> 3:24:58.980]  my house gets on the militia.
[3:24:58.980 --> 3:25:00.980]  I've been asked this question.
[3:25:00.980 --> 3:25:02.980]  Do you think this country deserves freedom?
[3:25:02.980 --> 3:25:04.980]  Maybe I'm saying from this applause,
[3:25:04.980 --> 3:25:06.980]  I don't mean to alienate the audience.
[3:25:06.980 --> 3:25:08.980]  If we don't get our heads out of the sand
[3:25:08.980 --> 3:25:10.980]  and wake up, we're going to get whatever we deserve.
[3:25:10.980 --> 3:25:12.980]  Why are your children playing with guns?
[3:25:12.980 --> 3:25:14.980]  Where are they getting the guns, lady?
[3:25:14.980 --> 3:25:16.980]  Where do the guns come from?
[3:25:16.980 --> 3:25:18.980]  What is your point?
[3:25:18.980 --> 3:25:20.980]  The point is this.
[3:25:20.980 --> 3:25:22.980]  This is a local sheriff.
[3:25:22.980 --> 3:25:24.980]  You're laughing at this?
[3:25:24.980 --> 3:25:26.980]  This is a local sheriff.
[3:25:26.980 --> 3:25:28.980]  That's his vehicle.
[3:25:28.980 --> 3:25:30.980]  That's an armored vehicle, folks.
[3:25:30.980 --> 3:25:32.980]  It said sheriff on it.
[3:25:32.980 --> 3:25:34.980]  In Washington state, in every major
[3:25:34.980 --> 3:25:36.980]  U.S. city and the small ones,
[3:25:36.980 --> 3:25:38.980]  like Bay City, Michigan,
[3:25:38.980 --> 3:25:40.980]  the police officers are getting hand grenades,
[3:25:40.980 --> 3:25:42.980]  hand grenade launchers,
[3:25:42.980 --> 3:25:44.980]  and CS gas like they used to kill the people in Waco.
[3:25:44.980 --> 3:25:46.980]  If you find humor in that,
[3:25:46.980 --> 3:25:48.980]  talk to me later on because you're looking at
[3:25:48.980 --> 3:25:50.980]  a different radio program.
[3:25:50.980 --> 3:25:52.980]  Let's review it for a second.
[3:25:52.980 --> 3:25:54.980]  Very recently, in our last election,
[3:25:54.980 --> 3:25:56.980]  we threw a lot of what we called the bums
[3:25:56.980 --> 3:25:58.980]  who were spending our money out of government.
[3:25:58.980 --> 3:26:00.980]  We hate government.
[3:26:00.980 --> 3:26:02.980]  We are ready for these guys.
[3:26:02.980 --> 3:26:04.980]  We think government is too big.
[3:26:04.980 --> 3:26:06.980]  We think taxes are confiscatory.
[3:26:06.980 --> 3:26:08.980]  We think the government is knocking down too many doors
[3:26:08.980 --> 3:26:10.980]  without the appropriate papers to do so.
[3:26:10.980 --> 3:26:12.980]  We also think
[3:26:12.980 --> 3:26:14.980]  there are a lot of people standing up
[3:26:14.980 --> 3:26:16.980]  and applauding the government when they do this.
[3:26:16.980 --> 3:26:18.980]  These guys, they
[3:26:18.980 --> 3:26:20.980]  respect the bill of rights.
[3:26:20.980 --> 3:26:22.980]  They don't think anybody from the federal government
[3:26:22.980 --> 3:26:24.980]  should be knocking anybody's door down.
[3:26:24.980 --> 3:26:26.980]  Certainly not without judicial approval,
[3:26:26.980 --> 3:26:28.980]  and so they're taking it one step further.
[3:26:28.980 --> 3:26:30.980]  They're not only voting to throw the guys out,
[3:26:30.980 --> 3:26:32.980]  they're waiting
[3:26:32.980 --> 3:26:34.980]  for anarchy, and when it comes,
[3:26:34.980 --> 3:26:36.980]  they say they're going to be ready, and you're not.
[3:26:36.980 --> 3:26:38.980]  And whenever they get into mainstream media
[3:26:38.980 --> 3:26:40.980]  and a report is given in the paper
[3:26:40.980 --> 3:26:42.980]  about where they're meeting or where they're training,
[3:26:42.980 --> 3:26:44.980]  you draw a big crowd, don't you?
[3:26:44.980 --> 3:26:46.980]  Not 10 million.
[3:26:46.980 --> 3:26:48.980]  Come on, you pull that out of your hat.
[3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:50.980]  I'll make you a watch
[3:26:50.980 --> 3:26:52.980]  if you have 10 million people.
[3:26:52.980 --> 3:26:54.980]  I'll keep your address, and I'll tell you my size.
[3:26:54.980 --> 3:26:56.980]  You don't.
[3:26:56.980 --> 3:26:58.980]  Here's what?
[3:26:58.980 --> 3:27:00.980]  150,000 people. That's max.
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:02.980]  That may be what you have.
[3:27:02.980 --> 3:27:04.980]  Let me point this out.
[3:27:04.980 --> 3:27:06.980]  There's three or four of us that work
[3:27:06.980 --> 3:27:08.980]  on a full-time basis
[3:27:08.980 --> 3:27:10.980]  in just keeping together
[3:27:10.980 --> 3:27:12.980]  the associations.
[3:27:12.980 --> 3:27:14.980]  No radio programs, for example,
[3:27:14.980 --> 3:27:16.980]  in Phoenix, Arizona,
[3:27:16.980 --> 3:27:18.980]  generate 200 phone calls
[3:27:18.980 --> 3:27:20.980]  of persons that want to develop
[3:27:20.980 --> 3:27:22.980]  their own individual groups
[3:27:22.980 --> 3:27:24.980]  of militia.
[3:27:24.980 --> 3:27:26.980]  At this point in time,
[3:27:26.980 --> 3:27:28.980]  we have no idea the best estimate
[3:27:28.980 --> 3:27:30.980]  is anywhere from 8.5 to 10 million,
[3:27:30.980 --> 3:27:32.980]  believe it or not.
[3:27:32.980 --> 3:27:34.980]  Just one question before I break.
[3:27:34.980 --> 3:27:36.980]  Do you stock armament?
[3:27:36.980 --> 3:27:38.980]  Absolutely. We stock whatever is necessary
[3:27:38.980 --> 3:27:40.980]  to protect ourselves.
[3:27:40.980 --> 3:27:42.980]  Would you stock?
[3:27:42.980 --> 3:27:44.980]  That includes semi-automatic weapons
[3:27:44.980 --> 3:27:46.980]  and all the...
[3:27:46.980 --> 3:27:48.980]  Are you talking automatic or semi-
[3:27:48.980 --> 3:27:50.980]  or do you know what the difference is?
[3:27:50.980 --> 3:27:52.980]  What if I don't?
[3:27:52.980 --> 3:27:54.980]  If you don't, then you're in trouble
[3:27:54.980 --> 3:27:56.980]  because I...
[3:27:56.980 --> 3:27:58.980]  Do you stock pile hand grenades?
[3:27:58.980 --> 3:28:00.980]  Absolutely not,
[3:28:00.980 --> 3:28:02.980]  and that's foolishness.
[3:28:02.980 --> 3:28:04.980]  That's illegal, Phil.
[3:28:04.980 --> 3:28:06.980]  You do have AK-47.
[3:28:06.980 --> 3:28:08.980]  That's illegal, Phil.
[3:28:08.980 --> 3:28:10.980]  You have to learn what's legal and illegal
[3:28:10.980 --> 3:28:12.980]  so that you don't get in trouble.
[3:28:12.980 --> 3:28:14.980]  We have two people who are involved
[3:28:14.980 --> 3:28:16.980]  in watching out for human rights,
[3:28:16.980 --> 3:28:18.980]  monitoring the activity
[3:28:18.980 --> 3:28:20.980]  of what many call
[3:28:20.980 --> 3:28:22.980]  extreme right-wing groups.
[3:28:22.980 --> 3:28:24.980]  Gentlemen, maybe you're flattered by that definition.
[3:28:24.980 --> 3:28:26.980]  Absolutely not.
[3:28:26.980 --> 3:28:28.980]  It's totally wrong.
[3:28:28.980 --> 3:28:30.980]  We'll talk with them and give them a chance
[3:28:30.980 --> 3:28:32.980]  to ask their own questions of these folks
[3:28:32.980 --> 3:28:34.980]  when we come back in just a moment.
[3:28:34.980 --> 3:28:38.980]  Music plays
[3:28:38.980 --> 3:28:42.980]  Music plays
[3:28:42.980 --> 3:28:46.980]  Music plays
[3:28:48.980 --> 3:28:50.980]  This is Waco.
[3:28:50.980 --> 3:28:54.980]  Music plays
[3:28:54.980 --> 3:28:56.980]  Here is...
[3:28:56.980 --> 3:28:58.980]  Incidentally, who's responsible for this?
[3:28:58.980 --> 3:29:00.980]  Here is... Incidentally, who's responsible for this?
[3:29:00.980 --> 3:29:02.980]  And you know,
[3:29:02.980 --> 3:29:09.980]  Well, is this the way you want your official response to express itself here?
[3:29:09.980 --> 3:29:11.980]  There you go, folks.
[3:29:11.980 --> 3:29:16.980]  And what we've done here with this kind of action, which incidentally...
[3:29:19.980 --> 3:29:26.980]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:26.980 --> 3:29:32.980]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history...
[3:29:32.980 --> 3:29:37.980]  And yes, folks, we know we're on air. We just do our behind the scenes on air now, so we do it.
[3:29:37.980 --> 3:29:42.980]  All right, going back to John. John, I'll come in, we'll play the last minute or so of that,
[3:29:42.980 --> 3:29:45.980]  then I'll comment on it, then we'll play the next 10-minute piece, okay?
[3:29:45.980 --> 3:29:46.980]  You got it.
[3:29:46.980 --> 3:29:47.980]  Thank you.
[3:29:47.980 --> 3:29:48.980]  No problem.
[3:29:50.980 --> 3:29:52.980]  Works inside the United States.
[3:29:52.980 --> 3:29:58.980]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:29:58.980 --> 3:30:02.980]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:30:02.980 --> 3:30:08.980]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:30:08.980 --> 3:30:14.980]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more, fabled enemies.

[3:30:21.980 --> 3:30:25.980]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:30:28.980 --> 3:30:31.980]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:30:31.980 --> 3:30:33.980]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:30:33.980 --> 3:30:40.980]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[3:30:40.980 --> 3:30:46.980]  finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx.
[3:30:46.980 --> 3:30:51.980]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk. I just talk to clients on the phone,
[3:30:51.980 --> 3:30:54.980]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[3:30:54.980 --> 3:31:17.980]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[3:31:28.980 --> 3:31:30.980]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[3:31:30.980 --> 3:31:36.980]  If you accidentally swallow more than use for brushing, seek professional assistance, or contact a poison control center immediately.
[3:31:36.980 --> 3:31:39.980]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[3:31:39.980 --> 3:31:44.980]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling,
[3:31:44.980 --> 3:31:49.980]  then you need Soley Smile All-Natural Tooth Powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.
[3:31:49.980 --> 3:31:55.980]  Soley Smile contains 84 mineral-rich Himalayan sea salt, baking soda, and xylitol,
[3:31:55.980 --> 3:31:58.980]  a sugar substitute with long-lasting dental benefits.
[3:31:58.980 --> 3:32:04.980]  Soley Smile comes in five flavors, made from great essential oils, so I know it'll please even your kids.
[3:32:04.980 --> 3:32:08.980]  You'll also appreciate the convenient two-ounce airline safe size.
[3:32:08.980 --> 3:32:11.980]  Try some, and you too will have a Soley Smile.
[3:32:11.980 --> 3:32:13.980]  Order some today at SoleySmile.com.
[3:32:13.980 --> 3:32:20.980]  Or call us toll-free, 866-497-0274.
[3:32:20.980 --> 3:32:24.980]  That's 866-497-0274.

[3:32:29.980 --> 3:32:33.980]  Here is, incidentally, who's responsible for this?
[3:32:33.980 --> 3:32:43.980]  And, you know, well, is this the way you want your official response to express itself here?
[3:32:43.980 --> 3:32:45.980]  There you go, folks.
[3:32:45.980 --> 3:32:51.980]  And what we've done here with this kind of action, which incidentally,
[3:32:51.980 --> 3:32:57.980]  I don't know what post-analysis has developed and whether anybody's taken any responsibility,
[3:32:57.980 --> 3:33:04.980]  but that action makes men here who are part of militias feel that they're doing the right thing,
[3:33:04.980 --> 3:33:06.980]  not to be confused with...
[3:33:06.980 --> 3:33:12.980]  The President and also Reno, our Attorney General, took responsibility for it,
[3:33:12.980 --> 3:33:14.980]  and they should rest right on their shoulders.
[3:33:14.980 --> 3:33:16.980]  They need to watch that tape a few times.
[3:33:16.980 --> 3:33:21.980]  Tom Halpern is Associate Director of the Fact-Finding Department at the Anti-Defamation League in New York City.
[3:33:21.980 --> 3:33:28.980]  And you're here with Dennis Hennigan, who is Director of the Legal Action Project of the City of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in D.C.
[3:33:28.980 --> 3:33:30.980]  Is it the Brady Bill?
[3:33:30.980 --> 3:33:34.980]  Another...the crime bill had an anti-automatic weapons provision.
[3:33:34.980 --> 3:33:35.980]  Do I understand that?
[3:33:35.980 --> 3:33:36.980]  A ban on assault weapons.
[3:33:36.980 --> 3:33:37.980]  A ban on assault weapons.
[3:33:37.980 --> 3:33:41.980]  You feel this is just two of stories that excited...
[3:33:41.980 --> 3:33:43.980]  Why don't you just give them a chance?
[3:33:43.980 --> 3:33:44.980]  Thank you.
[3:33:44.980 --> 3:33:50.980]  I think that the enactment of these federal gun control laws were the flashpoints for this militia movement.
[3:33:50.980 --> 3:33:57.980]  Clearly, these people believe that they have a right to resist, by force of arms,
[3:33:57.980 --> 3:34:01.980]  gun control laws that were enacted by a democratic government.
[3:34:01.980 --> 3:34:02.980]  And that's very disturbing.
[3:34:02.980 --> 3:34:06.980]  Yeah, but they would argue, I mean, probably more eloquently than I,
[3:34:06.980 --> 3:34:09.980]  if Koresh had been maybe readier and been able to defend,
[3:34:09.980 --> 3:34:11.980]  maybe he wouldn't have all those dead babies today.
[3:34:11.980 --> 3:34:17.980]  So, you know, what's the difference between self-defense and authorized invasion of a person's home?
[3:34:17.980 --> 3:34:20.980]  I think that's what we're down to trying to define here.
[3:34:20.980 --> 3:34:25.980]  Well, keep in mind, Phil, that Koresh's people were in illegal conduct.
[3:34:25.980 --> 3:34:28.980]  They were illegally converting semi-automatic weapons.
[3:34:28.980 --> 3:34:29.980]  Okay, hit pause there.
[3:34:29.980 --> 3:34:33.980]  We're going to go to the number four clip, right, John?
[3:34:33.980 --> 3:34:35.980]  That clip's over, correct, John?
[3:34:35.980 --> 3:34:36.980]  That's correct.
[3:34:36.980 --> 3:34:40.980]  Okay, we're playing it from the studio up in Minnesota.
[3:34:40.980 --> 3:34:42.980]  It has better audio quality there.
[3:34:42.980 --> 3:34:49.980]  And then we're also, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, playing the video from our end in Texas for people that are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:34:49.980 --> 3:34:53.980]  Now, remember, Henry Paulson's come out now and they're about to pass a bill saying,
[3:34:53.980 --> 3:34:56.980]  total anonymity, total liability protection.
[3:34:56.980 --> 3:34:58.980]  No one can ever even investigate it.
[3:34:58.980 --> 3:35:00.980]  Trillions being stolen.
[3:35:00.980 --> 3:35:01.980]  That's the bailout.
[3:35:01.980 --> 3:35:02.980]  And then it's unlimited.
[3:35:02.980 --> 3:35:04.980]  Just Congress signing over all authority.
[3:35:04.980 --> 3:35:07.980]  Of course, the president declares they have none anyways.
[3:35:07.980 --> 3:35:13.980]  Army brigades being called into the U.S. saying that it's to engage the American people.
[3:35:13.980 --> 3:35:19.980]  Wall-to-wall corruption, bill of rights and tatters, warrantless gun confiscation going on everywhere.
[3:35:19.980 --> 3:35:23.980]  A couple months ago, the governor of Illinois announces they're going to use the army to confiscate guns,
[3:35:23.980 --> 3:35:27.980]  gun confiscation in South Texas, gun confiscation in New Orleans,
[3:35:27.980 --> 3:35:29.980]  gun confiscation going on.
[3:35:29.980 --> 3:35:34.980]  Everything these guys talked about 14 years ago now happening.
[3:35:34.980 --> 3:35:38.980]  And just a completely lawless criminal government.
[3:35:38.980 --> 3:35:42.980]  And then we've got the saps from the ADL and others.
[3:35:42.980 --> 3:35:48.980]  Now it's come out in government declassified documents and FBI files that what we told you over the decade ago,
[3:35:48.980 --> 3:35:51.980]  the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the white supremacist compound.
[3:35:51.980 --> 3:35:53.980]  They had the two head people there into their funding.
[3:35:53.980 --> 3:35:54.980]  Not just there.
[3:35:54.980 --> 3:35:59.980]  They were running the thing with connections to the bombing of Oklahoma City.
[3:35:59.980 --> 3:36:04.980]  So these people are sick, very, very sick.
[3:36:04.980 --> 3:36:05.980]  Let's go ahead.
[3:36:05.980 --> 3:36:07.980]  And by the way, that's been in the mainstream newspapers now.
[3:36:07.980 --> 3:36:09.980]  You're not going to stop us.
[3:36:09.980 --> 3:36:11.980]  The people know what you've done.
[3:36:11.980 --> 3:36:18.980]  And now in hindsight, the first 10 minutes of the interview, the first 20 minutes,
[3:36:18.980 --> 3:36:20.980]  Donahue was attacking them.
[3:36:20.980 --> 3:36:22.980]  He's a well-meaning, bleeding heart liberal.
[3:36:22.980 --> 3:36:25.980]  Then he hears what they say and kind of wakes up halfway in and starts being a little bit nicer.
[3:36:25.980 --> 3:36:29.980]  You notice because they're so eloquent and he's listening.
[3:36:29.980 --> 3:36:32.980]  So he's realizing that he's getting his butt kicked here.
[3:36:32.980 --> 3:36:34.980]  Let's go ahead and go back to the next clip.
[3:36:34.980 --> 3:36:35.980]  Here it is.
[3:36:35.980 --> 3:36:41.980]  Those federal officers were enforcing a gun control law that is very important to public services.
[3:36:41.980 --> 3:36:50.980]  But there's nothing redeeming about the strategy that we use to explore or to enforce the laws that were allegedly being violated by this movement.
[3:36:50.980 --> 3:36:57.980]  I mean, certainly in the cold light of day after this fact, this was a very, very bad decision on the part of the government.
[3:36:57.980 --> 3:37:00.980]  Well, you have to remember, of course, there were two raids in Waco.
[3:37:00.980 --> 3:37:04.980]  In the first one, several federal law enforcement officers were shot and killed.
[3:37:04.980 --> 3:37:05.980]  Yes, they were.
[3:37:05.980 --> 3:37:09.980]  And that's not to excuse what happened in the fiery inferno afterwards.
[3:37:09.980 --> 3:37:10.980]  Right.
[3:37:10.980 --> 3:37:11.980]  My guess is, though, that...
[3:37:11.980 --> 3:37:12.980]  Sir.
[3:37:12.980 --> 3:37:19.980]  I just want to say that kind of an event that I think the militia groups are exploiting as a means of trying to advance their agenda.
[3:37:19.980 --> 3:37:21.980]  And the agenda is...
[3:37:21.980 --> 3:37:28.980]  Well, the agenda is, and it's in the literature that we've seen at the ADL, to thwart gun control laws.
[3:37:28.980 --> 3:37:33.980]  And it claims, now, it gets into these issues of privacy, but then I begin hearing all this stuff about...
[3:37:33.980 --> 3:37:34.980]  All right.
[3:37:34.980 --> 3:37:35.980]  Hit pause.
[3:37:35.980 --> 3:37:36.980]  Hit pause.
[3:37:36.980 --> 3:37:37.980]  Hit pause.
[3:37:37.980 --> 3:37:38.980]  To thwart gun control laws.
[3:37:38.980 --> 3:37:43.980]  That's our right to lobby and try to change government.
[3:37:43.980 --> 3:37:52.980]  Also, it's in the Declaration of Independence that it's a right and a duty to throw off government that tries to take your liberties.
[3:37:52.980 --> 3:37:57.980]  I mean, it's so clear who the anti-Americans are in the situation.
[3:37:57.980 --> 3:37:59.980]  Let's go ahead and go back to it.
[3:37:59.980 --> 3:38:08.980]  And it claims, now, it gets into these issues of privacy, but then I begin hearing all this sort of stuff about the New World Order and a One World Socialist Government.
[3:38:08.980 --> 3:38:12.980]  And that's, I think, the American people kind of know how to judge that.
[3:38:12.980 --> 3:38:14.980]  Oh, hit pause again.
[3:38:14.980 --> 3:38:18.980]  He thinks the American people know how to judge that.
[3:38:18.980 --> 3:38:21.980]  Presidents, prime ministers call for it.
[3:38:21.980 --> 3:38:26.980]  There have been, like, two prime ministers and four or five presidents last month call for it.
[3:38:26.980 --> 3:38:42.980]  Sorry, trying to eat here during the break.
[3:38:42.980 --> 3:38:45.980]  I was eating and I went, hold on, I'm back live.
[3:38:45.980 --> 3:38:46.980]  I want to comment on that.
[3:38:46.980 --> 3:38:47.980]  I'm just going to play it.
[3:38:47.980 --> 3:38:49.980]  There's just so much bull here.
[3:38:49.980 --> 3:38:55.980]  Somebody ought to watch the whole, you know, 50 minutes of this garbage and then write an analysis of it.
[3:38:55.980 --> 3:38:59.980]  But, oh yeah, there's no North American Union, no New World Order.
[3:38:59.980 --> 3:39:06.980]  Foreign corporations aren't, you know, with our tax money that's given to them in bailouts, buying up all our infrastructure.
[3:39:06.980 --> 3:39:08.980]  Just back to it.
[3:39:08.980 --> 3:39:11.980]  Full flak jacket and all helmets and full regalia.
[3:39:11.980 --> 3:39:13.980]  I'm sorry, hit pause again.
[3:39:13.980 --> 3:39:19.980]  Cops and black ski masks, armored vehicles, helicopters, all of this stuff's good.
[3:39:19.980 --> 3:39:23.980]  And these cowardly socialists feel safe.
[3:39:23.980 --> 3:39:29.980]  But then they got that piece of spinach back there.
[3:39:29.980 --> 3:39:31.980]  They feel safe seeing that.
[3:39:31.980 --> 3:39:33.980]  Oh, it's real radio and TV.
[3:39:33.980 --> 3:39:36.980]  So what?
[3:39:36.980 --> 3:39:37.980]  God Almighty.
[3:39:37.980 --> 3:39:39.980]  Oh, I feel better now.
[3:39:39.980 --> 3:39:41.980]  It's still back there though.
[3:39:41.980 --> 3:39:42.980]  You know how it is.
[3:39:42.980 --> 3:39:44.980]  A little bee piece.
[3:39:44.980 --> 3:39:48.980]  There's the culprit right there.
[3:39:48.980 --> 3:39:50.980]  Oh, it doesn't matter anymore.
[3:39:50.980 --> 3:39:51.980]  Whatever.
[3:39:51.980 --> 3:39:52.980]  The government's good.
[3:39:52.980 --> 3:39:53.980]  Let's just agree with the government.
[3:39:53.980 --> 3:39:54.980]  I'm being sarcastic.
[3:39:54.980 --> 3:39:59.980]  By the way, I was just made abreast of the situation about two weeks ago.
[3:39:59.980 --> 3:40:03.980]  And now it's really reached fever pitch, like all stalkers do.
[3:40:03.980 --> 3:40:06.980]  We have to end up going after them legally usually.
[3:40:06.980 --> 3:40:10.980]  Somebody's created 30, 40, 50 accounts.
[3:40:10.980 --> 3:40:12.980]  It's an army of people, as much work as they're doing.
[3:40:12.980 --> 3:40:14.980]  It's got to be at least 10 people.
[3:40:14.980 --> 3:40:19.980]  And they clone things like we, like one of our listeners has the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[3:40:19.980 --> 3:40:22.980]  He creates something that looks like the Alex Jones channel.
[3:40:22.980 --> 3:40:24.980]  It's only slightly different in the name.
[3:40:24.980 --> 3:40:26.980]  And it says, I'm Alex Jones.
[3:40:26.980 --> 3:40:30.980]  And I've got to watch what I say because then they'll edit it.
[3:40:30.980 --> 3:40:33.980]  But they say things like, I'm Alex Jones.
[3:40:33.980 --> 3:40:38.980]  And then they say, I want to, you know, K-I-L-L.
[3:40:38.980 --> 3:40:40.980]  That's what they say, Bill O'Reilly.
[3:40:40.980 --> 3:40:44.980]  And then they also take things I say on the show.
[3:40:44.980 --> 3:40:48.980]  And they edit them all together to where it sounds like that.
[3:40:48.980 --> 3:40:53.980]  And it's the same kind of black ops we saw with Malkin's people who were with her.
[3:40:53.980 --> 3:40:55.980]  Screaming, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin.
[3:40:55.980 --> 3:40:58.980]  And then having that put out on national news.
[3:40:58.980 --> 3:41:01.980]  So they're definitely taking the gloves off.
[3:41:01.980 --> 3:41:05.980]  And they've got me, there's all these channels with video edited.
[3:41:05.980 --> 3:41:10.980]  With, you know, me saying, you know, I hate America, stuff like that edited together.
[3:41:10.980 --> 3:41:14.980]  Because they can take hundreds of hours of radio and edit them together.
[3:41:14.980 --> 3:41:16.980]  And it's just a full court press.
[3:41:16.980 --> 3:41:19.980]  People claiming they're patriots. People who say they aren't patriots.
[3:41:19.980 --> 3:41:23.980]  It's people who admittedly are military. It's government.
[3:41:23.980 --> 3:41:25.980]  But it's not working, guys.
[3:41:25.980 --> 3:41:28.980]  I mean, no one believes anything you say anymore.
[3:41:28.980 --> 3:41:33.980]  And people are going to find out that those aren't my YouTube channels.
[3:41:33.980 --> 3:41:37.980]  They're going to find out that you've edited that video of me.
[3:41:37.980 --> 3:41:39.980]  And they're going to find out what you're doing.
[3:41:39.980 --> 3:41:41.980]  And I'm only one person.
[3:41:41.980 --> 3:41:45.980]  You can even probably destroy me down the road with physical means in other ways.
[3:41:45.980 --> 3:41:47.980]  But you can't destroy the message.
[3:41:47.980 --> 3:41:49.980]  The ideas are bulletproof and they go on.
[3:41:49.980 --> 3:41:51.980]  So let's just understand that this is life and death.
[3:41:51.980 --> 3:41:52.980]  This is really serious.
[3:41:52.980 --> 3:41:54.980]  The enemy is doing everything they can to stop us.
[3:41:54.980 --> 3:42:02.980]  And I need all of you out there to intensify your efforts with YouTube and LiveLeak and DailyMotion.
[3:42:02.980 --> 3:42:06.980]  You know, don't just post my videos or the audio on YouTube and Google.
[3:42:06.980 --> 3:42:08.980]  Do it everywhere. Intensify.
[3:42:08.980 --> 3:42:10.980]  I mean, they really don't like what we're doing.
[3:42:10.980 --> 3:42:12.980]  It's hurting them badly.
[3:42:12.980 --> 3:42:14.980]  I mean, here's one right here.
[3:42:14.980 --> 3:42:17.980]  So they will edit it.
[3:42:17.980 --> 3:42:18.980]  They monitor it.
[3:42:18.980 --> 3:42:21.980]  It's definitely government or a large corporation.
[3:42:21.980 --> 3:42:32.980]  And it says right here, first psychopath to kill Bill O'Reilly will get one million donation from infowars.com.
[3:42:32.980 --> 3:42:34.980]  This is not a joke of parody.
[3:42:34.980 --> 3:42:37.980]  This is serious call to execute someone for money.
[3:42:37.980 --> 3:42:38.980]  It is not terrorism.
[3:42:38.980 --> 3:42:40.980]  I am Alex Jones, a patriot.
[3:42:40.980 --> 3:42:47.980]  How this works is, again, I was reading what the person claiming to be me is saying.
[3:42:47.980 --> 3:42:50.980]  They will no doubt edit that and put it out.
[3:42:50.980 --> 3:42:55.980]  And this is generally what's done to someone before they're killed or set up.
[3:42:55.980 --> 3:42:59.980]  Because there's all sorts of other dirty tricks I don't have time to go into.
[3:42:59.980 --> 3:43:02.980]  And I should take threats to myself more seriously.
[3:43:02.980 --> 3:43:07.980]  I'm kind of calmly sitting around joking and laughing about it because it lets me know I'm really hurting.
[3:43:07.980 --> 3:43:14.980]  And again, you see all these patriot groups who've been active operating for a while and they activate and suddenly start attacking me.
[3:43:14.980 --> 3:43:17.980]  They tried to build their street cred before they did that.
[3:43:17.980 --> 3:43:20.980]  And I am the big kahuna in this movement and they really are coming after me.
[3:43:20.980 --> 3:43:22.980]  Which lets me know we're hurting them.
[3:43:22.980 --> 3:43:26.980]  And I just put everything in God's hands and it's going to be all right.
[3:43:26.980 --> 3:43:32.980]  But they have created websites, AlexJones.blogspot.com.
[3:43:32.980 --> 3:43:38.980]  And I need you, the listeners, to contact them and let them know that they're going to end up getting sued over this.
[3:43:38.980 --> 3:43:41.980]  This is not a parody. They say it's not a parody on here.
[3:43:41.980 --> 3:43:43.980]  So they're holding it out as if it's real.
[3:43:43.980 --> 3:43:50.980]  Blogspot needs to know that needs to be removed and any other fake accounts holding themselves out as me need to be removed.
[3:43:50.980 --> 3:44:09.980]  YouTube needs to remove the full channel is a close copy to what the real AlexJones channel that's also just a listener is saying and doing.
[3:44:09.980 --> 3:44:11.980]  And it's just unbelievable.
[3:44:11.980 --> 3:44:19.980]  On this channel, they're putting all the I'm a Catholic agent stuff when I'm not even Catholic, but I'm not bashing Catholics either.
[3:44:19.980 --> 3:44:25.980]  They're putting all of the 9-11 truths dead stuff.
[3:44:25.980 --> 3:44:27.980]  It's just standard government operation.
[3:44:27.980 --> 3:44:31.980]  And there's now hundreds of these accounts that they're just all over the web.
[3:44:31.980 --> 3:44:33.980]  This is a huge operation.
[3:44:33.980 --> 3:44:37.980]  And we need to get screenshots of this because the enemy is going to try to blip in and blip out.
[3:44:37.980 --> 3:44:41.980]  They've also been doing that changing it every time YouTube looks at it.
[3:44:41.980 --> 3:44:48.980]  And so they're claiming that I am calling for the murder of people on here, which of course I'm not.
[3:44:48.980 --> 3:44:53.980]  And they're also editing together things I've said in the past to make it sound like I'm saying that.
[3:44:53.980 --> 3:44:55.980]  And they're really coming after me right now.
[3:44:55.980 --> 3:44:59.980]  So they claim I'm holding out murder for hire in this clip.
[3:44:59.980 --> 3:45:09.980]  And then what they do is they then file similar complaints trying to get the legitimate channels that promote what I'm saying and doing.
[3:45:09.980 --> 3:45:13.980]  They then flag those and they've gotten a bunch of accounts deleted.
[3:45:13.980 --> 3:45:18.980]  Because the YouTube people aren't really paying attention or they admit they're following Lieberman's staff, maybe they know.
[3:45:18.980 --> 3:45:19.980]  Who knows?
[3:45:19.980 --> 3:45:20.980]  Maybe it's them.
[3:45:20.980 --> 3:45:22.980]  I don't know at this point because they're going along with it.
[3:45:22.980 --> 3:45:25.980]  The people will create accounts that sound like other people's accounts.
[3:45:25.980 --> 3:45:29.980]  They will then go and say kill everyone or murder these people.
[3:45:29.980 --> 3:45:33.980]  And then say that I said it or others said it and put it in my name.
[3:45:33.980 --> 3:45:35.980]  And then they will have the accounts deleted.
[3:45:35.980 --> 3:45:38.980]  So that's the main reason for all of this.
[3:45:38.980 --> 3:45:45.980]  Now this person needs to know that the FBI will probably give them a visit.
[3:45:45.980 --> 3:45:47.980]  And I'm not joking about that.
[3:45:47.980 --> 3:45:48.980]  I'm a kind of profile person.
[3:45:48.980 --> 3:46:03.980]  Other folks, what you don't understand is when you go out and you say I want murder for hire, just because you try to blame it on me, doesn't mean that then the government doesn't still consider that a solicitation for murder for hire.
[3:46:03.980 --> 3:46:10.980]  Because now some cases they don't know anything about it because it is government or it's contractors or it's a group of mentally ill people.
[3:46:10.980 --> 3:46:11.980]  We don't know.
[3:46:11.980 --> 3:46:13.980]  We'll find out if this is government.
[3:46:13.980 --> 3:46:19.980]  If this continues, this is government or someone who is protected by government.
[3:46:19.980 --> 3:46:24.980]  But again, people are holding out all over the web that I am soliciting murder for hire.
[3:46:24.980 --> 3:46:40.980]  And they are also putting out a bunch of anti-Semitic stuff and claiming that I put it out.
[3:46:40.980 --> 3:46:45.980]  This looks like an ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center operation.
[3:46:45.980 --> 3:46:56.980]  Just the people we were just talking about just now, the Southern Poverty Law Center that ran the two top people that founded the Elohim City Nazi compound that was then involved in the bombing of Oklahoma City.
[3:46:56.980 --> 3:47:00.980]  Now come out in the major newspapers and in FBI documents.
[3:47:00.980 --> 3:47:01.980]  So they don't play games.
[3:47:01.980 --> 3:47:06.980]  And if anybody bombs a federal building, it's not me or any of my listeners.
[3:47:06.980 --> 3:47:08.980]  I mean, this is false flag.
[3:47:08.980 --> 3:47:17.980]  They've already had people dressed up wearing a mask of Alex Jones, a big sign saying, I bombed the, you know, they got a mask on, saying, I'm Alex Jones.
[3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:21.980]  I bombed the military recruiting center.
[3:47:21.980 --> 3:47:24.980]  And, you know, doing that in front of news cameras.
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:29.980]  And it's just all sorts of operations to say 9-11-Truth's doing this.
[3:47:29.980 --> 3:47:33.980]  We're the ones that expose that you guys run false flags.
[3:47:33.980 --> 3:47:38.980]  So it is getting really, really bad.
[3:47:38.980 --> 3:47:42.980]  But I want everybody to know this is the kind of stuff gets me up out of bed in the morning.
[3:47:42.980 --> 3:47:47.980]  A lot of people get intimidated, get death threats, get death threats on their children and their wife.
[3:47:47.980 --> 3:47:50.980]  And it makes them wet themselves and go crown the corner.
[3:47:50.980 --> 3:47:52.980]  My ancestors weren't like that.
[3:47:52.980 --> 3:47:54.980]  You can call it nature, nurture, whatever.
[3:47:54.980 --> 3:48:02.980]  But my ancestors were the always the tip of the spear on both sides of my family in pioneers of this country, love them or hate them.
[3:48:02.980 --> 3:48:04.980]  And we like to fight.
[3:48:04.980 --> 3:48:05.980]  We like adversity.
[3:48:05.980 --> 3:48:07.980]  We like going up against scum.
[3:48:07.980 --> 3:48:11.980]  And I'm just going to tell you right now that I actually wouldn't have the energy in.
[3:48:11.980 --> 3:48:12.980]  And it's wrong.
[3:48:12.980 --> 3:48:17.980]  I'm trying not to tap into the energy that I get from people attacking me because it gives me energy.
[3:48:17.980 --> 3:48:19.980]  It gives me power to resist.
[3:48:19.980 --> 3:48:28.980]  But I want to do it from a position of love and a position of calm focus, which I did the first few hours of the show today.
[3:48:28.980 --> 3:48:31.980]  Because I'm more effective that way.
[3:48:31.980 --> 3:48:37.980]  But I feel better and it's more aggressive to just go ahead and focus on people attacking me.
[3:48:37.980 --> 3:48:39.980]  And then I can work 18 hours a day.
[3:48:39.980 --> 3:48:44.980]  But I can work 14 or 15 with love and it's better product, better info.
[3:48:44.980 --> 3:48:49.980]  So, but I mean, this does not intimidate me.
[3:48:49.980 --> 3:48:54.980]  And but and I try not to get distracted or diverted by the attacks.
[3:48:54.980 --> 3:48:59.980]  But in a way, we need to let folks know this fire base is taking heavy hits.
[3:48:59.980 --> 3:49:01.980]  A lot of attacks right now.
[3:49:01.980 --> 3:49:04.980]  But we can, you like Jiu Jitsu or Judo, they're coming at us.
[3:49:04.980 --> 3:49:07.980]  We can step out of the way and let them go crashing through the wall.
[3:49:07.980 --> 3:49:16.980]  And so if you recognize we're under attack, take our info, boost it, get it out to people, explain to people that we really are under attack.
[3:49:16.980 --> 3:49:17.980]  You know, you'll know them by their fruits.
[3:49:17.980 --> 3:49:20.980]  Look at all the people we've woken up through you, the listeners.
[3:49:20.980 --> 3:49:21.980]  Look at what we've done.
[3:49:21.980 --> 3:49:23.980]  Look at the success we've had.
[3:49:23.980 --> 3:49:28.980]  And then look at just the unprecedented attacks that we are under.
[3:49:28.980 --> 3:49:31.980]  I mean, it is just absolutely.
[3:49:31.980 --> 3:49:36.980]  I mean, if I tried to come in there, I've probably seen more than 50 accounts and I'm not even looking for them.
[3:49:36.980 --> 3:49:41.980]  And people all over ABC and Houston Chronicle and every other website saying I'm Alex Jones.
[3:49:41.980 --> 3:49:50.980]  I hate inwards and you know, I'm Alex Jones or stuff that looks like it's serious or and it just goes on and on and on.
[3:49:50.980 --> 3:49:53.980]  And this is criminal to go say I'm Alex Jones.
[3:49:53.980 --> 3:50:01.980]  I'm a reporter and I want, you know, you to go out and I want you to kill people and I'm going to pay you money.
[3:50:01.980 --> 3:50:07.980]  But seeing reality, Michael Reagan does that and says kill these 9-11 truthers, kill Mark Dice, I'll pay for it.
[3:50:07.980 --> 3:50:09.980]  He doesn't get in trouble.
[3:50:09.980 --> 3:50:13.980]  Then they hold it out and say I said kill Michelle Malcolm, which is proven I didn't.
[3:50:13.980 --> 3:50:15.980]  And then now they're creating fake accounts.
[3:50:15.980 --> 3:50:20.980]  Look, guys in the military that are doing this, your mama's going to lose her pension fund.
[3:50:20.980 --> 3:50:21.980]  So are you.
[3:50:21.980 --> 3:50:23.980]  I'm going to skip this break for him for worse listeners.
[3:50:23.980 --> 3:50:26.980]  I'm really trying to help you, even if you don't know that.
[3:50:26.980 --> 3:50:28.980]  Here we go.
[3:50:28.980 --> 3:50:34.980]  You get these young guys who've been in Iraq and, you know, they're sergeants by now, a lot of them.
[3:50:34.980 --> 3:50:36.980]  They've taken millions of dollars in payoffs.
[3:50:36.980 --> 3:50:37.980]  That's admitted.
[3:50:37.980 --> 3:50:41.980]  Billions are flown in every week, give them to the troops, just payoffs to commit crimes.
[3:50:41.980 --> 3:50:43.980]  They pay off the local governments.
[3:50:43.980 --> 3:50:45.980]  They paid off local governments here in the U.S., not just Iraq.
[3:50:45.980 --> 3:50:49.980]  And they come back and they do this in their little sitcom areas.
[3:50:49.980 --> 3:50:53.980]  And then they're really trying to flood the web right now.
[3:50:53.980 --> 3:50:55.980]  Lieberman's saying shut the web down.
[3:50:55.980 --> 3:51:00.980]  Europe's voting to try to shut large sectors of it down on the next few days.
[3:51:00.980 --> 3:51:02.980]  They're attacking it from hundreds of angles.
[3:51:02.980 --> 3:51:09.980]  And in Europe, they're trying to pass something about how you got to have an ID or your name, who you are on the web.
[3:51:09.980 --> 3:51:12.980]  And see, that sounds great, but that's all going to be selectively enforced.
[3:51:12.980 --> 3:51:18.980]  And they use examples like this, this terrorism that's going on, against legislators and others with people on the web,
[3:51:18.980 --> 3:51:19.980]  posing as them.
[3:51:19.980 --> 3:51:23.980]  It's like they're posing as me and other prominent people to go after them.
[3:51:23.980 --> 3:51:24.980]  But you always notice who it is.
[3:51:24.980 --> 3:51:26.980]  It's patriots, anti-New World Order.
[3:51:26.980 --> 3:51:28.980]  It's liberals who are against the war.
[3:51:28.980 --> 3:51:31.980]  It's real conservatives who are against open borders.
[3:51:31.980 --> 3:51:38.980]  You know, 100 fake sites will be put up that look real where, you know, you'll have a congressman who's against open borders
[3:51:38.980 --> 3:51:44.980]  for sovereignty issues and security issues saying, you know, things like, you know,
[3:51:44.980 --> 3:51:48.980]  I'm congressman such and such, and I hate black people, and I hate, you know,
[3:51:48.980 --> 3:51:52.980]  and they'll use racist terms for Mexicans or Latinos.
[3:51:52.980 --> 3:51:55.980]  It's just every dirty trick in the book.
[3:51:55.980 --> 3:52:01.980]  They are just pulling out all the stops for whatever's coming here in the next few months, next year.
[3:52:01.980 --> 3:52:03.980]  And just God help us.
[3:52:03.980 --> 3:52:05.980]  I keep telling you the last six months, man, don't you feel it?
[3:52:05.980 --> 3:52:07.980]  Don't you feel the big financial collapse coming?
[3:52:07.980 --> 3:52:09.980]  Don't you feel war coming?
[3:52:09.980 --> 3:52:10.980]  And just God help us.
[3:52:10.980 --> 3:52:16.980]  They are really trying to create just a fog of war, a fog of disinfo and intimidate people to go,
[3:52:16.980 --> 3:52:18.980]  well, I don't want to go create a website.
[3:52:18.980 --> 3:52:21.980]  I don't want to go on the web and do stuff.
[3:52:21.980 --> 3:52:23.980]  They'll create fake accounts of me.
[3:52:23.980 --> 3:52:25.980]  If you don't, they're going to win.
[3:52:25.980 --> 3:52:28.980]  We need more people to show their faces, more people to come online.
[3:52:28.980 --> 3:52:30.980]  We need more people to speak out and say no.
[3:52:30.980 --> 3:52:34.980]  And we need all you info lawyers who've spent an hour or two fighting the info war online.
[3:52:34.980 --> 3:52:36.980]  You just spend four or five hours a day.
[3:52:36.980 --> 3:52:41.980]  Quit watching your favorite sitcom, don't go get drunk with your buddies, or don't go fishing this weekend.
[3:52:41.980 --> 3:52:46.980]  We need you to fight the info war, also physically calling on the talk radio, do an access show.
[3:52:46.980 --> 3:52:48.980]  Now is the time to shine.
[3:52:48.980 --> 3:52:50.980]  Now is the time to get the word out.
[3:52:50.980 --> 3:52:55.980]  Tomorrow I'll air the last 15 minutes of that Donahue piece and analyze it.
[3:52:55.980 --> 3:52:57.980]  I was going to air that, but they're in the break.
[3:52:57.980 --> 3:53:00.980]  I've been looking at all these.
[3:53:00.980 --> 3:53:10.980]  Yeah, there's going to have to be an investigation of this and they will just, it's just incredible what they're doing here.
[3:53:10.980 --> 3:53:14.980]  And it's like people on here going, Alex Jones, you're a terrorist.
[3:53:14.980 --> 3:53:18.980]  I've reported you to YouTube, FBI, Homeland Security, Secret Service, CIA.
[3:53:18.980 --> 3:53:21.980]  They're going to get you.
[3:53:21.980 --> 3:53:22.980]  And it just goes on.
[3:53:22.980 --> 3:53:23.980]  You got idiots in there agreeing.
[3:53:23.980 --> 3:53:24.980]  I agree with Alex.
[3:53:24.980 --> 3:53:26.980]  Let's get O'Reilly.
[3:53:26.980 --> 3:53:28.980]  And then it'll be in the news.
[3:53:28.980 --> 3:53:30.980]  Alex Jones says it in the news will show up and I'll say, I didn't say it.
[3:53:30.980 --> 3:53:32.980]  They'll go, isn't this you?
[3:53:32.980 --> 3:53:36.980]  But see, they know it in me, but they know the public's dumbed down and not really paying attention.
[3:53:36.980 --> 3:53:59.980]  Here we go.
[3:53:59.980 --> 3:54:02.980]  But he can play the guitar just like he's ringing a bell.
[3:54:02.980 --> 3:54:04.980]  Let's it go.
[3:54:04.980 --> 3:54:18.980]  Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:54:18.980 --> 3:54:22.980]  You know, it's actually a great blessing.
[3:54:22.980 --> 3:54:23.980]  It is.
[3:54:23.980 --> 3:54:33.980]  It's a blessing to have hundreds of fake websites being created where they're falsely claiming that I'm calling for the murder of media figures and other people.
[3:54:33.980 --> 3:54:35.980]  And the death threats are a blessing.
[3:54:35.980 --> 3:54:40.980]  It is all a blessing because it means that I'm doing my job.
[3:54:40.980 --> 3:54:42.980]  It means we're warning people about the deadly vaccines.
[3:54:42.980 --> 3:54:44.980]  We're warning them about the mercury.
[3:54:44.980 --> 3:54:48.980]  We're warning them about the poisons in the water, the fluoride, other things.
[3:54:48.980 --> 3:54:51.980]  And governments are saying people aren't taking shots anymore.
[3:54:51.980 --> 3:54:53.980]  We've got to ban the freedom on the Internet.
[3:54:53.980 --> 3:54:56.980]  You know, they're actually saying 9-11 truth taking over.
[3:54:56.980 --> 3:54:57.980]  We've got to ban them.
[3:54:57.980 --> 3:55:03.980]  Now that's what they say in the halls of Congress and Parliament and Europe and with big UN meetings they had this week.
[3:55:03.980 --> 3:55:04.980]  It's all official.
[3:55:04.980 --> 3:55:08.980]  But then they go on the Internet and tell us, oh, your 9-11 truth's dead.
[3:55:08.980 --> 3:55:12.980]  And suddenly from hundreds of different areas, it's, you know, from the establishment, from the patriot movement.
[3:55:12.980 --> 3:55:13.980]  9-11's dead.
[3:55:13.980 --> 3:55:14.980]  9-11's dead.
[3:55:14.980 --> 3:55:15.980]  9-11's dead.
[3:55:15.980 --> 3:55:16.980]  Oh, you lost it.
[3:55:16.980 --> 3:55:17.980]  I tell you, nobody cares.
[3:55:17.980 --> 3:55:18.980]  Nobody's believing you.
[3:55:18.980 --> 3:55:25.980]  Forget all these government officials and Hollywood people and music stars and scientists and physicists going public and people waking up to false flag terror
[3:55:25.980 --> 3:55:28.980]  mainstream news reporting on changing one of the state's terror attacks.
[3:55:28.980 --> 3:55:29.980]  None of that matters.
[3:55:29.980 --> 3:55:30.980]  9-11's dead.
[3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:31.980]  9-11's dead.
[3:55:31.980 --> 3:55:32.980]  9-11's dead.
[3:55:32.980 --> 3:55:41.980]  And they are just going absolutely hog wild right now.
[3:55:41.980 --> 3:55:44.980]  You know what's going to happen?
[3:55:44.980 --> 3:55:49.980]  People that have discernment are going to find out that this is not Alan Jones on the web.
[3:55:49.980 --> 3:55:54.980]  And then they're going to notice that people are claiming I'm anti-Semitic or I'm a Catholic secret agent or all these lies.
[3:55:54.980 --> 3:56:02.980]  They're going to see all that disinfo with this where they have, you know, my face up there with the caption up there, you know, to go after Bill O'Reilly to
[3:56:02.980 --> 3:56:03.980]  killing.
[3:56:03.980 --> 3:56:04.980]  That's what they're saying.
[3:56:04.980 --> 3:56:05.980]  I'm saying.
[3:56:05.980 --> 3:56:11.980]  In my name with a clone of a popular Alex Jones channel that gets millions of views a month that isn't even mine.
[3:56:11.980 --> 3:56:12.980]  Somebody just set it up.
[3:56:12.980 --> 3:56:17.980]  The person offered it to us and I just like, I don't have the personnel to control that or run that.
[3:56:17.980 --> 3:56:23.980]  Now I've got a worry that talk show hosts and people that I know behind the scenes of attack me will try to go over to that channel and get on it.
[3:56:23.980 --> 3:56:26.980]  I just don't have time to mess with this stuff.
[3:56:26.980 --> 3:56:28.980]  Maybe we should ask that person to give us that channel.
[3:56:28.980 --> 3:56:32.980]  The point is, is that this over here is a clone of that.
[3:56:32.980 --> 3:56:33.980]  But there's hundreds of these.
[3:56:33.980 --> 3:56:35.980]  I mean, I mean, I've seen more than 50.
[3:56:35.980 --> 3:56:40.980]  And people are telling me they're just everywhere, you know, saying this.
[3:56:40.980 --> 3:56:47.980]  But even those that get gulped into this are later going to find out it's a lie, maybe a month, maybe a year, and then feel foolish.
[3:56:47.980 --> 3:56:56.980]  And now they will have the pallet or the acumen or the discernment in the future and they'll say, my God, this guy's the real deal.
[3:56:56.980 --> 3:57:03.980]  Because, you know, people creating mass detailed, you know, 50-something plus fake websites that took a lot of time and energy apiece.
[3:57:03.980 --> 3:57:04.980]  That's not one person.
