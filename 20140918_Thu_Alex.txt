[02:47.920 --> 02:51.520]  you've got the the accelerated dumbing down on one side while you have the
[02:51.520 --> 02:54.840]  accelerated awakening on the other and I just want to stay on the side of the
[02:54.840 --> 02:58.120]  accelerated awakening and all the interesting things that are happening in
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.840]  the marvels that we're seeing unfold because the more tyranny the system
[03:02.840 --> 03:07.360]  puts in place the more their approval rating drops the more people in the
[03:07.360 --> 03:12.040]  system wake up and realize it all really is a fraud and the more people realize
[03:12.040 --> 03:18.040]  that the criminal justice system at the federal level is completely a hoax with
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.400]  parallel construction staged rigged rigged judges rigged everything people
[03:23.400 --> 03:26.680]  realize the government's out there setting up libertarians and conservatives
[03:26.680 --> 03:30.760]  they realize that there is a fifth column within the libertarian conservative
[03:30.760 --> 03:38.640]  movement of basically FBI agents and others that are batten for the other

[03:51.160 --> 03:54.720]  none of us are perfect but what matters is you got to care about the little guy
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.720]  you got to care about justice you got to care about wanting to build others up
[03:58.720 --> 04:04.920]  and wanting to have a better world don't be a hater haters are just soulless

[04:26.960 --> 04:32.320]  had maybe one sociopath out of 30 or so now it's maybe two out of ten they're
[04:32.320 --> 04:38.280]  just robots they're not even real and I feel so sorry for them because they're
[04:38.280 --> 04:43.960]  so dead inside they're always putting off a facsimile of why they're doing
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.080]  something for a moral reason for those they're there they're trying to

[08:58.800 --> 09:04.600]  the kingdom of humanity returned this republic to something that looks a
[09:04.600 --> 09:12.320]  little bit more like a free country and not a nightmare 2.0 1984 i've told
[09:12.320 --> 09:19.040]  everybody the last few months my spider sense has been off the chart for this
[09:19.040 --> 09:24.000]  country in this world because the narrative is wearing paper thin now
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.960]  like bible pages on how our government criminal elements of it are publicly
[09:32.960 --> 09:39.360]  funding al-qaeda known as ices and we played that clip yesterday twice that i
[09:39.360 --> 09:44.320]  and i watched it again last night but i couldn't sleep in the thunderstorms like
[09:44.320 --> 09:48.240]  the end of the world or something we're so intense here for like six seven hours
[09:48.240 --> 09:55.360]  straight i got up like three in the morning stumbled down to the computer
[09:55.360 --> 09:59.120]  and i went back and i watched the hearing from
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.760]  tuesday with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general dimsey
[10:05.760 --> 10:09.440]  i've watched a lot of his testimony so i know his body language
[10:09.440 --> 10:12.560]  not a lot more respect for him after i learned that he went to obama
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.760]  15 months ago and they're about to strike the syrian military for no reason
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.800]  so that al-qaeda could take over our military said we're not going to do it
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.480]  dimsey came and said you know this just cannot happen
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.600]  that even came out in the press later but they're back now they've rebranded it
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.080]  okay we have to put troops in on the ground and bomb things as dimsey said
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.680]  in the hearing yesterday to remove the bad rebels that are 90 plus percent
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.360]  and schaefer colonel schaefer was saying that last week it's now in the news
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.560]  they're saying 80 plus percent and they just blew up last week the
[10:52.560 --> 10:55.840]  entire rebel leadership
[10:57.760 --> 11:02.400]  that wasn't wanting to blow up every church they found
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.080]  even the supposed non-radical well hobbyists are just absolutely blood
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.000]  thirsty out of their minds clearly i mean it's not propaganda to say these
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.520]  people are literally out of their minds it's like
[11:13.520 --> 11:20.640]  they're on pcp without taking it all the time just a scourge
[11:20.640 --> 11:23.840]  and criminal elements that run our government want to take our liberties
[11:23.840 --> 11:26.240]  are funding them and general dimsey can we
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.120]  find that again and play that thank you they already had it ready
[11:31.120 --> 11:33.920]  they never know where i'm going next i would have all have all this news to
[11:33.920 --> 11:37.760]  cover not just one half in this direction because
[11:38.400 --> 11:41.920]  if you know what you're seeing there if you watch enough of these arm services
[11:41.920 --> 11:46.960]  committees in the senate lindsay graham the chicken hawk
[11:46.960 --> 11:53.680]  is up there mr amnesty mr says he's for guns but then votes against him
[11:53.680 --> 11:58.160]  he's up there and he's saying well there's really no evidence that you know
[11:58.160 --> 12:02.480]  there's anybody helping ices any of our allies he's well yeah no
[12:02.480 --> 12:06.160]  some of our allies are arming them he's like wait a minute let's not you
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.360]  know get on him here i mean they just made a mistake
[12:09.360 --> 12:16.320]  and dimsey is just looking at him like you are the biggest liar on the planet
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.560]  because it is just a total joke 90 or more of the military
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.160]  knows the whole battle plan because they know how the military operates they
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.440]  know the players they study it even if they're a
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.760]  private that's only been in a year they know the players
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.480]  and dimsey knows whether he's a good guy or a bad guy that this is crazy
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.840]  this is like a headline today info wars dot com from gateway pundit actual
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.440]  headline global warming likely to cause colder
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.640]  and snowier winners scientists say you just can't make this stuff up and
[12:52.640 --> 12:59.760]  that's from aol
[12:59.760 --> 13:05.120]  i mean it's just i mean that's two plus two equals five it is just
[13:05.120 --> 13:10.560]  it is absolute premeditated bull they said in the 60s and 70s it was an
[13:10.560 --> 13:13.680]  ice age so we had to tax carbon and stuff
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.840]  and have global government then they said it was global warming now it's just
[13:17.840 --> 13:21.440]  change period folks the planet's always changing
[13:21.440 --> 13:23.920]  and it's not that we don't have real environmental issues
[13:23.920 --> 13:26.960]  it's that they just want a high jacket to run society
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.240]  and exempt themselves from all the regulations they put us under and then
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.280]  it's called feudalism it's called serfdom it's called game over
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.560]  the government is illegitimate it's exempt the fourth amendment it just spies
[13:40.560 --> 13:44.800]  on everything creates fake court cases i mean it's in ap and
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.520]  mclatchy and roiders for two years and wall street journal that i told you
[13:49.520 --> 13:52.800]  15 years ago because i was told this by federal agents
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.320]  who were retiring and one of them was high level and he said
[13:58.320 --> 14:02.400]  you'd have to be a criminal now to join this and be part of it
[14:02.400 --> 14:05.920]  and he said i just hope i can make enough money and retirement as a consultant
[14:05.920 --> 14:08.720]  to get out of here
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.080]  but that's an exact quote to get out of here one of my dad's friends
[14:14.080 --> 14:19.920]  to get out of here
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.600]  well guess what that was 20 years ago folks are longer
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.720]  most of them got out of there at the high levels and it is just packed
[14:28.720 --> 14:33.520]  with sociopathic criminals that will do anything and love hurting good people
[14:33.520 --> 14:36.720]  and love being able to carry out psychopathic operations
[14:36.720 --> 14:42.560]  and not get in any trouble for it it's just a wonderland and there's still a
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.520]  lot of good people at the local level even the federal but they're not
[14:45.520 --> 14:48.960]  running things anymore the bad guys are in charge
[14:48.960 --> 14:52.560]  but they got arrogant like criminals always do
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.200]  they got arrogant so they get up on television
[14:57.200 --> 15:04.160]  and they tell the world that we've got to bomb the rebels to stop
[15:04.160 --> 15:07.280]  isis when the rebels are isis they tell you
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.640]  two plus two equals five i know i harp on that it's just that it is the attempted
[15:12.640 --> 15:21.280]  overthrow of reality it is a war on reality a war on decency
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.360]  man they'll catch an old guy out on the back 40 driving down the rows had two
[15:25.360 --> 15:27.600]  beers and they'll charge him you know 10 15
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.720]  thousand dollars on the dwi and put him through that
[15:32.720 --> 15:39.680]  or they'll catch some teenager you know with some drugs that some government
[15:39.680 --> 15:43.600]  person sold them down the chain and they'll throw them in jail for years
[15:43.600 --> 15:46.640]  and ruin their life and they'll be able to get a good job but it's okay
[15:46.640 --> 15:49.920]  the government publicly ships in the majority of the narcotics and everyone
[15:49.920 --> 15:53.520]  knows it i've never talked to one cop didn't know
[15:53.520 --> 15:57.600]  that since the 30s the narcotics are brought in
[15:57.600 --> 16:01.040]  by government syndicates for private interest and laundered by the same banks
[16:01.040 --> 16:04.160]  that run the country today
[16:04.160 --> 16:07.280]  and all i'm doing sitting here watching this country sink
[16:07.280 --> 16:12.000]  people say what are you for the drug culture absolutely not
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.960]  but putting money in it and making it secret and and making it dirty only
[16:16.960 --> 16:20.160]  increases the amount of money and only increases the amount of people that are
[16:20.160 --> 16:24.720]  going to use it all the studies show that and
[16:24.720 --> 16:27.840]  they've wrecked this country there's more drug use now than ever america uses
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.680]  more drugs than anybody in the world anybody
[16:31.680 --> 16:34.880]  more alcohol we beat the russians now
[16:34.880 --> 16:37.680]  in guzzling
[16:39.280 --> 16:44.240]  in austin and new orleans are the two drunken cities of the drunken country
[16:45.200 --> 16:48.400]  we are a modern
[16:49.280 --> 16:51.680]  roam
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.040]  sinking and i don't want to sink i don't want to see this happen i don't want
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.000]  to be folded into a north american union i don't want to
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.080]  just just live in a giant fishbowl where everything's got government systems
[17:04.080 --> 17:06.800]  hooked into it so they can frame anybody they want
[17:06.800 --> 17:10.000]  with all of these systems that take over your phones and your computers

[24:16.480 --> 24:19.200]  your like your children there's no global government there's no
[24:19.200 --> 24:21.920]  secret elites meeting there's no builder bird

[24:26.240 --> 24:29.680]  he's crazy he thinks there's a cfr
[24:29.680 --> 24:32.960]  he's crazy he thinks the federal reserve isn't federal
[24:32.960 --> 24:38.480]  now everybody knows it's private literally over 90 percent in polls and
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.800]  want to audit it over 90 percent look it up by the way ron paul's bill he's on
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.920]  in house but it's his bill he wrote he's retired house approved ron paul's
[24:47.920 --> 24:53.920]  audit the fed bill bill approved 333-92 uh when he first
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.760]  introduced that like in 1996 he'd get one vote

[25:03.920 --> 25:10.400]  but for how long see they audit you the irs audits you and you
[25:10.400 --> 25:14.800]  know the same year the fellow reserve took over we got the irs
[25:14.800 --> 25:18.160]  and that money goes to them and it goes so they can
[25:18.160 --> 25:23.120]  selectively enforce the code and shut down their competition and they do
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.880]  because we act like a nation of chumps that believe in the system
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.200]  well this system is in america it's been replaced pretty much and
[25:33.200 --> 25:37.680]  now they're getting rid of what was left and the country will collapse into a
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.200]  third world slum and the globalists want it that way
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.520]  they'll live in their armored citadels in their
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.880]  in their capital districts under gen 21 that's that's not from hunger games i'm
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.160]  not quoting hunger games that's in
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.440]  the biological diversity assessments the mega opolis plans
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.360]  we've played the newscast all of it i mean this is what they're going to do
[26:05.360 --> 26:07.680]  okay
[26:07.680 --> 26:13.040]  and they're not building some utopia so we can all play patty cake
[26:13.600 --> 26:17.360]  they're putting in a high tech grid to take control the west
[26:17.360 --> 26:24.240]  the west to then devolve it but when you look at the third world of the old
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.160]  world they will put you to the sword they will bring in their rebels they'll
[26:28.160 --> 26:31.920]  bring in their troops and they will have the u n sit on the road to make sure
[26:31.920 --> 26:35.040]  you can't escape in rwanda and they'll send in the
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.640]  main group to kill every christian they find
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.640]  in the u n ran that massacre they didn't screw up or stand down
[26:42.640 --> 26:46.480]  they ran it they killed a lot of the people
[26:47.520 --> 26:52.640]  and an african wasn't even worth a bullet to them they did it with machetes
[26:52.640 --> 26:55.440]  and see they don't want you to know this is going on because as soon as they can
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.280]  get control here all the stuff they do overseas they want to do that here
[26:59.280 --> 27:02.720]  and they see they want your guns they can't stand it bloomberg with all this
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.400]  bodyguards up to 15 of them and michael moorlall his bodyguards they can't
[27:06.400 --> 27:10.240]  stand the fact that they've taken your jobs your industry your country your
[27:10.240 --> 27:13.920]  kids your husband your wife they've taken your health in many cases they've
[27:13.920 --> 27:16.800]  taken everything and they know you're still
[27:16.800 --> 27:21.200]  clinging to christ and clinging to self-defense and the right that by god
[27:21.200 --> 27:24.560]  you still got guns when they took them everybody else this is a symbol of
[27:24.560 --> 27:27.040]  defiance
[27:27.040 --> 27:32.960]  but they did take your church because they turned it into 501c3 and
[27:32.960 --> 27:36.000]  sent in preachers that are really government operatives
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.960]  and they're hopping mad folks and i'm telling you most of these big preachers
[27:38.960 --> 27:41.840]  are actually working for the federal government for the fbi under clergy
[27:41.840 --> 27:45.280]  response team and infregard just look it up
[27:45.280 --> 27:48.560]  they're hopping mad that they want to have their conversion and their takeover
[27:48.560 --> 27:50.560]  and we're telling you but here's the good news
[27:50.560 --> 27:53.680]  i don't want to be the only game in town the signal's been sent
[27:53.680 --> 28:00.000]  it's been transmitted people know the combo to the safe they know the game
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.360]  they know the tricks they know how it works we have
[28:03.360 --> 28:07.200]  decompartmentalized and that's our real power and we're imitated by all the
[28:07.200 --> 28:10.080]  other talk show hosts who now we're competing with each other
[28:10.080 --> 28:13.760]  who can put out the most reality and not get in trouble while i'm vanguarding
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.120]  ahead with my crew going over the top telling the truth
[28:17.120 --> 28:21.040]  to pave the way for all the cowards
[28:21.040 --> 28:23.760]  because most people that serve the system
[28:23.760 --> 28:27.520]  aren't truly evil they're scared to death most
[28:27.520 --> 28:30.960]  successful people have sense they have
[28:30.960 --> 28:37.200]  understanding they have discernment they have a sixth sense and they can feel
[28:37.200 --> 28:40.800]  the evil and they've made the decision to serve it
[28:40.800 --> 28:46.480]  man that is scary i would be scared to serve the evil or to run from it
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.960]  my biggest problem is i want to run at it even harder and i know that's not the
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.800]  smartest game we come back we've got a special
[28:54.800 --> 28:57.840]  report integrating popular culture promoting mass
[28:57.840 --> 29:00.880]  die-offs and mass culling 12 monkeys and others
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.240]  that rob do and darin mcbreen put together an excellent job
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.480]  and then we're going to get a lot more but uh i i never played that dimsy clip
[29:08.480 --> 29:11.680]  that i mentioned so let's go ahead and go out to break with it here it is
[29:11.680 --> 29:15.600]  so our national defense in terms of stopping
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.920]  isle from killing thousands or millions of americans if they get the
[29:19.920 --> 29:22.960]  capability really comes down to whether or not we
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.400]  can convince the arab world to go in there and
[29:26.400 --> 29:33.200]  and defeat these guys it really comes down to building a coalition so that
[29:33.200 --> 29:38.560]  that what the arab muslim world sees we're gonna come back with the rest of it
[29:38.560 --> 29:42.800]  reject we're gonna come back stay with us and then we'll uh
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.480]  get into all these other reports but i mentioned that earlier i want to play it
[29:46.480 --> 29:52.160]  we mentioned we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:23.280 --> 33:26.880]  let me finish the clip i know i've already played it multiple times yesterday but
[33:26.880 --> 33:30.160]  it's so important the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
[33:30.160 --> 33:35.840]  they're admitting what's already been admitted by other generals that
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.600]  the arab countries are allies Saudi arabia and others are arming al qaeda
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.560]  but but that's a fallback position because our government is arming
[33:44.560 --> 33:49.040]  the arab countries that are arming al qaeda but also directly doing it
[33:49.040 --> 33:54.880]  and that's what Benghazi was all about so it's just hiding in plain view and if
[33:54.880 --> 33:57.920]  you're if you're a radialist you can't see the body language of dempsi
[33:57.920 --> 34:02.000]  but it's so rich as they start basically arguing
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.320]  uh and saying oh come on they just messed up they didn't know
[34:06.320 --> 34:09.280]  they didn't understand
[34:09.280 --> 34:15.040]  it's the narrative wearing thin then i'll get to the abolish report so here's
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.240]  dempsi so our national defense in terms of stopping
[34:20.240 --> 34:24.640]  isle from killing thousands or millions of americans if they get the
[34:24.640 --> 34:30.000]  capability really comes down to whether or not we can convince the arab world
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.920]  to go in there and and defeat these guys it really comes down to building a
[34:35.920 --> 34:41.360]  coalition so that that what the arab muslim world sees
[34:41.360 --> 34:47.840]  is them rejecting isis not they already reject isle do you know any major
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.360]  arab ally that embraces isle i know major arab allies who fund them
[34:53.360 --> 34:56.480]  yeah but did they embrace it they fund them because the free searing army
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.120]  couldn't fight aside they were trying to beat aside
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.120]  i think they realized the folly of their ways let's don't
[35:03.120 --> 35:09.120]  tank the mitties unfairly oh let's don't take
[35:09.120 --> 35:12.240]  we're 15 of the 19 hijacker supposedly came from
[35:12.240 --> 35:16.160]  and that 28 page report speaking of that that's why i mentioned this today
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.840]  paul watson put the article out yesterday i i requested he do a report on
[35:19.840 --> 35:23.600]  this he has i want to thank paul for his great work
[35:23.600 --> 35:31.200]  pound or hashtag declassify colon campaign to reveal the 28
[35:31.200 --> 35:37.600]  censored pages the 9 11 commission report and then when you pound declassify
[35:37.600 --> 35:42.160]  or when you hashtag declassify
[35:42.160 --> 35:47.920]  it then sends everybody to ron paul rand paul congressman walter jones
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.480]  introduced this legislation colonel schaefer and countless others exposing
[35:52.480 --> 35:55.760]  what's really in the 28 pages and that's what our government stood down bare
[35:55.760 --> 35:58.000]  minimum ron paul has now come out and said yeah okay
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.520]  not all the trip was pretty much right uh there was at least a standout
[36:01.520 --> 36:05.520]  and saudi arabia was quarterbacking things just like they're quarterbacking
[36:05.520 --> 36:08.400]  isis right now
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.560]  and then why the federal government just loves it the fbi doesn't have to go out
[36:12.560 --> 36:18.560]  and you know manufacture uh any um
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.440]  any deaths the net you'll find some mentally ill people to blow something up
[36:23.440 --> 36:27.120]  or maybe the patsy speaks out and gets it gets embarrassing so they kill them
[36:27.120 --> 36:32.960]  and dump them in town lake i mean they don't have to do that anymore
[36:35.760 --> 36:39.680]  because they can have real terrorists attack us
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.360]  and everybody gets a big paycheck and gets to go watch jack bowyer on the new
[36:43.360 --> 36:47.680]  season of 24 whatever new show they'll have or where we learn to torture we
[36:47.680 --> 36:51.360]  learned to do all these bad things because we're the good guys
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.080]  it's not that we like to torture it's not that we'd like to do all these bad
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.240]  things no no we're the heroes that's right
[36:59.040 --> 37:04.240]  totally sick and is that a world you want to raise your children in
[37:04.240 --> 37:06.800]  whether it's just government does whatever it wants
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.200]  they got a name for it it's called nightmare it's called hell
[37:11.840 --> 37:18.560]  it's called a living breathing stinking mega hell
[37:19.440 --> 37:22.400]  a total hell
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.520]  and that's what we're entering
[37:29.520 --> 37:32.720]  that's where we're going we have to recognize that we're not being negative
[37:32.720 --> 37:38.400]  here we're breaking down what we as a society really face
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.000]  where this journey is going all these towers and all these children
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  adults that never had good mothers or fathers who were arrested development
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.080]  who are children they see the state as their father the state as their mother
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.480]  and empowerment through the collective estate
[37:54.480 --> 37:57.520]  whether it's the controlled leftist or the controlled right through
[37:57.520 --> 38:03.120]  authoritarianism that's how they expand their
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.760]  empires of control freak behavior
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.760]  and it's a society run by these people narcissistic self-important mentally
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.720]  ill monsters whose whole lives are based on
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.960]  betrayal
[38:21.440 --> 38:24.480]  whose whole world
[38:27.920 --> 38:33.040]  is based on deception that's not a world at all that's hell
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.920]  they're building hell on earth they're working for hell
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.360]  when obama says forward lean forward an actual
[38:41.360 --> 38:47.360]  Stalinist Leninist even predates that Marxist
[38:47.360 --> 38:50.480]  when people in jumbo jets and red carpets at hollywood events
[38:50.480 --> 38:54.640]  who are tax exempt just roll around in giant buckets of fiat money
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.960]  lecturing us with weird Karl Marx stuff about how our kids don't belong to us
[38:58.960 --> 39:03.760]  because see that's for us we're going to live in a shack in e-gmo
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.120]  and die when we're 45 they're going to get all the live extension just
[39:07.120 --> 39:10.720]  fly around up there laughing at us and if we try to get together well they'll
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.080]  just send in some agent revocateurs to get a race war going or
[39:14.080 --> 39:18.000]  disturb everybody up and balkanize us or send in some other co until pro or
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.840]  cognitive infiltrators who they now announce oh the cia's
[39:21.840 --> 39:24.720]  can operate domestically with cognitive infiltrators
[39:24.720 --> 39:30.320]  in 2014 oh great isn't it wonderful
[39:34.640 --> 39:38.800]  and oh it's not for al-qaeda it's for you
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.960]  you don't like agenda 21 you found out it's real you got the documents
[39:42.960 --> 39:45.680]  you learned the zoning commission's getting flown off to new york and paid
[39:45.680 --> 39:48.480]  off to be part of this you learned they're going to take over your whole
[39:48.480 --> 39:50.880]  town
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.480]  why we'll just send in some fbi informants that's another name for people
[39:56.480 --> 40:00.320]  that shut people up and harass them and engage in criminal activity
[40:00.320 --> 40:03.360]  up against a bunch of old farmers that's what's happening now
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.720]  they send in these young bucks out of the universities that you're a little
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.400]  little agents little secret police and they they march out and go harass
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.160]  tea party events and go and mess with everybody i mean that's where we're
[40:14.160 --> 40:17.120]  going in this country
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.440]  meanwhile there is a bola that appears to be coming
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.040]  more and more resistant to being able to live in the air at least a little while
[40:27.040 --> 40:30.320]  and it's spreading all over the place and a lot of top virologists to get
[40:30.320 --> 40:33.520]  estimate five million will die i'm not saying that
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.360]  that's in the major german newspapers like bill
[40:37.360 --> 40:43.920]  not tabloids and obama's sending troops and to quote fight it who aren't
[40:43.920 --> 40:46.960]  trained and general boykins gone public and world net aliens said it's
[40:46.960 --> 40:50.400]  horrible they would never do that in the past see i'm no military man but i've
[40:50.400 --> 40:54.640]  read the news over the years religiously and i know that that's
[40:54.640 --> 40:57.840]  missions they wouldn't do in the past because they know that it'll just
[40:57.840 --> 41:00.800]  spread it and then bring people back with it and it really doesn't even do
[41:00.800 --> 41:04.800]  any good but that matter they're doing it anyways they're
[41:04.800 --> 41:09.040]  going to bring people back here see they don't do things the way they did in the
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.720]  past it's a recklessness it's it's it's a
[41:12.720 --> 41:16.080]  wildness of an elite that's above the law
[41:16.080 --> 41:21.360]  unaccountable gets away with anything they want
[41:21.360 --> 41:26.160]  in china melamine got in the baby formula and they executed a bunch of the
[41:26.160 --> 41:29.040]  executives not defending their system i'm just saying
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.720]  here the executives owned the media they just had us say today come out and
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.640]  say well the FDA came out and said but
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.400]  they reported hey some melamine not bad
[41:42.400 --> 41:45.520]  it's just enough you know to cause kidney failure down the road but hell the
[41:45.520 --> 41:49.600]  kid will be 30 when his kidneys fail won't know why
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.200]  what's wrong with going on dialysis for a decade and then dying i mean come on
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.920]  what's wrong with bear knowingly nbc news you just type in
[41:57.920 --> 42:04.080]  a bear blood scandal knowingly in more than 14 countries from the united
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.920]  states to australia from india to canada
[42:07.920 --> 42:15.280]  from france to russia sold factor eight blood platelet
[42:15.280 --> 42:19.360]  in giant batches produced from blood from prisons
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.800]  and they knew every single production of it
[42:22.800 --> 42:26.480]  giant vats of different blood types poured together had HIV and hepatitis in
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.560]  it and they shipped it out and it came out in the memos in
[42:30.560 --> 42:33.840]  france was the only country to convict anybody that the executives knew it and
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.320]  said so what oh man hey so what so what people need
[42:38.320 --> 42:41.120]  some clotting agent hemophiliacs so what if you're a little kid you're
[42:41.120 --> 42:44.560]  hemophiliac and you take factor eight and then you die
[42:44.560 --> 42:49.200]  horrible excruciating hiv and hepatitis so what just kill them
[42:49.200 --> 42:52.880]  and hey don't ever criticize that or your anti-government man
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.800]  just bend over and take it from bear pharmaceuticals
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.240]  after all they did such a great job in nazi germany didn't they
[43:02.240 --> 43:05.440]  and maybe one of you fruitcakes out there could send me an email about how
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.200]  good hitler was i'm gonna throw up
[43:09.840 --> 43:17.440]  what we're fighting hitler adopted from the nuts that run society
[43:20.400 --> 43:23.680]  oh god it makes me sick
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.800]  it makes me so sick how there's just all these cowards just going along with
[43:28.800 --> 43:31.920]  this as it gets worse and worse we're gonna tell you what's coming up with
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.760]  the nationalist leader urges scots to grasp independence campaign borrowed
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.160]  heavily from obama tactics british pound at two-year high currency
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.200]  traders bet no voting begins you know i heard lord mongton on the other day
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.440]  well i had a guest host here rob do and i got his point i mean he'd say we could
[43:49.440 --> 43:52.560]  have independence if we weren't under the eu but the eu's just gonna come in and
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.280]  take over scotland anyways and then you've got basically the labor
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.200]  that's basically like the democrats and as bad as the tories are
[44:01.200 --> 44:04.320]  you know this is just going to be like a communist wonderland
[44:04.320 --> 44:07.840]  and that's kind of what'll happen you'll trade one boss for a new boss like the
[44:07.840 --> 44:11.120]  who says won't get fooled again but hey if they want to vote
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.000]  independence that's fine they will then go through that process
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.360]  of being raked over the coals like anybody that joins the euro
[44:17.360 --> 44:20.560]  basically scotland's just joining the euro even though england's already joined
[44:20.560 --> 44:25.280]  it to be gang raped more and i said there's pitfalls to this
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.240]  i mean i supported if they want to vote for it because you're just going to
[44:28.240 --> 44:31.200]  leave one system and go right back in the same
[44:31.200 --> 44:33.440]  systems arms another way it's kind of like you're throwing balls when you're
[44:33.440 --> 44:38.880]  left and right hand um i don't know it's a very
[44:38.880 --> 44:41.840]  sophisticated issue
[44:43.840 --> 44:46.480]  it's bizarre
[44:46.480 --> 44:50.240]  all right uh let's go to this special report
[44:50.240 --> 44:57.040]  dovetailing real reality in 2014 with 12 monkeys from 1999
[44:57.040 --> 45:02.080]  put together by rob do here it is well it sounds like the perfect script for a
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.240]  horror movie a virus with no vaccine and no cure
[45:06.240 --> 45:12.640]  kills thousands of people by paying people died in 1996 and 1997
[45:12.640 --> 45:17.520]  what's the entire population of the world
[45:17.520 --> 45:21.760]  only about one percent of us survived reports of blue cases along the border
[45:21.760 --> 45:25.520]  but officials are seeing the art connected surely there's very real and
[45:25.520 --> 45:28.640]  very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the
[45:28.640 --> 45:31.520]  human race and i actually think the world will be
[45:31.520 --> 45:34.960]  much better when there's only 10 or 20 of us left
[45:34.960 --> 45:38.560]  dr eric bianca but most frightening was the fact
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.160]  that in a crowd of over 1 000 prominent scientists
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.440]  local newspapers reported that 95 of those in attendance
[45:47.440 --> 45:51.120]  gave bianca sustained standing ovations
[45:51.120 --> 45:55.520]  every time he stole the virtues of mass culling microbes
[45:55.520 --> 45:59.680]  and man's destruction and went on to laud the virtues of obola
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.840]  because it would kill 90 of the world population quickly
[46:03.840 --> 46:08.080]  the world health organization said on tuesday the obola death toll jumped by
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.640]  almost 200 in a single day to at least 2 296
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.720]  and is likely to be higher than that the head of the u.s centers for disease
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.680]  control confirmed to state that west africa is in desperate situation
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.360]  but that there is still hope that the outbreak can be reined in
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.640]  a top german virologist has caused shock waves by asserting that it's too late
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.320]  to halt the spread of the ebola virus in other days the cdc is receiving reports
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.720]  of a possible flu outbreak in san francisco if the symptoms were first
[46:40.720 --> 46:44.480]  detected in philadelphia on december 27 1996
[46:44.480 --> 46:48.560]  that makes us know that it was released in philadelphia probably on december
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.440]  13 1996 and we'll see sequentially after that in
[46:53.440 --> 46:57.200]  san francisco new orleans Rio de Janeiro
[46:57.200 --> 47:06.720]  uh ron kashasa carachi bank hot then piquing ron kashasa carachi bank hot
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.640]  piquing it's some trip you're taking sir is this all in one week
[47:10.640 --> 47:14.800]  business one of the two americans infected with the
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.840]  ebola virus has arrived in atlanta from
[47:17.840 --> 47:21.360]  africa for treatment the massachusetts doctor arrived
[47:21.360 --> 47:24.720]  at the niraskan medical center just before dawn this morning to be treated
[47:24.720 --> 47:29.440]  for ebola and right now his or her blood sample is on its way
[47:29.440 --> 47:34.160]  to the centers for disease control a new ability to wage war is born from the
[47:34.160 --> 47:40.400]  blood derivative there you see also invisible to the naked eye
[47:40.400 --> 47:48.560]  it doesn't even have an odor imagine a virus the most terrifying virus you
[47:48.560 --> 47:52.240]  can and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure
[47:52.240 --> 47:55.760]  without specific drugs or a vaccine for ebola
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.760]  the only thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease
[47:59.760 --> 48:04.000]  is treat their symptoms ebola is not airborne
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.080]  one will not likely catch the virus just by nearing someone
[48:08.080 --> 48:14.800]  who has it in 1989 ebola made its way to the us this new strain of ebola had
[48:14.800 --> 48:17.760]  shown the potential to spread through the air
[48:17.760 --> 48:23.360]  they are now calling this a true pandemic five years on still no cure no cure
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.000]  the bill and melinda gates foundation has given 31 million pounds to help
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.240]  battle the ebola epidemic in africa it is hoped it will also speed up the
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.000]  development of drugs and vaccines as ebola has killed more than half of
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.800]  its 4,300 victims uh first we've got population
[48:40.800 --> 48:46.320]  now if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare we could lower that
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.480]  by perhaps 10 or 15 percent a preventative vaccine for the ebola
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.280]  virus could be available as early as next year
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.080]  as british pharma company glaucus Smith Klein so you want to balance the need
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.240]  to get a potentially effective vaccine to the people who need it
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.560]  in a way that you can get some meaningful information as to a whether it
[49:06.560 --> 49:09.440]  does work or not and whether it does
[49:09.440 --> 49:13.200]  hung a confidential glaucus Smith Klein document recently linked to the press
[49:13.200 --> 49:16.880]  exposed that within a two-year period a total of 36
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.200]  infants died after receiving the six-in-one vaccine of infrex
[49:21.200 --> 49:26.080]  hexa going right out to get vaccinated uh probably one of these numbers is
[49:26.080 --> 49:31.200]  going to have to get pretty near to zero attention due to the extremity of the
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.720]  simian flu crisis all regular government functions have
[49:34.720 --> 49:44.720]  been suspended i hope everybody enjoys this is undoubtedly a beta test but
[49:44.720 --> 49:48.400]  prince phillips said he wanted to come back reincarnated as a particularly
[49:48.400 --> 49:52.000]  deadly virus to exterminate 90 percent of the world population
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.480]  and contribute something in his words
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.440]  you can read that in the london guardian by the way we covered it a few days ago

[54:40.480 --> 54:45.360]  where we will accept almost anything
[54:45.360 --> 54:48.880]  almost anything and once they get a population to that point
[54:48.880 --> 54:52.960]  it's soviet russia it's nazi germany
[54:52.960 --> 54:59.680]  squared with all this high-tech garbage and so i'm not trying to scare anybody
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.120]  i'm trying to get people moving to not worry about this
[55:05.120 --> 55:09.440]  to not worry about the system trying to crush us but worrying about
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.320]  the larger program coming to fruition you shouldn't worry about yourself
[55:14.320 --> 55:17.680]  individually being attacked when you're trying to expose
[55:17.680 --> 55:21.120]  the new world order you should worry about the fact that people
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.360]  have no chivalry or no even basic culture or basic morals
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.800]  or can't even really communicate to where it's just a bunch of people
[55:28.800 --> 55:35.120]  milling around mindlessly trying to feel like they've done something
[55:35.120 --> 55:40.640]  the value and the only places you can have a male role model
[55:40.640 --> 55:45.040]  is in sports or as a government enforcer
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.200]  and then that'll all be gotten rid of once they've got the robots
[55:49.200 --> 55:54.400]  rolled out and that that's all stated it's the end of humanity ladies and
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.640]  gentlemen it's the end of what we are as we
[55:58.640 --> 56:04.160]  know it and it's being prepared
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.680]  and i don't believe that this Ebola outbreak is that it's a process
[56:09.680 --> 56:13.360]  of successive plagues that are going to get worse and worse as they pose as the
[56:13.360 --> 56:18.160]  saviors driving us further under their black wings
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.960]  where we can be safe as the third world dies as africa and latin america dies
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.360]  as asia areas dies areas of europe die and only the
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.200]  the controlled citadels of social engineering are allowed to go forward
[56:31.200 --> 56:35.440]  and it'll kind of be a wink wink well it was allowed to be released to save the
[56:35.440 --> 56:38.880]  earth but those of us within the dome cities are
[56:38.880 --> 56:42.720]  safe that's where all this is going that's why you see it in all the
[56:42.720 --> 56:47.040]  culture and all the movies for 50 60 70 years in the books
[56:47.040 --> 56:50.800]  because ht wells and others were exterminist eugenicist

[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.400]  i just and then they'll have them literally put like 14-year-old conscripts
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.760]  out to be blown up basically go make them sit in a jeep and get
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.640]  blown up or in a toyota i shouldn't laugh about this as i've
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.160]  seen the globalist do it before while the jihadis then get the missiles and
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.240]  the weapons to go kill christians our military dropping bombs will actually
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.360]  believe they're killing al qaeda they did that uh one of the invasion of
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.760]  afghanistan and the locals are so primitive you
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.920]  could say in many of these areas like afghanistan
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.120]  that they will then fight back because they're seeing their country get bombed
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.800]  and then that'll be called the terrorist and really they're just killing poor
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.000]  farmers i but this is now of course in syria and iraq isis released their
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.720]  latest propaganda video threatening jihad if the u.s puts boots on the
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.040]  ground
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.160]  this is the plan to play everybody off against each other
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.560]  and our military again because of this show and others
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.960]  now knows that this is all staged and our military may have been involved in
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.680]  some wars they weren't supposed to but on average they were highly dedicated
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.760]  people that really believed in what they were doing
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.680]  and now they are freaking out
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.960]  that they have
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.280]  been a party to all this for so long
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:12.080]  just in time for the false flags here in america to be blamed on the liberty
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.400]  movement
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.760]  it's just horrible
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.760]  they're gonna want the republicans that are going to sweep into office in the
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.400]  house and probably even the senate to purge the libertarians out of the
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.320]  republican party that's what the leader is basically pushing right now

[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.520]  lie about us and twist and deceive and do the things they do
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.800]  we have the moral high ground

[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.600]  when an NSA agent i guess you could call it was visiting a university to recruit
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.640]  college students to join the NSA they freaked out saying don't
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.840]  videotape me in public i mean i just love it we're gonna
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.160]  rape you and use all the data to corner the market manipulate the markets and
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.120]  do all of this but don't you dare show me
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.000]  they're just supposed to creep around and recruit everybody
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.840]  and then aggressively say don't videotape me at the fair
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.040]  the job fairs they put on where he was just there
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.080]  i love it other people that rape your rights are always the ones that freak
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.480]  out the most you see the video on info wars.com
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.040]  dr group is very interesting a gentleman of course he also is a
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.560]  army veteran and he's got his own perspective on the world
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.320]  it's pretty darn close to mine before we get into 12 ways to support your
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.600]  immune system naturally and talk about some solutions here today dr
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.840]  group what do you make of the state of the world and where it's all going what
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.040]  what does your gut tell you we're going to see in the next few years because
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:34.800]  you don't have to have spider sense to know things are declining in my view
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.360]  but also a lot of good things are happening for every action there's an
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.760]  opposite and equal reaction to tonic and physics
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.920]  you know expanded by uh max plank and other folks like
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.520]  albert einstein really proven as least a law of nature in this third
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.680]  dimension but it's just an amazing time to be alive
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.080]  what's your take on the big picture well uh you know
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.480]  looking at the big picture really in in how it affects the health of everybody
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.920]  is the fact that we're exposed to millions of chemicals and toxins and
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.320]  the earth is sick and when the earth is sick
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.880]  we're we all get sick i mean you look at the man made chemicals
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.360]  you know we've gotten away from nature and we've gone to a society of man-made
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.480]  things you know with prescription medications and
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.240]  toxins being released into the air the food the water etc
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.600]  so i mean i see a declining earth and i see declining health pretty rapidly
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.440]  especially since we're dealing with Ebola and we're dealing with man-made
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.760]  substances right now which are really hard and attack the immune system
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.600]  on the flip side though like you said there's always the negative aspect and
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.760]  then there's always the positive acts aspect i'm a big believer in
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.920]  you know there's always a solution for every situation i don't think there's
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.200]  problems i only think there's situations and there's always a solution
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.000]  and it's finding the solution that's what my 20 years of research has been you
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.920]  know why is everybody getting sick why is the earth getting sick
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.280]  you know mentally being abused i mean the diagnostic and statistical manual
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.960]  developing all these so-called mental illnesses you know why
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.240]  why is all this happening and what is the best solution to rectify it all how do
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.560]  we repair it so that's a big a big point now the good
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.760]  the good news is everything you know with the
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.960]  introduction of the internet with so many people not being satisfied and
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.400]  finally waking up because of your show and all the information that we've been
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.080]  putting out on natural remedies to help clean the soil you know organic
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.840]  farming methods people switching back to organic foods you know
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.960]  these are some of the good things that are happening the fight against
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.720]  genetically modified organisms the fight against monsanto you know
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.320]  the fight against chemical companies i mean you're now seeing chemical
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.000]  companies switching to natural brands and
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.800]  organic ingredients because the demand is finally there and as long as we
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.160]  don't buy these things and we demand higher quality and
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.280]  organic products slowly we're seeing a change happen
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.320]  so instead of just taking the programming from a state-run media
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.680]  we have to do our own research and change the paradigm
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.880]  right i mean that's i think people are waking up because they realize they
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.400]  can't trust the mainstream media anymore i mean they're not they're getting
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.200]  lied to i mean no one out there in the mainstream media
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.400]  is talking about natural solutions for Ebola right now
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.640]  no one's out there talking about unique you know are you ready in case of an
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.720]  outbreak that hits the united states do you have a plan of action do you have
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.600]  somewhere to go do you know about how to isolate
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.880]  yourself do you know how to protect yourself and your family i mean that
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.920]  should be on the mainstream news right now
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.480]  listen here we have a situation that could potentially
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:54.480]  you know we're bringing doctors into this country that are infected which god
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.560]  knows why we're doing that you know the whole purpose of the cdc
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.080]  and the world health organization when there could be an outbreak is to
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.880]  quarantine and contain the outbreak not let people travel all over the world
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.840]  and touch different things you know with the with any
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.800]  type of a pandemic you got to remember that even though
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.160]  they're saying that it's person to person contact
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.120]  one person can come by and use an ATM machine
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.880]  another person can come use the ATM machine and touch the buttons
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.120]  and that's you know that's contact i mean there's so many different things
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.280]  money you know money changes hands millions of times every day you can
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.240]  it can transmit by you touching money you know people sneezing at the mall
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.400]  or the office but they'll hype up h1n1 that was literally
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.960]  nothing medical doctors on record saying was totally basically made up
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.080]  like it's the end of the world but then meanwhile they've never flown a bowl of
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.360]  patients around they've never basically stood down
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.800]  now they let the crisis get bad enough obama is marching in
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.880]  with these thousands of us troops in african to save the continent which we
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.360]  knew was always part of why he was elected
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.560]  so the globalist could use his face as the face of occupying africa
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.000]  right the u.s. state department's ordering 160 000 hazmat suits i mean it's
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.600]  pretty much martial law lockdown over there that's a good point you made on
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.560]  monday dredging to our article on that that links right to the government
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.280]  documents but also there was another article out
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.120]  confirming that they're telling hospitals for weeks get ready for it
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.920]  but then not telling the public any basic precautions
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.440]  i mean that backs up your point this is unprecedented what what do you think is
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.440]  going on with this Ebola i'm not exactly sure yet what's
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.200]  going on you know it's a it's a system that we've
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.840]  seen that's happening you know time after time
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.360]  i'm still trying to figure out i mean we know it's man-made i'm just trying to
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.560]  figure out was this purposely released or was this
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.920]  accidentally released because um you know we know that the cdc has
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.280]  a patent on Ebola we know that they've been working
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.080]  on different types of vaccines do they actually have a hundred million stock
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.760]  piled vaccines somewhere that they're just they just haven't released yet
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.760]  i mean you know who knows but and who knows what's
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.240]  going to be in those vaccines too um you know right now or you know the black
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.840]  market situation going on in africa with people trying to
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.600]  get the blood and pay for the blood of infected people that
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.680]  have healed you have that situation but what nobody's talking about is
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.160]  what you can do naturally to boost your own immune system and to protect
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.280]  yourself you know that's uh you know that's not
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.720]  what they want and you know obviously we'll find out what's
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.800]  what's coming in the future you know you got cuba involved now too that's
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.760]  bringing people in and out it's just the whole thing is
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.640]  is very you know shady when you look at who's involved what's going on
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:59.840]  um what's what i've been involved with over the last few weeks is really
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.680]  telling people and educating people on what they need to do to prepare
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.240]  because here's the thing i mean all the fear
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.440]  mongering you know and they take the attention away as you know you know
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.600]  they'll focus the attention on an nfl player and nobody's really finding out
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.040]  the truth about this whole pandemic and and what could happen
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.680]  that's right obola is spreading all over uh africa and getting into the middle
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.840]  east in areas and they're flying patients everywhere
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.920]  and we're talking about a player who's spanked his kid
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.600]  yeah and then like all of a sudden let's say
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.120]  you know let's let's hope this doesn't happen but what if
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.400]  all of a sudden it comes to the united states what happens if it's already in
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.920]  the united states i mean i i know people are coming down with respiratory
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.120]  tract infections all over the place now what if that's
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.600]  being suppressed and then all of a sudden they say oh the pandemic is here
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.200]  and it's spreading rapidly what do what have you done
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.080]  your listeners what has everyone done really
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.600]  to prepare themselves in case a pandemic
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.720]  you know happens i mean do you have a bug out plan do you have a place to go
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.640]  that you can get out of the densely populated area i mean that's the first
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.000]  thing that you need to look at and the first thing that you need to do
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.600]  already in atlanta they're already talking about the waste of the of the
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.440]  people being treated there is being flushed into the public water system
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.440]  you know how do you spread i mean terrorists have been talking about this
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.800]  for years and years and years on the best way to spread
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.480]  bio weapons through the air or through the water supply you know
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.160]  so this could this could actually spread really fast
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.960]  and unless you have a plan of action ready unless you've stocked up on
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.400]  everything unless you know and you're preparing yourself
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.280]  uh and preparing your immune system right now you could literally be caught
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.120]  and the thick of things and and be thinking oh it's it's almost too late
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.320]  now because i don't have a plan of action well i mean i agree with that but
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.960]  let's just say this is a dry run it is a wake-up call
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.720]  but for african it's not a dry run i mean it is threatening to collapse
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.040]  cerulean libiria other areas it they're estimating millions could die
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.480]  um on the low end hundreds of thousands
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.160]  what about all the new superbugs what i want to talk about that
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.200]  finally they're talking about restricting antibiotics
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.160]  on farms that you know to feed the animals that aren't even sick
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.520]  which we then eat and then destroys the floor on our gut i want to talk about
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.800]  some of that because i don't think we're going to see it coming
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.560]  like abola it's like that mystery illness i know you're in
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.920]  texas it was really bad here this year that killed so many people
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.960]  they just go it's a mystery illness but the cdc knows what it is they won't say
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.200]  and we're not supposed to talk about it the doctors would just look at you
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.400]  weird when you're there watching family die

[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.840]  order organized tyranny scientifically organized tyranny
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.120]  you read all their publications that's what they call it themselves
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:10.080]  organized technocratic authoritarian scientific dictatorship
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.640]  and it's so sophisticated it's a conspiracy theory if you point it out
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.440]  when it's public
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.080]  all the major weather balloons satellites the actual just measurements of the
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.960]  north and south poles is just growing at record levels
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.200]  algore says it's all melted and polar bears can't swim
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.160]  and aol had the headline actual headline global warming likely to cause
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.120]  colder and snowier winters i had to say
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.000]  i mean it's just it's just this is the end of liars being checked
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.360]  or is it really the beginning because people are saying no but the
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.920]  establishment still stands though they just stand there and all their
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.360]  muck lying about a group i was digressing off into that but
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.560]  think about how they divert us into carbon dioxide the plants breathe
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.800]  basically and put off oxygen while there's just all these environmental
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.880]  crazinesses out there the gmo the cross species the spider
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.640]  goats the super salmon the the glow in the dark
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.480]  poodles you can buy you know that are part jellyfish
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.320]  what is your biggest concern of this whole cocktail do you agree with me that
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.760]  past abola it's just the all the other stuff that's happening in the
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:31.280]  background that's the big threat i totally agree it's a combination of
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.560]  everything it really boils down to uh how healthy and how mentally
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.280]  strong you are as a person because when you combine
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.240]  you know the damage that affects not only your mental capacity
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.200]  your physical capacity your spiritual capacity
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.440]  there's there's so much technology out there
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.080]  really what i should say is so many different methods that they're using
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.320]  from the fluoride in the water the gmo's i mean the list goes on and on
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.240]  that really you just have to educate yourself and know
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:14.080]  what to avoid and what to look for and use natural replacements and keep your
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.000]  body clean on a regular basis because you know all that is really
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.960]  designed to keep you sick keep you non aggressive
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.080]  keep you you know not feeling good about yourself
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.040]  and keep you in a constant state of fear which is another thing i mean look
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.400]  whenever they come out you were asking earlier about you know why are they doing
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.320]  all these things i believe one of the reasons why is
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.800]  you know and i don't i haven't seen any studies on this but when you come out
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.600]  with an Ebola or SARS or an H1N1 some sort of a pandemic
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.440]  it'd be interesting to see i mean people like us
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.040]  who know how to protect ourselves don't really panic
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.400]  because we're prepared we're in we don't get into a state of fear
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.280]  i mean Ebola doesn't scare me one bit you know there's no you know i know what
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.720]  to do for it but think of the million the billions of
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.800]  people out there that are extremely scared right now
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.800]  and fearful now how does that translate into money you know you think that oh
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.760]  they're creating the Ebola so they can come out on the back end with a
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.280]  vaccine and then make it mandatory for every
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.600]  single person to get the Ebola vaccine but the secondary thing is that
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.040]  they know that when they create fear that your immune system
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.720]  instantaneously falls down by 50 percent and it's very
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.400]  interesting too to note that there's all kinds of other super bugs
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.920]  that are going around right now in the u.s if you look at every single public
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.080]  school the children are sick right now the parents are sick because of some
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.680]  mysterious illness that's going around right now everywhere
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:56.720]  so when the immune system is down when they create all this stuff and fear
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.560]  and keep the immune system down you're more susceptible to catching any type
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.320]  of disease or breaking your own system down
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.320]  because you can't digest your foods your cortisol levels are high i mean
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.480]  we all know how stress is how damaging stress is i mean stress is a killer in
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.720]  itself you're right
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.720]  and even the elites newt gathers is in the news today saying
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.000]  that there's a global meltdown happening and a crisis of confidence in the
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.120]  elites uh the newark times is an article out about

[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.160]  when their grandmas have in their house taken it's just people know
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.400]  this new order does not take us to a good place
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.680]  and the dependency has just turned people and myself included into unhealthy
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.280]  blobs that's why i'm trying to have this journey to get back in shape
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.960]  but it's good news when newt gendritch is running around warning the elite i've
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.400]  got this here in my stack i'll pull it out in a minute
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.840]  you know citing that uh the system's in trouble
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.960]  here it is it was a national review gendritch warns gop of population and
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.840]  turmoil this fault
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:13.680]  and he says that um aggravated republicans
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:20.160]  have failed to offer a positive alternative to president obama's agenda
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.320]  well that's because they're bought and paid for by the same interest genders you
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:26.640]  know that there's another one left blast clinton in secret emails
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:31.920]  oh they absolutely hate her mainline leftists that really believe they're
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.440]  trying to build a better world they have a name for it it's called uh
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.200]  people that have been deceived
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.080]  because there's nothing liberal about the agenda of the of the of the big
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.480]  establishment liberal movement it is authoritarian it is
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.640]  totalitarian as the day is long
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.280]  but it's trendy so it's okay because after all you know uh the uh
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:01.920]  president wear sharp suits he's got a slick walk
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:05.760]  plays golf kind of looks like a professional golfer just hanging back
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.560]  smiling everything's all right he's up and look confident

[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:17.680]  he's there all let's come together of course you didn't build that business
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.280]  he's bitter cleaners i'll get those guns one
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.000]  while i'm guarding people's guns but that's all right
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  ah
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.160]  what a world
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.840]  what a world dr. Edward group joins us uh the toll free number if you've got
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.800]  any questions for him uh about herbs or about
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:51.760]  ace and iodine or about Ebola he really is an knowledgeable guy because i've
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.920]  had
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.880]  people that you know other guests on the show that are brain surgeons and
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.160]  mainline medical doctors and
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.080]  chemists and things and they just are blown away by the info he puts out and
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:11.040]  i know personally the products he helped us develop for infowarslife.com
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:18.880]  the supermail vitality superfilm of vitality the lung cleanse the x2
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.720]  the other products that he helped develop with my dad
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:27.920]  like the occupier for the eyes but of course uh
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.880]  one that really blows people away that's the dna force
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.520]  which by the way it's about 10 patented ingredients where you're allowed to
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.640]  actually make you know claims of what it does because it's certified it's a
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.560]  nutraceutical we don't have it it's sold out
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:51.440]  at infowarslife.com we'll get some in a few weeks hopefully uh but
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.680]  it's just amazing you know some people a lot of people i know who had like
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.160]  nerve damage their elbows or knees are like my knee is numb when i take this
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.440]  and well yeah that's what we told people that's what happens when nerves are
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.920]  growing back at first they tingle and get numb i mean i've got old sports
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:11.440]  industry injuries i've been on this about three months and then they
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.160]  we have our own supply that was sold out obviously uh and i'm
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.280]  anyways it's a sad issue i didn't mean to digress off into that dr group let's
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.400]  speak to that before we uh well here's the toll free number it's
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:30.400]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 for your question for
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.720]  dr edward group again i'm your host Alex Jones
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:39.600]  800-259-9231 uh dr group uh going back here uh for
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.160]  just a moment to what i was talking about with the products don't do a plug
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.120]  here that's how we fund our operation plus they're great products
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.720]  um the oxy powder that we still haven't stocked that you developed
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:52.720]  uh that is the you know proprietary on record
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.280]  mac daddy of of the oxygen tablets that clean out the guts the first the best
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.720]  and just i've had truly amazing results with it
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:06.560]  uh flushing out my system uh only been on it about a month and it's people can
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:12.000]  see how much weight i've lost around the abdomen area um
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.920]  specifically they'll get i want to talk about that and some of the products
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.240]  here but specifically getting into dna force and
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.480]  why it's so dramatic well the good news is
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.760]  which i was going to tell you anyway and and for the first time is we should
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.680]  have some uh shipped out to you guys tomorrow
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.600]  so you should have it available by early next week
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.120]  it's just an amazing formula that your dad and i put together because we looked
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.000]  around and there was nothing out there and everybody really wants to
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.440]  repair themselves and slow down the aging process so
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.960]  when we were doing the research you know all aging and all disease starts at the
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.240]  cell i mean if you look at the cellular function
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.240]  cells breathe they eat they drink they go to the bathroom they do
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:01.920]  every single thing that you do so the problem is if we have a hundred
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.920]  trillion cells in our body is that our cells are contaminated you know what
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.840]  surrounds the cell is water and what's inside the cell is
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:13.280]  water it's like a balloon it's really not water it's more like
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:17.760]  salt water see it's like a it's almost identical to seawater
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.840]  the problem is whenever our cells uh are unhealthy
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.480]  what you eat and what you drink and what you're exposed to on a daily basis
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.720]  ends up in that water surrounding the cells or ends up in the water
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.400]  inside of the cells and those are going to be your heavy metals your
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.440]  pesticide residue your insecticide residue the
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.800]  genetically modified stuff the viruses the bacteria all of other these things
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.800]  that end up surrounding your cellular fluid
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.440]  that cause the cells to have to replicate faster and faster
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:54.400]  and when your cells need to replicate faster
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.160]  what's going to happen is they can cause cancer it can replicate into an
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.080]  oncogen you know an oncogene a cancerous cell
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.400]  or each time it replicates you have what's called telomeres that become
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.080]  shorter and shorter and shorter and and scientists at Harvard have
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.040]  have come to the conclusion that they can measure your aging based on the
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.200]  length of your telomeres so the DNA force is really and we
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.800]  when i was talking about you know cellular damage it's really due to free
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.080]  radical damage you know all those chemicals and toxins
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.480]  out there are nothing more than free radicals harmful free radicals
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.760]  so when we were developing DNA force what we wanted to do was
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.840]  put together a formula that would strengthen the cell that would fight
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.480]  against free radical damage high antioxidant content
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.880]  but use compounds that have been proven effective for years and years and years
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.640]  by other companies that have actually done the research on these individual
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:53.600]  ingredients and then put them all together into
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.560]  one supplement and that was the birth or the creation of DNA force
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.960]  and it's organic types of the patented ingredients
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.160]  that's what's so important it's not the synthetic version it's the type the
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.920]  body's able to upload right no one's ever put more than maybe
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.840]  two of these ingredients together in any formula that's why there is no formula
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.400]  in the world that compares to this you know anybody can look on your
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.080]  website on infowarslife.com and go under the ingredient list of
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.240]  DNA force and type each ingredient in google
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.080]  and you can actually read for yourself all the benefits and the clinical
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:35.280]  studies that were done on each individual ingredient
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.880]  and then combine all those benefits into one
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:45.200]  hardcore packed supplement and you can only imagine the benefits that you're
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.600]  going to get out of it we've just had you know rave reviews i take it personally
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.680]  on a daily basis myself just because i know how strong it is
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.440]  and you know even though i'm super clean i have plants in my office i have an
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.920]  air purification system going i mean i drink clean water
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.160]  eat organic foods you're still exposed to
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.680]  environmental toxins when you travel you're still exposed to stuff all the
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.720]  time and you know i have to admit i actually do
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:17.280]  get a little stress from time to time just because you know everybody does so
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.640]  i try to control my stress at the same time but protecting the cells
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.360]  is a key factor and you talk about a lot of that is having really clean water
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.040]  drinking a lot of water uh obviously a lot of roughage and
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.440]  things like that i mean it's a lot of things you do
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.560]  i want to go to phone calls here and talk more about detoxifying but i was
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.080]  putting a plug for the oxy powder that you developed we do have it
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.280]  you guys told me for i don't know it's off and on for a year i should take it and
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.400]  i was like really oxygen tablets i hadn't really listened to you and read that
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:50.400]  it's your proprietary system where it opens up in the intestines
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.280]  and let me just say it's dramatic and it's unlike any other cleanse i've ever
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:58.400]  done and it's been dramatic on my waist size going
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:02.400]  down uh it's just simply amazing doctor group tell
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:06.960]  people about oxy powder available at infowarslife.com
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:11.280]  well years ago when i finished my research after you know 15 years of
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.400]  doing research on the cause of all disease i wrote my first book which was
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.280]  called health begins in the colon and also disease begins in the colon and
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:22.480]  really the intestinal tract everybody calls it the colon
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.160]  but it's the first exposure point to all the disease causing toxins is how
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.840]  every single thing gets in the bloodstream i mean you might breathe a
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:33.600]  few things in through your lungs but a lot of it gets caught in your mucous
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.200]  membrane and ends up you know draining back down into your stomach and into
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.360]  your intestines anyway so uh once we realize that all
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.600]  disease causing chemicals enter through the intestinal lining the next thing
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.720]  was what's going on with everybody's intestinal
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:52.480]  lining and then we started finding out that 10 out of 10 people usually over
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.920]  the age of 30 have some form of intestinal
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.360]  problem whether it's not enough probiotics whether they're eating two
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:03.520]  acidic foods they're eating gmo foods they have leaky gut syndrome irritable
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.760]  bowel syndrome chrome disease celiac bloating gas i mean the
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.480]  list goes on and on so then we found out that most people
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.000]  aren't having two to three bowel movements a day like they should so we
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.160]  just put two and two together and said wait a second what people need to be
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:24.000]  doing ultimately is eating clean food and more raw foods and stuff like that
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  but they're not so what can we do to get to help
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  people clean their intestines on a regular basis that's going to be
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.280]  safe and effective and not harm the intestinal
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.880]  lining but actually chew away and break down
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.400]  all that compacted fecal matter that's been there for years and years and years
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:45.840]  and years and start repairing their intestinal lining
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.000]  70% of your immune system is in the gut the gut is the key
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.080]  to being health healthy the key to your immune system the key to
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:58.400]  everything inside the body and that's when we developed oxy powder because it
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.280]  was based on nicolai tesla's research on stabilizing monatomic
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.480]  oxygen the monatomic is o1 it's a reactive form of oxygen it's called
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.800]  a reactive oxygen species and not we're not talking o2 here
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.880]  because o2 is already stable so what this does is it slowly
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.720]  releases in your intestines while you sleep at night it's easy to take you
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.400]  take it before bed and then it releases all these
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.880]  tiny little oxygen bubbles and it literally oxidizes these toxins and
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:34.160]  and and cleans and wipes breaks down through an oxidation
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.320]  reduction reaction all this compaction in your small intestine in your bow
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.160]  so when you get up in the morning you have maybe two or three bow movements
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.360]  depending on you know how much stuff is going on with you and again there's a
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.080]  lot of people out there that act like kids and make jokes about this this is
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.720]  serious colon cancer all of it is exploding
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.600]  bilimoligates are obsessed with billions invested
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.640]  on manipulating all these new diseases in the gut that they know the vaccines
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.200]  are triggering it's all connected this is a major
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.920]  revolution against what they're doing it helps funder operation
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.360]  as well so it's a win-win and you can also call toll free to get your oxy
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.360]  powder your x2 survival shield nascent iodine and all the great
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:13.120]  infowarslife.com products that's infowarsstore.com
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.760]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-339 and so that's a big part of it
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.360]  with 70% of the immune system being in the gut with all these things out there
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.520]  a big part of it ladies and gentlemen is to start taking high quality
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.320]  supplements like those available at infowarslife.com
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.040]  the fluoride shield chelation you name it okay again i like to have group using
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.160]  on once a month we're having them on two weeks in a row here because
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.360]  it's key information and it helps funder operation
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:45.040]  and that just is so essential so it's a win-win why not do it
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:50.160]  let's talk to larry in michigan you're on the air with dr edward group go ahead
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.800]  how you doing dr group how you doing alex good brother go ahead i'm a member
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:02.560]  uh i got a question uh i'm 67 years old had my ticker fixed
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:08.240]  four times i got like four steps what's what's good for me to keep my ticker
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:13.040]  cleaned out well uh best thing you could do to keep
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.280]  your cardiovascular system clean you know one of the first things that we do
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.360]  is do liver and gallbladder cleansing because if the liver is clean the
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.560]  kidneys are clean you know some of the other organs are clean
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.120]  then uh you know the liver can process some of those toxins that's
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:32.640]  floating around in your cardiovascular system but again
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.160]  addressing the gut because taking it back why why your
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.480]  cardiovascular system is weak to begin with the root cause
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.320]  is because you're taking in too many chemicals and toxins or something that's
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.000]  destroying the walls of your cardiovascular system
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.160]  so how are those things getting in they're getting in through your gut
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.200]  they're getting into the bloodstream through your gut so i would focus on the
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.720]  gut and then also continually cleansing your system
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.200]  another way to strengthen the cardiovascular system is with exercise
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:08.000]  you know pumping it you know doing some exercise slowly with your case
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.680]  uh maybe getting with a natural uh healthcare practitioner in your area
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:17.120]  there's also some herbs that you can take to strengthen the cardiovascular
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.520]  system but really focus on keeping your diet clean and increasing your water
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.640]  intake with organic apple cider vinegar and avoiding the the placky
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.160]  substances the white flour everything that can cause
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:37.360]  damage to the cardiovascular system yeah well you know i try to eat right
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.040]  and i do a fair job you know i'm not fat
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:46.240]  uh i think it's a genetic thing more than anything else because other
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.720]  i mean i'm pretty healthy you know other than that
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.000]  and uh well it is true that there's pre
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.520]  dispositions for cancer heart problems but if you look at the numbers though a
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.040]  lot of this stuff's going up because of the additives that you know the fake
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:09.520]  sweeteners the artificial uh fats and i tell you all fats bad that come out
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.280]  with these new artificial fats and you see the studies it's just like glue in
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.560]  your arteries glue in your guts i mean it's it's really
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.160]  not rocket science that chicken mcnuggets and i'm not just picking on
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:23.760]  mcdonald's it's it's in most of mcnugget type stuff produced in
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.520]  china has the the the base of silicone in it as a
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.680]  fluffing agent so that you know the crispiness looks like well that's really
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.240]  a lot of fried stuff there uh and it's it's literally plastic
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.720]  i mean it's just like what might be hurting you with stuff
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.120]  you ate 20 30 years ago that's just what i'm throwing out there dr group any
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.560]  validity to that yeah it's a progressive thing i mean
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:52.400]  the thing is they want you to be sick and slowly have you know you're
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.600]  predisposed as you said you might have some genes but it's been proven that
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.440]  gene just because you have the gene for breast cancer or heart disease or
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.120]  anything that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to your genes load the gun
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.880]  but the environment pulls the trigger exactly that's exactly what happens
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.080]  there's a couple other things you know you can look into some edta
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.960]  chelation therapy that helps clean the walls there's an enzyme called seropeptase
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.120]  that's produced by the silkworm and that is really good
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.800]  for the cardiovascular system in studies it it goes through
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.560]  and helps eat away some of the plucking and strengthens the walls
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.320]  also another enzyme called natokinase which is something that you should look
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:33.360]  at as well all right thank you caller we spent a lot of time
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.000]  with that caller it was an important question we got two more short segments

[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:32.880]  but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.040]  and the eyes in his head see the world
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.600]  well the british pounded two-year high currency traders bet no

[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.960]  scott's be independent again but after five hundred years fighting to be
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.760]  independent or more
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:59.280]  want to go back to your phone calls right now with dr grope again alex
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.400]  jones here live got a third hour coming up today
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.240]  billy in california thanks for calling in you're on the air
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.720]  hey guys uh first of all the oxy powder uh my wife and i have been taking it for
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.600]  a year we bought it from the global healing center
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:18.080]  but that stuff uh with diet and exercise is amazing
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:22.560]  for fitness um more recently the vitality we both take it
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.160]  it's awesome but my question is actually about my
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:30.720]  father-in-law who has hand tremors and it's not related to parkinson's
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:34.160]  um what will be good for him dr group to take
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:40.480]  for these hand tremors well the first thing i would do is try to trace back
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:44.480]  the root cause of why he's having the hand tremors and most likely it's some
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:49.440]  sort of heavy metal uh contamination it could be aluminum deodorant
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:52.960]  but usually whenever you're having some sort of neurological problem
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:57.120]  um it stems from toxicity in the brain and
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.880]  usually the heavy metals act as carriers and they can pull chemicals and toxins
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.880]  up there so aluminum mercury so i would recommend doing
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.880]  well i would recommend doing intestinal cleansing liver and gallbladder cleansing
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:12.880]  parasite cleansing heavy and then and then after that doing
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:17.120]  chemical and heavy metal cleansing and then looking at his environment
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:21.920]  and seeing what he might be exposed to on a regular basis that could be causing
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.800]  the neurological issues and the tremors one other thing that you might want to
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:31.280]  look at too is uh was he did he have a fall or any
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.560]  type of traumatic um accident you know in the last
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:38.480]  four or five years or something that could have misplaced one of his bones
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.000]  and his neck and i would recommend him going to a chiropractor because it could
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.640]  be nerves and it could be a bone that's moved out of
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.880]  position that um or it could even it could even be muscular
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.760]  actually up in the brachial plexus which is a branch of nerves under your arms
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.960]  oh i know that now that i'm working out hard sometimes dead with it or whatever
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.760]  at night my hands will be shaking but they're fine the next day they're just
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.120]  tired yeah so you know check the nerve you
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.880]  know check the nerves there's tests that they can do i mean even a chiropractor
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:11.200]  uh can do you know can call in somebody do a nerve conduction velocity testing
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.680]  it's called ncv but uh then have him checked too for a bone that might be
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.560]  out of position all right thank you caller let's jam another one Curtis real
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.960]  quick question go ahead thank you for calling
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.120]  yeah first um i'm very healthy i'm 31 years old i eat organic
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.800]  and i take mega doses of vitamins and nutraceuticals and i don't eat any
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:32.320]  processed foods and i feel great but my question is
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.080]  uh 10 years ago or 11 years ago when i was in the army i was given the
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.000]  anthrax vaccine and probably four or five boosters after that for the three years
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.840]  i was in uh is there anything i can do to help
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.680]  flush whatever would be left of that in my body out or do you think i'm
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:52.800]  good to go at this point if i feel good uh that's
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.400]  that just depends on how good your body works i don't know how the best thing
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.480]  that you can do i mean if is just continue to cleanse your body i don't
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.280]  know how many liver and gallbladder cleanses you've done
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.800]  and how many deep cellular cleanses you've done but
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.560]  um that would be something that i would focus on if you're not having any
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.600]  symptoms that's the main thing that you want to
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:16.640]  look for but if you've already changed your diet changed your
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:20.800]  environment and you've strengthened your immune system you're doing really good
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:24.720]  you might have some residue in there forever but as long as
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:28.880]  your system is strong your self healing mechanism is strong you should be okay
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:32.320]  all right thank you so much five more minutes with dr group and our special

[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.960]  let's go to robin in new hampshire quick question please for dr group or
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.240]  comment hi guys uh dr group i'd like to know more about colloidal
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.480]  silver why 30 parts per million is more effective than
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:22.160]  say 100 parts per million or 500 parts per million
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.440]  that's a good question i mean really just over the years the last 20 or so
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:31.920]  years with the testing that people have done
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.320]  they found that the 10 parts per million actually
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:41.760]  is the most effective dose i think it has to do more with the density of the
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.600]  water you know it's a it's a complicated process when you make colloidal
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:49.920]  silver and the type of water that you use the type of silver that you use i mean
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.960]  there's a lot of different variations that are involved
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:56.800]  you know the majority of people out there use a 4 9 silver there's a difference
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:00.640]  between using a 4 9 silver and a 5 9 silver that means point
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:07.120]  9 9 9 9 9 silver there's a difference in whether you use
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:12.560]  a deionized water versus distilled water versus double distilled water versus
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.200]  triple distilled water there's not enough scientific testing
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.360]  out there that i can say reliably why
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.160]  that is um you would think that the higher the parts per million the more
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.960]  effective it is but you also have to look at
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:33.840]  the absorption and and the testing that has been done and found effective is at
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:37.440]  lower ppm dosing so talking about colloidal
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:40.320]  silver it's one of my favorite things to have
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.160]  at all times and it's one of the things that i would recommend everybody uses
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:48.160]  not only does it boost your immune system and
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.120]  many many other uses but it's also one of those things
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.200]  that you need to have stock a stock good stock of
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.360]  in case of like a pandemic like a bowl or something like that
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.200]  and in my view any colloidal silver is better than no colloidal silver
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.240]  i think it also just like anything depends on the person's body their
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.760]  biology but about the group's the expert thank you so much ma'am
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:13.120]  one more caller we have time for sorry to ben and josh well we'll see how fast
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:16.880]  we can go Anthony and florida calling in go ahead
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.360]  hello yes go ahead sir oh yeah my question is um
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:24.960]  every morning i i do a lot of um for breakfast i'll
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:30.480]  i'll juice alert and my question is and i'm not hungry until the rest of like
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:36.160]  until like um dinner time is juicing a way to to get toxins out
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:41.920]  um juicing is a way to get toxins out it's it depends on what kind of juicer
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.200]  that you have you know whether it's a pressed juicer whether you have fiber
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.080]  not in your juicer or like for example if you have a
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:53.440]  norwalk which is what the gerson recommends to where you just get the
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:56.880]  juice itself and it goes directly into your bloodstream
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.960]  depending on what you juice juicing is never bad as long as you're using
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:04.880]  organic vegetables and stuff like that because juicing is going to
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:08.640]  be high in antioxidants it's going to be alive
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.880]  you know it's a live raw food you get highly concentrated vitamins and
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:16.400]  minerals you get a good form of water in the juices
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:23.360]  so it detoxifies you it energizes you um it boosts your immune system it helps
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.720]  heal we're almost out of time about a group i want to thank you it's amazing

[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:45.840]  a hormone balancer i still would not recommend it if you're pregnant

[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:13.440]  have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.880]  even outdoor air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time

[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.680]  and they could have killed some of them laudan other leaders of al-qaeda that of
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:47.600]  course is uh famously discussed in congressional
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:52.800]  hearings with abledanger and stratus ivy he was on with us last week to talk
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:56.880]  about the fact that the vast majority not just 65 or 85 but
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.880]  over 90 of the rebels are connected to al-qaeda type groups
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.920]  so he said hey you ought to get robert david steele
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:09.600]  on and so it's exciting to get him on robert david steele's a former marine

[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:46.480]  affordable and then it goes on to talk about being scalable
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:49.920]  his most recent book is the open source everything manifesto

[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.680]  robert thanks for coming on with us yeah alex it's an honor really i'm very
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:43.520]  glad to be here it's great to be here i mean to have you there's so much you
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:46.480]  discuss i just threw out a whole bunch of stuff what do you want to hit first
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:51.040]  i you follow the the program you've got ben gazi's good i've got six reasons why
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:57.680]  ben gazi was a cluster a perfect storm give us your take on ben gazi
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:04.400]  well first off cia did a coast cathie uh one of the problems with cia where i
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:08.320]  was a clandestine case officer and i served in three overseas tourists
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:11.600]  including chasing terrorists and planning for regime change
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:17.200]  is cia is a bureaucracy it doesn't actually do threat assessments it's not
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.920]  actually in touch with ground truth it tends to take most of its threat
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.680]  intelligence from local liaison from its counterpart services
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:29.440]  it doesn't have the clandestine human penetrations of rebel groups and
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.680]  others that it's supposed to have so bottom line is i think cia got
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:37.040]  blindsided they were doing their little arms transfer stuff
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:41.600]  and they did not realize just how vulnerable a position they had put themselves
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.480]  in number two the department of state is not responsible
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.640]  for defending cia facilities that are not part of an established
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:57.280]  diplomatic installation and the same is true for do d so cia was out on its own
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.320]  operating in annex that was not part of the the lineup according to do d or
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:05.840]  state and they failed to defend themselves
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:10.160]  number three there was no marine expeditionary unit offshore
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.760]  now normally we have a marine expeditionary unit offshore in the med
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.280]  but the joint chiefs of staff for reasons that are beyond me
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:21.360]  decided that they didn't need one that particular month
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:25.120]  number four i think panetta lost his nerve
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:28.320]  uh i do believe that general ham and everybody else
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.960]  said hey we've got to do something uh we had seven hours
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:36.080]  within which we could have done something and one of the first things that i and
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:40.240]  other officers did when that email came in the state was we posted
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.000]  a graphic of of all of the available units that
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.080]  were within one to two hours away and that graphic if you look up graphic
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:51.840]  Benghazi fiasco master post you'll get right to it
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:56.640]  and that shows everything that was available um and then you have besides
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:01.600]  panetta losing his nerve uh you basically have um
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.000]  you basically have uh the president uh the white house
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.440]  dithering for seven hours there is no question
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.040]  but that the white house knew what to do and i think it all comes down for me it
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:16.880]  comes down to panetta losing his nerve
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.400]  well we look at Benghazi and it's just another example of
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:27.120]  who this country's supposedly working for because from what i've read and what's
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.960]  been an open source as you call it this was really the security force there in
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:33.840]  Benghazi the group that the west had been you know
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:37.440]  conduiting arms through and then for some reason they decided to come down and
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.040]  attack the facility uh i mean i got dovetails and
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:45.680]  segues off into the rest of isis or issel or al-qaeda in iraq and
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:48.480]  where all that's going was in exchange two days ago
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:52.160]  with the chairman of the joint chiefs uh in the senate arm service committee
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.400]  dimsey with senator graham and graham was going now none of our allies ever
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:00.560]  work with issel changing the names again and then dimsey goes well yeah
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:03.680]  they're arming them i mean it's just it's just it seems like
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.520]  for when i've seen the military knows that this is going on from the grass
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:11.040]  roots right up at the top and i just don't see how
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:14.400]  they can get away with this i mean it's just so immoral
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.200]  to to to overthrow a sod and put something in
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:20.320]  ten times worse in my view do you agree with that or what can you add to that
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:24.720]  alex i i agree with you completely and and as you say there's so much we could
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:27.200]  talk about but let's unpack this a little bit
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:32.240]  first off let me give really high credit to the defense attache's on the ground
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:36.480]  uh one of the great shining spots in defense intelligence
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.320]  is the defense attache core and the things these guys do and the risks they
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.640]  take to go out on the street in in completely open capabilities
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:49.920]  um i really respect these guys and yes dod get stuff that cia does not get
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.840]  because cia has its head up the rear end of foreign liaison
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:58.080]  it literally does not have clandestine human penetrations of all of these
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:01.360]  groups now number two the american government
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:04.880]  generally in the intelligence community particularly
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.720]  are naive they literally have allowed the
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:13.920]  soddies to fund radical islam they've allowed the zionists to basically
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.760]  take everything they want from us at american taxpayer expense
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.000]  and we don't actually do a a balance sheet
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.920]  of what's going on with the allies my personal feeling is that
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:29.920]  we have absolutely no business putting troops into into the middle east and we
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:32.720]  have absolutely no business arming the arab
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:36.560]  dictators and we have no business paying 20 percent of the of the israeli
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:39.680]  budget which is being used to eradicate palestine
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:43.440]  but what this boils down to is the failure of american intelligence and a
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.040]  failure of american integrity and let me stop there and and
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:52.480]  give it back to you for a follow-up oh i just don't
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:56.560]  understand the policy i mean i could see a policy of balkanization
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:00.000]  and i'm not an anti-israel guy on my shelf but when netanyahu came out a
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.240]  few months ago i was in the jerusalem post saying
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.160]  you know isis might be good because it'll destabilize everything
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.840]  that's just so macchiavellian to openly say
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:14.800]  we want failed states from libya to syria and even try to
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:18.320]  you know destabilize uh egypt it just it sounds like
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.480]  set the world on fire and watch it burn well what what you really have here is
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:27.440]  i think obama is a prisoner of state uh the neoconservative game plan which is
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:30.640]  also the zionist game plan and i certainly distinguished between the
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:36.400]  loyal american jews and the loyal jews in israel and the the
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:40.160]  nation of israel and then the zionist management of israel
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:44.400]  um it's only the last that i have a real problem with
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.920]  but the neocons when they took us to war on the basis of 935 now documented
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:53.760]  lies they had a plan to destabilize the entire
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:57.920]  region general west clark went on video his video still up there talking about
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:01.280]  a foreign policy coup what's happening now in
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:07.280]  washington with isis is a second foreign policy coup and it's 935
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.440]  lies light i just don't see how they're
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:15.520]  going to get away with it because most people are figuring out
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:19.120]  we're going to fund the rebels to take out the rebels
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:22.400]  when the majority anyway you slice it or the radicals
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:26.560]  and then they just last week blew up the non radicals all at some meeting
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:29.760]  shades of darth vader showing up you know in episode three to
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:33.600]  kill the uh you know the opposition leaders i mean it's just it just really
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:38.720]  reeks i mean what is the policy from the best you know from your sources
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:42.320]  i don't see a policy what i see is a spending plan
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.960]  um from where i sit and this goes back to vietnam
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:50.720]  and to iraq and to the general perception within the
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.720]  the neoconservative circles the banking circles the military industrial circles
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:57.600]  and if you haven't had chuck spinney and windslow
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:04.000]  wheeler on i certainly recommend them what the money people are trying to do
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.400]  is send the military back into the middle east to use it up burn it out
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:11.760]  have more veteran suicides have more casualties
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:15.840]  and they are completely oblivious to the fact that that's exactly what
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:20.480]  the saudi arabians and and the jordanians and the kitaris
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:23.840]  and the united arab republic and the israelis as you just pointed out
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.840]  that's what they want us to do they want america to put troops back on the
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.880]  ground so everybody will be angry at the americans
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:34.560]  and this will take some pressure off of the dictators in the middle east
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:38.320]  who are essentially doing to their public what the wall street
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.240]  uh one percent has done to the american public
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:45.120]  you know i like to paraphrase abe lincoln and one of the reasons that
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.760]  scotland and and katalan and quebec and all these
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.920]  other secessionist movements are are active now is as a guy named neil did
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:55.520]  so beautifully in the in the new york times today
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:01.120]  is you cannot screw 90 of the people 90 of the time and that's what's happened
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:07.680]  these last 20 years um so i absolutely oppose any further american air strikes
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:10.640]  any further american destabilization of syria
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:14.480]  any further american troops into the middle east in fact i think we should
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:18.000]  close down the 44 bases that we have surrounding
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.120]  iran we need to come back home where 30 to 40
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:28.160]  towns in california and 30 to 40 towns in texas have run out of water
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.360]  and a bowl and there are other things we can talk about but the bottom line is
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:34.720]  there is no policy there is no strategy there is no
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:39.760]  policy there is no intelligence coming out of the white house right now

[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:15.200]  guest he's a marine and of course a former cik case officer spy
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:18.560]  hacker ceo of open source solutions network i want to talk about his
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:22.480]  book and what he means by open source everything that's a book i want to read
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:25.760]  but but in the short segment
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:30.000]  specifically because you know israel does it at least in the u.s become a
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.160]  sacred cow uh it's also a sacred cow to bash israel
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:37.600]  it just becomes a bunch of tribal victory all on both sides
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:40.960]  i don't like the israel lobby manipulating internal
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:44.240]  politics in this country and i don't like other lobbies doing it either
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:48.080]  uh so i don't like israel or at least people that run israel trying to couch
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:50.960]  any disagreements with what they say is being anti-israel
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:53.840]  even by jews that live in israel it just becomes assing on its way to
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:57.120]  like saying you're racist if you don't agree with obama on something or if you
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:00.240]  don't like obama care that by the way the republicans just joined
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:06.080]  the democrats in funding it bainer uh with polosi but that's another issue
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:11.600]  we'll cover another point so i'm annoyed by both sides of this
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.200]  thing uh because then i just see vicious vitriol out of the
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.320]  anti-israel crowd that uses their hatred of israel is just an
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:22.560]  excuse to act however they want but then i see out of what i guess you call
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:27.920]  um the militarized state of the you know in in israel as as a as kind of a
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:31.840]  military industrial complex that eisenhower talked about using that
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.920]  as a way to control israel and then skim the money off the top from
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:39.440]  all the us aid i mean is that what you're basically getting at
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.360]  i i totally agree with you and let me come back to morten halperin's book
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.160]  bureaucratic politics and foreign policy that book tells you that rule number
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:51.120]  one in washington is lie to the president if you
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:55.280]  can get away with it and i will tell you that that based on my
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:58.560]  looking at what john carrey and chuck hagel are getting from their
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:01.360]  intelligence people and what obama is getting
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:05.680]  obama has nobody today in washington that he can trust
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:11.520]  to tell him the truth and that's what i'm about i'm about putting the truth on
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:15.440]  the table the truth at any cost lowers all other costs and
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:19.680]  right now obama is deaf dumb and blind
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:23.360]  well undoubtedly you can see the policies by western governments are
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.880]  completely run by special interest and it's like the special interests are
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.240]  driving us off a cliff they're not going to be able to spend all that money if we
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:32.480]  have nuclear war with russia they're not going to be able to
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.680]  spend all that if we say i mean it's just it's just so immoral
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:39.760]  and i'm not in romanticizing the elites of old like eisenhower and kennedy and
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:42.880]  people but it just seems like there's a
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:46.960]  decadence to it and weird warmongering women at the state department
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:54.880]  i mean it it it's it's really obscene it is obscene but i have good news for you
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:58.080]  and and it actually comes from the roth trials
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:02.640]  um i've been working with some people in europe and we're looking very much at
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:06.080]  how the economy is changing and what the messages are that are coming out from
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:09.840]  the elites and and i want to give a kissing her and and for
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.600]  reed zacharia high marks which i don't normally do
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:17.760]  because they've broken ranks with the insiders that are pushing this war on
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:21.200]  on isis and if people go to five beta iota the public
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:25.360]  intelligence blog and just search for isis they'll get some very compelling
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:29.040]  truthful surveys of what's actually going on
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:32.800]  but here is what happened in london they had a conference on inclusive
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:37.200]  capitalism this was sponsored by the city of london and by the
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:42.960]  rocks trials lady rocks child this is nothing less than a primal screen
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:47.280]  this is nothing less than the people who are managing 30 trillion dollars saying
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:51.920]  oh my god the pitchforks are coming so i'll tell you alex you're absolutely
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:55.440]  right when you say this is a wonderful time to be alive
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.400]  because i think what is happening now is that the financial people are
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:04.560]  realizing that the two-party tyranny that they've been so happy to sponsor for
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:08.480]  so long has failed them and they have to find the third
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:12.880]  path and i think you and i are part of that third path
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:16.480]  what is your view obviously when nobody lionizes russia it's got its share of
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:22.080]  corruption and you know kind of thuggish bureaucracy but
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.880]  what do you think about ukraine and where all this is going because it seems
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:28.080]  pretty dangerous to me well let me say first off i've been
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:32.400]  high on putin for a long time i think putin is a professional a realist a
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:37.520]  serious guy uh and he has put up with a lot of misbehavior
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:42.320]  by the united states as well as elements of europe on the ukraine
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:45.520]  putin shares some of the blame because he allowed a
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:48.720]  a corrupt communist government to go for too long
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:52.640]  but now we have a corrupt fascist government
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:58.640]  um the ukraine is a really ugly mess the united states has no business being
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:02.400]  in there nato has no business saying that they
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:05.840]  well first off nato has been violating its promise to russia
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:10.240]  that we would not embrace the eastern european countries and add them to nato
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:13.680]  so we have a whole long line of broken promises
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:17.360]  with respect to eastern europe as a buffer zone well it's a broken treaty
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:19.760]  isn't it go ahead i mean it's pretty much a broken
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:24.080]  treaty right yes and and and we are the violators
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:29.120]  we should not be in the ukraine period i want to hear where you think it's

[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:17.760]  every single day if there's a water emergency

[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:15.840]  your phone calls but um what what do you and
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:19.520]  the other uh you know thinkers that you read and see
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:22.080]  is there a consensus because i mean there's a consensus we've seen how
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:25.760]  there's a decline of the whole world really uh except for maybe some areas of
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:30.400]  asia a accelerated moral decline a police state
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:33.600]  acceleration uh an elite that just thinks they can
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:38.160]  continue to just buy more armored vehicles more drones more nsa spying
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:40.800]  more hidden microphones more stingray systems
[02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:43.920]  stealing your data more i mean you're talking about how there's no real human
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:49.680]  intelligence in the cia except domestically uh my dad just retired but
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:53.440]  he and all the doctors where he worked got visited by homeland security and they
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:56.880]  said like two years ago we want you to spy on your patients
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:00.960]  and they said what like like terrorists people that said no just you know
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:04.080]  everybody tell us what they're thinking and come to monthly meetings with
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:06.720]  homeland security we can even get you a little card and
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:08.960]  you know if you work enough for us give you some money
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:12.880]  they were like trying to turn doctors into like spy informants
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.160]  and a lot of them you know watch 24 or something think it's really cool but
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:20.640]  most of knew that it was like going to work for chelchescu or something
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.800]  and then you learn about clergy response teams and fbi infregard and
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:27.680]  and and i mean i personally have to deal
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:31.680]  with well-known fbi informants literally and i'm thinking about
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:36.320]  doing a report on this literally following me around and then letting me
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:39.680]  know they are and just doing all sorts of weird stuff just
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:43.680]  because i'm on air saying i think we should not have warrantless wiretapping
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:46.960]  i mean it's just and it's just so crazy to watch this
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:50.160]  decline it's scary and and i don't want to
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:53.600]  leave the us with my family there's really nowhere to go
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:57.680]  i mean it's almost like ringing of hands here
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:02.080]  well let me give you the good news and the bad news um the bad news is
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:05.440]  you're you're absolutely right we've created a national security state
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:09.200]  and and homeland security in the nsa with its mass surveillance they're out of
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:12.640]  control the good news is it's an employment
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:17.200]  program for white guys that can't get jobs anywhere else
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:21.440]  okay and what you really have because i mean i'm part of that community i've
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:24.320]  been part of that community i still care for that community
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:28.240]  my wife still works for that community and the bottom line is
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:32.960]  95 percent of these people are good people trapped in a bad system
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:38.160]  what this is all about is spending money because congress gets a five percent
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:41.440]  kickback and nobody really cares whether homeland
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.480]  security the nsa are are effective or not they're not
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:48.000]  in fact almost virtually everything that's happened in the united states
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:52.880]  has been a false flag event it has not been a real event and nsa has not
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:55.440]  prevented a single terrorist incident neither has
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:59.440]  homeland security so the good news is this is really
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:04.480]  the u.s government budget out of control serving special interests and giving
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:09.280]  congress a five percent kickback it's not actually the orwellian state it's
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:12.720]  it's more of a perversion of the orwellian state
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:16.640]  so it's like a bunch of country club folks and others just running around with
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:20.480]  all this high-tech power and it's basically just a way to
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:23.440]  continue the gravy train rolling because i mean sure the
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:26.320]  nazis had a security state but they were really going around grabbing people
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:30.400]  on work somewhat organized no i gotta give people credit because
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:34.320]  yes they they will they will assassinate you and they will lock you up
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.840]  without due process and there are some pretty bad things that are happening
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:42.400]  but it's a very very small tiny percentage i think i remember madeline
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:46.640]  albright's memorandum memoir she talked about how a secretary of
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.240]  state she was a gerbil on a wheel so just think of
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:53.600]  these people as 10 million gerbils on wheels
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:56.880]  yeah you've got an idea of how threatening they actually are to the
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:01.440]  constitution well my problem is is that well you
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:06.800]  already said another case entirely sure sure they definitely don't like me
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:12.080]  they they hire though these really obviously sociopathic psychopathic
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:16.000]  borderline personality disorder narcissists types who go around doing
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.200]  their dirty work and you know it's usually their operatives not even agents
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.160]  or people and then you'll find people with two or three degrees and a big
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:26.000]  combat resume that run eight miles every morning and are super moral
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.080]  and you know volunteer at the church and they're just
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:34.400]  literally at a cubicle and then you'll just have whoever psychopathic
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:38.400]  just running around the streets you know doing whatever they want i mean i had
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:42.000]  i had family obviously a ci recruits a lot out of texas
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.200]  who just you before they died were just point blank that you know they were
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:48.640]  taken out of the army put in black ops teams and went around assassinating
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:53.200]  people inside the u.s. and it just you start learning how pervasive all this
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:56.160]  is so when you say yeah they lock people up they have rendition
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:58.800]  they kill people it is a very small percentage
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:02.240]  but it's still we've got about 10 million people that's that small
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:05.920]  percentages is a pretty big you know multi brigade level hit team
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:08.560]  operation you're you're absolutely right and in
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:12.880]  fact we should talk about boston breaks and the murder of that journalist and
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:15.600]  yeah let's talk about that talk about false flags sir
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:19.040]  all right well from from from where i sit
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:23.040]  both the school in connecticut and the boston bombing were false flag
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:27.200]  operations um the school in connecticut had been
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:32.080]  closed for four years there were no students no teachers no parent
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:36.400]  teacher association the paramedics were not allowed into the school
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:40.400]  from where i sit that was a complete false flag it was a drill
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:45.200]  and we've already not we but others have exposed the actors that were involved
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:49.760]  the financial relations with the families that were allegedly victimized
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:53.280]  who had their homes bought and who were then given
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:57.360]  exit paths all of that is on the record but you don't see the media covering
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:00.480]  that boston bombing for me the truth teller
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:03.840]  was when the rabbis and the priests rushed to comfort the wounded
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:06.960]  and they were not allowed to get near any of the wounded
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:11.520]  that in intelligence we call an indicator and then you add to that the fact
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:17.200]  that there were no i mean no wounded people being taken to the hospitals
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:22.640]  um and finally you add to that the big to do about the amputee
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:26.800]  he turns out to be a hired actor for a company that specializes
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:31.600]  at putting amputees into battlefield simulations
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:38.560]  false flag boston was a practice attempt to lock down an entire city
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:42.400]  uh we actually had our reporters on the ground we got death-threaded pretty
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:46.400]  seriously over that and that's when a lot of heat got turned on against this
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:49.680]  operation they got really upset and they even had secret
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:52.320]  service even though obama wasn't there going and telling our reporters on
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:55.680]  national news it ended up getting televised you know don't ask your
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.800]  question and they told the reporters don't look at this man's photos
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:02.480]  well what we had was what appeared to be craft international
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:06.000]  yeah navy seal sheep dip even wearing the punisher hats
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:09.600]  and the uniform and some of the guys we identified in other photos of craft
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:12.000]  people were not saying they were involved because they were all looking
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.040]  around didn't know what was happening they all had black backpacks it looked
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:19.280]  like to create a bunch of decoys again i'm not saying they were even involved
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.400]  and then we had all this other stuff added to it and the brothers saying we
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:24.800]  didn't do it they're chased down they're killed
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.480]  locked down the city try to hunt him down he pleads not guilty
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:32.080]  they start killing their friends i mean let's elaborate on why you're saying
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:36.880]  false flag because uh well if you if you go to phi beta iota
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:40.560]  and you look up boston bombing you'll get to all of the
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:43.680]  the coverage that we've had and when i say we
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:48.080]  i'm a curator and i keep the hands off distance but i've got over 80 contributing
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:51.360]  editors and and some of them are quite extraordinary
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:55.280]  um but if you look up boston bombing at phi beta iota you'll get everything but
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:59.360]  if you go back to the actual bomb it was a theatrical device
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:03.200]  you don't buy gunpowder at a firework store
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:07.920]  to create a bomb it just is not done i had my explosive ordinance people look
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.520]  at this everybody laughed at this this was school
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:16.480]  kids stuff there was no bomb there were no injuries
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.040]  this was a false flag and now we're starting to see 9-11
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:24.960]  unravel and richard gauge has gotten on a c-span and
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:28.400]  basically the american public is starting to wake up
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:31.520]  and all of these little things that they could have gotten away with
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:36.320]  are now starting to collapse because of the internet because of guys like you
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:39.360]  because of people like me and my contributing editors
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:42.480]  and so i think we're coming to the end of the road here
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:46.720]  uh i do believe i really want to stress this i think 95 percent of the people in
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:49.680]  the u.s government are good people trapped in a bad system
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:53.520]  but the last five percent are doing some evil pathologically
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:58.720]  sick things including murdering u.s citizens um and that's the part that
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.920]  i'm starting to see some signs of encouragement for example
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:05.600]  and this is my last comment the court has just
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:08.960]  finally refused to accept attorney general
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:12.480]  uh assurances about secret state documents
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:16.560]  and for the first time in modern history the court is saying to the executive
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:21.600]  you have to show us these secret documents we will not let you make claims
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:25.600]  without showing us the documents i believe the tide is turning
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:28.880]  legally against government misbehavior
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:32.240]  wow i gotta tell you we've got to have you back for a full hour sir just on
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:35.360]  false flags and and also on your book we're getting your book in a moment take
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:40.800]  some calls but look at how suddenly the head of
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:45.040]  crafts international the navy seal gets killed right after the boston bombings
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:48.400]  at a shooting range and all of this and and again that's a key
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:52.480]  part of the investigation it is all these craft guys out there who i never
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:55.840]  said were involved there were clearly lots of decoy groups
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:59.440]  so that no one could catch whoever really detonated the simulant
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:02.240]  which i showed to bomb experts they said look it just poofs there's nothing
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:05.440]  even there that kind of like the underwear bomber was obviously drugged
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:08.880]  brought on the plane our witnesses saw it confirmed a month and a half later
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:12.560]  about two lawyers uh exactly mr and mrs haskell
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:16.960]  and and it's just how do they think they'll get away with something
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:20.640]  this this this this big and this obvious
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:24.720]  look i gotta tell you having been a spy for a long time and and having worked in
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:28.400]  that environment it is a it is an environment characterized
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:33.280]  by being out of touch with reality they're out of touch with real people
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:36.960]  they're out of time let me give you a simple example out of the 14 out of the
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:40.320]  1400 professors of middle eastern studies in the
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:43.920]  united states of america cia talks to maybe 14
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:48.320]  and those 14 are the ones that are u.s citizens with secret clearances
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:52.080]  okay so they have they they're beyond rose colored
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:56.400]  glasses these people are wearing an eye patch and they have a pinhole on the
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.720]  other eye um they are literally out of touch nobody
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:03.920]  challenges them and that's the problem i testified
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:07.520]  to senator patrick moinahan god rest his soul and
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:13.200]  i testified on secrecy and what secrecy does secrecy makes you stupid
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.160]  that's right i want to go to some calls but let's talk about i can't wait to
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:19.200]  read your book open source everything because
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:23.120]  when it's open source everything you get the transparency the truth will emerge
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:25.600]  very easily and and then there's such a deeper
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:29.120]  understanding but exactly in a national security state
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:32.400]  it just looks lies and fraud and laziness grow they want to make
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:35.680]  everything secret because they want to cover up all the screw-ups
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:38.640]  they want to get they want to make everything secret in part to avoid
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:41.760]  accountability yeah
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:44.720]  and then it's like a new title of nobility too
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.760]  it's like oh i have a security clearance yeah well that that's become so
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:53.920]  devalued now i mean it unfortunately a security
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.200]  clearance today does not mean that you're trustworthy
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:01.920]  it means that you have accepted slavery
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:06.720]  well that's a heavy statement well i i tell you something the threats that are
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:11.280]  being made to my colleagues today they are being told that if they have a
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:14.480]  twitter or if they have a facebook post or if they
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.080]  are seen anywhere within three miles of a journalist
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.920]  they will lose their security clearance they've tried to arrest
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:25.600]  members of the state department that publicly at press conferences go talk
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:28.800]  to fox news for five minutes and give their personal opinion
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:31.760]  uh about kim jong-un i mean that that's it's like
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:35.360]  you we will arrest you for state secrets i mean
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:40.000]  you and i are loyal dissidents and one of the problems that our government has
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:43.120]  today is it does not understand that we are the canary
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:47.440]  in the coal mine we are the loyal people saying
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:51.520]  you have a problem here and so they're killing the canary
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:55.840]  to have no warning and that's a huge mistake
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.360]  but i agree with you it's starting to turn around but won't the entrenched
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:02.080]  bureaucracies and special interests and foreign
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:05.840]  interests won't they pull off a huge false flag or
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:09.920]  have we exposed false flags so well now that it's into the vernacular
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:15.040]  that they are hesitant to use it no they will have another false flag in fact
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:19.120]  the the false flag i'm hearing about is a simulated Ebola attack
[02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:23.200]  in which they actually use biochemical weapons that that dissipate
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:27.040]  but then they pretended it's Ebola and that it has been brought here by
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:30.800]  saudi martyrs okay so no we have not reached the
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:34.560]  end of the false flag line however what we have reached
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:38.160]  is i i did my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution and there's a
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:41.920]  difference between preconditions of revolution and precipitants
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:45.600]  and i have posted a graphic on preconditions of revolution that exist
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:50.400]  in the usa today now a precipitant is like the tunisian fruit seller
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:54.480]  my preferred precipitant is a soccer mom that torches herself on the steps of
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:57.760]  capitol hill and it appears on youtube but the bottom
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:04.160]  line is the next false flag could lead to a general strike across this country
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:07.520]  people really are not buying it i mean they just get caught i talked to the
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:11.200]  military and i'm not exaggerating it was 50 percent of the military
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:14.960]  enlisted her officers i talked to 10 years ago that were somewhat away
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:19.760]  two years ago it was like 75 percent it's like 90 percent now
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:25.520]  i know it's 100 percent that's why the military in fact the military
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:30.080]  military veterans 22 of whom are committing suicide every single day
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:35.360]  military veterans plus unemployed college kids plus unemployed old guys like me
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:38.800]  in my demographic the unemployment rate is close to the 40 percent
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:42.800]  the real unemployment in the united states according to shadow stats dot com
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:48.560]  is 22 percent yep okay and if we all come together and you throw into that the
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:51.680]  soccer moms i think you have the beginning of a
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:55.120]  revolution in the united states of america and that's why i ran for president
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:58.720]  to get an electoral reform act that would put the public back in
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:02.400]  charge and every single person running for the presidency
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:07.280]  including ron paul refused to engage because they wanted to keep their sugar
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:11.440]  bowl going well if you talk about you know
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:15.040]  people like colonel shaffer has so much courage they tried to throw him in jail
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.280]  for speaking out made up stuff they tried to uh
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:22.800]  william benny and number four at the nsa the director of one of their major
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:25.520]  programs they've been trying to put him in prison
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:28.880]  uh and and you know they're now calling me up saying listen we're going to set
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:32.000]  you up and put you in prison i haven't got to this yet on air but i mean it's
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.880]  been multiple people just point blank saying we're gonna come after you if you
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:37.760]  don't shut your mouth and i don't think they understand this
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:40.640]  can give the point where i'm gonna come after them and i don't mean in a
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:43.680]  violent way i mean you know these roads go two ways
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:47.600]  here you know i mean i i do unfortunately i think they have
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:52.720]  the power to do more damage to you than than than we have to do to them
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.640]  but if you were to disappear i would be very pleased if your audience
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:01.520]  rose up and demanded habeas corpus uh because if alex
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:07.600]  jones goes off the air people will notice if i disappear nobody will notice
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.160]  well it's it's just unprecedented how how just
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:16.800]  do you think that the power structure fills cornered now or does it feel arrogant
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:19.760]  uh first off there's no such thing as one power structure
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:24.560]  bunch of interest you you you have you have the fbi is multiple fbis i've
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.160]  posted a thing on how there's actually seven cias
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.000]  um and so what you're probably dealing with is
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.080]  mid-level to low-level morons that do not have the approval of their senior
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:39.600]  agency heads yeah no that's what i've been
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:43.040]  told by the marines because i've dealt with uh
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:48.720]  state department security forces like just trying to like go cover a obama
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:51.920]  event and you know running around it's just i don't know i was like i tell you

[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:18.160]  is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:20.640]  reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:24.240]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be

[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:27.600]  talk about that specifically let's go to some phone calls here for our guest
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:31.600]  robert david steel highly recommended by
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:34.320]  colonel schaffer and you can see why amazing interview
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:37.040]  frank in north carolina thank you for calling go ahead
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:41.040]  oh yeah my phone's going crazy now i got something i need to tell you though
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:44.800]  uh about seven years ago i was on my space
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:49.360]  and i was communicating back and forth with a female police officer nypd
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:53.120]  she uh eventually wrote a book and i i can only remember her first name but
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:56.560]  she uh told me some information and i can't recall it's been so many years
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:55:00.400]  ago i can't remember if it was off the record or what but she said on the
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.320]  morning of 9 11 she was on duty you know she got the badge gun
[02:55:04.320 --> 02:55:08.960]  you know uniform radio all that she said uh that it was very well known
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:13.360]  amongst the police among the police department there uh that
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:17.600]  taken into custody were individuals with remote control
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:20.560]  detonators and i said well how come this never made it into the media this is
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:24.160]  many years ago when she told me this i haven't been i i have not sure that was
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:28.000]  even on fox news and that was in new jersey and other areas let's get
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:35.440]  steel's take on that well first off 9 11 was was was uh we got 13
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.080]  different countries warned us about 9 11 three to six months in advance
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:44.720]  and dick chaney used that to schedule a national counterterrorism exercise
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:48.880]  specifically to allow 9 11 to happen dick chaney murdered
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.480]  3000 people in order to get his trifecta for going to war in iraq larry
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:59.280]  silverstein was briefed by the mosad and put in the control demolitions
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:04.080]  the fema emergency center was set up on the piers of new york the night before
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:09.840]  9 11 um bottom line is that 9 11 was government
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:14.320]  complicity it was a crime against humanity
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:19.840]  and richard gauge and the architects and engineers of 9 11 are finally gaining
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:25.440]  traction and i am with a great deal of pride a 9 11 truther
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:32.000]  um this was all a contrived operation that murdered people including foreigners
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.480]  on united states so with the complicity of dick chaney in the white house
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:40.080]  and and now it's going to come out the 28 page report that that i've talked to
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:42.160]  congressman have seen it welter jones and others
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:45.440]  clearly says shawty rabbi involved stand down was ordered
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:48.480]  and even ron paul has come out now and said there was clearly a stand down
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:52.480]  well that's complicity right there yes and i'm glad to see ron paul get into
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:55.920]  this because i think i personally i would have voted for ron paul as president
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:00.560]  if he had not let the the republicans steal the last election from him
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:06.880]  um the saudi's provided the passports and the saudi's provided uh the the kind
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:11.360]  of the pretext for operations i personally do not believe that airplanes
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:14.880]  hit the twin towers and i personally believe that a missile took out the
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:19.280]  pentagon but what i like to do and i honor uh
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:22.720]  the guy that rode crossing the ruber con um rupert
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:27.040]  um michael rubert yes he may in fact have been pressed to suicide
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:32.080]  uh but the bottom line here is what i like to say is i am absolutely certain
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:36.240]  9 11 has not been properly investigated i completely support
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:40.000]  richard gaige's call for an independent independently funded
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:43.440]  investigation and i have lectured in new york and i have
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:49.120]  said if you give me the 90 days of larry silverstein prior to 9 11 i will
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:52.960]  give you the entire plot so are you saying i don't under
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:56.240]  blue beam other programs they have giant hologram projectors
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:00.880]  i'm not sure it was holograms as much as uh planes flying by
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:06.000]  uh drones there's any there are multiple different kinds of things including
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:09.920]  cloaking devices i mean we have some very advanced technology
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:12.800]  well sure i mean i was told about that 20 years ago and now they've admitted
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:17.040]  they got tanks and planes that are see-through you were ahead of your time
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:20.960]  but the bottom line here is the three buildings in new york came down with
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:23.680]  control demolitions i don't care what hit them
[02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:27.680]  whatever hit them did not bring them down they were brought down with control
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:31.120]  demolitions and the pentagon was undoubtedly some of those planes
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:34.480]  look like they were they were cargo planes painted up look like passenger
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:36.640]  planes i don't know just we know the official story
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:40.720]  isn't true we know that we'll be right back in one minute talk to chip and
[02:58:40.720 --> 02:58:44.720]  Tony and others are just amazing amazing interviewing our guests

[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:14.640]  harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially
[02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:18.160]  dangerous ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic fillers

[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:39.440]  with the question or comment but mr steele alex thank you so
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:42.800]  very much for for your time and even every day do overdrive here's what we've
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:46.320]  got guys uh mr steele i'm curious as to what you think
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:50.400]  about mandatory vaccinations a couple days ago
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:55.120]  our local city here in fairfield arkansas is requiring our students to get a
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:00:59.280]  mandatory chicken box back well they lie they say it's mandatory it's not really
[03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:02.640]  they have to give you a waiver well we're looking into all that stuff
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:06.560]  because they've not contacted us per their email or phone now they play dumb
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:09.920]  and say there isn't one in a conspiracy to lie to you mr steele comments on
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:13.520]  mandatory i'll tell you this is why i'm such a
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:18.080]  a believer in the truth what we are learning now
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:22.880]  is that vaccinations on the one hand if they're honest vaccinations and they're
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:25.840]  properly screened and you know what's in them they're good
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:30.240]  they prevent disease but what we're also learning is that bill gates and others
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:35.280]  are using them for eugenics purposes we have found vaccinations not me personally
[03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:38.560]  but the many many people that i rely on it's been on mainstream it's been on
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:41.200]  mainstream news he's had a bunch of deaths in a un
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:46.320]  shot program in syria look vaccinations are sterilizing people in african
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:49.360]  central america and so is monsanto grain
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:52.960]  okay by the third generation of rats eating monsanto grain
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:57.040]  they're sterile so what i really believe in
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:02.080]  is that we the people have a right to public intelligence which for me means
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:05.040]  decision support it doesn't mean spine
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:09.200]  we the people have a right to know what's in that vaccination
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:13.280]  and my bottom line is there's nobody in the united states of america i trust
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:16.640]  today that will tell me what's in that vaccination
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:20.880]  exactly they don't want gmo labeling they won't let us have it in california
[03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:23.760]  so you can't know what's in your food with the nsas you know what you said on
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:27.040]  the phone to your wife i mean yeah but only if they want to destroy you
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:31.120]  alex the the good news about nsa is it only processes one percent of what it
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:34.960]  collects the bad news is it processes everything about alex
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:40.000]  johnson's oh i know and then add some
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:44.960]  let's go to indigo in colorado uh i'm i guess i'm the burning man when it comes
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:49.280]  down to the end of the end of the day uh indigo you're on the air
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:54.880]  i agree with you guys about this abola false flag my dad trains constantly for
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:58.800]  you drill in the northeast for the imminent biological attack with hazmat
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:01.680]  suits and all that but i was serious so what your
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:06.240]  guest thought about uh a second amendment false flags on the border like
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:11.920]  i had this dream seven months ago about where i was a little latin american kid
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:16.000]  with like uh just women and children like in the compound and
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:20.400]  there was gunfire that went off and i ran outside it was a
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:23.600]  basically a black ops operation it was blamed on
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:28.000]  i just knew it was blamed on veterans um because after i got shot it uh
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.760]  zoomed out it was yeah and that's another question they're constantly demonizing
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:34.400]  veterans and saying they're the main terror threat what do you think about
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:38.480]  that uh i think they are scared to death of veterans
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:43.120]  i mean veterans are a sacred institution in america and they should be
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:48.560]  um the bottom line here is that again you know the u.s government is not a
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:52.080]  monolith 95 of it good people trapped in a
[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:55.120]  bad system but the u.s government is doing some very
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:59.280]  bad things at the political level and and what really troubles me is that
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:03.280]  people have forgotten their oath to the constitution of the united states
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:07.200]  because we have too many people in law enforcement as well as the military as
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:11.200]  well as the civil service and the government who say i have to follow the
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:14.640]  orders of the chain of command and what they forget is that their oath to the
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:19.360]  constitution allows them to not only refuse to obey illegal
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:23.280]  orders but they have a responsibility to the public
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:28.160]  to denounce the people giving well i mean the the constitution bill of rights
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:30.480]  that they swear an oath to is is the chain of command
[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:35.680]  it's the top but they don't see it that way too many people are taking the easy
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:39.280]  route out and saying i either have to obey orders or resign
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:42.480]  and if i resign i have to keep my mouth shut or i'll lose my security
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:46.640]  clearances and i won't get a second job there is a third path and that third
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:51.040]  path is be true to the constitution or turn into a total
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:53.600]  tyranny robert david still great interview thank you so much for the
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:57.280]  time my place tonight seven o'clock central info
