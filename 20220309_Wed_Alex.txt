[00:00.000 --> 00:10.720]  Where they can coerce you as the health care worker, as somebody who works in the grocery
[00:10.720 --> 00:15.840]  store or wherever to get that flu shot and their economic incentives to do this.
[00:15.840 --> 00:25.480]  So where someone might say, this is not federally controlled, well, try again, it's all funded
[00:25.480 --> 00:26.480]  by the federal government.
[00:26.480 --> 00:31.400]  If you're giving it away and people are still rejecting it past years, consumers had to
[00:31.400 --> 00:32.400]  pay now.
[00:32.400 --> 00:34.880]  Now they're saying you get the flu shot for free.
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.000]  Well, Bill, Bill, that's my that's my question to you.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.320]  Analyzing this, I want your perspective.
[00:44.320 --> 00:47.840]  Is this just not the perfect federalization vehicle?
[00:47.840 --> 00:53.160]  Is this not just a beta test for the future, a way to clamp down on society during a financial
[00:53.160 --> 01:00.320]  meltdown or for other reasons, even better than terrorism, a biological pathogen is the
[01:00.320 --> 01:06.120]  perfect way to be able to fully federalize things and take total control over society.
[01:06.120 --> 01:14.300]  And all the evidence that I'm seeing shows that this is a beta test for total federalization.
[01:14.300 --> 01:19.080]  The chirping agents of the New World Order are mindlessly and relentlessly demanding
[01:19.080 --> 01:20.680]  a no fly zone.
[01:20.680 --> 01:25.320]  For the past few days, there have been growing calls for the United States and NATO to establish
[01:25.320 --> 01:28.120]  a no fly zone over Ukraine.
[01:28.120 --> 01:34.040]  This airspace safety is something that I think the people of Ukraine would see as extremely
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.920]  important for their freedom of movement and ability to get to safety.
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.760]  With forces battling on the ground, Ukraine is begging the U.S. and its allies for more
[01:43.760 --> 01:45.760]  firepower in the sky.
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.280]  Now the Biden administration is negotiating with Poland to give Ukraine its old Soviet
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.160]  made MiG fighter jets and replace them with U.S. made F-16s.
[01:55.160 --> 01:58.520]  NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no fly zone.
[01:58.520 --> 02:03.320]  President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops.
[02:03.320 --> 02:08.280]  But what more can the United States do here if, for instance, the Polish government, a
[02:08.280 --> 02:11.280]  NATO member wants to send fighter jets?
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.480]  Does that get a green light from the U.S. or are you afraid that that will escalate
[02:15.480 --> 02:16.480]  tension?
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.640]  No, that gets a green light, in fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now.
[02:21.640 --> 02:27.040]  As a passive public allows the fire to be stoked, there can only be one result if a
[02:27.040 --> 02:29.320]  no fly zone is authorized.
[02:29.320 --> 02:35.720]  The acceleration of World War III followed by a very good possibility of global thermonuclear
[02:35.720 --> 02:36.720]  war.
[02:36.720 --> 02:38.720]  Shall we play a game?
[02:38.720 --> 02:45.520]  How about global thermonuclear war?
[02:45.520 --> 02:54.720]  If the talking head idiots succeed with their petition for a no fly zone, a 24-hour airborne
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.120]  warning and control system long-range radar surveillance and control center for air defense
[03:00.120 --> 03:06.240]  known as AWACS would need to be protected by NATO's air force, which would quickly cause
[03:06.240 --> 03:12.000]  allied fighter jets to engage Russian fighter jets.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.760]  Russia's MAX air show held every two years at an old flight test center outside of Moscow
[03:17.760 --> 03:21.760]  is more than just a chance for Russian pilots to show off their skills.
[03:21.760 --> 03:27.160]  It's an important forum for Russia's aerospace industry to entice foreign buyers and to impress
[03:27.160 --> 03:30.120]  the boss with their latest creations.
[03:30.120 --> 03:36.000]  This year, aircraft manufacturer Sukhoi had a big announcement, a design for a brand new
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.920]  stealth fighter jet.
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.880]  It forced a NATO attack on Russian anti-aircraft systems in order to protect AWACS.
[03:43.880 --> 03:46.880]  Are you and your colleagues now more open to a no fly zone?
[03:46.880 --> 03:52.960]  So basically a no fly zone, if people understood what it means, it means World War III.
[03:52.960 --> 03:54.480]  It means starting World War III.
[03:54.480 --> 03:59.080]  So I think there are a lot of things we can do to help Ukraine protect itself both from
[03:59.080 --> 04:03.880]  airstrikes and missile strikes, but I think that people need to understand what a no fly
[04:03.880 --> 04:04.880]  zone means.
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.840]  It's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by, it's the willingness to
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.880]  shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World
[04:13.880 --> 04:14.880]  War III.
[04:14.880 --> 04:16.880]  That would be the point of no return.
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.880]  The globalists would be safe in their massive bunkers, and according to Putin's posturing,
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.720]  China's backing and Russia's protocols, Putin says, look, if these anti-ballistic missiles
[04:27.720 --> 04:36.040]  are placed in Eastern Europe, if those missiles are placed on water, patrolling the Mediterranean
[04:36.040 --> 04:43.320]  and the Northern seas, and in Alaska, almost the whole Russian territory would be encircled
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.920]  by these systems.
[04:44.920 --> 04:50.120]  As you can see, that is another great strategic mistake by our partners, because all these
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.160]  actions are going to be adequately answered by Russia.
[04:54.160 --> 05:01.160]  A nuclear offensive would be imminent, John Bowne reporting.
