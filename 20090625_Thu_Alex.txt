[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  You want answers?
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.920 --> 00:22.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.160 --> 00:30.000]  All right, very important broadcast lined up today, absolutely jam-packed with vital
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  information.
[00:31.000 --> 00:41.880]  It is already Thursday, the 25th day of June, 2009, with four hours spanning out the forests
[00:41.880 --> 00:45.400]  on this vista of enlightenment and awakening.
[00:45.400 --> 00:54.800]  Well, quizzling, dum-dums, control freaks, nobodies, nose-picking video game playing,
[00:54.800 --> 01:02.800]  hot pocket eating, no prospect future, tattletail squads from Australia to the United States,
[01:02.800 --> 01:09.720]  from Canada to Germany, from Japan to South Korea, are all simultaneously being given
[01:09.720 --> 01:16.440]  climate cop powers, public schools worldwide are setting up climate cops that report and
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.240]  write dossiers publicly, they're proud of it.
[01:20.240 --> 01:27.800]  On their parents' climate crimes, hell is being released.
[01:27.800 --> 01:35.640]  Nothing worse than an idiot, stupid, soft, prozac, riddle-in-head, coward, weakling.
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.120]  These public school kids never allowed to even play tag or dodgeball now, thumb-scanning
[01:40.120 --> 01:46.920]  for their lunches, videotape constantly, the sickening little mindless twit servants now
[01:46.920 --> 01:53.520]  to be given power and weapons to wage war on decent, hard-working people.
[01:53.520 --> 02:00.760]  The age of the parasite is upon us, the age of the cowardly chicken net.
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.440]  New World Order control freak is here.
[02:05.440 --> 02:10.560]  To prepare yourself, they're about to be given full reign over all of you.
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.480]  And hell followeth, SWAT teams followeth them.
[02:15.480 --> 02:25.080]  They're like these little demonic, little plump, soft probe droids they send in who just ooze
[02:25.080 --> 02:30.680]  in with their effeminate nature, but if you don't submit shock forces and black uniforms
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.240]  are right behind them, oh, hi, oh, stealing old people's houses right where I live, grabbing
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.800]  private property, viciously savaging every business, erecting hundreds of new taxes a
[02:40.800 --> 02:49.280]  year, feeding on everyone, crawling all over everything like a horde of demonic locusts.
[02:49.280 --> 02:51.720]  You think I'm joking around, you think I'm kidding.
[02:51.720 --> 02:56.240]  Climate cops define wasteful homeowners and businesses worldwide.
[02:56.240 --> 03:04.960]  They are coming, gore to talk climate change with House Democrats today in an emergency
[03:04.960 --> 03:07.920]  dispatch trying to get it passed.
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.280]  Meanwhile, it's racing through the Senate.
[03:11.280 --> 03:16.280]  Looks like it's going to pass the Clean Water Restoration Act.
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.840]  Open total federal declaration of absolute rulership, over 100% of the land mass of
[03:21.840 --> 03:25.440]  the United States, same laws are being rammed through everywhere.
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.200]  They then hand the water jurisdictions over to offshore corporations who triple the price
[03:30.200 --> 03:31.800]  of water overnight.
[03:31.800 --> 03:38.840]  The IMF World Bank rape plan about to be dropped, hardcore on you, states going bankrupt, people
[03:38.840 --> 03:42.920]  losing their jobs in mass and they're going to bring in the carbon taxes and shut down
[03:42.920 --> 03:43.920]  what's left.
[03:43.920 --> 03:46.840]  It's all about driving you into submission.
[03:46.840 --> 03:51.440]  It's all about destroying what's left of the economy so the bankers can turn their parasites
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.160]  loose on you to squeeze you into oblivion so you got to go get on welfare and then be
[03:56.160 --> 04:03.840]  forced into their other auxiliary brigades, hundreds of new brigades, scores of new subsections
[04:03.840 --> 04:10.040]  and divisions, millions of youth already spelling out in red and black uniforms, blue and yellow
[04:10.040 --> 04:19.400]  uniforms, gray uniforms, just hellspawn, nobodies, cowards, weaklings, scum, trash, dim-witted
[04:19.400 --> 04:21.200]  fools.
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.280]  This is the reign of the parasite.
[04:24.280 --> 04:32.040]  Oh, you don't make enough money to have a child, oh, you can't pay the tax.
[04:32.040 --> 04:34.560]  Fine for having a child, we're gonna take it.
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.600]  Go ahead and give us the child, the SWAT team's waiting outside.
[04:39.600 --> 04:44.600]  Oh, yes.
[04:44.600 --> 04:46.840]  Not kidding.
[04:46.840 --> 04:49.200]  They can't wait, the control freaks.
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.240]  They hate any of you that are intelligent, any of you that have done well, any of you
[04:53.240 --> 04:54.240]  that are coming.
[04:54.240 --> 05:00.320]  I'll break down the news, Webster Charply joins us later, stay with us.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.240]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.440]  in the Truth Movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.680]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[05:11.680 --> 05:16.320]  My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner
[05:16.320 --> 05:21.000]  Food, his Editor's Choice Award, or Best Superfood of 2009.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.560]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners.
[05:25.560 --> 05:30.320]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[05:30.320 --> 05:33.160]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[05:33.160 --> 05:38.240]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the
[05:38.240 --> 05:39.240]  immune system.
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.440]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great, and take it from me, folks, it really does
[05:43.440 --> 05:44.440]  taste great.
[05:44.440 --> 05:56.680]  Don't forget to try their other great products, go to www.enerfod.com, that's www.enerfod.com,
[05:56.680 --> 06:01.160]  or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[06:01.160 --> 06:06.600]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[06:06.600 --> 06:12.920]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[06:12.920 --> 06:14.520]  just as well-funded.
[06:14.520 --> 06:19.680]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[06:19.680 --> 06:21.160]  of the American people.
[06:21.160 --> 06:25.560]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[06:25.560 --> 06:30.680]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[06:30.680 --> 06:37.200]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[06:37.200 --> 06:40.760]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[06:40.760 --> 06:47.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[06:47.680 --> 06:53.160]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[06:53.160 --> 06:55.880]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:55.880 --> 06:59.680]  The Obama Deception, the people strike back.
[06:59.680 --> 07:02.880]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[07:02.880 --> 07:06.840]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching, a storm that will affect
[07:06.840 --> 07:08.200]  you and everybody you know.
[07:08.200 --> 07:09.200]  Here's the story.
[07:09.200 --> 07:12.640]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million
[07:12.640 --> 07:13.880]  new people free care.
[07:13.880 --> 07:15.120]  Now here's the bad news.
[07:15.120 --> 07:18.760]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free
[07:18.760 --> 07:20.520]  services and procedures.
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.400]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[07:22.400 --> 07:26.920]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[07:26.920 --> 07:31.080]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the
[07:31.080 --> 07:32.080]  healthcare services.
[07:32.080 --> 07:34.640]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[07:34.640 --> 07:38.440]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness
[07:38.440 --> 07:43.280]  course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own
[07:43.280 --> 07:44.280]  home.
[07:44.280 --> 07:47.920]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and is flat out the best course
[07:47.920 --> 07:48.920]  of its kind.
[07:48.920 --> 07:53.040]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[07:53.040 --> 08:00.640]  That's makeherbalmedicines.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[08:00.640 --> 08:06.560]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[08:06.560 --> 08:14.720]  a war on for your mind.
[08:14.720 --> 08:20.640]  On this Thursday, 25th day of June 2009, we've got Webster Tartley joining us for two-plus
[08:20.640 --> 08:31.160]  hours today, coming up in exactly 51 minutes, 32 seconds.
[08:31.160 --> 08:32.160]  So that is coming up.
[08:32.160 --> 08:34.640]  We'll go over the whole geopolitical breakdown.
[08:34.640 --> 08:40.360]  He predicted all of what's happening actually in the Obama deception, and we shot that interview
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.600]  with him six months ago.
[08:42.600 --> 08:46.000]  We just shot a new interview with him about another month ago to put in the new Obama
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.040]  film we're working on that's actually coming out in early October.
[08:49.040 --> 08:52.840]  I could have had it out July 4th, I could have had it out in August or September, but
[08:52.840 --> 08:56.640]  I just, you know what, I'm going to take my time on this.
[08:56.640 --> 09:02.280]  People like John Perkins are in the film, Economic Hitman, Webster Tartley, and a whole
[09:02.280 --> 09:05.560]  bunch of other big surprises, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[09:05.560 --> 09:11.280]  I might even jump on an airplane and fly out to Los Angeles for an interview for the film,
[09:11.280 --> 09:13.840]  but that's an interview I'll have to do.
[09:13.840 --> 09:16.320]  I don't know.
[09:16.320 --> 09:21.360]  We'll see, but it's going to, I don't want to say top the last one, which is a very
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.760]  important film, you know, this is the time of the Obama deception, not the time of the
[09:26.760 --> 09:33.960]  next film, so I don't want to trump my own film, but it's one film, this will be another.
[09:33.960 --> 09:41.360]  The Obama deception, certainly proven right, certainly proven accurate, certainly proven
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.280]  to be very, very precise.
[09:44.280 --> 09:47.040]  Unfortunately, I wish we were wrong.
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.360]  The only problem with the Obama deception is that Obama was worse than we thought and
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.640]  lied even more than we thought he would.
[09:54.640 --> 10:08.360]  It's just incredible, so Obama deception available at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139er.
[10:08.360 --> 10:14.000]  You know, I'm not going to talk all day about missing governor was in Argentina, and then
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.240]  it turns out he was with his girlfriend breaking up with her, and then his wife was withdrawing
[10:21.240 --> 10:26.320]  from what she told him months ago about how she was going to make him move out of the
[10:26.320 --> 10:28.100]  house.
[10:28.100 --> 10:29.680]  This doesn't matter.
[10:29.680 --> 10:32.640]  It's a political diversion.
[10:32.640 --> 10:38.520]  It's a political distraction from what's happening in Iran, what's happening with North Korea,
[10:38.520 --> 10:45.480]  what's happening in Pakistan, the NATO buildup again with U.S. and Israeli forces backing
[10:45.480 --> 10:51.800]  the Georgians outside of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the Russian border, what's happening
[10:51.800 --> 11:00.200]  with the plunging, imploding economy, the total greenhouse gas emission takeover of
[11:00.200 --> 11:05.720]  the United States and the world, the announcement that China, India, Mexico, and 100-plus third
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.840]  world countries will get billions of dollars a piece in U.S. taxpayer money to pay for
[11:10.840 --> 11:12.080]  the carbon taxes.
[11:12.080 --> 11:15.760]  The bankers are saying, look, we'll give you aid to pay us.
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.400]  So the bankers who run the U.S. have the money given, and they told the public, oh, it's
[11:20.400 --> 11:21.400]  for greening.
[11:21.400 --> 11:24.800]  And then they hand the money right back to the bankers for carbon credits.
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.480]  In fact, directly to Al Gore, who owns Occidental Petroleum and is worth tens of billions but
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.960]  keeps that quiet and has a, what is it, 8,000 square foot house that uses seven times on
[11:35.960 --> 11:37.520]  average what the average home uses.
[11:37.520 --> 11:40.320]  I mean, what a piece of filth.
[11:40.320 --> 11:41.320]  Carbon tax.
[11:41.320 --> 11:49.280]  Well, Al Gore puts out a lot of carbon dioxide and a lot of methane, too.
[11:49.280 --> 11:54.800]  Carbon comes out on one end, carbon dioxide, methane out the other.
[11:54.800 --> 11:57.320]  It's the sun, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.560]  And you watch as things get colder, because the sun dimming the next 12 years, they'll
[12:01.560 --> 12:06.720]  say, see, cutting carbon did it when they haven't even cut it, and they don't intend
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.720]  to cut it.
[12:07.720 --> 12:11.720]  They intend to harass the daylights out of you and tax every facet of your life and have
[12:11.720 --> 12:18.200]  little dim-witted religious cult member control freaks in your house auditing everything and
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.200]  bossing you around.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.200]  It's a new religion.
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.840]  They're setting up a new priesthood with their little Maoist acolytes.
[12:24.840 --> 12:28.000]  They're quizzlings running around, bludgeoning everyone.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.320]  Hell, you can't park your SUV down at Barton Springs anymore or anywhere else because the
[12:33.320 --> 12:39.480]  environmental jihadis come up and slice your tires open, even little SUVs get attacked unless
[12:39.480 --> 12:46.120]  you put carbon credit stickers on the back and people buy these carbon indulgences, kind
[12:46.120 --> 12:55.200]  of like when they were building St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome, they needed money to build
[12:55.200 --> 12:56.440]  that, so they had indulgences.
[12:56.440 --> 12:58.800]  They said, get your mother out of purgatory.
[12:58.800 --> 12:59.800]  She's going to go to hell.
[12:59.800 --> 13:05.240]  She committed sins when she was alive or your daddy or your grandpa and if you pay us all
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.200]  this gold and silver, we'll get her out of hell.
[13:08.200 --> 13:10.240]  Well, it's the same thing today.
[13:10.240 --> 13:13.520]  I see these Austinites driving around with these carbon credit stickers and I go look
[13:13.520 --> 13:14.840]  the companies up.
[13:14.840 --> 13:20.160]  Total frauds, total frauds, total scams, usually connected to groups actually running eugenics
[13:20.160 --> 13:21.160]  operations.
[13:21.160 --> 13:28.760]  Hey, pay us carbon credits and we'll force them to sterilize some Africans and the quizzlings
[13:28.760 --> 13:29.760]  love it.
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.720]  They kind of lick their lips, little yuppie power trip and they go, yeah, yeah, and they
[13:33.720 --> 13:40.360]  go home and give their kid fluoride supper time and they give them fluoride toothpaste
[13:40.360 --> 13:44.360]  and wonder why their kid's a dimwit.
[13:44.360 --> 13:45.360]  They like it.
[13:45.360 --> 13:46.360]  They like death.
[13:46.360 --> 13:47.920]  They like fraud.
[13:47.920 --> 13:50.560]  They like being scammed by offshore banks.
[13:50.560 --> 13:54.040]  And let me tell you, you like being raped by the New World Order, you're going to get
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.320]  what you want in spades, in triplicate over and over again.
[13:59.320 --> 14:00.440]  You like being dominated.
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.560]  You like being a slave.
[14:01.560 --> 14:02.720]  You like getting into it.
[14:02.720 --> 14:06.240]  You're going to have lots of opportunities to engage in crime, stop and double think
[14:06.240 --> 14:12.520]  and you're just going to love and aren't you because you're cowards.
[14:12.520 --> 14:19.320]  And of course, we're not talking about the loving Liberty people out there who love humanity
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.920]  and love life and love innovation and love strength and love rugged individualism.
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.760]  I'm talking to the parasite mass that have learned to Google and snicker at everything
[14:27.760 --> 14:29.880]  I say.
[14:29.880 --> 14:42.760]  Well, you're going to get everything you want.
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.360]  Anything you want, you got it.
[14:46.360 --> 14:48.920]  Anything at all, baby.
[14:48.920 --> 14:52.600]  Hey, pull up that Royal Orbison song.
[14:52.600 --> 14:56.200]  We'll play that for all the slaves out there.
[14:56.200 --> 14:59.760]  Let's see the New World Order says you want slavery.
[14:59.760 --> 15:00.760]  You want bondage.
[15:00.760 --> 15:03.080]  You like saying tyranny and tyranny.
[15:03.080 --> 15:09.400]  Well, you want a double triple quadruple super helping of the hospitality of the New World
[15:09.400 --> 15:10.400]  Order.
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.800]  You're going to get it.
[15:11.800 --> 15:16.240]  So gore to talk climate change with House Democrats to today, your Democratic leaders
[15:16.240 --> 15:24.480]  are whipping and cajoling skeptical lawmakers aside with them to approve the measure that
[15:24.480 --> 15:28.080]  could have significant economic impact on the energy bills of Americans and even drive
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.320]  up the price of food.
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.080]  Well, that's what this is all about.
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.960]  You got to make the depression as bad as you got to take every dime of stimulus money and
[15:38.960 --> 15:45.200]  every dime of banker bailout money and take it offshore and then use it to buy up infrastructure
[15:45.200 --> 15:46.400]  and then jack up prices.
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.360]  I mean, that's how they that's how this game of risk works.
[15:50.360 --> 15:52.240]  This is economic warfare.
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.160]  This is this is being we're being conquered right now like the like the Normans like William
[15:57.160 --> 16:01.800]  the Conqueror conquered England.
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.480]  Britannia Albion.
[16:06.480 --> 16:09.720]  It's most ancient name.
[16:09.720 --> 16:13.600]  The Gaelic name adopted by the Romans.
[16:13.600 --> 16:19.520]  This is Conquest and they sit there with fancy PR, making you feel like you're part
[16:19.520 --> 16:20.520]  of it.
[16:20.520 --> 16:22.280]  And oh, it's so fun.
[16:22.280 --> 16:33.880]  Two days ago, I was in the coffee room suckling and there was Michelle Obama giving a speech
[16:33.880 --> 16:41.800]  with her predatory gleam and her insectoid eyes and she was up there with that predatory
[16:41.800 --> 16:48.840]  she devil enjoyment is looking at the kids with eyes searing hatred, but with a smile
[16:48.840 --> 16:51.160]  on her vicious, wicked face.
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.520]  That's a true devil right there.
[16:56.520 --> 17:04.000]  And she was up there looking at the children in their little yellow t-shirts and she was
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.960]  announcing how good the community service was and the TV was recording.
[17:10.960 --> 17:13.880]  So I've got it, but we just have two TVs constantly recording or even have the personnel
[17:13.880 --> 17:14.880]  to go through it.
[17:14.880 --> 17:15.880]  But that's about to change.
[17:15.880 --> 17:16.880]  Thanks to you and the money bomb.
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.800]  But side issue.
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.360]  My point is, or I would have it for you right now.
[17:23.360 --> 17:26.040]  I just had to run back in here during the break.
[17:26.040 --> 17:30.520]  I think it was about 230, two days ago.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.520]  And it was her life.
[17:31.520 --> 17:36.880]  I was seeing and she's she's going, these children have worked at the public school
[17:36.880 --> 17:43.840]  in Sacramento and later in the day, I saw her, she was somewhere else in another state.
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.920]  I mean, she must be going everywhere to the slave grid to make the kids feel important.
[17:47.920 --> 17:54.400]  She was saying they've raised hundreds of dollars for the school by working every day
[17:54.400 --> 18:01.280]  after school in the government garden and see it sounds reasonable.
[18:01.280 --> 18:02.280]  Gardening is good.
[18:02.280 --> 18:07.160]  Gardening is the basis of human civilization, the agrarian society developed in the last
[18:07.160 --> 18:12.840]  8,000 years, the bedrock, something humans enjoy.
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.640]  The most honorable profession is farming.
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.360]  It's in our blood and hey, they got the kids out doing something wholesome and she threw
[18:21.360 --> 18:23.640]  in something about exercise and getting outside.
[18:23.640 --> 18:25.440]  It's all true.
[18:25.440 --> 18:33.880]  But they were doing it to give the money to the government.
[18:33.880 --> 18:37.520]  Service is what you choose, but she was going on to say they will now do this as part of
[18:37.520 --> 18:43.160]  their regular accredited work in the school during regular school hours and they're turning
[18:43.160 --> 18:45.520]  the schools into little work camps.
[18:45.520 --> 18:48.840]  In China, the kids go out a few hours a day and work in fields.
[18:48.840 --> 18:52.280]  In China, they go out a few hours a day and then after school, five or six hours more
[18:52.280 --> 18:54.760]  and work in firework factories.
[18:54.760 --> 18:59.560]  Then they work with that product packaging where the toy you buy for your kids has all
[18:59.560 --> 19:05.800]  that wire, wiring it in for display with little fingers doing it.
[19:05.800 --> 19:10.680]  They work in the rug factories and they work in the chemical factories and they work for
[19:10.680 --> 19:15.560]  the state and the argument is, well, the state pays for their education.
[19:15.560 --> 19:21.720]  See, because they know after you've been bankrupted completely, you're not going to be able to pay
[19:21.720 --> 19:22.720]  taxes anymore.
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.160]  You're going to say, well, everybody pays their fair share like in the Soviet Union.
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.880]  They had a couple of times a week, so everybody get out of here, line up, we got a sewage
[19:29.880 --> 19:33.120]  line broken, get in there and shovel it out.
[19:33.120 --> 19:41.680]  We need you over at the rock quarry, busing up rocks for aggregate, for building roads.
[19:41.680 --> 19:44.080]  That's people that had other jobs with the government that had to go out and do that
[19:44.080 --> 19:45.720]  extra work on top of it.
[19:45.720 --> 19:47.840]  You want to be a slave.
[19:47.840 --> 19:52.880]  You're going to be actual slaves with forced compulsory service and forced military draft.
[19:52.880 --> 20:00.560]  It's all introduced, it's all happening, it's so liberal.
[20:00.560 --> 20:03.240]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[20:03.240 --> 20:06.280]  I've been so sick, will a life change tea help me?
[20:06.280 --> 20:08.120]  Our answer is always the same.
[20:08.120 --> 20:14.400]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[20:14.400 --> 20:20.240]  Right back with our all natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[20:20.240 --> 20:24.680]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[20:24.680 --> 20:26.200]  We use results.
[20:26.200 --> 20:30.880]  Life change tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.440]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[20:35.440 --> 20:39.400]  The public has reached its all time record for chronic sickness.
[20:39.400 --> 20:43.160]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[20:43.160 --> 20:54.840]  Our number is 928-308-0408 again that's 928-308-0408 or you can order online at getthetea.com
[20:54.840 --> 21:01.400]  that's getthetea.com and remember we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[21:01.400 --> 21:08.840]  Hi I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources 800-686-2237 extension 128 and let's take in a brief mind
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.840]  movie.
[21:09.840 --> 21:14.640]  We're surrounded by gestures, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington
[21:14.640 --> 21:15.640]  DC.
[21:15.640 --> 21:20.160]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes and now offering financial assurances that
[21:20.160 --> 21:21.160]  all will be well.
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.320]  The stimulus package is working, a bailout is coming your way and while we're flat broke
[21:26.320 --> 21:30.560]  we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink, pardon me.
[21:30.560 --> 21:35.040]  Back to the real world, we know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.040]  security.
[21:36.040 --> 21:38.520]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[21:38.520 --> 21:40.320]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[21:40.320 --> 21:46.880]  Please call me John Swenson 800-686-2237 extension 128 to discuss investing in precious metals,
[21:46.880 --> 21:51.560]  gold and silver with a 6000 year track record of success and security.
[21:51.560 --> 21:58.040]  I'm John Swenson 800-686-2237 extension 128 and together we'll create a package that really
[21:58.040 --> 22:01.280]  works for you.
[22:01.280 --> 22:07.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[22:07.400 --> 22:11.880]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[22:11.880 --> 22:13.200]  us would like to see.
[22:13.200 --> 22:18.360]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[22:18.360 --> 22:19.760]  of the American people.
[22:19.760 --> 22:24.120]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[22:29.200 --> 22:37.280]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[22:37.280 --> 22:40.900]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[22:40.900 --> 22:47.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[22:47.800 --> 22:53.400]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[22:53.400 --> 22:56.000]  quality at presentplanet.tv.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.400]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[23:00.400 --> 23:02.720]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[23:02.720 --> 23:07.120]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes,
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.200]  and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[23:12.200 --> 23:17.360]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created
[23:17.360 --> 23:20.320]  an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.400]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save
[23:24.400 --> 23:29.920]  thousands, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.880]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[23:34.880 --> 23:39.920]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you in garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[23:39.920 --> 23:45.240]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS
[23:45.240 --> 23:48.640]  off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[23:48.640 --> 23:56.080]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[23:56.080 --> 24:03.080]  Call 10-800-506-5904.
[24:26.080 --> 24:50.640]  Roy Orbison, you got it.
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.360]  But you can superimpose that over.
[24:52.360 --> 24:55.960]  You like Billy clubs, you like tasers, you like cattle prods, you like all your private
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.120]  property being stolen, you like bureaucrats taking over everything, you like home inspectors
[25:00.120 --> 25:04.180]  every week, you like forced inoculations, you got it.
[25:04.180 --> 25:06.520]  You like cancer viruses, you got it.
[25:06.520 --> 25:13.280]  You like New World Order, you got it.
[25:13.280 --> 25:17.000]  But here's the good news, Barack Obama has got to be on television.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.600]  I haven't actually averaged it out, but I know I seem at least doing four or five press
[25:20.600 --> 25:22.960]  conferences a day.
[25:22.960 --> 25:24.560]  His wife is constantly on TV.
[25:24.560 --> 25:26.840]  All of his surrogates and minions are on TV.
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.080]  And that's because they themselves admit what we've put in the Obama deception is true,
[25:32.080 --> 25:39.200]  that this creature and his evil minions and his controllers know that they only have a
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.480]  year to rape and destroy the United States until people figure out he's a total puppet
[25:43.480 --> 25:50.520]  liar and gave people false hope and lied about everything.
[25:50.520 --> 25:54.840]  And then they're going to have trouble ramming their agenda through until there's another
[25:54.840 --> 25:58.920]  new puppet, fake Republican coming up in three and a half years, who will then have
[25:58.920 --> 26:01.280]  a year or so to lie and con people.
[26:01.280 --> 26:04.520]  But every time this happens, there's less and less time in the past.
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.920]  People have three, four, five, six years to lie to the public.
[26:09.920 --> 26:12.480]  Now it's four or five months.
[26:12.480 --> 26:14.880]  It just doesn't work anymore.
[26:14.880 --> 26:20.480]  We know your criminals and people are now finding out that Obama lied about everything
[26:20.480 --> 26:22.120]  he said he would do.
[26:22.120 --> 26:25.120]  He says he wants to be friends with Iran a month ago.
[26:25.120 --> 26:28.480]  I said, watch him launch covert operations, get ready for the overthrow of Iran.
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.480]  I'm on record.
[26:29.480 --> 26:30.480]  How do I know?
[26:30.480 --> 26:34.160]  Because when Obama says he's going left, he's going right.
[26:34.160 --> 26:35.480]  He says he's zigging to the left.
[26:35.480 --> 26:36.480]  He's zigging to the right.
[26:36.480 --> 26:40.480]  If he says he's going forward, he's going backwards or sideways.
[26:40.480 --> 26:42.400]  If he says green, it's yellow.
[26:42.400 --> 26:43.880]  If he says black, it's white.
[26:43.880 --> 26:47.400]  If he says up, it's down.
[26:47.400 --> 26:49.000]  If he says blue, it's red.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.760]  If he says he loves you, he hates you.
[26:51.760 --> 26:58.480]  What comes out of Obama's mouth, total lies and spin and distortion to a level I have
[26:58.480 --> 26:59.480]  never seen.
[26:59.480 --> 27:01.000]  He makes Bill Clinton look like a Boy Scout.
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.720]  He makes George Bush look honorable.
[27:02.720 --> 27:05.760]  He makes Richard Nixon look truthful.
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.800]  I'm not a crook.
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.440]  By the way, it's coming out about Nixon wanting to abort black babies and any interracial babies
[27:14.440 --> 27:15.440]  particularly.
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.840]  Well, of course, he's the guy that had George Bush senior as his minion that helped sterilize
[27:19.840 --> 27:22.880]  40 plus percent of Native Americans on record.
[27:22.880 --> 27:27.600]  Then they sent George Herbert Walker over to China to get him to adopt IMF and World Bank,
[27:27.600 --> 27:33.760]  State Department memorandum 200, CIA memorandum agreement to sterilize and to kill and have
[27:33.760 --> 27:37.320]  a one child policy and they would be made to be the new empire.
[27:37.320 --> 27:41.640]  The Chinese Communist said absolutely in the rest of history, they're the new center of
[27:41.640 --> 27:48.200]  the world, not the U.S.
[27:48.200 --> 27:52.040]  Their elites said absolutely, we think our people are scum trash as well.
[27:52.040 --> 27:54.080]  We want to get rid of a bunch of them.
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.960]  Just give us the weapons systems, give us the nukes, give us the technology and we'll
[27:56.960 --> 27:58.560]  do it.
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.880]  It's all public record, so that's coming up later.
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.920]  But yeah, the first lady, you know, I've got this press release put out by the California
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.760]  governor's office that says the first lady, Maria Shriver Schwarzenegger met with the
[28:15.760 --> 28:21.200]  first lady, Mrs. Obama.
[28:21.200 --> 28:24.840]  They're always blurring it about the first lady this and the first lady that and Arnold
[28:24.840 --> 28:28.040]  when he became governor changed the press briefing room to look like it's a White House
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.120]  press briefing room with the same type of seal that looks like the White House behind
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.640]  him in a blue oval.
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.680]  I mean, you know, because he has disgust for you.
[28:38.680 --> 28:41.200]  And you know, a lot of people have been saying this for the last six months and I think it
[28:41.200 --> 28:42.560]  may happen.
[28:42.560 --> 28:47.320]  It's in the cards that it's going to come out that he really was born in Kenya.
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.120]  I mean, his grandma runs around saying it and then they're going to say, oh, we got
[28:52.120 --> 28:55.560]  to get rid of the 22nd Amendment.
[28:55.560 --> 29:02.400]  We got to get rid of that area in the Constitution that says you got to be born in the U.S. We
[29:02.400 --> 29:03.400]  got to get rid of the thing.
[29:03.400 --> 29:04.400]  We can only serve two terms.
[29:04.400 --> 29:12.920]  We can only do that to 22nd Amendment and you're going to get Schwarzenegger because
[29:12.920 --> 29:15.840]  they're just always pushing it movies and culture.
[29:15.840 --> 29:21.640]  He was in 1978 and no, 1977 Rolling Stone, it's in my film, Marshall Law, saying I want
[29:21.640 --> 29:22.640]  to be Hitler.
[29:22.640 --> 29:23.840]  I want to be a dictator.
[29:23.840 --> 29:25.080]  I'm going to be your president.
[29:25.080 --> 29:33.240]  I'm going to, and then here it is, I'm telling you, they're going to try it, but hey, good
[29:33.240 --> 29:37.800]  news when we get back and a big news blitz and then Webster Tarpley T minus 30 minutes
[29:37.800 --> 29:43.800]  from now for two plus hours as we break down the world according to Webster Tarpley with
[29:43.800 --> 29:51.360]  a little bit of added spice for me from Alex Jones.
[29:51.360 --> 29:52.680]  We're on the march.
[29:52.680 --> 29:55.160]  The empire's on the run.
[29:55.160 --> 30:00.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.680 --> 30:02.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons.
[30:02.840 --> 30:05.920]  You should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[30:05.920 --> 30:09.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:09.960 --> 30:14.520]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:14.520 --> 30:15.760]  allows you to have.
[30:15.760 --> 30:16.760]  It's true.
[30:16.760 --> 30:20.920]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.920 --> 30:25.040]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[30:25.040 --> 30:27.440]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[30:27.440 --> 30:31.000]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.680]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:39.240 --> 30:43.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[30:43.360 --> 30:45.040]  a long time sponsor of ours.

[31:01.000 --> 31:05.240]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[31:05.240 --> 31:09.640]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:09.640 --> 31:15.800]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group, but their objective being world domination.
[31:15.800 --> 31:18.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:18.960 --> 31:23.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[31:23.960 --> 31:29.320]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:29.320 --> 31:34.320]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:34.320 --> 31:38.640]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[31:38.640 --> 31:41.320]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[31:41.320 --> 31:42.320]  Most people have no idea.
[31:42.320 --> 31:43.320]  They're not after money.
[31:43.320 --> 31:44.320]  They have all the money they need.
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.320]  They're after power.
[31:45.320 --> 31:46.320]  That's their aptitude.

[32:00.080 --> 32:03.440]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[32:03.440 --> 32:07.360]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.

[32:58.720 --> 32:59.720]  today.
[32:59.720 --> 33:19.960]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio, George Drake was singing, seashores
[33:19.960 --> 33:30.160]  of old Mexico, it sounded so good, I've got an idea, I'm gonna go there since they're

[33:59.680 --> 34:20.400]  clothes on my back, so long Texas, hello Mexico, I'll drive a rattletrack car with no liability,

[34:50.800 --> 34:59.080]  keeps rolling across the line, this old Texas cowboy feels like my home state's no longer
[34:59.080 --> 35:14.600]  mine, so long Texas, hello Mexico, I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso, that's right
[35:14.600 --> 35:21.920]  thank you for joining us today, I'm leaving tonight, I ain't gonna pack, I'm only taking
[35:21.920 --> 35:26.920]  the clothes on my back, so long Texas, hello Mexico, I'm leaving tonight, I'm leaving tonight,

[35:37.120 --> 35:45.520]  I'm leaving tonight, I'm leaving tonight, I'm leaving tonight, I'm leaving tonight,
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.360]  But then I kind of refreshed my memory about this guy last night, and now there is no doubt
[35:51.360 --> 35:56.080]  in my mind what's going on, so that's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[35:56.080 --> 35:58.640]  Here's the good news.
[35:58.640 --> 36:05.440]  Newspaper readership is completely imploding.
[36:05.440 --> 36:08.320]  On a month-by-month basis, it's eroding.
[36:08.320 --> 36:13.560]  It's down by over 60-plus percent just in the last five years alone.
[36:13.560 --> 36:21.120]  And television ratings are just almost non-existent.
[36:21.120 --> 36:26.600]  There are regional radio shows that are on maybe 50, 60 AM and FM stations that are popular,
[36:26.600 --> 36:29.200]  that are more popular than the ABC Nightly News now.
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.160]  I mean, there are a lot of regional radio shows that have three, four million viewers.
[36:33.160 --> 36:35.880]  That's as many as ABC and NBC and CBS have.
[36:35.880 --> 36:38.400]  I mean, they are a joke.
[36:38.400 --> 36:45.160]  A bunch of arrogant people, dolled up info babes, men wearing suits, you know, picked
[36:45.160 --> 36:51.760]  because they speak well and can read a teleprompter well and look authoritative like grandpa.
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.400]  And people know they're a pack of liars now, a pack of New World Order parasites you want
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.600]  to enslave us.
[36:57.600 --> 36:58.880]  And it's just over for you.
[36:58.880 --> 37:00.080]  It's broken.
[37:00.080 --> 37:04.120]  And so the bankers just want to loot and rob and blow out the economy fully and blow
[37:04.120 --> 37:08.360]  out the borders because they know the public's waking up to them.
[37:08.360 --> 37:12.440]  All the horrible things that are happening is an attempt to fully get you in line and
[37:12.440 --> 37:17.320]  fully just get rid of the illusion of a free society and bring us into tyranny where you're
[37:17.320 --> 37:25.360]  so broke and so poor, you don't have a choice but to climb upon the government life raft.
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.480]  Now that's the game plan.
[37:29.480 --> 37:36.200]  But for weeks, the White House planned this big blitz for these town halls he was going
[37:36.200 --> 37:42.200]  to have on ABC and the ratings came in.
[37:42.200 --> 37:49.680]  And despite ABC promoting this for weeks and weeks and weeks, 4.7 million viewers.
[37:49.680 --> 37:56.520]  I mean, it did worse than old comedy repeats.
[37:56.520 --> 37:58.440]  No one wants to hear you.
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.920]  Obama's approval rating was at 80 something when he first got in.
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.680]  Now it's dropped to 56, some polls 52.
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.320]  The news keeps showing polls from a few months ago where it was at 60 something and has dropped
[38:12.320 --> 38:13.320]  to 50.
[38:13.320 --> 38:19.000]  There's different polls, 65, dropping to 54, 58 or 52.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.480]  The point is they don't like going back to when he first got elected and then when he
[38:22.480 --> 38:24.800]  first got into office, it was in the 80s.
[38:24.800 --> 38:28.480]  It's dropping like a rock.
[38:28.480 --> 38:31.520]  And that means that he's going to be a lame duck soon.
[38:31.520 --> 38:36.440]  That means he could be a one-term president unless he sets off terror attacks or unless
[38:36.440 --> 38:44.240]  his bosses stage terror attacks and try to blame it on North Korea or Iran or LCI Ada.
[38:44.240 --> 38:48.480]  And then they can go with the full bore martial law, which they keep building up, keep expanding,
[38:48.480 --> 38:53.560]  keep setting up, but they never leap because they know we're an armed population and the
[38:53.560 --> 38:55.320]  public isn't going to buy it.
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.080]  So they're trying to maneuver us into a situation where we're so bankrupt and people are rioting
[39:00.080 --> 39:09.200]  so the population begs for intervention and martial law.
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.400]  You're in a city like L.A. or New York or Chicago or Dallas and there's rioting people
[39:13.400 --> 39:19.840]  two, three weeks into it and no power, I'd probably even be sharing troops coming in
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.360]  and restoring order.
[39:21.360 --> 39:22.680]  And then they do a good job.
[39:22.680 --> 39:26.200]  It's on the news they did it, precedent set, and the Army's going to stay on the streets
[39:26.200 --> 39:31.080]  to maintain order and then the arrest of political dissidents can begin.
[39:31.080 --> 39:33.520]  See they know how to sell it.
[39:33.520 --> 39:36.840]  They don't come out and say, we're going to put Americans in forced labor camps.
[39:36.840 --> 39:41.640]  It's oh, look at the kids, society's collapsing and now they'll spend part of their school
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.640]  day planting government gardens on city property and giving them money to the state from the
[39:47.640 --> 39:50.640]  sale of the food.
[39:50.640 --> 39:54.240]  And oh, we're going to have environmental brigades and they're going to pay the kids
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.760]  and pay the adults and pay the senior corps and pay the, you know, everybody, the baby
[39:58.760 --> 40:01.600]  boomers, the seniors, they admit they're hiring everybody.
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.360]  They want to hire 13 million, the Associated Press reports.
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.440]  The government wants to pay 13 million.
[40:07.440 --> 40:11.720]  The military's a million.
[40:11.720 --> 40:16.720]  I kept saying as big as the military off Obama's speeches and off Rahm Emanuel's book, his
[40:16.720 --> 40:20.920]  chief of staff of forced compulsory service, no, they, then a month ago, no, it's 7 million
[40:20.920 --> 40:28.480]  and now it's 13 million New York times.
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.120]  And it's compulsory service in that, oh, well, to get out of school to when, you know, you
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.240]  know, you got to serve a year compulsory national service.
[40:38.240 --> 40:39.240]  It's paramilitary.
[40:39.240 --> 40:40.640]  The White House has shut it.
[40:40.640 --> 40:46.160]  It's been a change.gov Rahm Emanuel speeches, C-span, the bills they've introduced, but
[40:46.160 --> 40:53.240]  then everybody else, it's, oh, well, you get a little stipend and you get a security card
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.240]  where it means you're trusted and you go to the head of the line at the airport.
[40:57.240 --> 41:02.280]  You don't get searched too bad on the buses and they're going to have TSA on every street
[41:02.280 --> 41:04.040]  corner minimum wage.
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.880]  We're talking $7, $8 right above minimum wage.
[41:07.880 --> 41:13.960]  This TSA has already paid a lot of them, $11, $12 on the streets.
[41:13.960 --> 41:15.600]  They've announced everywhere.
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.240]  They're going to be searching you, bossing you.
[41:18.240 --> 41:19.440]  You'll be walking down the street.
[41:19.440 --> 41:20.840]  You'll be at the farmer's market.
[41:20.840 --> 41:22.000]  You'll be at the mall.
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  You'll be in a bus.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.480]  They'll pull you over just like Mexico happened to me two years ago when I was down there
[41:26.480 --> 41:30.080]  to show my children some pyramids, give them a little bit of culture, a little bit of history,
[41:30.080 --> 41:32.280]  a little bit of anthropology.
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.360]  And the Mexican troops would pull over the turbos, big nice turbos and make the people
[41:36.360 --> 41:39.440]  get out and pay them money.
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.240]  That's how the world works in North Korea.
[41:43.240 --> 41:46.320]  Obama wants it's been to China twice.
[41:46.320 --> 41:51.720]  He goes on trips once a year and he was in Tibet and the police just pull you over and
[41:51.720 --> 41:54.080]  shake you down for money.
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.800]  It's the same thing here, same thing in Texas.
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.920]  So the good news is no one is buying your bull.
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.440]  You know, Obama would give press conferences when he first got elected and you'd have five,
[42:10.440 --> 42:12.520]  six, seven, eight, nine million people tuning in.
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.080]  Now when he does these press conferences constantly, you'll have a couple hundred thousand tuning
[42:16.080 --> 42:18.400]  into CNN and a couple hundred thousand tuning into Fox.
[42:18.400 --> 42:19.480]  They tune out.
[42:19.480 --> 42:25.880]  They're sick of some, you know, handsome guy in a fancy suit who's got a nice voice and
[42:25.880 --> 42:35.000]  a nice cadence with a Harvard silver tongue, lawyer tongue sitting there lying to you.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.800]  Read not the teleprompter.
[42:37.800 --> 42:39.880]  The jig is up.
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.560]  The people know he's a liar.
[42:43.560 --> 42:47.360]  So now the Obama supporters have gone from, yeah, oh, he's the Messiah.
[42:47.360 --> 42:48.360]  You just shut up.
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.360]  You watch.
[42:49.360 --> 42:50.360]  My bills are paid.
[42:50.360 --> 42:51.360]  My car is paid for.
[42:51.360 --> 42:52.360]  Life is fixed.
[42:52.360 --> 42:57.240]  Jesus Christ has returned to the planet Earth, literally saying he was the one, the Messiah
[42:57.240 --> 43:02.200]  from Krypton, you know, just the savior, the president of the earth, all those headlines
[43:02.200 --> 43:03.200]  too.
[43:03.200 --> 43:06.440]  Well, he's better than Bush and, you know, he's got a compromise to get things done too.
[43:06.440 --> 43:08.120]  Yeah, he's a traitor.
[43:08.120 --> 43:12.000]  He sold us out in, uh, what, four months?
[43:12.000 --> 43:13.000]  Let me see.
[43:13.000 --> 43:24.720]  January, February, March, April, May, five months because into June, June 25th, he got
[43:24.720 --> 43:30.640]  in, uh, January 21st.
[43:30.640 --> 43:31.960]  That's a little over six months.
[43:31.960 --> 43:34.120]  What's six months in four days?
[43:34.120 --> 43:44.080]  Let me see, January, February, March, April, May, June, and it's five months in change.
[43:44.080 --> 43:49.920]  So he's been in roughly six months and his approval ratings dropped from 84%, 86%, depending
[43:49.920 --> 43:55.160]  on the poll to the mid fifties and it's going to keep dropping until they start a war with
[43:55.160 --> 44:01.040]  North Korea or until they start a war with Iran or until they go into Georgia again.
[44:01.040 --> 44:06.000]  I don't mean Georgia peaches on the East coast down there with the, with the Southern
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.320]  girls.
[44:08.320 --> 44:21.360]  I'm talking about Georgia, South Eastern Europe, North of Turkey, the gateway to the
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.280]  East.
[44:25.280 --> 44:34.800]  So ABC News, White House Special, Struggled for Viewers is the headline.
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.880]  Meanwhile, let me just give everybody the news flash here and it's up on infowars.com
[44:40.880 --> 44:42.520]  and prisonpondet.com.
[44:42.520 --> 44:44.200]  Articles breaking this down.
[44:44.200 --> 44:46.600]  Total war has been declared on humanity.
[44:46.600 --> 44:57.000]  The establishment is making its move with everyone.
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.160]  They're grabbing the entire water supply and the surrounding areas, total federalization
[45:01.160 --> 45:05.560]  of every square inch of the United States, underground water, underground aquifers controlling
[45:05.560 --> 45:15.180]  the land above it, below it, around it, up to 10 miles on every side of every river,
[45:15.180 --> 45:18.080]  just like with their Napa Super Highways, 10 miles on each side of every one of their
[45:18.080 --> 45:19.080]  roads.
[45:19.080 --> 45:25.880]  You look at the maps, it's over half of Texas, over half of Nevada, over half of all these
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.880]  states.
[45:26.880 --> 45:34.160]  See, this is the federal land grab.
[45:34.160 --> 45:43.360]  They're making their move for open total dictatorship dealing with the swine flu, openly
[45:43.360 --> 45:48.440]  announcing on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, drilling it in your head, calmly saying, yeah, we might
[45:48.440 --> 45:49.600]  have to have martial law.
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.640]  Oh, it killed another person this week when regular flu kills 30,000 plus people a year
[45:54.640 --> 45:55.640]  in the U.S.
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.480]  There's been, what, three deaths or something?
[45:59.480 --> 46:05.760]  They're saying, yeah, in the fall, it's going to get real bad and we're going to have to
[46:05.760 --> 46:07.760]  forcibly inject you.
[46:07.760 --> 46:11.840]  Yeah, we're implementing all the executive orders for martial law, but it's for your
[46:11.840 --> 46:22.080]  own good, getting all the billions of doses globally ready for the population.
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.080]  They're announcing the total Federal Reserve banking takeover of all financial transactions,
[46:27.080 --> 46:31.240]  any business, anything associated with the economy that affects the economy or the overall
[46:31.240 --> 46:32.960]  strength of the economy, they say.
[46:32.960 --> 46:36.840]  They have control over no audits, no investigations, no way to look into what they're doing.
[46:36.840 --> 46:42.200]  The IRS has been given unconstitutional power to spy on anyone, to not have warrants, just
[46:42.200 --> 46:43.800]  total into the Bill of Rights on that front.
[46:43.800 --> 46:47.400]  That's back on the news today.
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.680]  Climate cops, climate regulation, carbon taxes on everything globally being passed right
[46:51.680 --> 47:00.320]  now, giant hundreds of billions, 100 to 6 billion to pay off governments in the name
[47:00.320 --> 47:05.400]  of war funding, hundreds of billions they're about to pass to pay Mexico to pay China to
[47:05.400 --> 47:10.360]  pay India.
[47:10.360 --> 47:16.680]  That's mainstream news.
[47:16.680 --> 47:23.080]  Calderon wants green money and he's going to get it, which then they pay them the billions
[47:23.080 --> 47:29.000]  of dollars to quote adopt climate taxes and they pay them the money to do it.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  It's a payoff.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  They never have to follow it.
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.960]  Not only the idiots in the West do and then they pay the majority of it right back to
[47:35.960 --> 47:36.960]  the bankers.
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.040]  They take taxpayer money, fence it, it's not even fenced, but laundered it publicly through
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.960]  the third world countries and developing nations and then send it right back to themselves.
[47:45.960 --> 47:54.640]  I mean, this is fraud.
[47:54.640 --> 47:59.080]  So we'll go over all that Webster Tarpley and take your phone calls coming up today.
[47:59.080 --> 48:02.920]  Meanwhile, we have all these states shutting down.
[48:02.920 --> 48:09.720]  State shutdowns loom as deadlines near at least 19 states will still have to approve
[48:09.720 --> 48:14.760]  their fiscal 2000 budgets before next Tuesday they're all trying to raise taxes.
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.760]  If they don't, staffers might not get paid and services might be shut down and they always
[48:18.760 --> 48:24.400]  do this to terrorize state and federal employees to then really harass and squeeze the citizens.
[48:24.400 --> 48:27.600]  You know, the states really have two sets of books, the comprehensive and financial
[48:27.600 --> 48:28.600]  reports.
[48:28.600 --> 48:31.960]  Normally, it's about 70% more than what you see on budget.
[48:31.960 --> 48:35.680]  Texas has hundreds of billions every year in extra money, but that's then invested and
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.120]  laundered into offshore banks, but they'll tell the cops, you're fired.
[48:41.120 --> 48:44.880]  If you don't go out and squeeze and the cops are now just out writing one mile over the
[48:44.880 --> 48:46.200]  speed limit, you got to take it.
[48:46.200 --> 48:48.360]  Just squeezing everybody by the throat.
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.880]  You can't get a cop to show up if you get robbed or raped hardly, but you can get them
[48:51.880 --> 48:53.720]  to show up to give you a ticket.
[48:53.720 --> 48:57.600]  Hell, you call the cops half the time now for trouble in it, writing you a ticket when
[48:57.600 --> 48:59.800]  they show up because they're there.
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.880]  They're going to lose their job if they don't.
[49:04.880 --> 49:05.880]  And see, they don't care.
[49:05.880 --> 49:06.880]  The establishment doesn't care.
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.320]  Everything collapses because they all live in armored villas offshore in Switzerland
[49:12.320 --> 49:19.220]  and in the Cook Islands and in New Zealand and in the Caribbean behind big 12 foot bar
[49:19.220 --> 49:23.520]  bar fences with their own arm guard shack, grenade launchers, weapons.
[49:23.520 --> 49:25.360]  It's a big joke to them.
[49:25.360 --> 49:30.480]  Chest of diamonds, chest of gold, just wealth, unbelievable, even the mid-level people.
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.360]  It's just, it's been an incredible raping, an incredible victory against humanity, an
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.920]  incredible, just absolute takeover.
[49:36.920 --> 49:43.240]  The entire government was formed into a mafia proboscis instrument to suck all the wealth
[49:43.240 --> 49:44.240]  out.
[49:44.240 --> 49:50.960]  And now the rearguard action is the police state.
[49:50.960 --> 49:52.600]  That's just perfecting the robbery.
[49:52.600 --> 49:58.560]  It's just babysitting the slaves as we're basically put under, euthanized, culturally,
[49:58.560 --> 50:02.320]  psychologically, mentally, physically.
[50:02.320 --> 50:07.640]  So state shuts down slash states, state slash jobs, despite stimulus, so they're already
[50:07.640 --> 50:10.440]  getting rid of a bunch of their own people and then just keeping the money because most
[50:10.440 --> 50:13.480]  that goes to debt to the banks.
[50:13.480 --> 50:16.560]  State shutdown looms as deadlines near and they will end up laying off a lot of cops
[50:16.560 --> 50:17.560]  on the road.
[50:17.560 --> 50:18.560]  You'll lose your job.
[50:18.560 --> 50:19.560]  It doesn't matter.
[50:19.560 --> 50:22.640]  You're going to have private murk arms that you'll have to then go get employed by that
[50:22.640 --> 50:25.120]  will do it.
[50:25.120 --> 50:36.240]  California is set to issue IOUs as fiscal crisis ways, Reuters, U.S. jobless claims rise, total
[50:36.240 --> 50:42.680]  benefit rolls climb, so that's some of the news on that front.
[50:42.680 --> 50:45.480]  It could all stop if we arrest the bankers.
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.040]  It could all stop if we said no to the new old order, but we can.
[50:49.040 --> 50:51.680]  We have to do what the establishment says.
[50:51.680 --> 50:56.200]  We have to continue to let them, like a bullet constrictor wrapped around a pig, let's strangle
[50:56.200 --> 50:57.200]  us to death.
[50:57.200 --> 51:00.520]  We'll come back and break down the governor.
[51:00.520 --> 51:05.240]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground
[51:05.240 --> 51:06.560]  up shells?
[51:06.560 --> 51:07.560]  Think about that.
[51:07.560 --> 51:10.360]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[51:10.360 --> 51:13.440]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[51:13.440 --> 51:18.600]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health, a delicious tasting
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.760]  chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.
[51:23.760 --> 51:28.280]  Unlike hard to digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for
[51:28.280 --> 51:29.600]  better digestion.
[51:29.600 --> 51:31.080]  The choice is yours.
[51:31.080 --> 51:35.080]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can
[51:35.080 --> 51:36.560]  better digest.
[51:36.560 --> 51:41.560]  Choose for Health, the world's first super fruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant, chewable.
[51:41.560 --> 51:44.480]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.

[52:00.320 --> 52:01.760]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[52:01.760 --> 52:05.520]  I'm sitting on a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt
[52:05.520 --> 52:07.120]  and struggling to make payments.
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.560]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number due to a declining economy and credit
[52:11.560 --> 52:12.560]  crisis.
[52:12.560 --> 52:17.600]  You now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.200]  by calling the bailout group.
[52:19.200 --> 52:24.040]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.440]  consumers thousands of dollars.
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.120]  Folks if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments,
[52:30.120 --> 52:32.600]  the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[52:32.600 --> 52:37.320]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[52:37.320 --> 52:39.240]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[52:39.240 --> 52:42.600]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save.
[52:42.600 --> 52:44.880]  Right over the phone with one simple call.
[52:44.880 --> 52:49.880]  Put the bailout group bail you out of debt, reduce your payments by up to 60% and save
[52:49.880 --> 52:51.800]  you thousands of dollars today.
[52:51.800 --> 53:00.360]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554-800-324-6554, the bailout group.
[53:00.360 --> 53:03.360]  You worry if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[53:03.360 --> 53:06.720]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[53:06.720 --> 53:10.160]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember there's a
[53:10.160 --> 53:11.680]  learning curve.
[53:11.680 --> 53:13.720]  Experience is the best teacher but that means time.
[53:13.720 --> 53:17.000]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.800]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[53:21.800 --> 53:25.480]  The DVD gives you a 3-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[53:25.480 --> 53:29.960]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[53:29.960 --> 53:34.120]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your field work.
[53:34.120 --> 53:38.720]  This 3-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist
[53:38.720 --> 53:40.320]  in weeks, not years.
[53:40.320 --> 53:44.840]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal, she's my mom and I watched her do it.
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.700]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[53:49.700 --> 53:50.700]  Start now.
[53:50.700 --> 53:52.200]  Knowledge is power.
[53:52.200 --> 53:53.200]  Better take action.
[53:53.200 --> 54:12.880]  Make the storms coming.
[54:12.880 --> 54:35.760]  Viacondios de Ferra Fawcett, dead at age 62, Ed McMahon a couple days ago, death is the
[54:35.760 --> 54:36.760]  great equalizer.
[54:36.760 --> 54:39.760]  None of us are making it out of here alive.
[54:39.760 --> 54:43.080]  A lot of times when people figure out they're going to die and got time to get ready for
[54:43.080 --> 54:48.440]  it, they grow spiritually because then all the crud, all the bobbles, all the pettiness,
[54:48.440 --> 54:51.440]  all the posing, it doesn't matter anymore.
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.920]  What matters is the species and what you've built, what you stood for and realizing you
[54:56.920 --> 54:59.400]  live on for humankind.
[54:59.400 --> 55:01.840]  This life was only a test.
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.360]  Ferra Fawcett, who's skyrocketed to fame as one of a trio of impossibly glamorous private
[55:07.360 --> 55:12.800]  eyes on TV's Charlie Angels, has died after a long battle with cancer.
[55:12.800 --> 55:14.800]  She was 62.
[55:14.800 --> 55:21.360]  Fawcett died at 9.28 a.m. Pacific Standard Time at St. John's Health Center in Santa
[55:21.360 --> 55:22.360]  Monica, California.
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.680]  She had recently returned to St. John's for treatment of complications from the cancer.
[55:27.680 --> 55:29.880]  First diagnosed three years ago.
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.480]  Her longtime partner Ryan O'Neill was at her side to the final days.
[55:34.480 --> 55:41.760]  So there you have it.
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.440]  Volcker gets less than he wants in curbing Wall Street excesses.
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.640]  Without Volcker runs around blaming the CEOs and the brokerage firm heads who were hired
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.720]  financial mercenaries, jackals, hyenas, to carry out the crime and then always the big
[55:57.720 --> 56:03.920]  shareholder controllers like himself and he's just a Uber manager for the real shareholders,
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.200]  but he's up in that upper echelon, the lower rooms of it, and then they always blame it
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.680]  on a organized economy and Obama can fire what CEOs he wants and they can give pieces
[56:13.680 --> 56:17.040]  of GM and Chrysler to who they want.
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.360]  Watching George Soros a few months ago testify how he was fighting the evil bankers and fighting
[56:22.360 --> 56:24.160]  the implosion of the economy.
[56:24.160 --> 56:29.040]  Then the surly bastard goes on international television and press conferences bragging
[56:29.040 --> 56:35.400]  he's involved in it and saying he loves doing it and it's so much fun.
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.740]  I mean this is the type of garbage that we talk about, the type of garbage that we see
[56:39.740 --> 56:42.520]  and deal with from these people.
[56:42.520 --> 56:43.520]  You know what?
[56:43.520 --> 56:47.560]  I could get into Governor Sanford, but I'm going to do it later because I don't have
[56:47.560 --> 56:56.960]  time now at the end of the shower.
[56:56.960 --> 57:05.080]  So a lot is going on and I'm just going to go ahead and get tarpily on now and then
[57:05.080 --> 57:08.440]  at the end of the show I promise I want to spend 10 minutes breaking down what's really
[57:08.440 --> 57:11.400]  happening with Governor Mark Sanford.
[57:11.400 --> 57:17.000]  We got some video clips of him admitting he's attended Bilderberg up on infowars.com and
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.880]  another video clip of him talking about weird all-seeing eyes and all this stuff.
[57:21.880 --> 57:24.880]  And I knew that he was pro-second amendment and actually had a better voting record than
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.600]  a lot of governors.
[57:29.600 --> 57:33.360]  And from the get-go, them hyping up where's the governor, where's the governor, you know,
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.000]  the TSA knew day one where he'd gone, what he'd done.
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.800]  But they built this up as hype so it would get a lot of attention that he was cheating
[57:40.800 --> 57:43.880]  on his wife when regularly it would just been a little blurb in the news.
[57:43.880 --> 57:49.800]  This was a coordinated, scientifically implemented psi-op and you got to ask why this was done
[57:49.800 --> 57:52.400]  by the mainstream media.
[57:52.400 --> 58:01.720]  Just like Governor Elliott Spencer, he writes an op-ed piece for the New York Times and for
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.960]  the Wall Street Journal, writes a couple of them, I saw, explaining how the scam worked
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.560]  with the bankers and they said, buddy, we've had you under surveillance, you see hookers.
[58:11.560 --> 58:14.080]  We watch your bank account, everybody gets their bank account watched.
[58:14.080 --> 58:19.720]  I mean, if you're above somebody working at McDonald's, you got AI computers and analysts
[58:19.720 --> 58:22.960]  looking at what you do, we're doing your file.
[58:22.960 --> 58:25.000]  And they said, burning.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.160]  Now the question with Governor Sanford is why did they say burning?
[58:31.160 --> 58:34.560]  Probably because we got video of them talking bad about all the old geezers at Bilderberg.
[58:34.560 --> 58:42.760]  I think they've showed him, but I'll break that down later, stay with us.
[58:42.760 --> 58:45.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.240 --> 58:50.480]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.480 --> 58:51.840]  This is Alex Jones.
[58:51.840 --> 58:53.840]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[58:53.840 --> 58:54.840]  Well, you should.
[58:54.840 --> 58:59.360]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[58:59.360 --> 59:00.360]  That's right.
[59:00.360 --> 59:05.160]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[59:05.160 --> 59:10.080]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[59:10.080 --> 59:14.520]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free, spring-filled armory
[59:14.520 --> 59:17.320]  XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[59:17.320 --> 59:21.400]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[59:21.400 --> 59:24.480]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.

[59:58.960 --> 1:00:05.240]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.200]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:24.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:42.280]  All right, we're now into the second hour of this worldwide transmission.
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:45.960]  Webster Griffin-Tarpley will be with us for two hours, maybe even longer, if I can twist
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:52.160]  his arm into it, because I got a host of issues to talk about at Webster Griffin-Tarpley.
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:57.160]  Because viewers know many of you, Webster Griffin-Tarpley is really the main voice of
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:58.640]  the Obama deception.
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:01.800]  It has my good friend and economist, George Humphrey in it.
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:07.680]  It has great trans forecaster and political analyst, Gerald Salente.
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:08.680]  It has Willie Nelson.
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.720]  It has Jesse Ventura.
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:15.760]  It has KRS-1, Professor Griff, myself, and many others in it.
[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:20.440]  But Tarpley is really the main voice of the film, as he is in the new upcoming film that's
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:24.560]  got John Perkins in it and a bunch of other people I'm not even going to name at this
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:25.560]  time.
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:26.720]  I've never had a budget like this for a film.
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.560]  I mean, it's probably going to have like 15 big names in it with their analysis, all
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:34.080]  on the same page, but different perspectives.
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:37.520]  So that is coming up in, that's going to come out October 1st.
[1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:40.400]  I've gone ahead and extended it because I was just going to throw a film out.
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:44.600]  It was still going to be a hard heading, but I really want this, the Obama deceptions
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:46.480]  now rivaling loose change, folks.
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:50.360]  It is, I cannot describe to you, and we're going to Webster Tarpley, but I think he
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:55.600]  needs to hear this as well, that I've confirmed it's in Japanese newspapers and they're showing
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:00.440]  it to Japanese, not just film students, but economic and political science students.
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:07.440]  That entire universities, this is in the South Korean news, are showing it to all their students,
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:13.600]  that multiple universities, that I've been interviewed for magazines, and they've told
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:20.720]  me over in South Korea and TV programs as well, that entire universities are showing
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:22.920]  it to entire student bodies.
[1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:26.280]  I mean, I've asked one newspaper reporter, I go, well, how many at this one school?
[1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:30.080]  Oh, hundreds of classes have been shown, the Obama deception.
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:35.720]  And I'm just moving from the East to the West, Russia, Europe, everywhere, translated into
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:46.200]  more than 10 languages that I've seen, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, German, Dutch, French.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:47.880]  Just it's incredible.
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:54.880]  This is on track now to become the most downloaded, most viewed internet film in history, and
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:56.800]  we have no way of gauging it.
[1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:04.720]  Two months in, I checked it, there were 15 million views I could see, and I only spent
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:08.920]  45 minutes going to different sites, million here, 2 million there, 3 million here, half
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:12.680]  million here, 400,000 there, 15 million.
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:18.740]  The peer-to-peer networks, the BitTorrents, other language systems, thousands of video
[1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:21.040]  sites, I have no way of knowing.
[1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:27.880]  Just the copies of DVDs, Phoenix newspapers reported more than 15,000 given out by students
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:30.960]  at one Obama event when he came to speak.
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:36.240]  That's devastating, and videos of the students going wild, putting all their extra money,
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:41.160]  fundraisers, end up buying 15,000 DVDs with mass burners making copies, and now they're
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:45.760]  doing, I mean, it's just all over the country, all over the world, just so that's why I said,
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:49.000]  look, I can't just throw another film out, even though I was doing it for speed, it was
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  going to be good, this is going to be a masterpiece, I just am battling with myself over the name.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  So we'll talk to Webster when we get back about first the spirit of resistance, the spirit
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.880]  of liberty, the spirit of believing you can stand up and getting animated in this fight,
[1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:07.720]  knowing who your enemy is half the battle, taking action and knowing you can't be stopped
[1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:11.360]  if you simply exert yourself as the other half.
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:17.960]  If you counter-strike the New World Order before it's too late, before their full panoptagon,
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:21.720]  their technological system is in place.
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:24.120]  So we'll kind of go to break here in a moment, come back, Webster Tarpley, but I just wanted
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:29.280]  you to know that in the second interview with Webster, and also in the first, we didn't
[1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:34.360]  put a lot about Iran and Pakistan and North Korea in the first one, because we wanted
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:38.320]  to have it simpler for the general public, the second one will have more on that, everything
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:42.720]  he said came true, and it just gives me more and more respect for the foresight over the
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:48.200]  horizon analysis of Webster Griffin Tarpley, we're going to get two hours of that coming
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:53.400]  up after this break, his view on what's happening geopolitically, and then economically, and
[1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:59.000]  then inside the United States as well, detailed analysis straight ahead, you don't want to
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.760]  miss this information.
[1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:04.520]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:05:04.520 --> 1:05:07.240]  self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:11.080]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key, you'll never have to stand in
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:14.800]  a bread line until you have your own bread, you'll never have to go to the super-dome
[1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:19.280]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:22.680]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you, you know

[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:05.240]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:07.800]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:11.840]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:15.960]  great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:17.480]  there is no job security.
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:22.280]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:23.800]  and own your own business.
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:26.400]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:32.080]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:36.480]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:41.040]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:45.360]  of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:47.280]  compounding monthly income.

[1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:54.080]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:58.160]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:02.040]  Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:04.520]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:09.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:19.240]  All right, Webster Griffin Tarpley is with us into the fourth hour today.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:25.120]  So two plus hours, phone calls coming up later in the next hour with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:27.440]  I want to go over Iran.
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:29.680]  I want to go over Pakistan.
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:34.520]  I want to continue to move east into the Korean Peninsula.
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:37.560]  Why suddenly all this is starting and happening?
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:43.280]  I want to get into then what's happening with the economy and a lot more with the unauthorized
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.640]  biographer of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barack H. Obama.
[1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:52.840]  We carry both his books on Barack H. Obama at infowars.com on the secure online video
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:55.280]  bookstore shopping cart, I would add.
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:09:02.240]  Also, he is an award-winning economist and researcher, Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:07.000]  Webster, so much of what you said in the first Obama Deception, now in the new film where
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  we interviewed you a few months ago, is now coming true.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.840]  So I want to get into how you knew their attack plan.
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:14.160]  I mean, I know what you're going to say.
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:17.960]  Brzezinski has been quite public and vocal about it, but still, to see them actually
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:19.640]  doing it is just amazing.
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:24.320]  What you think their next moves will be, are things going well for the globalist for the
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:26.740]  Anglo-American New World War crime syndicate?
[1:09:26.740 --> 1:09:30.440]  Is there a global game of grand chessboard playing out the way they would have wanted
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:31.440]  to?
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:33.880]  How do we block them and then what's happening with the economy?
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:38.400]  Well, first, I just want to share the good news with people.
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:41.360]  Folks out there have done an incredible job of the Obama Deception.
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:46.920]  It is on track right now to rival any film ever released as being the most viral film
[1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:47.920]  in Internet history.
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:54.480]  It is just, it is incalculable with the intelligence I have and the systems we have to even gauge
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:55.480]  it.
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:59.800]  Conservatively, again, over 15 million views a month and a half ago when I last counted
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:05.640]  up just a few sites, just incalculable the DVDs being copied and given out worldwide,
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:09.480]  incalculable because it's so accurate and showed all his lies and said what his next
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  lies would be.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.840]  And it's actually worse than we said.
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:15.760]  So the film, people are seeing it almost like revelation.
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.600]  And though it's not real revelation, it's, they reveal what they would do before in their
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:21.320]  white papers as you know.
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:26.760]  So can you speak to people having faith in themselves, realizing we're at the global
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:31.280]  crossroads where they're trying to bring in the carbon tax tyranny, the total federalization
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:38.280]  of all water supply tyranny, the fascistic healthcare takeover tyranny.
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:45.080]  Just on every front, militarily, you name it, we're at that flash point in history and
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:47.360]  it seems things are only accelerating.
[1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:48.360]  Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:54.600]  Thank you, Alex, and congratulations to you on the tremendous success of this Obama deception.
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:00.120]  I think we've just come through a watershed in that I believe Obama has now peaked at
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:07.040]  least for the moment in terms of his ability to manipulate the United States population
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:08.840]  with his demagogy.
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.720]  You can see that his poll numbers are beginning to fall and in this he repeats the track of
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:14.720]  Carter.
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:20.040]  Now, in the middle of that, I think the Obama deception has been an important ingredient
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:25.160]  in catalyzing people to see what was going on in front of their noses.
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:31.480]  And one of my favorite proverbs, I guess you could call it, is something I learned from
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:37.160]  a Spanish coal miner from the north of Spain from the Asturias and he said, you have to
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:41.200]  remember that in this life you can either be active or you can be radioactive.
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:47.560]  In other words, you have to use political action to try to fend off and avoid the worst.
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:51.880]  And I believe that remains absolutely valid today.
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:59.000]  And the other side of it, I think, is another good quote for people, if you're concerned
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:05.880]  with being political and continuing a struggle even when it doesn't look so good, is you
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:09.800]  can have the pessimism of your intelligence, in other words, you can look around and say
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.400]  that the world is in very, very bad shape and it often does and it often looks like
[1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:18.480]  things are not very hopeful, shall we say.
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:21.040]  So the pessimism of the intelligence is fine.
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:26.840]  But then, don't use that to drop out or relapse into just a mode of complaining.
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:31.000]  The optimism of the will, and I think optimism of the will is what you showed by putting
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.440]  out this Obama deception, right?
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:38.360]  At the time we taped that, it was the height of Obama mania, right?
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:43.360]  It was the beginning of December of last year, as I recall, the part that I was in.
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:46.960]  Yeah, he had 80% approval ratings, godlike level.
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:54.160]  Right, it seemed like a small group of people going against the biggest demagogical exercise
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:55.160]  in world history, right?
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.720]  It seemed like an act of the most protest lunacy, but in reality, I think it has had
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:02.000]  a significant effect and I think it will have more.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.720]  I think the audience for this can only grow because the audience, as long as they were
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:15.520]  on this hysterical high of Obama mania and utopian dreams and Messianic illusions everywhere,
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:20.280]  people are probably not so interested, but I think as the problems become more obvious
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:28.160]  and as these illusions vanish, vanishes like at dawn and then comes the hangover, in the
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:31.480]  middle of the hangover, I think people are going to want to see exactly what has been
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:32.480]  done to them.
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:33.480]  You're right, that's key.
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:35.960]  In fact, that's the only point I meant to make and you're right.
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:37.600]  No, no, you're right.
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:41.720]  It's growing, it's accelerating in its exponential explosion.
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:43.840]  That's what's really taken my breath away.
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:44.840]  Go ahead, Webster.
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:52.200]  So, I recommend political action and I think the people, you know, I got an email the other
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:59.120]  day from a guy in New York City in Brooklyn who was a big Obama supporter and he'd been
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:05.560]  in the 9-11 truth movement and he wrote me an email saying that he had been very wrong
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:11.320]  about Obama and I thought this was probably one of the most committed Obama supporters
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:18.680]  in New York City and he said, well, I realize now that this was a mistake and of course,
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:21.280]  you can understand why some people would make a mistake, right?
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:26.320]  A lot of people hated Hillary Clinton for various reasons, hated other people certainly, just
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:32.240]  about everybody decent, hated Bush, so there were reasons why people made this mistake
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:35.600]  and that was really what Obama built on, right?
[1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:40.640]  He was sort of judoing a situation where, you know, the other alternatives all seemed
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:46.080]  to be totally discredited and he was new and nobody knew anything about him, so why not
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:47.080]  give it a try?
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:50.240]  Well, unfortunately, not a good idea as we're seeing now.
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:54.960]  So I think the resistance is likely to grow and I think a lot of people are having these
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:59.440]  moments of epiphany, right, where they realize that this was, that they've been duped, right?
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:00.440]  So, fine.
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:03.920]  We'll be once shame on you.
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:04.920]  Absolutely.
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:11.680]  I want to get back into where you see Obama's future, how you see his crumbling unfolding.
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:14.440]  We talked during the break, you have the same concern as mine.
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:22.000]  He will implode until he's discredited as a fraud, a charlatan, a con man, false hope,
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:28.160]  a scam artist puppet unless they stage terror attacks or some type of Iranian crisis or
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.240]  a North Korean situation.
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:37.640]  So let's start now on the geopolitical spectrum, moving first to Iran.
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:38.640]  Right.
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:44.880]  I think we can start with Iran because Iran is the, is the big concern of the Carter administration,
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:45.880]  right?
[1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:50.240]  Remember that the trilateral commission is the common denominator of Carter and now of
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:52.920]  Obama and indeed some of the people are the same.
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:57.960]  Paul Adolf Volker was put into the Federal Reserve by Carter and now we've got Paul Adolf
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:04.360]  Volker sitting in the White House as the director of economic recovery for Obama, a real amazing
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:05.360]  thing.
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.440]  And of course, back in the Carter administration, we had Big New Brzezinski running the government
[1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:15.480]  in terms of foreign policy from his post at the National Security Council.
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:21.200]  Today we have Robert Gates, the protege of Brzezinski, a man who owes much of his career
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:26.760]  to Brzezinski, now in the Pentagon running the US military.
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:28.800]  So Iran was the big thing.
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:35.240]  The only time Carter got an improvement in his public opinion after the first year was
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:45.520]  the Iranian hostage crisis beginning in what, January of 1979 and then lasting for more
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:46.520]  than a year.
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:47.520]  Right.
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:48.520]  That gave him the rally round effect.
[1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:53.200]  So we got to remember what Biden said in Seattle on the 19th of October, that there's going
[1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:55.080]  to be a crisis in the first six months.
[1:16:55.080 --> 1:16:56.600]  We'll see what that might be.
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:59.440]  But let's look for the moment at Iran.
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:03.920]  We just had Obama go to Cairo and give this speech, right?
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:06.080]  It was really the second time Obama had done this.
[1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:12.360]  He had gone to Turkey some months before in April and given really the same kind of speech
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:18.360]  with a little bit less oomph and with a certain, probably not as much hysteria around it.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:21.360]  But there he was in Cairo and he made this speech.
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:23.880]  Now, forget about the details of the speech.
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:29.480]  I think the main thing in the speech that was important was he had no economic perspective
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:30.560]  to offer.
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:35.280]  He had nothing about a Marshall plan for the Middle East, nothing about rebuilding the
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:43.560]  war-torn economies of Gaza, of southern Lebanon, of Iraq, helping a place like Iran that has
[1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:46.040]  been hit by economic sanctions.
[1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:48.520]  He had nothing about the Israeli economy, right?
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:53.640]  Three-quarters of every Israeli of the Israeli children grow up in poverty thanks to the
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:59.720]  economic policies instituted by our dear friend Netanyahu when he was the finance minister.
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:04.080]  If any part of the world needs a Marshall plan, this is a very good example.
[1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:09.480]  There's not a word about improving living standards, fighting disease, illiteracy,
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:11.440]  despair, hunger, none of that.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:15.840]  It's all in the area of just rearranging the counters on the board.
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:21.520]  Now, after that, you had this election in Lebanon where the Hezbollah were thought to
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:27.440]  be about to take over the Lebanese government, and they didn't, so it's Hezbollah and General
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:33.240]  Aoun, a Maronite Christian, a great Lebanese patriot, the guy that I would look to in Lebanese
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:34.240]  politics.
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:38.240]  They didn't quite get the majority, but they remain quite strong, and this was considered
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:42.360]  to be already a magical effect of Obama's speech.
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:49.880]  The main goal of Obama's speech, though, is to try to turn the Arabs and the Iranians,
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:55.120]  the Islamic world in the Middle East, against Russia and against China, because this is
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:57.560]  the essence of Obama's policy.
[1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:03.040]  It's an anti-Russian, anti-Chinese policy that tries to address the question of world
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:11.400]  domination using other countries as pawns, kamikaze puppets, expendable assets, proxies,
[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:15.040]  exercises in buck passing, and things like this.
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.560]  So that, I think, is now what's going on with Iran.
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:23.240]  I mean, if you want to just put a headline over the Iranian situation, you could say
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:30.640]  that if you had regime change in Iran, one of the first things that a new puppet state
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:36.360]  in Iran controlled by the U.S. and the British would do is to cut off the oil to China.
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:40.320]  And similarly, if you have a revolution in Saudi Arabia, they might have a revolution
[1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:41.320]  in Saudi Arabia.
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:44.880]  The goal of that would be to cut off the oil to China, because that is the geopolitical
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:46.120]  sense of this entire thing.
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:47.600]  You've got to stay there.
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:53.360]  Again, they use revolution, whether it's anti-religious or pro-religious.
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:54.360]  It doesn't matter.
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:56.760]  They'll do it to break down and control any group they can.
[1:19:56.760 --> 1:20:00.440]  I want to look at the different characters involved in what's happening in Iran and where
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:01.440]  you see that going.
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.040]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary
[1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:09.480]  to maintain good health, with so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to
[1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:12.040]  buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:13.600]  The answer is simple.
[1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:18.480]  PureBulk.com PureBulk.com has over 150 bulk wholesale nutritional

[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:04.200]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:08.760]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:09.760]  your IRA?
[1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:10.760]  That's right.
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:16.680]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:21.320]  refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.680]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments, like stocks, bonds, and
[1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:29.480]  CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:33.600]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:34.960]  you in paper.
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:40.840]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:45.360]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:48.200]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:50.720]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:54.200]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:22:01.160]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:05.360]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:09.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:12.280]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:15.920]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:19.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:25.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:29.440]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:34.920]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:38.840]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.

[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:43.280]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:44.600]  They have all the money they need.
[1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:45.600]  They're after power.
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:46.600]  That's their after-easier.

[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:25.440]  have open phones coming up in the next hour.
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:30.120]  Webster, you get on the air and you're calmly talking about all of this and I think that's
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:32.280]  important to break it down.
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:36.080]  I want people to understand you've done deep research on all these subjects.
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:43.560]  I've done quite a bit of research as well to be able to even vast the basics to grasp
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:47.840]  the basics of what's going on, but I just want listeners to understand this is again
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:49.160]  a key crossroads.
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:51.800]  Very serious things are happening right now.
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:56.120]  Very serious things are being decided right now.
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:25:01.680]  And so I don't want to just talk about what their goals are in Iran or Pakistan or going
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:06.440]  west in Georgia or going east again in North Korea.
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.520]  I want to talk about where you see it going, I mean is it going well for them?
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:16.720]  Just as a layman studying this, it looks like things aren't going well in Iran.
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.400]  The goal was to demonize Iran for military strikes perhaps in the future to kind of sell
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:25.400]  the outside world on that as one option.
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:32.920]  Another option is to try to put in the former prime minister who was hooked into the CIA
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:37.480]  and different black ops who's actually a hard liner and goes with the corrupt inner
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:47.520]  mullahs versus Ahmed Dinajid and that they do want to install him and he is of an anti-Russia
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:51.820]  in the past to kind of strike a deal with the mullahs.
[1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:54.280]  But certainly that deal has been rebuffed.
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:55.280]  It's not being accepted.
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:56.840]  I mean this is very, very murky.
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:02.400]  We know the CIA and MI6 are on record in their fomening this and coming up with a classic
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:04.480]  color revolution and admittedly doing it.
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:09.520]  But what are the goals, are they going well, who are the factions, because people want
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:10.520]  to hear that from you.
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:17.360]  Well, remember the Brzezinski tradition and this is just normal imperialism.
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:22.320]  The neocons make you forget what a normal imperialist looks like.
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:27.120]  The Brzezinski tradition is you don't attack anybody, you sit back and play other countries
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  one against the other.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  They have a name for this.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:30.120]  It's called buck passing.
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:34.760]  But if you want to do something bad to China, don't do it yourself, because there might
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:36.000]  be blowback.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:37.280]  You get somebody else to do it.
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:41.880]  So if you can get Iran to cut off the oil to China or if you can get Iran into some
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:45.520]  hostile relation with Russia, then that's what you want to do.
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:46.520]  And I think-
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:54.160]  Destabilization, Balkanization, wind-up toys, the word you use is good, kamikaze.
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:55.840]  This is the great game, isn't it?
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:27:01.960]  So, as you say, it's a color revolution, it's a people power coup, it's a velvet revolution
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:08.280]  and there was some guy from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the pastor, who had an article about
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:11.480]  in the week before the election saying that what's going to happen is an attempt at a
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:17.080]  velvet revolution at the people power coup by the CIA and we won't let it happen.
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:19.600]  Now, I think they're not doing well with this.
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:26.240]  I think there was a hysterical group and it's called the soft power group in the U.S.
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:28.440]  foreign policy community.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:34.560]  The soft power group says, we don't want the neocons and their stupid military methods.
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:39.360]  We want to use trickery, guile, subversion, soft power.
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:41.200]  We can do more with less.
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:47.480]  We can do more imperialist dirty work with less losses and certainly less expense and
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:50.280]  less pure political problems.
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:54.320]  And that would be this group around Joseph Nye, who was one of the-
[1:27:54.320 --> 1:28:00.360]  Nye is kind of an interface between the trilaterals and the Bilderbergers, big supporter for Obama.
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:03.280]  He was blogging for Obama on the Huffington Post.
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:06.920]  So, the soft power group and now let's look at what they've got.
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:11.880]  If you want to have a color revolution, you've got to have a telegenic demagogue who gets
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:14.440]  out there and leads and this they don't really seem to have.
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:20.720]  I mean, somebody like Obama himself or you can see that the telegenic is a flexible term
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:26.600]  when you get somebody like Yushenko in Ukraine, he's not exactly telegenic.
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:32.560]  Maybe Sakashvili in Georgia maybe looked more telegenic at the beginning.
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:36.320]  Anyway, they have a problem in the sense that they don't have a leader who's willing to
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:38.440]  get out there and bet the ranch.
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:41.000]  The other thing you need, of course, is a color in Iran.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  They have it.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  It's green.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  They have a slogan.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.760]  The slogan is something like, yes, we can, as I understand it.
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:49.080]  You've got to have control of the TV and the media.
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:52.200]  Now, inside Iran, they don't have it.
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:55.680]  The state television, of course, is pro-Aquaman dinner job.
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:58.560]  Satellite TV, though, is going to be anti-regime.
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:28:59.640]  It's interesting.
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:06.560]  The British just began a special television channel for Iran a couple of months before
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:07.560]  this started.
[1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:11.640]  The BBC, Persian television, not radio anymore, but now television.
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:13.880]  This is something I think big.
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:20.000]  The really basic thing you need is a rent-a-mob, a duper mob, and swarming adolescents.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.920]  The kind of thing you saw camped out in Kiev in late 2004.
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:30.960]  That they had up to a point largely through the intervention of the CIA covert action
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:38.320]  program with the $400 million for communications, for Twitter, for cell phones, and all the rest
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:39.320]  of this stuff.
[1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:40.320]  Stay there.
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:41.320]  Stay there.
[1:29:41.320 --> 1:29:43.760]  We've got a quick break-long segment coming up.
[1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:45.960]  Let's continue to break this down.
[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:49.920]  On the other side, with Westford Griffin-Tarbley, we've got both his books on Obama, by the
[1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:51.640]  way, available at infowars.com.
[1:29:51.640 --> 1:29:52.920]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:55.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.400 --> 1:30:00.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:04.800]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:08.000]  in the Truth Movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.240]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:14.160]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:19.120]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food, his Editor's Choice Award,
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:21.600]  or Best Superfood of 2009.
[1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:24.440]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:26.160]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:30.960]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:33.760]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:35.240]  Try the Nutra Cafe.
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:39.840]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:42.400]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:43.600]  And take it from me, folks.
[1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:44.960]  It really does taste great.
[1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.960]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:05.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered
[1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:06.320]  generator this summer.
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:10.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:14.920]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:16.160]  allows you to have.
[1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:17.160]  It's true.
[1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:21.320]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:21.320 --> 1:31:25.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:27.840]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:31.400]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:35.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:39.600]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:43.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:45.440]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:06.600]  red wine.
[1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:10.840]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:15.400]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to New Rev.
[1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:20.680]  New Rev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient,

[1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:22.640]  The great game!
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.240]  How do the globalists, the new world, the Anglo-American establishment, plan on playing
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:32.240]  with different countries in the world, populations off against each other, to bring in this world
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:33.240]  government?
[1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:37.360]  They've openly announced Bank of the World, controlling everything you do.
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:43.680]  The green Nazis in your home, mainstream news, the young people's new jobs will be converted
[1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:47.040]  over to being brigades.
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:51.960]  They're saying the public school children will grow gardens to give it to the state.
[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:54.160]  That's the new service, is actual slavery.
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:34:00.440]  I mean, we're going back to pre-1860s here, going back to Webster Tarpley in a moment
[1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:04.720]  to continue with Iran, then North Korea, to go around the world and look at what's really
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:09.800]  happening and then we'll look at the economy as well with our guest, who has a great track
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:14.760]  record of analyzing and breaking all this down extremely accurate fashion.
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:16.800]  Before I go any further though, I'll tell you about a few of the sponsors that make
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:20.040]  this radio show possible, one of them is Home Game.
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:23.400]  This is a place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, getting
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:26.840]  any real estate questions answered, and it's absolutely free.
[1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:32.640]  It's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com, homegain dot com, and see what I'm talking about.
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:36.920]  All you need to do is type in your home address and you will get a free estimate of your home
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:39.480]  value or any other address for that matter.
[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:41.480]  You're buying or selling a home.
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:46.560]  According to Realtor's home sellers, becoming more realistic on home prices, go to blog
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.640]  dot homegain dot com and see homegain home prices survey results.
[1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:55.160]  There is a new feature called Street View, where you can look at the house at street
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:59.080]  level, take a virtual walkthrough tour of the neighborhood, you're interested in.
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:01.640]  You've got to see it for yourself and again it's all free.
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.920]  There are tons of tools to help you for instance, and if you want to remodel your home, go
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:06.400]  to homegain dot com.
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:09.920]  Use their home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most
[1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:12.640]  increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:15.360]  It's homegain dot com.
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:22.240]  And one other sponsor I wanted to tell you about this hour is eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:25.320]  This is the place to get high quality storeable foods for insurance.
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:29.680]  You know, you buy insurance for floods and insurance for hurricanes or tornadoes or storms
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:35.280]  or fire, but in this depression we're going into, in this urban society with almost no
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:39.920]  one being self-sufficient, no one having really gardens unless it's a slave garden with your
[1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:44.480]  children working for the federal government, we need to have storeable food.
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:47.280]  And this is who I get my storeable food from.
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:53.040]  I was buying food for them before they were a sponsor, eFoodsDirect.com, the letter eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:36:01.080]  eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633, that's 1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:04.680]  Call and get a free brochure or watch the videos online about all their high quality
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:08.200]  food products and they have other things like stoves and water filters and stuff.
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:13.320]  It's just a great site, eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:18.240]  And then lastly, we have an online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:21.840]  It's a video store, a bookstore, all the best films and books that I read that I think are
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.360]  important, the best films I see.
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:25.840]  It's all available at infowars.com.
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:31.000]  We've had a lot of t-shirts that spread the word about the New World Order and fighting
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  the globalist.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:38.600]  If you want to meet like-minded people, if you want to reach out to folks in your community,
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:44.460]  well then wear your colors on your sleeve, on your back, infowars.com, just a whole bunch
[1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:51.820]  of anti-New World Order, Pro1776, anti-slavery material, and of course, all of the films
[1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:57.120]  like Endgame and Maafa, 21, Black Genocide in the 21st Century America.
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:01.080]  I want to go over some eugenics and this whole green movement with Webster as well before
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:02.080]  he leaves us.
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:06.960]  Now, going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, Webster, okay, you got the floor.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:11.400]  I'm going to sit back here, continue with the different players in Iran, where you see
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:15.680]  this going, how that's going, and then let's move to other battle fronts like what you
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:21.760]  see really going on in Pakistan versus what's happening in North Korea, because it's as
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:28.440]  if someone flipped a light switch in global crises in a fiery crescent from Eastern Europe
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:34.640]  into the Korean Peninsula, just suddenly lit up in flames, as well as Africa.
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:42.960]  Yes, well, just on Iran now, if you come out and say that the revolution in Iran is being
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:49.600]  run through Twitter, that already implies a very specific class composition of who is
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:51.200]  out there revolting.
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:53.760]  A lot of people in Iran don't even have a phone.
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:57.120]  A lot of people in Iran have never made a phone call.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:02.520]  The people who have access to the Internet are maybe 20, 25 percent, that would be my
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:03.520]  guess.
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:11.000]  So if you say that the golden youth, the privileged, youthful students of Tehran University are
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:17.560]  demanding the overthrow of the regime, this is a social stratum that is essentially demanding
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:20.120]  more privileges for itself.
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:26.640]  These are people who believe in economic globalization, they're big on free market.
[1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:32.640]  For example, this guy, Musabi, is demanding privatization of the state sector, a typical
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:37.880]  IMF, International Monetary Fund, shock therapy demand.
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:43.160]  He's demanding freedom on the Internet, well, to the average peasant or poor worker, there's
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:47.080]  no such thing as freedom on the Internet, because they don't have the Internet.
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:52.000]  And I think this points to the limitation of what they're doing in Iran.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.080]  It reminds me a little bit of the Cedars Revolution that they tried in Lebanon a little while ago,
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:05.640]  you had the rich Christian Maronite jet set driving up in Porsches and BMWs, if not Rolls-Royces
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:11.880]  and Lamborghinis, and saying, oh, we're really hurting, we've got to get Hezbollah out of
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:12.880]  Lebanon.
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:14.360]  It's this kind of a situation.
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:21.840]  The support for Musabi is largely in North Tehran, which is like saying Park Avenue or
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:26.760]  Beverly Hills or the Gold Coast of Chicago, in other words, a very rich neighborhood.
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:32.040]  So it's rich elitists who like Musabi, and you can get enough of them to go out on the
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:37.560]  street and drag some others with them, and the Desperate Housewives, because the Desperate
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:45.080]  Housewives are fascinated by the wife of Musabi, who's a lady with some kind of academic
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:46.080]  background.
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:47.080]  She's an academic dean.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:52.840]  And now, this is the problem, the very narrow base of support for the US-British candidate
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.400]  Musabi, normally you have to have a public opinion poll.
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:02.680]  The classic way you do a color revolution is an oppressive regime has an election, and
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.080]  then you get your swarming adolescence, you get your rent-a-mob and duper mob of young
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:12.600]  people and rich elitists out in the streets camping in the main square of Kiev, things
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:16.960]  like this, and they demand the overturning of the election, as they're doing now, based
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:19.400]  on the idea that boat fraud took place.
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:21.720]  Well, how can you prove boat fraud?
[1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:26.520]  In this case, there's absolutely no proof, there's no suggestion of how you can prove
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:27.520]  boat fraud.
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:32.800]  They say, well, such and such a candidate came from this region and he didn't win it.
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:36.280]  Well, Al Gore lost Tennessee, big deal.
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:41.880]  It's very easy for people to lose the area that they come from if the opponent is popular.
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:47.880]  So the boat fraud scenario suffers from the fact that they don't have a poll, and the
[1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:54.480]  polls that they do have show Ahmadinejad chose the regime candidate winning by about
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:55.480]  two to one.
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:41:00.280]  So about two-thirds of the votes for Ahmadinejad, and that's about what you have.
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:05.360]  So I think on the whole, this is not going to be very, very successful.
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:10.560]  And I think the really sinister thing again is if Mousavi got in, what would he do?
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:12.520]  Let's look at Mousavi for a minute.
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.000]  This is the butcher of Beirut.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:19.560]  This is one of the most hard-line Islamic fascists to use the neocon terms.
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:22.320]  If anybody is Islamic fascist, it's him.
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:27.120]  But always you see the globalist, the CIMI-6, cozying up to these butchers.
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:32.560]  He represents the old line, he represents the old line, wealthy corrupt that Ahmadinejad
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:33.560]  is fighting.
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:37.560]  I'm not saying Ahmadinejad is any angel, but this guy, you know, actually you can tell
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:38.560]  by his actions.
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:39.840]  He really believes he's doing the right thing.
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:40.840]  You're right.
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.160]  He's dealing with the people, but the little CIA-funded kids, the only way I see this working
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.120]  and I want your take on this is why I'm interrupting Webster, because I want to hear what you have
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:51.120]  to say on this.
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.840]  And this is what Paul Craig Roberts and others are saying, and I agree with them.
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:58.680]  The only real reason they went with this is maybe it's going to work to overthrow them.
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:04.240]  It destabilizes them, period, and discredits them in the world's eyes if Israel goes ahead
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:09.760]  and blows their new reactors to kingdom come that, oh, well, the regime deserved it.
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:12.880]  This is some type of demonization campaign.
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:15.040]  Now, do you agree with that or am I wrong?
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:19.760]  Well, I think their maximum option was to try to overthrow the regime and put in a puppet
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:21.240]  state.
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:24.640]  The other thing, let me talk in a minute about the idea of busting up Iran, because that's
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:26.640]  the real strategy.
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:31.400]  Mousavi, as you say, is this prime minister from the 1980s.
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:37.760]  And for me, the thing that sums it all up is, during the Iran-Iraq war, started by the
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:45.880]  U.S., of course, in 1980, 1981, you had the mullahs, who are not good people, to say the
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:48.480]  least, going around and getting children.
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:52.960]  They would take children, barely young children, away from their parents and get them to go
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:54.360]  to the front.
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:43:00.040]  And they would give them a stick or some little weapon that was really no weapon at all, maybe
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:05.600]  a knife or some silly little thing, and then send them up against the machine guns of the
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:06.600]  Iraqi army.
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:09.000]  So it was like a children's crusade.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:16.280]  Now, Mousavi was the prime minister who presided over human wave attacks by young children
[1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:20.600]  who had been taken away from their parents by these mullahs.
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:25.840]  So this is what he represents, and he, of course, is a tool of this guy, Raf Sanjani.
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:29.440]  Raf Sanjani is one of the most corrupt people in the world.
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:35.480]  Raf Sanjani could compete with Zardari there in Pakistan in terms of corruption, right?
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:40.120]  He's the extreme corrupt manifestation of the old regime.
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:47.640]  So Raf Sanjani, who is the oldest, most discredited, most corrupt representative of this entire
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:54.280]  theocracy, that, again, the theocracy was set up by Carter and Brzezinski during the
[1:43:54.280 --> 1:43:55.280]  Carter administration.
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:43:56.280]  Right?
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:57.280]  They installed Khomeini.
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:43:58.280]  That's what they wanted.
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:03.280]  They wanted Islamic fundamentalism as a bulwark against Soviet communism, and by God they
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:04.280]  got it.
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:09.880]  And so Raf Sanjani is the spirit of Khomeini living on, and that's Mousavi.
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:13.000]  So this is now in the eyes of the US and the British.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:18.720]  This is now a wonderful reformer and his wonderful supporters are these people that everybody
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:19.720]  should support.
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:24.840]  I think this is probably going nowhere, and therefore that's a defeat for Obama, because
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:31.280]  remember, the argument for Obama was that this wonderful personality, this dazzling
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:36.000]  smile of Obama would transform the world through magical powers, right?
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:40.480]  Obama would gesture hypnotically, and the regime in Iran would fall.
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:45.080]  And again, the soft power people wanted the argument of saying, don't attack Iran, don't
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:46.160]  attack Iran.
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:49.480]  We can deal with Iran using these methods.
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:54.040]  Now, they have shaken the regime, but I don't know what's going to come out of it.
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:59.040]  I mean, it's, you know, ten on men was certainly not as, it was more extreme than what we've
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:00.040]  seen here.
[1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:04.360]  And that did not work in China, so it doesn't look, it looks like the, the color revolution
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:09.720]  people power coup model is getting to be so well known that you can take measures against
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:10.720]  it, right?
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:14.320]  The Iranians have cut off Twitter and cut off parts of the internet and so forth.
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:18.160]  So they, I think they knew what was coming and they were ready for it.
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:23.600]  Now, in terms of the long-term CIA stuff, the, the, the journalists today ignore the
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:32.200]  fact that Bush in May of, of 2007, with great fanfare, Bush signed a $400 million program
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:36.880]  to subvert Iran using communications and other, used to be fax machines.
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:42.800]  Now it's Twitter, cell phones, and more importantly, that was done publicly for a color revolution.
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.480]  They said to get the students to try to overthrow the government on active war.
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:49.640]  And I want you to continue, but for folks that don't know, this is on record.
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:54.600]  We've written a bunch of articles at infowars.com and prismplanet.com, previous to this latest
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:55.760]  big flare up.
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:46:01.080]  They tried this actually back in 2004, the year after they'd taken over Iraq.
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:06.640]  There were some bombings and riots and things, and then they started even before 2007, hiring
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:07.640]  four groups.
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:11.960]  And you always go over that Webster, and then I want to move back to the current time and
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:12.960]  into the future.
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:16.480]  But, but, but you're really an expert on the four groups, one of them Kurdish, three of
[1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:24.200]  them connected in to Sunni, Wahhabist, and number three in al-Qaeda working for CIA.
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:29.480]  But then also one of the groups that work for Saddam, they've got such five groups,
[1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:34.880]  bombing mosque, blowing up school buses, shooting police, and Iran has sued the United States.
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:37.160]  The West admits they're staging attacks.
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:40.040]  You imagine if Iran was staging weekly attacks here for years.
[1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:46.040]  So it's not just 2007 with the shift from paramilitary attacks to getting the students
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:48.160]  ready for now what's happening.
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:52.800]  And then the facts of also how the Mullahs can appoint who's going to run anyway.
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:56.280]  So why would they steal an election when they rig who gets to run anyway?
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:47:02.960]  So I mean, it's just unbelievable, but how terrorists, including al-Qaeda, openly work
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:05.040]  for the U.S. and England.
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:07.980]  And then they think our public is so stupid, Webster.
[1:47:07.980 --> 1:47:14.000]  They tell us Iran is al-Qaeda when it's the opposite religious group of Islam.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:17.160]  I mean, this is like saying Superman is Lex Luthor.
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:23.240]  Yeah, the U.S. Congress, of course, has passed repeatedly passed regime change laws concerning
[1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:24.240]  Iran.
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:27.840]  In other words, a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:32.480]  Now, remember, Seymour Hirsch of the New Yorker has been writing articles since what?
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:41.720]  2004, 2005, saying the U.S. has special forces teams, terrorist controllers, saboteurs, political
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:44.400]  operatives on the ground in Iran, and they do.
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:50.600]  We have Brent Scowcroft, a great eminence of the ruling elite, has given an interview
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:55.880]  quite recently, which is, of course, we have all kinds of CIA personnel on the ground.
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:48:00.160]  And that gets us into, then, the, I think that the reasonable scenario for Iran is,
[1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:06.680]  if you had Musavi take over, that would leave Musavi as the prime minister of what they
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:13.040]  call Iranistan, Iranistan would be sort of the central part of Iran, Tehran and Quam
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:14.400]  and some other large cities.
[1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:19.560]  But then, as you mentioned, now, the CIA and the British, MI6 especially, they have these
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:21.240]  other groups, right?
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:25.360]  You have the Jundula terrorists operating in Baluchistan.
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:30.720]  That would be Southeast Iran coming in sometimes from Pakistan.
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:36.920]  They have terrorists coming from Afghanistan into the area in the northeast, that would
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:38.680]  be Pushtunistan.
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:40.480]  That would be another component.
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:44.360]  Then they have, in the north, they have Azeris.
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:47.000]  They have Kurds.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.880]  And then they have this Arabistan.
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:51.360]  This is where the British have invested a lot.
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:49:00.000]  Arabistan, or Akvaz, is the coast of Iran along the Persian Gulf or Arabian Gulf, the Gulf,
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:01.120]  I guess.
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:07.160]  And that's the area of the Abadan refinery, the Kargaylan tanker terminal, the oil fields,
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:09.600]  sort of south of a chain of mountains.
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:16.160]  And here, for a long time, the British have sponsored what I call the BP Liberation Front,
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:22.000]  British Petroleum Liberation Front, because it is an open attempt to detach from Greater
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.960]  Iran the parts that the British used to control and used to be there.
[1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:27.680]  They want to slice the big port.
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:30.840]  They want to slice the big port and oil field away, so Iran has trouble.
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:31.840]  Right.
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:33.240]  And then you mentioned the MEK, right?
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:40.320]  The Mujahideen-e-Kalq is an army with tanks, with all kinds of weapons that the U.S. has
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:45.600]  and continues to protect inside an enclave on the Iraqi side, but these people can be
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  sent over.
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:53.440]  So if you add up al-Qaeda in that Pushtunistan area, you've got Jundulah in the Baluchistan
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:54.440]  area.
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:58.560]  You've got Mujahideen-e-Kalq, you've got this Akfaz Liberation Front, you've got four or
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.960]  five different terrorist groups that are being fermented by the U.S. and the British.
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:07.640]  And the background to the entire thing, they say, if you turn on CNN, they say, well, the
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:11.480]  economy under Ahmadinejad is bad, yeah, there are sanctions.
[1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:15.040]  There are draconian economic sanctions, practically a blockade.
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:19.560]  I don't know why Ahmadinejad doesn't get up there like Castro and say, you know, comrades
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:25.360]  or brothers in Islam, our economy is bad because we're under economic blockade.
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:29.560]  And I suppose he does say that, but that is one of the realities.
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:34.880]  Now, Ahmadinejad is, of course, a populist demagogue with a lot of bluster, but in terms
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:37.080]  of an election, it really looks like he won it.
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:38.080]  So...
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:43.240]  Now, certainly, we have U.S. poll companies saying two to one, and then the other clown
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:47.600]  announces he's won hours before the polls close to create the perception of a stolen
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:49.800]  election when he loses.
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:54.120]  Webster, do you think he knows he's working for the CIA or do they want to put him in?
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:56.760]  I think he's probably a winning actor.
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:50:58.680]  All right, stay there.
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:01.040]  We'll come back and get into other areas of the world.
[1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:03.480]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.840]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:10.680]  on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.

[1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:01.240]  show.
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:07.880]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:12.400]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:13.720]  us would like to see.
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:18.880]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:19.880]  of the American people.
[1:52:19.880 --> 1:52:24.640]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:29.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:37.880]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:41.440]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:48.360]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:02.640]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:04.440]  What does humidity mean to you?
[1:53:04.440 --> 1:53:08.840]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[1:53:08.840 --> 1:53:12.200]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:15.160]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablu.com.

[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:20.640]  I think if you boil it all down in the last 45-50 minutes talking to Webster Tarpley,
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:27.680]  he's coming to the same perspective and summation that I've come to and many of us have.
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:31.320]  The globalists have the high ground financially, but not morally.
[1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:32.320]  They have the power.
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:33.320]  They have the money.
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:35.560]  But it's a losing game.
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:40.500]  Time is on our side, those of us that want human liberty and freedom and upward mobility
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:46.080]  and goals for society and, you know, where decency and truthfulness is honored, not just
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:52.280]  this capitulation to lies and evil, and that on every front, the New World Order is failing.
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:55:00.160]  They're grinding down to their axles like Napoleon in Russia, or Hitler in Russia.
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:04.760]  But they got a lot of tricks up their sleeves, namely stage terror, and that's why we now
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:13.920]  get into North Korea, Pakistan, conflict with Russia, the encirclement, all of that continuing.
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:21.360]  But Webster, one final note on Iran that we'll get into stage crises, North Korea being chief
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:25.360]  among them, I would imagine will be your view, but we'll see.
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:29.160]  And that is the, have you ever seen one that lies as much as Obama?
[1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:33.120]  I mean, we know presidents lie a lot, and that's just part of what they do.
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:35.560]  Unfortunately, it's become just business as usual.
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:41.960]  But with him, it's the over the topness, saying there's no CIA doing anything in Iran.
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:47.640]  There's no involvement while, while his bosses, Brzezinski and Kissinger, and you mentioned
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:52.840]  Skrokow are on TV bragging how they're running and all, and calling it delicate manipulation.
[1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:54.760]  I mean, and that's another question.
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:59.040]  Why do they go on TV and admit they're behind it, but then he gets up and lies?
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:01.960]  Is that just part of the, the flaunting it in our face?
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:02.960]  They think we're a bunch of idiots?
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:08.120]  I think Obama has a much bigger audience, and then when, when somebody like Brad Scalcoff
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  speaks, that doesn't exactly get, you know, doesn't get on the evening news, but you're
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:14.120]  certainly right.
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:22.680]  With Bush, we had a brutal aggressor, an imperialist, a reactionary, and he was Frank, as he always
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:24.400]  said, you know exactly where I stand.
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:25.400]  Yeah, we did.
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:31.840]  He, he had this thin veil of pro-democracy neocon rhetoric, but you could already see
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.440]  that, you know, the, the intent, which was just aggression, right?
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:38.600]  Imperialism, and then he would say things like, bring it on, or dead or alive.
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:42.960]  So that's, that's Bush, but now Obama's a completely different method.
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:52.520]  This is now systematic, strategic deception, dissembling, fakery, lying, duping people,
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:58.120]  mass brainwashing, and according to some, even mass hypnosis, or, or the attempt at,
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  at mass hypnosis.
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:00.440]  No, no, he's definitely doing that stuff.
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:03.120]  They have corporate classes on that.
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:05.720]  People used to tell me about it a decade ago, I didn't believe it.
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:07.240]  They really teach him how to do that.
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:11.640]  Yeah, they, you know, there was, I think it was Caliostro in the French Revolution could
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:12.960]  hypnotize crowd.
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:14.680]  I guess that's, that's what Obama's trying to do.
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:19.080]  One of the, one of the mountain banks of the, of the French Revolution is now reincarnated
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:20.640]  in, in Obama.
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:26.000]  So, the, the point though is that, that, that his method is, is this deception.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.880]  And I, I think as long as that holds up, it looks like it's, it's going well, but then
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:34.880]  as they used to say in Vietnam, it will become polluted by reality.
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:40.160]  You know, all the, the promises that Lyndon Johnson made eventually crashed to the ground.
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:45.880]  And of course he was a much less clever practitioner of, of deception than Obama.
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:47.680]  So people have got to change gears, right?
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:49.240]  You're no longer dealing with Bush.
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:50.240]  Bush is gone.
[1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:53.960]  I know a lot of leftists that I know are still hanging onto this idea that Bush is their
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:54.960]  main enemy.
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:57.160]  Well that's, that's long gone.
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:02.000]  So you're not dealing with Obama and his method is, is this lying and so forth.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.440]  And therefore the, the idea of exposing him, right?
[1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:08.320]  What you do in the Obama deception, this becomes one of the main things.
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:13.840]  In other words, simply the, the, the loud statement of the truth is practically revolutionary
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:15.520]  when you're dealing with somebody like Obama.
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:16.520]  All right, stay there.
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:17.520]  Stay there.
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:18.520]  We're going to come back in one minute.
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:19.520]  Webster will be a third hour.
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:20.920]  We have plenty of time with you today.
[1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:24.520]  We're very honored to, and very thankful that you're spending so much time with us.
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:28.000]  Webster Griffin Tarpley and we'll tell you about his books and other materials on the
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  other side.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:33.960]  But yes, it was George Arwell that said in an age of universal deceit telling the truth
[1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:35.600]  is a revolutionary act.
[1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:43.360]  So I think that's a nice addendum or dessert to what the Webster just said.
[1:58:43.360 --> 1:58:45.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:34.640]  on us or something I mean just the mafianess of the government is just unbelievable.
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:37.480]  Going back to Webster Griffin Tarpoli we're trying to make a point there Webster as we
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:40.720]  slammed into that satellite initiated break.
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:46.920]  Well just look at what's going on the program of the US and the British for all these countries
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:54.840]  is partition, Balkanization, getting back to a crazy quilt instead of a unified national
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:55.840]  state.
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:00.040]  Brzezinski writes about this all the time he writes about micro states and mini states
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:05.480]  and how you need micro states and mini states to safeguard human dignity and of course it
[2:02:05.480 --> 2:02:10.680]  also happens that the micro states and mini states are so small, so impotent, so squabbling
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:18.160]  so wretched that they couldn't stand up against JP Morgan or Exxon Mobil or Halliburton or
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:19.160]  Blackwater.
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:25.320]  Czechoslovakia was divided into two parts right after the fall of the Warsaw Pact, Yugoslavia
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:30.480]  divided into five parts, Iraq divided into three parts, maybe two parts now and another
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:31.840]  part coming.
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:36.920]  The plan for Iran is to divide it into six parts, the plan for Pakistan into five parts,
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:43.080]  Sudan into two parts and on and on and on, some people come forward and say secessionism
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:47.680]  in the United States, I don't think so because that's exactly the program of the Council
[2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:49.560]  on Foreign Relation.
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:54.080]  Micro states and mini states in the US or North America would be just about the workers
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:55.080]  order.
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:58.520]  Webster, I'm going to let you speak on this, but I want to be clear.
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:05.560]  The mainstream media and Fox News and these different governors, including the one who's
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:11.640]  in trouble now, Ann Rick Perry, hijacked a state's rights movement saying we're not
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:18.840]  going to let the offshore banks control the federal government and through that mechanism
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:23.800]  control us, we're going to have the states re-declare the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:25.080]  for the Republic.
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:35.520]  Then the media in a split miscast the movement as secession to the left and balkanization
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:38.760]  which it was and to the right said, oh, yes, it's good.
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:44.240]  We do want to secede and now they have Glenn Beck and others pushing for physical secession.
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:45.240]  So I agree.
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:46.720]  I'm not for secession.
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:51.240]  I'm for the states, like they said, no to the Patriot Act saying, no, we're going to
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:55.960]  keep the Republic in place and reconvene the federal government if it becomes a complete
[2:03:55.960 --> 2:03:57.360]  vassal of offshore banks.
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:03:58.920]  But no, I agree with you.
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:04.400]  There's been an attempt somewhat successful to to to miscast or change the casting of
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:10.080]  this movement that I and others have been pushing into pure secession, not declaration
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:12.360]  of the Republic rights.
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:17.440]  I have a program for California which can be adapted to any state and I'd be happy if
[2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:21.160]  I could to to adapt it if people have struggles going on in different states.
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:22.160]  Okay, well, we got to break again.
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:24.160]  I interrupted you when we come back.
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:25.160]  Long segment.
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:26.160]  Okay.
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:30.960]  If flesh out that full point that you want to make about that and I agree with you of
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:31.960]  what they've done to it.
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:37.720]  But it's a new watch, people say I'm saying secede, no, I'm saying the state's right ninth
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:43.040]  tenth amendment where the feds can't come into Texas and take my guns or they can't
[2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:47.960]  come in and say the feds own all the water supply of the US and use that to triple prices
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:53.400]  because the bankers can balkanize to get control of you or they can use a strong central government
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:54.400]  to do it.
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:58.560]  As you know, Webster, so I'm trying to head off both the past by balancing the powers of
[2:04:58.560 --> 2:05:01.080]  the states against the fed.
[2:05:01.080 --> 2:05:02.080]  Hello, friends.

[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:52.360]  they want, when they want, how they want.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:58.080]  Thank you so much for making us number one on ShotCast, number one on many AM and FM affiliates,
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:01.600]  just ratings coming in from those, just exploding everywhere.
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:04.600]  As people find out all these years, we were telling you the truth.
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:08.680]  This new order is real, this global empire is real, and we have a good chance of beating
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:11.480]  it if we just wake up to it and decide we have power and say no.
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:17.000]  Okay, Webster, I want to get into the economy, so let's accelerate through your point about
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.640]  the secession movements around the world, how they balkanize everywhere, or if they can,
[2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:25.960]  they want a powerful central government, if they've got that, that's fine, but if they
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:30.320]  want to bring something down or shut off a region's sanctions, they fund terrorists,
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:36.200]  they fund racial break-off or religious break-off groups, you were beginning to warn about that
[2:09:36.200 --> 2:09:42.160]  here in the United States, the states' rights movement being hijacked and turned into a
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:46.040]  secession movement, then let's move into Pakistan, let's move into what you see happening in
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:48.440]  North Korea with Russia and then the economy.
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:53.880]  Just in terms of what states can do, I would always say that the main level where you're
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:58.600]  going to fight a world economic depression is at the level of the federal government,
[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:03.360]  and I urge people to regard government as the battlefield where the people confront
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:09.920]  the bankers, and if you don't fight the bankers concerning the government, in the government,
[2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:13.360]  then the bankers will control the government, and that's going to be bad, but if you have
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:19.000]  a mass movement of politically aware people, as you're saying, then you can push the bankers
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:23.280]  back and at least diminish their control over the government.
[2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:25.720]  Now, here's what I think those states can do.
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:30.040]  I wrote this program for California because this is the most acute case.
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:34.040]  In California, the whole economy collapsing and the place is descending into barbarism
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:37.800]  with Schwarzenegger, you've also got this thing going on in New York where the state
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:41.600]  government of New York has just about lapsed into chaos itself.
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:43.640]  It's a situation of unbelievable.
[2:10:43.640 --> 2:10:46.760]  They're saying they're going to have the state police come arrest the members of the
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:47.760]  legislature.
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:48.760]  It's unbelievable.
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:49.760]  So here's what you can do, though.
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:54.280]  Let's see, what can a state do rather than assert general principles or maybe in addition
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:59.440]  to the general principles, let's assert a substantive program, how are you going to fight the depression?
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:01.440]  You want states rights fine to do what?
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:03.200]  Here's what I would do.
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:04.200]  Tobin tax.
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:08.920]  If you look around in California, let's take California, good example.
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:09.920]  Everybody's overtaxed.
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:11.360]  You don't want to put any more taxes on people.
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:14.920]  But you want a local Tobin tax, not what the New World Order wants, right?
[2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:15.920]  No, this is state tax.
[2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:21.760]  In other words, the government of California in Sacramento can say the only untapped source
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:25.680]  of wealth, the only, if not really wealth, but let's call it a cash flow.
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:31.080]  The only cash flow that is not taxed six ways to Sunday is financial speculation.
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:33.320]  Interesting coincidence, huh?
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:37.120]  Financial speculation, the most harmful of all activities, the activity that brought
[2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:41.120]  us derivatives and the depression is completely untapped.
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:46.200]  So let's have a Tobin tax, the securities transfer tax, which would be a 1% tax on all
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:50.880]  derivatives, stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, commodity speculation.
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:54.320]  The kind of speculation that drives up the price of gasoline.
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:58.240]  Won't the feds claim a commerce clause on that?
[2:11:58.240 --> 2:11:59.240]  Fight them.
[2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:00.480]  I mean, do something, right?
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:03.360]  Don't be paralyzed by what they might do.
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:06.800]  Let Obama come out and argue in the courts that that's impossible.
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:13.080]  No, I think a Tobin tax, if you can have a sales tax in California, it's a 9% sales tax
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:14.080]  in many areas.
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:18.600]  So if you want to go out and buy a pair of shoes for your kid, you pay 9%.
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:19.600]  What is the banker pay?
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:24.560]  Well, there's a big financial district there in San Francisco with Wells Fargo and Trans
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:30.360]  America and all these people, that huge stylized pyramid with the Eye of Horus on top that people
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:31.360]  may have seen.
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:32.360]  They pay nothing.
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:33.360]  There's no tax.
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:35.360]  There's no sales tax on taxes.
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  Exactly.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:40.320]  They tax us through the bureaucracy and all the money's fed into their mouth.
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:42.680]  Yeah, so I'm saying let's redress the balance.
[2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:48.880]  And if you say, is there anything to tax that's not already overtaxed, it's clearly speculation.
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:55.720]  So derivatives and speculation of all kinds, 1% tax paid by the broker, paid by the institutional
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:57.960]  partner in the exchange, not by you.
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:59.800]  So that I think that would do it for California.
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:00.880]  How about another one?
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:01.880]  Stop foreclosures.
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:03.920]  We've already, we've been on this program.
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:05.420]  I gotta stop you.
[2:13:05.420 --> 2:13:08.640]  I wanted to get into Malthusian economics.
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:10.480]  He wanted to bulldoze cities.
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:12.240]  He wanted to do things like that for those that don't know.
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:13.240]  I know you know.
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:14.240]  That's right.
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:17.240]  Obama's saying bulldoze one-fourth of US cities.
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:20.680]  This was the Brzezinski poll pot model for those that don't know.
[2:13:20.680 --> 2:13:26.280]  And they just put it in USA today like, well, of course we've got to bulldoze the cities.
[2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:31.000]  I mean, I mean, this is, instead of just letting people live in those, they're making them
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:34.160]  go to sports stadiums in California and Hawaii.
[2:13:34.160 --> 2:13:36.120]  We sent cameras out there as we predicted.
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:38.880]  You're not allowed to stay on the streets now or at a park.
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:40.360]  You've got to go to a FEMA camp.
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:45.320]  Meanwhile, the feds are federalizing the cities and are going to bulldoze neighborhoods.
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:48.840]  Which is a code word for land grabbing.
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:50.760]  Imagine the bulldozing Flint, Michigan.
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.400]  This is just national suicide.
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:55.200]  A healthy economy builds new cities.
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:56.920]  You don't bulldoze old ones.
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:14:01.440]  You develop absolutely new ones, right, the science cities indeed, places that are built
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:04.440]  around a specific new industry that's emerging.
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:09.200]  But as you're saying, in California, this is the capital of the Obama bills, right,
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:12.200]  the Hoover bills of the current depression.
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:13.600]  You want to do something about that?
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:19.400]  Right, state law, ban foreclosures for five years or the duration of the crisis.
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:22.440]  That also applies to family farms.
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:26.440]  That applies to any business, a restaurant, a dry cleaner.
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:27.720]  You can't be foreclosed on.
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:32.960]  You can't be driven out of business for reasons of financial debt for five years or a duration.
[2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:33.960]  By the way, let me stop you.
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:38.360]  I mean, because we look at the Austrian view, which I have heard you this weekend attacking.
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:43.160]  We look at your egalitarian view, and so let people decide and think about themselves.
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:48.720]  But regardless, both of those systems are decidedly better than giving 14.8 trillion
[2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:54.600]  as Bloomberg reported in seven months to offshore banks who then hoard the money and increase
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:58.800]  the price of loans and have accelerated foreclosure.
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:05.960]  So they promised Bloomberg and AP reported 9.4 trillion would have paid off all mortgages,
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:15.680]  mortgages and trouble for $45 million apartments, penthouses, $200,000 houses, $100,000 condos,
[2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:17.480]  everything paid off.
[2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:26.560]  That's our tax money to begin with all real estate paid off that that's a dwelling and
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:32.280]  but no, now it's worse, no loaning, actual interest rates going up.
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:37.760]  And then the phony right wing will say, you're a communist Webster saying just freeze the
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.640]  mortgages to these criminal banks.
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.040]  They've already been given more money than did, I mean, it's such a scam.
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:48.840]  But then meanwhile, the so-called conservatives want to give trillions more to the bankers
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:50.600]  and then have them not say where it went.
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:51.600]  That's the new conservatism.
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:54.960]  My method basically says people stay in their homes.
[2:15:54.960 --> 2:15:59.520]  You throw an American family on the street, it's a federal crime, Wall Street can eat
[2:15:59.520 --> 2:16:00.520]  the losses.
[2:16:00.520 --> 2:16:03.720]  And as you say, this is not the main thing in the financial crisis.
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:09.040]  The goal of all these bailouts has very little to do with subprime housing or housing.
[2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:15.440]  In any sense, the centerpiece is derivatives, derivatives, derivatives, 1.5 quadrillion of
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:20.960]  derivatives, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles,
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:24.840]  asset backed securities, mortgage backed securities, and the mortgage backed securities
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:28.720]  is where the subprime business comes in.
[2:16:28.720 --> 2:16:34.120]  But the goal of the Obama administration, the overriding purpose of Obama, is to try
[2:16:34.120 --> 2:16:39.080]  to bail out the derivatives bubble, 1.5 quadrillion, and it can't be done.
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:42.560]  And the only thing you can do is realize you're dealing with a black hole.
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:49.960]  It doesn't matter how much you shovel in there, you've got to have some kind of a disintegration
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:53.120]  ray that you fire at the black hole and get rid of it.
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:57.720]  But that's what I was going to say, Webster, is that you said five months ago when I interviewed
[2:16:57.720 --> 2:17:04.280]  you for the Obama deception that the more money we pump into the bailout, the worse
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:09.600]  it gets, and that's actually happened, loans are down, prices are up, foreclosures are
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:14.280]  accelerating, and the bankers are saying, put more in the black hole, that will fix
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:15.280]  it.
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:16.280]  And of course, it won't.
[2:17:16.280 --> 2:17:18.960]  So the answer, of course, is to shut down these banks.
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:24.720]  In other words, 16 out of the top 19 banks are insolvent and should be seized this Friday
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:29.000]  by Sheila Baer, and the fact that Sheila Baer, the head of the Federal Deposit and Insurance
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:35.320]  Corporation, has not seized Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:40.480]  of New York Mellon, and so on down the list, it's the top 16 out of 19, as far as I can
[2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:41.480]  see.
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:42.480]  That is a crime.
[2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:46.760]  Sheila Baer is violating the law, and this is simply illegal.
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:51.960]  She does shut down these little banks, tiny little banks in out-of-the-way places, rural
[2:17:51.960 --> 2:17:56.040]  America, out-of-the-way small banks.
[2:17:56.040 --> 2:18:03.280]  The difference though, Alex, is the Austrian school will, they may oppose what Obama does,
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:05.560]  but they still leave you with the depression.
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:13.520]  The American system of Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln, Kerry, Roosevelt, Kennedy, which I'm trying
[2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:17.960]  to represent, the American system actually deals with the depression and defeats the
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:18.960]  depression.
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:23.600]  One side can say, let's defeat Obama, that's fine, but let's go beyond defeating Obama.
[2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:27.720]  We've also got a real economic depression that we've got to deal with, so California
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:30.280]  could have a Tobentax, they could stop foreclosures.
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:34.840]  The other thing, how about a reviving a state-usury law?
[2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:40.160]  Many states, just about all of them, up until the Volcker era, had a limit on the amount
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:42.200]  of interest that you could charge within the state.
[2:18:42.200 --> 2:18:46.600]  This is clearly constitutional, and this was in place for many years.
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:52.040]  When Volcker began getting up to that 22% prime rate, which meant, for the average person,
[2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:56.800]  30, 35, or more percent, these laws were swept away.
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:04.320]  What I was going to ask you is, how did Obama's reform mean that you had a 15% rate on your
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:07.000]  credit card that went to 25?
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.400]  How was that a reform?
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:16.040]  Well, again, it's the corporate state, and again, I have to call it the only term for
[2:19:16.040 --> 2:19:21.040]  it is the Mussolini fascist corporate state, where corporation, it doesn't really refer
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:27.480]  to a modern corporation, it refers to a medieval guild, where you've got government, business,
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:32.800]  and labor together obeying the logic of the banks, above all, not the logic of government
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:34.840]  or the people, but of the banks.
[2:19:34.840 --> 2:19:41.120]  The whole universe is a food chain, feeding into them at the top, and they've got to destroy
[2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:46.280]  things to feed, so they're not builders, they're destroyers, they're parasites.
[2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:50.960]  We kind of sidetracked into the economy first.
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:55.840]  I want to go through the geopolitical structure, then calls, then the economy.
[2:19:55.840 --> 2:20:02.280]  Okay, we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarpoli on North Korea.
[2:20:02.280 --> 2:20:06.000]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:10.120]  problems facing the US and the world, and for the first time in their lives, they are
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:12.240]  feeling the need for preparedness.
[2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:16.720]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:18.720]  foods for almost 40 years.
[2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:23.400]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:28.120]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish, with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen
[2:20:28.120 --> 2:20:29.120]  packaging.
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:33.000]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  prices.
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:37.360]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve
[2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:39.480]  ships within five business days.
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:41.560]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:45.400]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.

[2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:07.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:12.120]  You've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:13.440]  us would like to see.
[2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:18.600]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[2:21:18.600 --> 2:21:20.000]  of the American people.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:24.360]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one of this election.
[2:21:24.360 --> 2:21:29.440]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:21:29.440 --> 2:21:37.560]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:41.120]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:48.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:15.840]  Webster Driven Tarbly is our guest.
[2:24:15.840 --> 2:24:17.960]  I don't want to start taking your calls coming up in the next segment.
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:22.080]  Webster, let's move quickly through what's happening in the rest of the world.
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:27.440]  Obviously, the globalists, the neocons, the neoliberals, the New World Order, the Anglo-American
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.120]  establishment, the global empire, they want crises worldwide.
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:38.520]  What do you see happening with North Korea right now and what do you see unfolding with
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:39.520]  that in the future?
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:46.760]  Well, North Korea has traditionally been used by the U.S. under Bush, let's say, to maintain
[2:24:46.760 --> 2:24:53.240]  imperial discipline in Northeast Asia, especially when the U.S. was getting ready to attack
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:55.600]  Iraq under Bush.
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:59.680]  You might have thought that when the cats away, the mice will play.
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:05.040]  That might have given Japan and South Korea the chance to do something independent on
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:06.040]  their own.
[2:25:06.040 --> 2:25:10.520]  So, in order to make sure that didn't happen, and this is actually an exercise in buck passing
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:16.720]  as the theoreticians call this, if you get a crisis going with North Korea, you terrified
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:23.240]  Japan, terrified South Korea, you force them back to the skirts of the U.S. nuclear umbrella
[2:25:23.240 --> 2:25:27.800]  to mix a metaphor, and you maintain control by having an artificial crisis.
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:33.840]  So, Kim Jong-il, the dear leader, has been a great asset for the U.S. in maintaining
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:40.140]  the imperial status quo in Northeast Asia, also scaring China, embarrassing China, creating
[2:25:40.140 --> 2:25:42.640]  all kinds of problems for China.
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:47.200]  And I think that's what they're doing again, as you mentioned, there have been all kinds
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:51.560]  of provocative maneuvers by the U.S. and probably South Korea.
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:57.640]  The South Korean leader right now seems to be much more of a hawk than the one before.
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:03.120]  You've got this, you know, every year they have this old chief focus lens exercise and
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:04.120]  so forth.
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:09.520]  Yeah, that happened a month ago, former presidents being thrown off cliffs, all submarines and
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:15.760]  ships, planes flying over North Korean airspace, right while the dear leader is giving power
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:22.080]  to the next hereditary thug, who's 20-something years old, perfect time to try to razz them.
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:28.680]  I think they've probably had, you know, some border violations and territorial water violations,
[2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:30.960]  at least the way they see it.
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:35.240]  They are paranoid, of course, these people are, you know, the true heirs of Stalin, I
[2:26:35.240 --> 2:26:40.520]  guess, in the modern era, so it's a paranoid regime, and it seems to me also that they
[2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:44.000]  must have been getting threats that the world public doesn't see.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:51.720]  In other words, some kind of a back channel, informal envoy, traveler who knows what, speaking
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:52.880]  for the U.S. government.
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:58.040]  Well, now they're saying you ship even artillery shells to any country, you know, every other
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:26:59.480]  nation can sell weapons.
[2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:04.080]  We're going to board your ships and take them, which is a Cuban Missile Crisis level provocation.
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:06.640]  So that's out on the open, throwing the gauntlet down.
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:10.360]  Right, and I think on this, they're right, that if you board one of their ships on the
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:15.440]  high seas, that's an act of piracy and war, and that is Casus Belli, in other words, if
[2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:19.040]  you want to take it that way, that can be the reason to get going with a war.
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:23.480]  I don't know if it's going to come to that, but look, go back to Joe Biden's famous speech
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:29.640]  in Seattle, 19th of October last year, where he said, after one year, we'll be hated because
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:32.880]  of our economic policies, and we're going to need your support then.
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:34.640]  That was the long perspective.
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:40.880]  The short perspective was, in the first six months, Obama will be tested with a manufactured
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:42.440]  international crisis.
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:48.760]  So six months takes us up to the 20th of July, so we've got a little bit less than a month
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:52.760]  for this to happen, and the hype now, of course, as everybody can see, is that there's going
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:58.840]  to be some kind of a missile test from North Korea on or around July 4th, that this is
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:00.320]  a greater front to the U.S.
[2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:06.680]  We've got the Patriot missile battalions, I guess, sent to Hawaii, demands for more
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:10.120]  ABM interceptors in Alaska and so forth.
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:14.720]  But in reality, North Korea has put out their international alert, as all governments do
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:19.720]  in the U.S. and Russia test missiles, saying we're firing a missile into this area in and
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:25.760]  around this date, nowhere near Hawaii it's come out, and it's on the death date of the
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:27.040]  first thug.
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:32.000]  They always test missiles, it turns out, on the death date, the day he died.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.880]  So this is more just manufactured crises.
[2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:40.720]  Right, and of course, it is their right to test missiles within certain parameters.
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:42.280]  Everybody else does it, right?
[2:28:42.280 --> 2:28:47.760]  Pakistan, India, Iran, everybody in the world has missiles, starting with the U.S., the
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:49.080]  Russians, the British, and the French.
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:57.000]  So it's a manufactured crisis, and I think the goal is always to maintain the substance
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:04.480]  of subjugation and subjection of Japan, especially South Korea, and also to embarrass China, just
[2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:09.120]  to create tremendous problems for China, because the worst things are in North Korea, the more
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:11.440]  refugees go across into China.
[2:29:11.440 --> 2:29:16.160]  The bigger the problem is for this very important Chinese province of Manchuria, which is right
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:22.920]  above North Korea, Harbin, and these places in China, big industrial centers.
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:29.880]  So it's a cynical crisis being artificially created by people like Biden.
[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:34.760]  And isn't it also for our consumption here domestically as well, not just to keep the
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:37.200]  entire area of Asia in fear?
[2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:42.120]  Yes, I think, and remember, with Obama, the door to false flag is now wide open, because
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:46.680]  the ruling elite thinks that he can accuse the country and be believed, which would not
[2:29:46.680 --> 2:29:47.680]  be.
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:50.400]  Exactly, let's cover false flag when we get back and take your phone calls, then get
[2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:51.800]  into the economy.
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:55.520]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.520 --> 2:30:01.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:05.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:30:05.680 --> 2:30:06.680]  this summer.
[2:30:06.680 --> 2:30:10.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:15.160]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:16.400]  allows you to have.
[2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:21.560]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:25.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:28.080]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:31.640]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:35.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:39.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:45.680]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[2:30:45.680 --> 2:30:50.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:31:02.200 --> 2:31:04.200]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:05.200]  Well you should.
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:09.720]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:27.680]  XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:31.800]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[2:31:31.800 --> 2:31:34.840]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:31:34.840 --> 2:31:39.240]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[2:31:39.240 --> 2:31:40.340]  attitudes.

[2:32:01.040 --> 2:32:02.680]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:06.520]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[2:32:06.520 --> 2:32:07.520]  important than ever.
[2:32:07.520 --> 2:32:10.240]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:13.240]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:32:13.240 --> 2:32:17.280]  You'll never have to go to the super-dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:32:17.280 --> 2:32:21.240]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:22.840]  the final equation but you.
[2:32:22.840 --> 2:32:27.080]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:31.440]  salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost
[2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:33.120]  of last year's grocery prices.

[2:32:56.960 --> 2:33:13.160]  The first step is getting storable food.

[2:33:29.640 --> 2:33:32.400]  I really appreciate Webster Carp was spending so much time with us today.
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:37.480]  We've got him till a half hour into the next 30 last minutes of the show.
[2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:40.240]  I'm going to do a big news blitz and play some important video clips and give you my
[2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:45.600]  take on why they're getting rid of the South Carolina governor at least destroying his
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:47.320]  political fortunes.
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:49.720]  So that is coming up as well.
[2:33:49.720 --> 2:33:54.720]  But I do want to get into false flag terror and then the economy with Webster Carp Lee
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:33:56.520]  in one moment.
[2:33:56.520 --> 2:34:01.680]  Before we do that, I have a few sponsors I want to thank who I believe in.
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:03.520]  I think are really great folks.
[2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:08.040]  And they also make this radio show possible.
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:10.920]  And one of those sponsors is Front Sight.
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:20.720]  This is the premier and the biggest in the country shooting training center for hand
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:26.280]  guns, rifles, shotguns, long distance, you name it.
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:31.480]  And if you want to learn how to shoot good at 600 yards, 1,000 yards, I said 6,000 yards
[2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:34.240]  the other day folks, I get numbers backwards.
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:35.680]  You want to go to Front Sight.
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:36.960]  It's frontsight.com.
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:38.720]  Just the front of a gun site.
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:43.320]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:46.000]  And look, I haven't know a lot of people went through their farms training.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:51.680]  They have their big jumbo course with the 30 stake and seal weapons permit with the
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:58.920]  free $500 to $600 spring filled handgun and your caliber you choose the five days of training.
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:03.360]  Everything for $1100.
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:04.360]  What is it?
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:05.440]  $1195.
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:10.480]  That would normally be about 4,000, but they've got a bunch of other free training online,
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:12.960]  a lot of great news, a free newsletter online.
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:15.520]  Just go check out frontsight.com.
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:20.600]  Frontsight.com.
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:22.280]  And they've also got their phone number on there.
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:23.640]  You know, I should get their phone number out.
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:26.840]  We had Dr. Ignatius Piazza on a few days ago.
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:27.840]  He gave that out.
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:32.280]  He said they got a lot of phone calls, but it's on the website frontsight.com.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:37.320]  Next time I plug it, I'll be sure to have the number for you too as well.
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:40.280]  And lastly, sponsor wise, mysolarbackup.com.
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:41.960]  Great little unit.
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:47.480]  It provides 1,800 watts of power, 1,800 watt power generator, a high efficiency solar panel
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:49.560]  designed to provide endless electricity.
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:53.360]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:55.080]  And this will power quite a few little things in your house.
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:59.000]  You can get multiple units and run more of your house or enough units, the whole house.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:04.440]  Great little proven solar panel itself, the little unit, and the plugs that go into it.
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:09.000]  It's just a great system, all part of being prepared, getting more and more off the grid.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  Mysolarbackup.com.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:18.600]  Our call told for you to get a brochure or to order it or to inquire 877-327-0365-877-327-0365.
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:21.280]  Mysolarbackup.com.
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:23.640]  And last but not least, let me digress now.
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:28.080]  Before we get into false flag terror, I wanted to briefly get Webster Griffon Tarpleys take
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:32.600]  on a few news items, and then we'll do false flag terror, then calls, and then the economy
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:34.040]  before he leaves us.
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:39.520]  But I wanted to bring this up because Webster really is a historian and a economist and
[2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:41.020]  author and journalist.
[2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:42.560]  I mean, he really is a great guy.
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:45.840]  And the more I research this stuff, the more I realize over the years how much Webster
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:47.880]  really does know.
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:51.320]  This is a crass plug.
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:55.880]  We carry both of his great books, the one about Barack Obama and his crime machine, and then
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:36:58.360]  the unauthorized biography of Obama.
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:01.000]  You really want the straight poop, as they say.
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.640]  This isn't rumor and you end up baloney.
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:06.400]  This is scholarly, all available at infoworks.com.
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:10.400]  But I'll put you on the spot, Webster, you're obviously in the Obama deception, the main
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:13.320]  narrative voice in there other than myself.
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:19.600]  But in game, I remember I gave a speech in Chicago the first time I physically met you
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:24.360]  have an interview on you for more than 10 years, and I remember you going, yes, excellent
[2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:29.560]  information and learning you had a great knowledge of the eugenics, model the idea of these people.
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:35.520]  The establishment is all moving at once right now, as if they know their window of opportunity
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:37.520]  is closing.
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:38.520]  And they're moving with eugenics.
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:42.640]  They're moving on one child policies worldwide, you know, getting rid of tax credits for kids
[2:37:42.640 --> 2:37:45.280]  and even trying to tax having children.
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:52.040]  They are launching programs of climate cops training children to tattle on their parents
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.960]  in the United States in Australia and Canada.
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:56.120]  It's in the news today.
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:37:59.600]  Climate cops to find wasteful homeowners and businesses.
[2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:04.920]  Austin's already setting this up as home audits has nothing to do with energy.
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:09.720]  Literally this commissariat, I guess, would be the best way to describe it, but it's
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:10.720]  not communist.
[2:38:10.720 --> 2:38:16.720]  It's like a fascistic commissariat or political officer and they have the green police.
[2:38:16.720 --> 2:38:21.600]  In fact, here's a shot of that for folks on prisonplanet.tv.
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:26.680]  Green police and that as people lose their jobs, it won't be an FDR.
[2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:32.760]  Build dams, build roads, build rest stops, build power plants.
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:37.040]  It will be literally tattling on neighbors, spying on people, watching surveillance camera
[2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:38.040]  banks.
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:41.000]  That's all in the news now.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:46.240]  And the carbon tax, Al Gore, can you spend a few minutes on that then we'll go to calls
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:48.080]  and then get into false flag and the economy.
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:54.600]  But I mean, the Federal Reserve Banker Reform Bill is a Federal Reserve can seize anything
[2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:56.760]  connected to any part of the economy.
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:38:59.960]  Just the complete end of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:01.160]  We thought Bush was bad.
[2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:06.120]  It's just a progression, an evolution from bad to worse, where the feds are announcing
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:08.320]  they're taking over the entire water supply.
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:09.320]  No more states rights.
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:11.320]  They're announcing green taxes.
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:17.440]  They're announcing total takeovers, banking takeovers, Homeland Security reports saying
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:20.200]  all gun owners and veterans are terrorists.
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:26.360]  I mean, it's so over the top, I'm having trouble processing it all.
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:31.120]  Are they trying to just bum rushes like a human wave attack of tyranny, where we may
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:34.680]  shoot down five or six of the things, but three or four will make it.
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:40.360]  And any one of these is like a hydrogen bomb being brought into Liberty's bosom.
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:44.720]  I would certainly say that the one of the main goals of Obama from the very beginning
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:51.960]  is to undermine the rationality and the political will of the American people.
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:56.960]  In other words, we have this very interesting thing, a woman who worked for Obama by the
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:03.800]  name of Sarah, last October, came out with her confession, and it was late October.
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:08.320]  And she said that the conscious goal inside the Obama campaign is to make you feel like
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:14.160]  your world is collapsing around you, that there's no hope, and that all the forces that you
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:21.040]  look to oppose the things that Obama stands for, that these forces were all simply collapsing,
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:25.080]  that they were all going over to Obama, giving up, and so forth.
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:33.040]  And in the books that you've mentioned, I compare this to certain passages of Mein Kampf
[2:40:33.040 --> 2:40:39.200]  by Hitler, where he says, the main purpose of my rallies is to undermine the free will
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:40.200]  of people.
[2:40:40.200 --> 2:40:46.000]  In other words, to subject them to another will and force them to do what the dictator
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  wants.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:51.040]  To switch on the reptilian brain, the primitive brain, to put you into a gut gut.
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:55.480]  I don't know about reptilian, but it's an appeal to irrationality, right?
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:56.480]  It's certainly an appeal.
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:00.960]  I don't mean that as reptilian in a David Ikean way, I mean the primitive areas of the
[2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:01.960]  brain.
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:05.040]  Yeah, well, irrationality, which I think is culturally there.
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:09.880]  I don't know about the physiological basis of irrationality, but there's certainly
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:11.800]  plenty of cultural irrationality.
[2:41:11.800 --> 2:41:13.560]  You're a smart guy, Webster.
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:18.200]  You know about the area of the brain that has aggression and sexual drive and all that?
[2:41:18.200 --> 2:41:21.240]  I mean, that's called medically the reptilian complex.
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:25.400]  Yeah, I wouldn't want to get into the idea of trying to explain human consciousness based
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:31.240]  on materialist or physiological basis, because it seems to me that most of this is culturally
[2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:32.240]  and psychologically.
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:33.240]  No, I agree.
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:35.600]  It's more complex than that, but go ahead.
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:38.840]  Whatever it is, Obama is appealing to the dark side.
[2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:46.040]  It's for sure, so Obama is an appeal to irrationality with the goal of making people the captives
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:52.040]  and the thralls of irrational drives and therefore depriving them of their reason, because human
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:53.720]  reason is the point of all this, right?
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:42:00.680]  That's what we want to, we want to have a world where human reason plays the larger
[2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:07.240]  role at least, and instead what they want is to have irrationality, unreason, and insanity
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:08.240]  rule the roost.
[2:42:08.240 --> 2:42:11.160]  And I would call them totalitarian liberals.
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:16.880]  Totalitarian liberal is a term that was coined for John Maynard Keynes, Lord Keynes, during
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:22.960]  the 1930s, and this was the way the British ran their show during the 1930s and into World
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  War II.
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:28.000]  Totalitarian liberalism, meaning that they control every aspect, right, the stuff that
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:32.320]  you're going through, at the same time, it's the bankers who rule.
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:37.440]  In other words, the whole society is revamped according to what these bankrupt zombie bankers
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:38.440]  then and now.
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:39.920]  Well, let me stop you again.
[2:42:39.920 --> 2:42:42.720]  Can you comment on the Malthusian view?
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:44.920]  She goes to China, Nancy Pelosi.
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:49.680]  Nancy Pelosi goes to China and says, everything you buy, sell, and do, everything you own,
[2:42:49.680 --> 2:42:52.000]  it's all going to be chronicled by the state.
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:53.560]  I mean, they mean business.
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:54.760]  This is neo-futilism.
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:43:03.640]  This is a system of serfdom, economic degradation, as a weaponized tool to keep you at a subsistence,
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:04.640]  subservience level.
[2:43:04.640 --> 2:43:08.720]  Certainly, and that's where I was headed, was the totalitarian liberalism.
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:13.920]  Once you say Keynes, then you have to point out that the father of Keynes is Malthus.
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:18.280]  In other words, Keynes is somebody who comes on the scene saying, I am an economist in
[2:43:18.280 --> 2:43:22.880]  the tradition of Malthus, and once you've said Malthus, you've also said Darwin, and
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:28.200]  by that I mean the ugly side of Darwin, which is the main side, that Darwin, when you think
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:33.520]  about social Darwinism, right, the survival of the fittest and the struggle for survival
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.720]  in society, that has always been the most brutal reactionaries who come forward with
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:39.720]  that.
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:43.520]  You could even make an argument that Hitler and Mussolini are unthinkable without Darwin.
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:49.760]  So today, because of the factional situation inside the US, you have left liberals coming
[2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:52.320]  forward saying, Darwin is our man.
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:54.040]  Darwin is a charlatan.
[2:43:54.040 --> 2:44:00.320]  Darwin, especially what I'm referring to, is the blind watchmaker side of Darwin, the
[2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:04.040]  insistence that everything in the universe is purely by chance.
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:05.040]  I don't think it is.
[2:44:05.040 --> 2:44:07.480]  And that's the way to neutralize our political will.
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:11.960]  They always say, oh, it's just neurons, there are no morals, but then the establishment
[2:44:11.960 --> 2:44:18.840]  has its own dark, bloody, culling morals of the destruction economy, bulldozed cities
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:21.480]  instead of build starships to Alpha Centuries.
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:22.480]  Exactly.
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:28.640]  And I think that is the ultimate appeal to irrationality, to say total predestination,
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:31.200]  that with everything you do is fated and predetermined.
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:32.200]  Well, that's the rationality.
[2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:37.360]  Well, it's a control freak religion to overturn the entire system and just haugedly kill
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:42.480]  everybody because that means you win as you sit on a pile of skulls.
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:44.000]  And that would be Al Gore, I guess.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:48.960]  Al Gore and these theoreticians of global warming, which is a hoax of fraud and it's
[2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:49.960]  transparent.
[2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:55.000]  Again, as a historian, I can tell, I don't need climatologists, their charlatans when
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:56.440]  it comes to this stuff.
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:45:01.880]  The current variations of temperature are well within the observed historical range.
[2:45:01.880 --> 2:45:07.320]  If we go from the medieval warm period, about 1100 when you had various kinds of grapes
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:13.520]  and vines growing in Newfoundland and even in Iceland and Norway, you have wine culture
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:15.960]  going on in the North Atlantic.
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:18.400]  That's a whole lot warmer than what we have now.
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:24.960]  And then you've got this little ice age around 1600, 1650, maybe up to 1700, when the Northern
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:29.200]  European ports were blocked with ice, huge icebergs came floating down.
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:33.880]  But let's go back 9000 years to the beginning of the Bronze Age when it was even hotter.
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:34.880]  Precisely.
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:40.000]  So I think we're well within the historically observed range and you can even, you know,
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:45.400]  you can go into the CO2, but the German chemist of the 19th century had records about that,
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:49.640]  too, and we're well within those parameters as well.
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:55.200]  What they're expressing is the class consciousness of the Anglo-American banking elite.
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:45:57.640]  Very interesting observation.
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:03.000]  Any prediction of the end of the world has a definite class content.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.760]  In other words, if somebody's saying the world is going to end in such and such a way, you
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:09.240]  look at that, that reflects interests.
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:14.440]  It reflects interests of groups, of classes of people like oligarchs, bankers, and so
[2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:15.920]  forth, and that's Gore.
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:21.160]  Gore is obviously, his ego ideal is Prince Charles, he's very much under the influence
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:25.960]  of Prince Philip, he thinks that he's an American aristocrat, he'd like to join the
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:30.320]  title, Nobility and Feudal Oligarchy of Europe.
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:34.960]  And their basic idea has always been that the world is overpopulated, nothing new.
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:41.320]  The argument that they had for the Trojan War, 1000 BC, the principal oligarchical centers
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:47.000]  like the cult of Apollo at Delphi, were saying, the reason we have to have the Trojan War
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:49.320]  is that the world is overpopulated.
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:53.120]  There are too many people pressing down on the breast of Mother Earth.
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:54.840]  So nothing is new.
[2:46:54.840 --> 2:47:01.080]  The oligarchs thought that the world was overpopulated in the year 1000 BC, and now 3,000 years later
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:04.400]  they're coming with the same idiotic nonsense.
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:05.400]  If you take...
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:09.560]  But it's not idiotic if they're going to control resources as a tool of tyranny.
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:11.160]  They don't believe this stuff.
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:13.800]  And they cynically know it's a way to control people.
[2:47:13.800 --> 2:47:17.280]  That's why they'll go ahead and do all the other dangerous things they are doing environmentally.
[2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:20.280]  Well, you know, you have to look at individual cases.
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:23.160]  I've been a gore, it seems to me, probably does believe this stuff.
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:24.160]  Oh, really?
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:26.160]  Even though he owns the main carpet credit company?
[2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:27.160]  Yeah.
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:33.760]  I discovered that Gore was the owner of Love Canal, in other words, Gore had a share in
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:36.400]  this worst toxic waste site of the 1970s.
[2:47:36.400 --> 2:47:37.400]  Love Canal.
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:38.400]  Yes.
[2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:40.920]  He's the majority owner of Occidental Petroleum.
[2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:41.920]  Yeah.
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:42.920]  So they have double think.
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:44.240]  I suppose you can call this double think.
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:51.760]  In other words, oligarchs are of always hated technology, they hate science, they hate progress,
[2:47:51.760 --> 2:47:57.160]  and they've got to find a way that defines the rest of humanity as somehow bestial and
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:47:58.160]  inferior to them.
[2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:01.200]  Because the oligarchs problem is always, why should you be an oligarch?
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:05.680]  Why should you rule and not somebody else that's smarter, you know, more moral, more
[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:08.240]  honest, and just generally more desirable than you?
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:12.560]  So they've got to say, well, we're the oligarchs, Pelosi summed this up once.
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:18.040]  People camped out in front of her house during the Iraq war, and she said, we are leaders,
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:19.880]  you are mere advocates.
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:21.960]  You're only agitating for this or that idea.
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:24.920]  We take the responsibility of ruling.
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:27.720]  So we have a bankrupt ruling class.
[2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:28.720]  I think this is important.
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:31.360]  It also gets into discussion of what did they know.
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:35.680]  If you look at the endowments of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, and MIT, they have lost
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:38.160]  between one quarter and one third.
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:41.160]  The Harvard case is something that's going to be in the news now.
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:47.080]  At the end of the month, the June 30th, coming up now, we will know the losses of the Harvard
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:48.800]  endowment, which is the largest one.
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:52.720]  It's going to be 25%, 30%, might be 35%.
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:54.320]  How did they lose all the money?
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:49:00.320]  When Larry Summers, who is now running the economic policy for Obama, when Larry Summers,
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:04.360]  the woman-hater, remember him, right, women can't do science, Larry Summers, president
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:09.240]  of Harvard, said to the people managing the endowment, put the endowment into derivatives,
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:14.080]  derivatives, derivatives, and naturally, when that blew up, there were the losses.
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:20.600]  Now, the question is, did Larry Summers, as an oligarch and a financier, know what he
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:21.600]  was doing?
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:22.600]  I would say he didn't.
[2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:27.360]  He wouldn't have put all the Harvard endowment into derivatives if he had actually realized
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:29.080]  that the bubble was coming down.
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:34.000]  I think the problem of the oligarchy is they believe the world is overpopulated.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.880]  They hate technology, and they love bubbles.
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:39.280]  Every time there's an economic bubble, they run.
[2:49:39.280 --> 2:49:40.440]  It's like a heroin addiction.
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:45.280]  They can't help themselves, and everything else they do is subordinated to this idea
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:46.840]  that we've got to have bubble.
[2:49:46.840 --> 2:49:48.160]  We've got to have a bubble economy.
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:52.320]  We've got to have globalization, and this is just the most recent form of things going
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:53.320]  back to the bubble.
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:54.320]  How do you see happening?
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:49:58.880]  Because we're going to come back and go to calls, we've got to stop you.
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:00.600]  How do you see this unfolding, though?
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:07.120]  If things aren't going well for them, but they've still got the force of their mass
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:11.720]  moving them forward, grinding over us, how does this all end?
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:17.520]  Well, the situation of the U.S. is desperate, and we've got a thermodynamic breakdown going
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  on.
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:22.240]  If you look at this crash on the Washington subway line, nine dead on the subway that
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:27.720]  I take many days a week, that's scary in the same area.
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:32.040]  But this should be the area where they keep everything nice for the imperialist bureaucrats
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:34.960]  in southern Maryland.
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:39.520]  They've had two big waterman breaks, so we're approaching the point of physical breakdown,
[2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  and that's got to be addressed.
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:44.440]  Somebody's got to come out and say, we've got to rebuild everything, marshal plans for
[2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:45.440]  the United States.
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.160]  But the bankers don't care.
[2:50:48.160 --> 2:50:51.160]  They want to destroy cities with bulldozers, and they're all going to live in palaces
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:52.160]  offshore.
[2:50:52.160 --> 2:50:53.160]  We fight them.
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:54.160]  Look at me, though.
[2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:55.160]  We've got to fight.
[2:50:55.160 --> 2:50:59.320]  We've got to get rid of the bulls, and the burn to get into the stage terror, and the
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:00.320]  economy later.
[2:51:00.320 --> 2:51:01.320]  Stay with me, Webster.
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:04.680]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[2:51:04.680 --> 2:51:10.280]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[2:51:10.280 --> 2:51:14.840]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:15.840]  are synthetic.
[2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:17.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:51:17.240 --> 2:51:20.960]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:25.480]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[2:51:25.480 --> 2:51:26.480]  and mucous membranes.

[2:52:06.600 --> 2:52:08.080]  struggling to make payments.

[2:53:01.680 --> 2:53:06.720]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:10.400]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:15.440]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:19.000]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:23.560]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives

[2:53:32.200 --> 2:53:33.200]  healthier I feel.
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:35.880]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:18.440]  Alright I'm going to take 10 calls or so for Webster then we're going to get into false
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:19.440]  flag terror.
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:25.600]  One ace in the hole, this huge police state, open martial law, open forced inoculations,
[2:54:25.600 --> 2:54:32.160]  swine flu hysteria, they're only intensifying the fear mongering and hyping.
[2:54:32.160 --> 2:54:34.200]  That's what's so important about all this.
[2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:36.200]  So that's coming up Webster Griffith Tarpoli.
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:39.560]  Right now let's go to Warren in California.
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:41.560]  Warren thanks for holding her on the ear.
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:44.480]  Okay Alex, I have two things I want to mention.
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:49.520]  I believe it was Sunday night on coast to coast that George, that set in for George Norrie
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:57.120]  from Las Vegas, his news at the beginning of the show, he mentioned that two Japanese
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:05.240]  individuals were apprehended on an Italian border and they had $120 billion in US treasuries.
[2:55:05.240 --> 2:55:10.760]  No, no that was in Bloomberg and Associated Press, that is true, so we'll ask Tarpoli
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:11.760]  about that.
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:12.760]  Go ahead.
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:18.480]  I have no particular opinion, a lot of money, but Switzerland is a paradise of flight capitals,
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:22.320]  so I don't know, is that really that new?
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:23.760]  The amount is rather large.
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:26.520]  And what's the other point?
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:27.920]  What's the other point, caller?
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:33.960]  Yes, I have an article from 1983 of the San Francisco Chronicle, I don't have it right
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:36.720]  here with me, it's about 400 miles away in storage.
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:37.720]  That's okay.
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:47.400]  But the article says the feds ready to distribute private individuals' property and what it
[2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:56.840]  was when they had the banking holiday in 1933, they gathered up all stuff that was in safety
[2:55:56.840 --> 2:55:58.840]  deposit boxes all over the United States.
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:03.400]  Yeah, they made folks turn their gold in and then they gave them paper money back and then
[2:56:03.400 --> 2:56:04.960]  a year later double the price.
[2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:10.840]  They are talking about taking private property, seizing pensions to feed that into the bankers.
[2:56:10.840 --> 2:56:12.960]  So let me ask Webster about that.
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:21.720]  Yeah, this new Federal Reserve, quote, reform bill, openly, I'm sure you've seen it, Webster,
[2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:25.760]  says they can take over from a hot dog stand to a car dealership.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:33.240]  Obama, it's admitted, if you give millions of Democratic Party, he'll let your GM dealership
[2:56:33.240 --> 2:56:38.440]  stay open, but if you don't make the payoffs, they give it to somebody else or shut it down,
[2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:42.680]  even though it has an incredible value, they take the franchise.
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:43.680]  Give us your take on that.
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:49.880]  Well, that is the corporate state, the Mussolini-Fascist corporate state as imposed now by the Wall
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:53.840]  Street banking community, where the Wall Street banking community takes over the government
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:54.840]  and runs it.
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:56:59.000]  Now, of course, in the middle of that, somebody like Obama's got to maintain his own political
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  interest.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:02.520]  I would just point to this Federal Reserve question, though.
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:08.240]  The point of Obama's regulation is that the Fed becomes the regulator of systemic risk,
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:14.440]  and as you say, can therefore argue that the hot dog stand poses systemic risk to the derivatives
[2:57:14.440 --> 2:57:17.440]  bubble and the banking community.
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:19.400]  That got a very bad reception in Congress.
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:24.360]  A lot of Democrats in the House who don't like that one, I saw, I think, Brad Sherman
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:28.080]  of California was one of them, was that he didn't like it.
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.480]  And now you've got this thing, Congressman Issa, also of California, has come out with
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:39.320]  this thing about Bernanke engaging in threats and blackmail against another villain, another
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:43.680]  finance oligarch, Lewis, the head of Bank of America.
[2:57:43.680 --> 2:57:48.080]  And while we've been talking today, there have been hearings in the House banking committee
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:53.560]  where Bernanke has been treated rougher than I've ever seen a Fed chairman get treated
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:56.840]  by a whole bunch of congressmen, including Republicans and Democrats.
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:02.600]  Sort of conservative Republicans, anti-Wall Street Republicans, if you will, and at the
[2:58:02.600 --> 2:58:07.280]  same time, sort of these new deal Democrats getting together to beat up Bernanke.
[2:58:07.280 --> 2:58:13.200]  I think now the political vulnerability of the Federal Reserve is probably greater than
[2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:14.200]  it ever was.
[2:58:14.200 --> 2:58:19.520]  I think the auditing of the Fed is a great idea that should be done, and then go on, though,
[2:58:19.520 --> 2:58:24.120]  because that will then have more scandals, time to have new peccary hearings against
[2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:25.120]  the Fed.
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:29.600]  All right, stay there, Webster, we're going to come back, I want you to elaborate on,
[2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:35.360]  if you audit the Fed, that begins the ending of the Fed or the federalization of it.
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:39.400]  This has never been federal, folks, and we'll be right back with Webster Griffin Tarbley
[2:58:39.400 --> 2:58:42.400]  in one minute.

[2:59:54.120 --> 3:00:13.240]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:14.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:19.200]  We're talking to Webster, Griffin Tarpoli, continuing with your phone calls, having gotten
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:23.960]  into the ace in the hole the establishment has, staged crises.
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:29.440]  So it's all coming up in the next 30 minutes or so with our guests and we've got some other
[3:00:29.440 --> 3:00:32.280]  video clips and news I want to cover after he leaves us.
[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:40.400]  We're going to go to Johann, Anthony, Annie, and others.
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:41.800]  Robert, in just a moment.
[3:00:41.800 --> 3:00:44.120]  Webster, you're talking about ending the Fed.
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:49.440]  This is so criminal, so obviously corrupt, it's coming out that Congress is subpoenaing
[3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:54.960]  over Bank of America, ordering them to buy up different assets, different brokerage firms.
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:01:01.000]  Because the big mega bankers at the Volcker or Kissinger or David Rockefeller level, they're
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  always in the news.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:07.440]  In fact, Volcker's in the news today in Bloomberg at press conferences blaming the CEOs, blaming
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:13.360]  the brokerage firm heads, who aren't they just hired captains or mercenaries for the
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:16.400]  larger investment groups?
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:21.640]  And isn't this the elite trying to throw a few little bankers or middle-sized bankers
[3:01:21.640 --> 3:01:28.660]  to the wolves to throw the wolves off of their trail or the bloodhounds off of their trail?
[3:01:28.660 --> 3:01:31.120]  What's going on here?
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:37.400]  The fascist corporate state, and it is a government-sponsored compulsory cartel.
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:42.320]  It obeys the logic of finance, right, of Wall Street in this case.
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:47.760]  A government-sponsored compulsory cartel for the purpose of driving down production,
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:51.560]  you see that in Detroit, factories close, driving down wages.
[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:57.160]  The UAW has had to eat tremendous losses, right, they've been driven down to sweatshop
[3:01:57.160 --> 3:01:58.160]  wage levels.
[3:01:58.160 --> 3:02:01.360]  So you're going to drive down production, you're going to drive down wages, and you're
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:08.440]  going to prop up the fictitious derivatives and the other fictitious pieces of paper capital
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:10.000]  that are floating around.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:16.640]  Notice the big robbery in the Detroit business with General Motors in particular was a $6
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:24.000]  billion payment in cash was made to Citibank and JP Morgan Chase while the UAW, instead
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:29.040]  of getting guaranteed health care from General Motors, they got some shares of General Motors
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:31.600]  stock, which I think are likely to be worthless.
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:36.880]  So the risk, the risk was shifted off of General Motors and shifted on to the UAW.
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:42.640]  Another good example, the people who say that Obama is helping the unions must be standing
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:46.920]  on their heads because he's doing the opposite, he's destroyed the UAW, he's driven down
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:52.080]  their wages, he's taken away their benefits, he's looted their health care funds, and he's
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:54.120]  going to do the same thing with the teachers union.
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:59.080]  So Obama is a consummate union buster, so much so that a lot of people can't even see
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:04.160]  what he's doing, but the UAW basically voted themselves out of existence as any kind of
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:05.320]  an industrial union.
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:07.800]  But this is all part of the corporate state.
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:11.120]  You've got to create a cartel, it means you've got to discipline the others.
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:14.760]  A lot of little fish are going to get fed to a lot of big fish.
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:20.160]  The winners are picked by the government based on, well, JP Morgan Chase is the winner, Goldman
[3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:25.520]  Sachs is the winner, a city bank looks more and more like a loser, Bank of America probably
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:30.000]  a loser, and naturally the squawking here from Wall Street is from the people who were
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:31.520]  on the losing end.
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:37.120]  Look at Washington Mutual Bank, savings bank, fed to JP Morgan Chase, a lot of people very,
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:42.520]  very upset about that, or Bank of America told, you are going to eat the losses of Merrill
[3:03:42.520 --> 3:03:43.520]  Lynch, right?
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:48.520]  This is all the disciplining that goes on in, again, the fascist corporate state because
[3:03:48.520 --> 3:03:51.240]  that's the only way to describe it.
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:58.000]  So if they are unopposed, would they reduce us to stone age running around in link cloths
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:04.280]  while they're in armored compounds and in high technology reservations away from us?
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:09.080]  I mean, because that's what they describe in their white papers, while they, I guess,
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:13.800]  have hunter killer robots out, like Zardos hunting us down or something?
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:18.500]  Well, I mean, it may eventually come to that, but what you can see right now with the
[3:04:18.500 --> 3:04:19.500]  Obama's, the following.
[3:04:19.500 --> 3:04:23.840]  Now, it's being somewhat sarcastic, but my point is, I mean, is there just no end to
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:24.840]  their thieving?
[3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:26.840]  They will destroy all of civilization for themselves.
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:33.240]  Again, the $1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble is a black hole, and you can shovel all the
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:37.240]  austerity loot and sacrifices and cuts into that you want.
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:42.160]  It's still going to be bankrupt, so that means they're going to gouge Medicare and Medicaid,
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:46.560]  and then, as Orsac, they're going to go on and start reducing your social security pension,
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:48.680]  which for a lot of people is going to be the only thing they have.
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:51.360]  Yeah, because none of the taxes you pay will go to any services now.
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:54.440]  It's all to debt, created out of nothing by the bankers.
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:55.440]  Stay there.
[3:04:55.440 --> 3:04:56.440]  And derivatives bailouts.
[3:04:56.440 --> 3:04:57.440]  Yeah, derivatives bailouts.
[3:04:57.440 --> 3:05:00.600]  Going to come back and blitz through the phone calls on the other side of Webster Griffin
[3:05:00.600 --> 3:05:01.600]  Tarbling.
[3:05:01.600 --> 3:05:05.160]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[3:05:05.160 --> 3:05:08.360]  in the Truth Movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:12.560]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[3:05:12.560 --> 3:05:14.480]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:19.440]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food, his Editor's Choice Award,
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:21.920]  or Best Superfood of 2009.
[3:05:21.920 --> 3:05:26.480]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners.
[3:05:26.480 --> 3:05:31.280]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[3:05:31.280 --> 3:05:34.080]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:39.160]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the
[3:05:39.160 --> 3:05:40.160]  immune system.
[3:05:40.160 --> 3:05:44.840]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great, and take it from me, folks, it really does taste
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:45.840]  great.
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:47.280]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:59.640]  Go to www.enerfod.com, that's www.enerfod.com, or just click on their banner on infowars.com
[3:05:59.640 --> 3:06:01.320]  for special pricing.
[3:06:01.320 --> 3:06:05.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:06:05.720 --> 3:06:06.720]  this summer.
[3:06:06.720 --> 3:06:10.640]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:06:10.640 --> 3:06:15.200]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:16.440]  allows you to have.
[3:06:16.440 --> 3:06:21.600]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:25.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:28.120]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:06:28.120 --> 3:06:31.680]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:06:31.680 --> 3:06:35.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:39.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:44.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:06:44.040 --> 3:06:45.720]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[3:06:45.720 --> 3:06:52.080]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:02.080]  toll-free, 877-327-0365.
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:05.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:08.640]  You're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm.
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:10.360]  How much ammunition do you want?
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:15.960]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:07:15.960 --> 3:07:17.440]  Food is your only ammunition.
[3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:18.680]  How much do you want?
[3:07:18.680 --> 3:07:19.680]  When do you want it?
[3:07:19.680 --> 3:07:21.680]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:07:21.680 --> 3:07:22.840]  When will you need it?
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:24.960]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:07:24.960 --> 3:07:26.280]  Will there be any food?
[3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:27.760]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:31.880]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:07:31.880 --> 3:07:33.040]  and be immunized?
[3:07:33.040 --> 3:07:36.800]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:07:36.800 --> 3:07:40.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:41.640]  How much will you need?
[3:07:41.640 --> 3:07:42.640]  We don't know.
[3:07:42.640 --> 3:07:43.640]  How much do you want?
[3:07:43.640 --> 3:07:44.640]  All you can get.
[3:07:44.640 --> 3:07:45.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:48.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:56.360]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:56.360 --> 3:08:03.080]  Find that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:08:03.080 --> 3:08:09.640]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:14.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:14.840 --> 3:08:26.440]  All right, Webster Gryffindorpley is our guest, I want you to hurry through your phone call
[3:08:26.440 --> 3:08:34.240]  so I can get into separate from Webster's solutions and ideas he's got, where he sees
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:40.560]  them taking us and politically as a realist, how he sees things unfolding.
[3:08:40.560 --> 3:08:48.480]  Because I agree with him, without some type of stage crises or terror attacks, Obama is
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:56.200]  a political commodity that is losing value by the day and you will see an acceleration.
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:09:01.320]  We've seen him lose, depending on the poll gauge, 20 to 30 plus points the last three
[3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:06.000]  months and we see an acceleration in that loss.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  So that's important.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:08.160]  That's coming up in a few minutes.
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:11.600]  Right now, let's talk to Johan in Europe.
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:14.200]  Thanks for holding Johan.
[3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:18.520]  I would like Webster Gryffindorpley to explain how the state of Israel could influence the
[3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:24.040]  country of Cyprus to prevent Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney's second attempt to break
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:26.600]  the illegal blockade of Gaza.
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:32.800]  Tonight she's going to be on microburrow what really happened, as even before the boat had
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:35.840]  docked at the Cyprus port.
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:40.760]  There was an official waiting there with papers saying that it was unseaworthy, even before
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:43.360]  he had even taken a look at it.
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:48.960]  How could this little country have so much influence on Cyprus, which is-
[3:09:48.960 --> 3:09:50.360]  Well, I'm envious of Mike.
[3:09:50.360 --> 3:09:55.040]  I know Cynthia McKinney and people always say, oh, she'll come on and then it always falls
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:09:58.800]  through, but I'm going to get an interview set up with her, but I appreciate your call.
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:03.880]  Yeah, Israel ramming her boat, she's trying to bring medical supplies in to Gaza, and
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:05.560]  then I did see a blurb about.
[3:10:05.560 --> 3:10:09.800]  Now they won't even let her into Cyprus, and it's pretty obvious the United States and
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:15.520]  Israeli lobby is very, very strong over the police state that is Cyprus, but let's get
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:16.920]  Webster's comment on that.
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:22.400]  Well, I certainly condemn the Israeli blockade of Gaza, and I condemn what the Israelis did
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:23.400]  there.
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:28.040]  They killed about 1,500 people, and you didn't see the U.S. media screaming about 1,500
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:34.360]  people dead, as they have now about much smaller numbers, as far as we know, in Iran.
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:39.600]  And I would also point out that what Obama and Netanyahu are talking about is not really
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:44.600]  a two-state solution, but it's actually a kind of Bantu stand where there would be a
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:51.600]  limited sovereignty or maybe autonomy, self-administration, Bantu stand for the Palestinians.
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:57.440]  I think what you've got to have is an independent Palestinian state with real sovereignty, but
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:00.680]  again, none of that will work without an economic development program for the area.
[3:11:00.680 --> 3:11:05.480]  There's got to be a Marshall plan for the entire Middle East, or nothing else will work.
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:07.880]  And that would have been done 60 years ago.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:09.280]  All this fighting wouldn't have happened.
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:15.640]  The people are in starvation level, and you're going to continue to have incredible conflict,
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.400]  which is what the bomb makers, which is what the defense establishment wants.
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:23.400]  They love a few hot zones they can dump weapons systems into.
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:25.560]  I mean, this is really just business.
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:31.480]  And of course, Obama's Cairo speech had nothing in terms of economics for the Palestinians,
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:35.560]  and the big, you know, the unemployment in these areas is 50, 60 percent.
[3:11:35.560 --> 3:11:36.560]  It's out of this world.
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:42.080]  But Webster, Webster, doesn't that fit, though, with the Obama model, if he says, I'm going
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:47.080]  to be friendly to the Middle East and Persia, and then they launch the CIA destabilization?
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:49.200]  Whatever he says, it's the opposite.
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:11:54.080]  So he does the emotional salve, so there's not a blowback on the West, and so there's
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:11:58.080]  a debate about whether we did this or not, when obviously they did.
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:11:59.080]  Go ahead.
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:04.720]  The idea with Obama is he's trying to appear to do a favor for the Arabs and the Palestinians.
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:06.680]  He's really not doing anything.
[3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:11.600]  With the gold, and abusing them as dopes, again, kamikaze puppets against China, cut
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:16.400]  off the oil, Russia, pick a fight with Russia any way you can.
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:18.040]  So it's not a good deal.
[3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:19.560]  It's pure demagogy.
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  It's more of that trickery and dissembling that we've talked about as the hallmark of
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:24.560]  Obama.
[3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:25.560]  Absolutely.
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:26.560]  Okay.
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:29.560]  Let's go to Anthony in California.
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:31.560]  Anthony, you're on the air.
[3:12:31.560 --> 3:12:32.560]  Hey, Alex.
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:33.800]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[3:12:33.800 --> 3:12:36.080]  I got seven questions I'd like to ask.
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:40.400]  First of all, I heard you guys talking about bulldozing cities and towns in California.
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:42.280]  I live in California.
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:43.280]  What can I do?
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:47.080]  The second thing is I live on a naval base where military laws every day, you're not
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:48.560]  allowed to own a gun.
[3:12:48.560 --> 3:12:54.160]  Third of all, how do I make a big impact that's wake up more people, influence the government
[3:12:54.160 --> 3:12:55.160]  with no money?
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:59.160]  Fourth of all, how do I arm myself for under $20 if I can?
[3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:04.640]  Fifth of all, front-side training, unfortunately, is far too expensive for me and my father.
[3:13:04.640 --> 3:13:05.640]  It's $1,000.
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:07.960]  My dad doesn't even make that much.
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:08.960]  What can I do?
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:15.120]  Number six, if North Korea strikes with a nuclear weapon and it's total martial law
[3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:19.160]  and the police come and try to take me and my dad away, what can I do?
[3:13:19.160 --> 3:13:21.080]  And fifth, I want to make a comment.
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:26.120]  There was an episode of a show called Star Trek Enterprise where there was this Terran
[3:13:26.120 --> 3:13:32.000]  Empire, a parallel universe version of the Federation of Planets, that basically everything
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:34.880]  they're doing now, the New World Order, is what they do in that show.
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:42.280]  It's got an earth with a logo, a sword where the handle is above the north pole and the
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:45.280]  blade tip is below.
[3:13:45.280 --> 3:13:47.840]  All right, let me try to answer that.
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:51.480]  I didn't even have time to write all those questions.
[3:13:51.480 --> 3:13:53.360]  You ask about how to get firearms training.
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:58.880]  There are a lot of free manuals online, frontside.com has some.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:04.040]  If you can afford a firearm, I would suggest for training something like a single shot
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:05.040]  22.
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:07.080]  You can get decent ones for like $100.
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:09.280]  Go out, shooting range.
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:14.720]  22 rounds are very inexpensive, learn how to shoot with that, and then you can buy something
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:17.960]  else a little more high-powered if you want.
[3:14:17.960 --> 3:14:23.080]  But for training, there are a lot of manuals, online training, simple safety stuff, how
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:24.080]  to use a firearm.
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:28.000]  I mean, there were just so many questions in there.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:32.280]  I mean, let's take the false flag stage terror situation.
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:39.120]  The controllers, the oligarchs could stage a nuke attack and say that North Korea had
[3:14:39.120 --> 3:14:40.120]  done it.
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:41.800]  They could do anything.
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:47.640]  That's why the head of ABB, Rumsfeld, gave the reactors in North Korea to begin with.
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:50.200]  That's why the West helped arm Pakistan.
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:56.400]  This is all part of destabilization so they can then play the part of the saviors later.
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:14:57.400]  Webster Tarpley.
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:15:03.880]  Let me just say, in the 1930s, what you see is when you get depression, really serious
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:07.760]  economic depression of the type we're going to have increasingly, if you don't solve the
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:13.200]  depression and fight the depression and defeat it and get a recovery and some kind of turn
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:19.240]  towards prosperity, then you get to fall into dictatorship, right, Germany, best example.
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:25.080]  But every place in Europe obviously went in some form of dictatorship or just about every
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:26.640]  place.
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:30.080]  If you want to avoid that, you've got to address the economic crisis.
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:31.720]  You've got to end the economic crisis.
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:37.400]  The only way you do that is with these American system or New Deal measures.
[3:15:37.400 --> 3:15:41.160]  The Austrian side argues, well, we've got to let the depression play out.
[3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:43.000]  We've got to let it take its course, right?
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:44.440]  We can't do anything about it.
[3:15:44.440 --> 3:15:48.040]  It's part of a cycle and the cycle is not controllable by us.
[3:15:48.040 --> 3:15:49.840]  No, we can and we must.
[3:15:49.840 --> 3:15:55.480]  So the Tobentax, Stop For Closures, Usury Laws and things like this, you've got to defend
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:16:00.880]  civilization in California through political action and that's what I recommend.
[3:16:00.880 --> 3:16:01.880]  Political action.
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:02.880]  Be political, right?
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:03.880]  Whatever else you do.
[3:16:03.880 --> 3:16:07.440]  Do all these other things if that's what you think is required.
[3:16:07.440 --> 3:16:12.160]  But the one thing you've got to have is political action and it's got to be programmatic.
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:15.840]  And generally speaking, the problem is, as we see it, that the right-wing critique of
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:21.040]  Obama doesn't get anywhere and you can see this because this is what Obama loves.
[3:16:21.040 --> 3:16:25.800]  He's always talking about Hannity and Limbaugh and all these characters.
[3:16:25.800 --> 3:16:28.840]  This is the opposition that he desires.
[3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:32.160]  He wants you to have to choose between Limbaugh and Obama.
[3:16:32.160 --> 3:16:33.400]  That's a terrible choice.
[3:16:33.400 --> 3:16:36.240]  That helps Obama to stabilize himself.
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:40.560]  What I think is likely to happen is a left-wing challenge, some kind of a New Deal challenge
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:46.200]  to Obama coming out of the Democratic Party in the same way that Ted Kennedy, weak-wessel,
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:48.000]  though he was, to be sure.
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:53.640]  Ted Kennedy gave Carter a real serious challenge, which then crippled Carter.
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:59.560]  I think that is what might happen in the Democratic Party, say, towards the end of next year.
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:02.760]  All right, let's take another phone call here.
[3:17:02.760 --> 3:17:06.600]  Let's talk to Annie in New York.
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:07.600]  You're on the air.
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:08.600]  Go ahead.
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:09.600]  Good afternoon.
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:10.600]  Thank you both.
[3:17:10.600 --> 3:17:11.600]  First, an observation.
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:12.600]  A quick one.
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:16.360]  A couple of months ago, all the mainstream media outlets were pushing Twitter.
[3:17:16.360 --> 3:17:17.360]  Remember?
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:24.000]  It was so orchestrated, it was like when all of the corporations came out with the boxes
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:30.560]  of goods on the store shelf in three languages, but now they're saying, oh, this Twitter revolution
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:36.360]  in Iran, it makes me so sick that it's so orchestrated.
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:38.160]  By the way, ma'am, that's not your opinion.
[3:17:38.160 --> 3:17:43.760]  The State Department and the CIA admit that they were running Twitter during this and
[3:17:43.760 --> 3:17:48.360]  even stopped Twitter from doing regular maintenance that might shut down Twitter for a few hours
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:17:50.560]  one night when this was happening.
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:54.680]  These were artificial Twitters telling people they lost the election that had been stolen
[3:17:54.680 --> 3:17:55.680]  from them.
[3:17:55.680 --> 3:17:56.680]  It was all staged.
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:18:02.040]  The external polls, nothing to do with the Iranian government, showed that Ahmed Indijit
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:04.640]  was the winner.
[3:18:04.640 --> 3:18:10.840]  This was a way to then get these youths, swarming adolescent masses, as Webster rightly calls
[3:18:10.840 --> 3:18:15.840]  them, to go out and then suddenly our government's all for revolution while it puts out Department
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:19.520]  of Homeland Security reports saying protesting is illegal.
[3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:24.680]  Webster, have you seen these documents where they're saying the army's being taught all
[3:18:24.680 --> 3:18:27.560]  protest is illegal and they're going to be shutting it down?
[3:18:27.560 --> 3:18:31.200]  I mean, they're certainly getting ready for martial law, but I don't see them getting
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:32.200]  away with it.
[3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:37.040]  Well, the irony is that the U.S. foreign policy is now based on mob rule.
[3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:38.400]  What's their prescription for Iran?
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:43.960]  They say, we want mob rule, forget about elections, we want mobs, we want rioters.
[3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:50.520]  The irony is, of course, that the same television channels were confronted with real vote fraud
[3:18:50.520 --> 3:18:57.000]  in the United States in the year 2000 in Florida and other places in 2004 in Ohio.
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:01.800]  Vote fraud, in favor of Bush, when they were confronted with real vote fraud, they ignored
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:02.800]  it.
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:03.800]  They didn't have any time for that.
[3:19:03.800 --> 3:19:09.800]  They just swept that aside, so they have no credibility, and the Iranian thing is just
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:17.200]  a big fraud, and Twitter, I guess, is a cultural campaign, and as you're right, the State Department
[3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:23.240]  and the CIA obviously run or at least partially run Twitter, so don't believe anything you
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:24.240]  see on Twitter.
[3:19:24.240 --> 3:19:27.520]  It's also great when you turn on CNN and they're reporting what's on Twitter.
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:32.520]  Twitter is a sewer where anybody can float anything they want and have it reported then
[3:19:32.520 --> 3:19:33.920]  on CNN.
[3:19:33.920 --> 3:19:37.720]  Well, I mean, it's clear that's, but I mean, it's come out, I'm sure you've seen the
[3:19:37.720 --> 3:19:43.400]  articles, Webster, just admitting CIA and State Department run Twitter, I mean, it's
[3:19:43.400 --> 3:19:44.400]  their tool.
[3:19:44.400 --> 3:19:50.880]  And it doesn't stop there, right, you look at Google and look at some others.
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:51.880]  It's amazing.
[3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:52.880]  Ma'am, anything else?
[3:19:52.880 --> 3:19:53.880]  I don't have to...
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:54.880]  Stay there.
[3:19:54.880 --> 3:19:55.880]  Stay there.
[3:19:55.880 --> 3:19:56.880]  We're going to come back to you.
[3:19:56.880 --> 3:19:57.880]  Webster Griffin Tarpleys, our guest.
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:01.840]  We'll talk about false flag terror as well.
[3:20:01.840 --> 3:20:04.520]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[3:20:04.520 --> 3:20:06.680]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[3:20:06.680 --> 3:20:10.920]  The price of food continues to rise and the economy continues to falter.
[3:20:10.920 --> 3:20:15.520]  You know that you need to prepare and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to
[3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:17.160]  act is now.
[3:20:17.160 --> 3:20:20.600]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[3:21:06.040 --> 3:21:10.520]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:21:10.520 --> 3:21:16.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:21:16.600 --> 3:21:19.760]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:25.680]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:30.120]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:21:30.120 --> 3:21:35.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[3:21:39.440 --> 3:21:42.120]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:21:42.120 --> 3:21:43.120]  Most people have no idea.
[3:21:43.120 --> 3:21:44.120]  They're not after money.
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:45.120]  They have all the money they need.
[3:21:45.120 --> 3:21:46.120]  They're after power.
[3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:47.120]  That's their opportunity.

[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:00.840]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[3:22:00.840 --> 3:22:04.560]  Hello Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:06.960]  and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:11.200]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:14.840]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:19.240]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:20.880]  for immediate withdrawal.
[3:22:20.880 --> 3:22:24.880]  Deposit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:27.720]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[3:22:27.720 --> 3:22:32.240]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:33.240]  for depositors.
[3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:37.560]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:38.560]  inflation.
[3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:42.800]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:46.520]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:51.200]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value
[3:22:51.200 --> 3:22:53.000]  for over 6,000 years.
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:56.920]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:23:00.200]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:23:00.200 --> 3:23:05.400]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:06.520]  into our bodies.
[3:23:06.520 --> 3:23:07.520]  Take a deep breath.
[3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:13.480]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria and dangerous ozone
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:14.800]  entering your lungs?
[3:23:14.800 --> 3:23:16.360]  Have a glass of water.
[3:23:16.360 --> 3:23:21.240]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs and numerous other
[3:23:21.240 --> 3:23:22.240]  chemicals?
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:23.240]  Of course you can't.
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:26.880]  The air that you breathe and the water you drink should help maintain good health, not
[3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:28.200]  take away from it.

[3:24:06.360 --> 3:24:13.080]  Raging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:17.480]  from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[3:24:17.480 --> 3:24:24.200]  Back on the network, 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. retransmitted to Genesis, replay back to back on the internet
[3:24:24.200 --> 3:24:31.760]  streams at infowars.com 24 7, and I come in Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time,
[3:24:31.760 --> 3:24:34.800]  5 to 7 Eastern, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:37.840]  I'm going to hold Tarpe a few minutes until the next hour to finish up with false flag
[3:24:37.840 --> 3:24:40.760]  terror after we're done with calls and we're going to let him go.
[3:24:40.760 --> 3:24:46.120]  Really appreciate his detailed analysis and breakdown today of where he sees the world
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:47.800]  and how things are unfolding.
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:50.000]  Great perspective always.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  Let's go back to Annie in New York.
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:53.240]  You had one other question, Annie?
[3:24:53.240 --> 3:24:58.080]  Yeah, and just give me a minute and I'll get off the phone and he can answer.
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:02.240]  You've got the CIA and the corporate media with Operation Mockingbird.
[3:25:02.240 --> 3:25:06.840]  Congress has been brought off by the corporations, the courts are corrupt, Homeland Security
[3:25:06.840 --> 3:25:09.480]  is brought off law enforcement.
[3:25:09.480 --> 3:25:16.560]  The biggest story of the decade should have been about that FEMA videographer, Kurt Sunfeld,
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:22.800]  and Webster thinks that we can do it through elections when we know that all these computerized
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:25.240]  voting machines are rigged.
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:29.080]  People say when push comes to shove, gee, aren't we there yet?
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:33.400]  Well, that's certainly the pessimism of the intelligence, but I think you've got to supplement
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:35.760]  that with the optimism of the will.
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:40.320]  I don't say through voting alone, but through a mass movement, in other words, get political
[3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:45.160]  and have a program, you've got to know how to end the depression and slogans will not
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:46.160]  do it.
[3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:49.520]  Free market won't do it, big government is bad, that won't do it, you've got to know
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:50.520]  what you want.
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:51.520]  It's got to be very specific.
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:56.000]  Well, I know we can do at least this and it's simple and it's true.
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  The private bankers, the Federal Reserve, they did this, it's their fault.
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:04.600]  Their answer is more of the same, expanding what they're doing, audit the Fed, arrest the
[3:26:04.600 --> 3:26:07.000]  bankers, prosecute them.
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:10.920]  The Federal Reserve broke the law with this Bank of America thing.
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:13.600]  That's like Bush breaking the law with warrantless wiretapping.
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:16.540]  He tries to get Congress to pass a retroactive.
[3:26:16.540 --> 3:26:19.800]  That's what this federal takeover of the Federal Reserve is.
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:25.240]  This reform is them trying to legalize the crimes they've already committed.
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:31.280]  Just the bastards, get that drumbeat going, in the Fed, arrest the Fed, and then, with
[3:26:31.280 --> 3:26:38.320]  them removed, we can just having them off our back, we'll then open a vacuum of, okay,
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:39.480]  what's the solution?
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:42.640]  But until you arrest these bastards, I don't see anything happening.
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:45.800]  Yeah, and add to that, who should pay for the depression?
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:47.360]  This is a depression.
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:48.440]  Who should pay?
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:53.640]  The bankers say, Obama said, we should pay, we should have Medicare, Medicaid, couch,
[3:26:53.640 --> 3:26:58.240]  we should lose our social security pensions, we should have the dissent into barbarism,
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:02.000]  old people on welfare should die, what you're seeing in California.
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:03.640]  Who should pay for the depression?
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:08.800]  By the way, you're not just saying that, you're not just saying that, Biden has said that,
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:13.760]  Dashell wrote a book saying, old people don't get brain surgery, man, I appreciate your
[3:27:13.760 --> 3:27:14.760]  call.
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:17.800]  I mean, you cannot make up how evil these people are.
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:22.720]  And again, they use the right wing to say, no welfare, nothing at all, taxing is stealing
[3:27:22.720 --> 3:27:24.480]  and at a certain level it is.
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:29.200]  But then they use that phony right wing argument to make sure all the tax money instead just
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:31.880]  goes to offshore banks and we get none of it.
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:37.280]  I mean, it is just, and the left is saying, tax the middle class, they're the enemy when
[3:27:37.280 --> 3:27:38.280]  that's the main engine.
[3:27:38.280 --> 3:27:41.680]  I mean, it's everything is engineered to consolidate power.
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:42.840]  Let's take another call here.
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:47.040]  Let's talk to Robert in Texas and Robert in California and others.
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:51.360]  But we have an endless, we have a call from Italy, we'll go to an exit for that.
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:53.120]  Go ahead, Robert in Texas.
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:56.880]  Hi, Mr. Jones, Mr. Tarpley, pleasure to talk to you all day.
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:02.880]  I'm gonna go through just something real quick here in regards to what the last lady said.
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:06.840]  I think that if everybody does just a little bit or just what they can, that'll make a
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:07.840]  difference.
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:11.840]  I mean, a bucket of water is not a lot, but a million buckets of water is a torrent.
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:16.720]  And with that being said, I have called for, because I do, every once in a while I try
[3:28:16.720 --> 3:28:21.320]  to get on the radio shows, the mainstream radio shows and put a little truth on there
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:25.960]  and I was able to get into Sean Haley's show, I was able to get by his screener and talk
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:32.240]  about how the Builder Bird Conference fixes the oil prices and how Mr. Tucker and Mr.
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:36.480]  Esselen were able to predict that two years before the huge spike last summer.
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:39.480]  Yeah, no, I put that in in game.
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:42.520]  What did he say when the, what's documented in in game came out?
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:44.600]  Did he just say it didn't exist and hung up?
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:49.000]  Well, what happened was I called him, I had the video up on my channel, it's Funkmaster
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:53.880]  Five, I've called here before, and that's five spelt out, not the number.
[3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:54.880]  Okay.
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:29:00.560]  He started ranting about conspiracies and he even mentioned a mothership UFO flying
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:04.240]  around or something like that, you know, and then he hung up on me promptly before I could
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:09.840]  mention end game because I had plenty more to say, but he cut me off pretty quick.
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:10.840]  Well that's what they do.
[3:29:10.840 --> 3:29:14.880]  I mean, Hannity admits they're trying to set up a bank of the world, New World Order,
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:19.000]  and he says, Oh, we're right, but only because he has to give us lip service.
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:22.280]  The rest of the time he's there trying to discredit us Webster.
[3:29:22.280 --> 3:29:23.480]  This isn't going to work anymore.
[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:27.400]  There is a world empire being set up and they can't deny it.
[3:29:27.400 --> 3:29:32.240]  Look, I was at a conference recently, I put a picture of Lewis, a bank of America, a blank
[3:29:32.240 --> 3:29:36.880]  fine of Goldman Sachs, a standard of Citibank, I said whoever gets all three gets a copy
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:39.440]  of my new book, Surviving the Cataclysm.
[3:29:39.440 --> 3:29:40.840]  Nobody could name all three.
[3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:45.840]  And I suggested read less about flying saucers and more about your class enemies.
[3:29:45.840 --> 3:29:47.720]  Those are the bankers.
[3:29:47.720 --> 3:29:48.720]  Absolutely.
[3:29:48.720 --> 3:29:49.720]  They are criminals.
[3:29:49.720 --> 3:29:52.040]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:52.040 --> 3:29:53.320]  We're on the March.
[3:29:53.320 --> 3:30:01.280]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:02.640]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:30:02.640 --> 3:30:04.680]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:30:04.680 --> 3:30:05.680]  Well, you should.
[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:10.200]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[3:30:10.200 --> 3:30:11.200]  That's right.
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:16.000]  You can attend five days of world class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:20.920]  Institute and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:25.800]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD
[3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:28.160]  pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:32.280]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[3:30:32.280 --> 3:30:35.320]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[3:30:35.320 --> 3:30:39.600]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[3:30:39.600 --> 3:30:40.800]  attitudes.
[3:30:40.800 --> 3:30:42.300]  This is real.
[3:30:42.300 --> 3:30:43.600]  Don't miss out.
[3:30:43.600 --> 3:30:48.960]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit
[3:30:48.960 --> 3:30:51.760]  for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[3:30:51.760 --> 3:30:54.240]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[3:30:54.240 --> 3:30:57.800]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.

[3:31:01.520 --> 3:31:02.520]  Hello, friends.
[3:31:02.520 --> 3:31:03.520]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:31:03.520 --> 3:31:07.040]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[3:31:07.040 --> 3:31:08.040]  important than ever.
[3:31:08.040 --> 3:31:11.040]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[3:31:11.040 --> 3:31:13.840]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[3:31:13.840 --> 3:31:17.720]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:31:17.720 --> 3:31:20.120]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[3:31:20.120 --> 3:31:23.360]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:31:23.360 --> 3:31:27.640]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:31:27.640 --> 3:31:32.040]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of
[3:31:32.040 --> 3:31:33.640]  last year's grocery prices.
[3:31:33.640 --> 3:31:38.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[3:31:38.760 --> 3:31:43.640]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the final list of high quality, pre-stried and dehydrated
[3:31:43.640 --> 3:31:45.120]  foods they have to offer.
[3:31:45.120 --> 3:31:46.120]  Watch the free videos.
[3:31:46.120 --> 3:31:51.320]  Look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[3:31:51.320 --> 3:31:56.480]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[3:31:56.480 --> 3:31:57.480]  Take action today.
[3:31:57.480 --> 3:32:01.880]  The first step is getting horrible food.
[3:32:01.880 --> 3:32:06.160]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:10.400]  have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[3:32:10.400 --> 3:32:11.400]  water?
[3:32:11.400 --> 3:32:14.680]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:32:14.680 --> 3:32:15.680]  into the skin.
[3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:20.320]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:25.640]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:32:25.640 --> 3:32:26.880]  algae and fungus.
[3:32:26.880 --> 3:32:31.800]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:32:31.800 --> 3:32:32.800]  comes first.
[3:32:32.800 --> 3:32:36.960]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:32:36.960 --> 3:32:39.000]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:32:39.000 --> 3:32:40.000]  What about you?
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:45.360]  Order your KDF shower filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free
[3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:46.360]  shipping.
[3:32:46.360 --> 3:32:55.080]  Call the Berkey guy in order now by calling 1-877-886-3653 that's 1-877-886-3653 or order
[3:32:55.080 --> 3:33:02.080]  online by visiting us at Directive21.com that's Directive, the number 21.com now.
[3:33:02.080 --> 3:33:15.520]  All right, I want to get into some financial news breakdown briefly what I think happened
[3:33:15.520 --> 3:33:19.280]  with that governor, play some clips.
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:23.680]  I went to four hours a year ago because I wanted more time and now seems like four hours
[3:33:23.680 --> 3:33:28.200]  is enough, that's probably my fault.
[3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:33.560]  Going back to Webster Griffin Tarbley and a few final calls and then he once talked
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:37.720]  some about this news about could there be a bank holiday because we've been hearing
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:46.400]  about and confirming that the embassies are being told dump their cash for US dollars
[3:33:46.400 --> 3:33:49.360]  and buy up the local currency.
[3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:53.840]  Now is that for war, is that for a bank holiday coming?
[3:33:53.840 --> 3:33:57.760]  We'll get Tarbley's brief comments on that in a moment and talk some about false flag
[3:33:57.760 --> 3:34:02.560]  terror, the ace in the hole for the establishment that we've got to expose as he says break
[3:34:02.560 --> 3:34:07.240]  that tool by exposing that tool so they can't do that to make people rally around the system
[3:34:07.240 --> 3:34:10.320]  and run into the skirts of the establishment.
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:14.640]  But Salvatore in Italy, you're on the air, go ahead sir.
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:19.120]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:21.120]  Here's a canned Salvatore, welcome.
[3:34:21.120 --> 3:34:22.120]  Hi, hi.
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:26.320]  I'd like to talk with Webster Tarbley.
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:27.320]  You're on the air with him.
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:28.320]  How about me?
[3:34:28.320 --> 3:34:36.160]  Ciao Webster, senti, ti posso parlare in italiano, voglio parlare in Italian, maybe I can make
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:38.560]  it real quick, I'll translate it for you.
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:39.560]  But quick.
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:40.560]  Okay.
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:49.560]  The question is, am I following Berlusconi, what's happening to Berlusconi?
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:53.080]  Yeah, why are they doing the scandal with the hookers?
[3:34:53.080 --> 3:34:55.360]  Okay, maybe I'll just.
[3:34:55.360 --> 3:35:07.040]  Okay, this is an attack that comes from the British and the London intelligence centers.
[3:35:07.040 --> 3:35:09.080]  I think we understand the question Salvatore.
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:16.520]  Let me just answer, Berlusconi is the most pro-Russian of all the European leaders.
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:21.080]  And this is a tradition in Italy, it goes back to the 20s and 30s, even under fascism.
[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:26.800]  You had companies like Fiat and others going into Russia, Soviet Union then, building things.
[3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:34.440]  Berlusconi is a big guy for the South Stream pipeline, which is the pro-Russian pipeline
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:41.800]  as against the Nabucco pipeline, which is the imperialist US, British and European central
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:42.800]  banks.
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:47.200]  Yeah, all these guys have girlfriends and they're all allowed to have them and boyfriends
[3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:51.280]  as long as they don't get out of line.
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:56.080]  The minute they do, like in Eliot Spitzer or this other governor, Mark Sanford, it's
[3:35:56.080 --> 3:35:57.080]  over.
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:35:58.080]  Are you saying that's happening with Berlusconi?
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:35:59.080]  Yeah, obviously.
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:04.880]  But again, he's the most pro-Russian of all the Europeans, he's the best from this point
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:05.880]  of view.
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:10.000]  In other words, he wants the obvious thing for Europe, is promote East-West trade, promote
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:12.400]  energy exchange, European technology.
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:17.920]  Okay, so he was good for Bush and one of the few allies to want to go into Iraq, but now
[3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:18.920]  he's out of favor.
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:20.720]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:21.720]  Salvatore?
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:22.720]  Well, he's an opportunist, of course.
[3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:25.320]  He's an opportunist during the Gulf War.
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:29.800]  He was, you've got to remember, who has given you the nuclear umbrella?
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:34.160]  One of the things he was interested in was maintaining a US nuclear umbrella over Italy.
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:38.480]  But the other thing is, if you look at where the Italian troops went, they went to the
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:42.400]  Italian-owned A&E, the state oil company, E&I.
[3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:44.920]  They went to guard the A&E oil wells in Iraq.
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:45.920]  They didn't do anything else.
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:50.400]  They were just there to secure Italian interests and then Bush said, oh, they're joining us
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:51.400]  in the fighting front.
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:52.400]  They didn't do the fighting front.
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:57.320]  No, no, I understand they hyped all that, I mean, you could have a, you know, made from
[3:36:57.320 --> 3:37:00.400]  Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, and they'd say the Czechs were supporting.
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:04.240]  Does that answer your question or do you have any other comments, Salvatore?
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:12.040]  I want to say that it's the Sunday times and the times of London who are attacking prominently
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:14.920]  against Berlusconi and the owner of this nuclear paper.
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:15.920]  Rupert Murdoch, guys.
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:20.840]  No, it's Rupert Murdoch going around talking to the hookers, yes.
[3:37:20.840 --> 3:37:30.840]  He has a lot of problem with the Sky Network, TVU, paper, no, as you said.
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:39.840]  Salvatore, let me propose, if Berlusconi wants to fight back, he should invite Larry Sinclair
[3:37:39.840 --> 3:37:45.560]  to come to Italy and tell his story and see how that stacks up against the alleged picadillos
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:46.560]  of Berlusconi.
[3:37:46.560 --> 3:37:48.400]  Take the offense.
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:50.920]  The defense is always hopeless, as Paolo Sopi said.
[3:37:50.920 --> 3:37:54.520]  Well, I mean, most of the elite in the United States like men, and they're probably mad
[3:37:54.520 --> 3:37:59.080]  that he likes 20-year-old blondes or something, I don't know, but it's very upsetting when
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:00.080]  he's doing it.
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:03.600]  That's why they're probably going after, that's why, probably why Matt Drudge is going
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:06.480]  after Mark Sanford.
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:09.400]  If Sanford was dating men, it'd be okay.
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:11.840]  I think that's a little bit different, Alex.
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:18.040]  It seems to me the idea there is just to prevent any national figure who could be a focus of
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:20.600]  resistance to Obama from emerging.
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:26.440]  I don't see anything good about Sanford, you know, not taking the stimulus money.
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:30.800]  He didn't want to pay unemployment benefits to the unemployed people in South Carolina.
[3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:31.800]  Hey, I'm joking, Webster.
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:32.800]  Webster, it's a joke.
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:34.120]  I understand that.
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:36.120]  Thank you so much, Salvatore, for meddling.
[3:38:36.120 --> 3:38:38.120]  Call back again, okay?
[3:38:38.120 --> 3:38:39.120]  Chow.
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:41.120]  Take care, buddy.
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:45.120]  Hey, I know another word, huh?
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:46.120]  There you go.
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:49.320]  When I can call my wife in here right now, I'll get her to speak Italian to you, Tarpley.
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:51.320]  See how good you speak Italian.
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:52.320]  Great.
[3:38:52.320 --> 3:38:53.320]  Bay Lake.
[3:38:53.320 --> 3:38:54.320]  No.
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:55.320]  I'm not going to drag her in here.
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:38:56.320]  She doesn't want to be on TV.
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:38:58.880]  I tell you what, let's bring my wife in and have her speak Italian to Tarpley, but don't
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:38:59.880]  put her on TV.
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:01.200]  She hates being on TV.
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:02.520]  Will you call her in here?
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:03.840]  Call Violet in here?
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:07.640]  Actually, we're going to test your Italian, Tarpley.
[3:39:07.640 --> 3:39:09.760]  You're always saying how good you are at it.
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:12.360]  We're going to test it right now.
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:18.320]  You know what chow-bombo means, chow-bombo means, chow-bombo means, I don't know what
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:19.320]  chow-bimbo means.
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:23.720]  Well, bimbo is strictly speaking a child, but then in U.S. it means something else.
[3:39:23.720 --> 3:39:24.720]  No, I know.
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:27.600]  Hey, come on in here, Tarpley.
[3:39:27.600 --> 3:39:29.480]  Come in here, Violet.
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:30.480]  Just don't put her on TV.
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:31.480]  Come on in here.
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:34.560]  We've got to have something original and exciting here on here.
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:37.360]  Tarpley's in there showing off, speaking Italian to Italian listeners, so I want you
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:42.320]  to speak Italian to Webster Tarpley, because I was just saying chow-bombo being, he was
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:45.320]  saying other hard things, I think, mean things towards you.
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:46.320]  No.
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:47.640]  Anyways, I'm just joking, Tarpley.
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:48.640]  We know we love you.
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:49.640]  Hi, Webster Tarpley.
[3:39:49.640 --> 3:39:50.640]  Here, here, here.
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:51.640]  What's between Italian?
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:52.640]  Here, here.
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:53.640]  Chow-comestà.
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:54.640]  Bene signora.
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:39:55.640]  No.
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:39:56.640]  Quit laughing.
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:40:02.640]  Sit in the chair normally instead of leaning over and talk to them.
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:04.240]  I don't know what you want me to say.
[3:40:04.240 --> 3:40:07.360]  Just talk to them about the New World Order.
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:08.360]  Can we do it in French?
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:09.360]  No, no, no.
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:10.360]  No, no, do it in Italian.
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:11.360]  You're good at Italian.
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:12.360]  Just talk to Italian.
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:13.360]  Non ci piace in the world order.
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:14.360]  I don't know what to say.
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:15.400]  I don't know.
[3:40:15.400 --> 3:40:17.440]  We don't like.
[3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:19.840]  Que lo ordine mondiale non lo vogliamo.
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:22.240]  We don't want the New World Order.
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:23.240]  Non, no, no.
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:26.000]  No, no piacere in the world order.
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:27.240]  Niente, niente.
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:28.240]  Okay, ciao.
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:30.800]  Tell everybody how handsome I am in Italian.
[3:40:30.800 --> 3:40:31.800]  No.
[3:40:31.800 --> 3:40:32.800]  I'm just having some fun, honey.
[3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:33.800]  Hey, hey, hey.
[3:40:33.800 --> 3:40:36.360]  Is the New World Order not out of control?
[3:40:36.360 --> 3:40:37.880]  It is out of control.
[3:40:37.880 --> 3:40:39.720]  Hey, CFC of Tarpley speaks some French.
[3:40:39.720 --> 3:40:40.880]  Let's hear that.
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:41.880]  Go ahead.
[3:40:41.880 --> 3:40:42.880]  What do you want?
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:43.880]  No, no.
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:46.480]  Talk to Tarpley about the New World Order in French.
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:47.480]  Okay.
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:49.480]  Ask him about the stimulus package.
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:50.480]  Okay.
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:51.480]  I don't know what...
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:52.480]  This is much harder.
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:54.800]  I don't know how to say stimulus.
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:40:55.800]  I guess stimulus.
[3:40:55.800 --> 3:40:56.800]  I don't know how do you...
[3:40:56.800 --> 3:40:57.800]  I can't hear.
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:40:58.800]  I can't hear.
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:40:59.800]  What are we talking about?
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:05.800]  Mr. Sarkozy, soutien le nouveau ordre mondial des ingles américains.
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:06.800]  Okay.
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:10.400]  Sarkozy supports the US-British New World Order.
[3:41:10.400 --> 3:41:11.400]  Right.
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:13.400]  So talk about Sarkozy being a prophet in French.
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:14.400]  Go ahead.
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:15.400]  Il est un poupé.
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:16.400]  Il est un marionnette.
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:17.400]  Un pote-touche.
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:18.400]  Un pote-touche.
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:19.400]  Je sais pas.
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:20.400]  Sarkozy, c'est un pote-touche de Londres.
[3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:21.400]  Okay.
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:22.400]  Quelle honte.
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:23.400]  Quelle honte pour les Français.
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:24.400]  What a shame for the French.
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:25.400]  Can't touch your friends today.
[3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:26.400]  Quelle honte, yes.
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:27.400]  Quelle honte pour eux.
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:28.400]  Oui, c'est vrai.
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:29.400]  Quelle honte.
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:30.400]  C'est terrible.
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:31.400]  Il est terrible.
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:32.400]  Voilà.
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:33.400]  Terrible.
[3:41:33.400 --> 3:41:34.400]  Okay.
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:41.400]  We got to have occasional craziness, honey.
[3:41:41.400 --> 3:41:42.400]  Good job.
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:48.400]  C'était un plaisir de vous parler et c'est vraiment, c'était fou.
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:52.400]  Hey, hey, say long live the republic.
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:54.400]  Death to the New World Order in French.
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:56.400]  How do you say that?
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:41:57.400]  Monsieur Turbot.
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:41:58.400]  Live la République.
[3:41:58.400 --> 3:42:05.400]  On parle le nouveau ordre économique mondial.
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:06.400]  Voilà.
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:08.400]  Tarpoli, something else.
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:13.400]  Hey, hey, let's see, let's see how Tarpoli does on the Spanish.
[3:42:13.400 --> 3:42:14.400]  And then let's do.
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:16.400]  I never made any claims, Alex.
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:18.400]  Let's do the Denmark speak.
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:19.400]  The Denmark.
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:20.400]  I don't know.
[3:42:20.400 --> 3:42:23.400]  We may be losing listeners with all this.
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:24.400]  Oh, whatever, Tarpoli.
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:26.400]  You got to have a little fun every once in a while.
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:28.400]  We've been serious for two and a half hours.
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:29.400]  That's right.
[3:42:29.400 --> 3:42:35.400]  Anyways, I thought I would, me and Charlie Sheen were sitting in one banquet room through
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:38.400]  the wall listening to you talk to some Italian lady for like an hour while we were sitting
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:41.400]  there drinking coffee and we found it to be quite entertaining.
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:44.400]  So here's your interesting guy, Tarpoli.
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:45.400]  Thank you.
[3:42:45.400 --> 3:42:46.400]  You bet.
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:49.400]  Now I don't have time to take any more calls, but I do want to spend a few minutes here
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:55.400]  with you specifically getting into false flag terror.
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:58.400]  Could we do the bank holiday since this is what I prepared.
[3:42:58.400 --> 3:42:59.400]  No, no, no.
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:00.400]  I mean, do both.
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:01.400]  Go ahead.
[3:43:01.400 --> 3:43:02.400]  Just go ahead.
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:03.400]  Okay.
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:07.400]  The bank holiday, the reason I want to mention the bank holiday is because there should be
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  a bank holiday in the following sense that any Friday Sheila Bear should go and shut down
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:18.400]  the top money center banks starting with JP Morgan Chase, Citibank Bank of America.
[3:43:18.400 --> 3:43:19.400]  And she doesn't do it.
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:24.400]  And that's the whole secret of this system is to keep them going as zombie banks when
[3:43:24.400 --> 3:43:27.400]  they should be shut down because they are so bankrupt.
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:33.400]  The stress test that was done as we learn completely ignored the question of derivatives.
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:37.400]  And that's like saying, you know, if you weren't head over heels in debt, you wouldn't be bankrupt.
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:41.400]  Well, the point is you are head over heels in debt and you are bankrupt if you're one
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:43.400]  of these zombie bankers.
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:45.400]  So this is what is not done.
[3:43:45.400 --> 3:43:50.400]  Now the notion of the bank holiday, this has been around now for the last six months because
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:53.400]  clearly the US banking system is completely bankrupt.
[3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:59.400]  What you've got to remember though is that the Roosevelt bank holiday did not close any banks.
[3:43:59.400 --> 3:44:02.400]  Those banks were already shut down.
[3:44:02.400 --> 3:44:07.400]  The whole banking system had ground to a halt on the night before Roosevelt took office.
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:11.400]  It all comes out of the British default on gold in September, 1931.
[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:17.400]  You then had 2300 US banks blow up, go bankrupt during 1931.
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:23.400]  And then you had this rolling regional crisis that goes to Chicago in the summer of 1932,
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:29.400]  then to Nevada, then to Louisiana, then to Michigan, and then finally New York shuts down
[3:44:29.400 --> 3:44:32.400]  on the last day of Hoover and then Illinois shuts down.
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:37.400]  So by the time we're going to see that here, I don't think so because I think that's the
[3:44:37.400 --> 3:44:43.400]  whole idea of Obama is to keep this system of zombie banks open.
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:47.400]  And again, I write about this in my newest book, Surviving the Cataclysm.
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:53.400]  I have a whole chapter, Models of Disintegration, which is about the 1932-33 banking crisis.
[3:44:53.400 --> 3:44:54.400]  You know what?
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:44:58.400]  I'll have you back on in the next few weeks just specifically about that for a few hours.
[3:44:58.400 --> 3:44:59.400]  Thank you.
[3:44:59.400 --> 3:45:02.400]  It's almost out of time, but I do want to briefly get you a shirt.
[3:45:02.400 --> 3:45:04.400]  One last thing though is what's coming is a dollar crisis.
[3:45:04.400 --> 3:45:08.400]  In other words, the reason the US embassies are selling dollars is there's going to be
[3:45:08.400 --> 3:45:09.400]  a dollar panic.
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:12.400]  There's going to be a rush to the exit sometime soon.
[3:45:12.400 --> 3:45:14.400]  Everybody tries to dump dollars.
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:19.400]  It would be very much in the interest of the world to have that not be chaotic, but to
[3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:21.400]  find a way to repatriate the dollars.
[3:45:21.400 --> 3:45:25.400]  You could say to China, look, you want to do health care in rural China.
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:31.400]  We can sell you 1,000 US-made hospitals with everything in them, turnkey hospitals, so
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:35.400]  you can improve health conditions in rural China or in rural Russia because they have
[3:45:35.400 --> 3:45:36.400]  a lot of dollars, too.
[3:45:36.400 --> 3:45:41.400]  In other words, let them buy things, capital goods, real big improvements, things that
[3:45:41.400 --> 3:45:44.400]  will permanently help them, not consumer goods.
[3:45:44.400 --> 3:45:45.400]  Sure.
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:48.400]  We're just out of time here, so we're going to have to cut that off there specifically
[3:45:48.400 --> 3:45:50.400]  false flag terror quickly.
[3:45:50.400 --> 3:45:51.400]  Well, it could be anything.
[3:45:51.400 --> 3:45:53.400]  We look at the pattern inside this country.
[3:45:53.400 --> 3:45:59.400]  We had CHO at Virginia Tech in the spring of 2007, so you can have college students
[3:45:59.400 --> 3:46:00.400]  as terrorists.
[3:46:00.400 --> 3:46:04.400]  You've had a whole bunch of Columbine-type events.
[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:06.400]  They've been going on in the background.
[3:46:06.400 --> 3:46:14.400]  Now, more recently, you've had this Van Braun, the guy at the Holocaust Museum here in the
[3:46:14.400 --> 3:46:21.400]  United States, and they attack him as being a 9-11 truther and a birther, somebody who
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:26.400]  is interested in the question of Obama's birth certificate, the stuff that Phil Burke has
[3:46:26.400 --> 3:46:28.400]  been looking into in his law cases.
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:30.400]  That looks staged to me.
[3:46:30.400 --> 3:46:32.400]  He's a real patsy.
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:34.400]  Every one of them is a patsy.
[3:46:34.400 --> 3:46:36.400]  That goes without saying.
[3:46:36.400 --> 3:46:42.400]  But then you could also have false flag terror, obviously targeting the Shanghai Cooperation
[3:46:42.400 --> 3:46:47.400]  Organization, Russia, China, people in Central Asia, people like this.
[3:46:47.400 --> 3:46:50.400]  India, possibly.
[3:46:50.400 --> 3:46:51.400]  More likely Pakistan.
[3:46:51.400 --> 3:46:55.400]  I mean, more likely the new enemies list, of course, where India is.
[3:46:55.400 --> 3:47:01.400]  Now, I'm going to activate some of the Hindu terror groups blaming on Muslims.
[3:47:01.400 --> 3:47:02.400]  Right.
[3:47:02.400 --> 3:47:04.400]  And that's exactly what was done, right?
[3:47:04.400 --> 3:47:10.400]  That was Mumbai last summer, or the last, well, in the past year.
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:12.400]  So, the door for that is open.
[3:47:12.400 --> 3:47:17.400]  Again, the line from the ruling elite was, as Andrew Sullivan said it in the Atlantic
[3:47:17.400 --> 3:47:20.400]  Monthly, with Bush, nobody would believe him.
[3:47:20.400 --> 3:47:24.400]  You couldn't do false flag anymore because nobody but nobody would believe Bush.
[3:47:24.400 --> 3:47:28.400]  They would accuse him of incompetence, or some would even say you did it yourself as
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:29.400]  a provocation.
[3:47:29.400 --> 3:47:34.400]  So, the door for this, from the point of view of the U.S. ruling elite is open.
[3:47:34.400 --> 3:47:36.400]  I don't think in the world that's true.
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:40.400]  I don't think people are going to believe Obama very much more than they would have
[3:47:40.400 --> 3:47:41.400]  believed Bush.
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:45.400]  But the danger is that the people in Wall Street and the Council on Foreign Relations
[3:47:45.400 --> 3:47:49.400]  and these people, the State Department, they believe that they might be able to get away
[3:47:49.400 --> 3:47:50.400]  with this now.
[3:47:50.400 --> 3:47:54.400]  So, we have to be very vigilant and, of course, don't be stampeded no matter what happens.
[3:47:54.400 --> 3:47:55.400]  All right, Webster.
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:47:56.400]  Great job.
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:47:58.400]  Thanks for spending two hours and 40 minutes with us.
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:47:59.400]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[3:47:59.400 --> 3:48:02.400]  And you're in the Obama deception and in the upcoming Obama film.
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:03.400]  Right.
[3:48:03.400 --> 3:48:04.400]  And more power to you with these documentaries.
[3:48:04.400 --> 3:48:08.400]  They're a tremendous ingredient in changing the political climate.
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:11.400]  Well, more power to you and the listeners who are getting them out there, people.
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:12.400]  Take care, Webster.
[3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:13.400]  Bye-bye.
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:14.400]  There he goes.
[3:48:14.400 --> 3:48:17.400]  Okay, now I want to come back and into Sanford because I promised to do it briefly with
[3:48:17.400 --> 3:48:20.400]  his weird Illuminati comments and thanks and his Bilderberg group connection.
[3:48:20.400 --> 3:48:22.400]  But then why are they burning him?
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:24.400]  Did he go against him or something?
[3:48:24.400 --> 3:48:26.400]  Just the way the media built this up, where is he?
[3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:28.400]  He brought out it was with a woman.
[3:48:28.400 --> 3:48:32.400]  That's clearly a Psyop because him with a woman by itself isn't big national news.
[3:48:32.400 --> 3:48:33.400]  That's coming up.
[3:48:33.400 --> 3:48:37.400]  But for two minutes before I go to break, Ted Anderson, he's been holding for like 10
[3:48:37.400 --> 3:48:40.400]  while it held tarply over because I wanted to have Ted back on.
[3:48:40.400 --> 3:48:42.400]  Gold and silver went up again today.
[3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:47.400]  But Ted has the price of gold that he bought when it was $20 lower and silver when it was
[3:48:47.400 --> 3:48:49.400]  lower and he could pass that savings on to you.
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:52.400]  And in these uncertain times, it's win, win, win, win, win.
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:55.400]  Ted sells this to you right at his cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:48:59.400]  He sells it from when he bought it earlier at a lower price, still at a lower price now.
[3:48:59.400 --> 3:49:01.400]  And he supports this network.
[3:49:01.400 --> 3:49:03.400]  What we're doing, get into gold and silver.
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:09.400]  If it's 10 gold coins or 10 silver coins or one gold coin or one silver coin, get into it
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:11.400]  physically holding it.
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:15.400]  Ted, you still for a little while longer, you told me, got some of the coins left at the
[3:49:15.400 --> 3:49:16.400]  lower price.
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:18.400]  That's exactly what I have right now, Alex.
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:19.400]  We got the prices lower.
[3:49:19.400 --> 3:49:20.400]  We quoted them yesterday.
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:23.400]  We both have seen gold and silver go up today.
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:26.400]  Again, I'm holding the prices just exactly where they were yesterday.
[3:49:26.400 --> 3:49:29.400]  The Lakota coin right now, $19.70.
[3:49:29.400 --> 3:49:33.400]  Silver went over 14 cents or $14 an ounce.
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:36.400]  That pushes that coin over 20 bucks.
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:39.400]  In addition to this, we still have the British Sovereigns and Franks.
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:42.400]  They're at $2.75 for the British Sovereign.
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:44.400]  The Frank is at $2.22.
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:47.400]  I have a long array list of other coins that you can ask about if you're interested with
[3:49:47.400 --> 3:49:50.400]  the U.S. Eagles, the Maple Leafs, all the different things that we have.
[3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:54.400]  Matter of fact, we have a bunch of pandas, which I can't believe I usually never get those.
[3:49:54.400 --> 3:49:55.400]  Oh, my gosh.
[3:49:55.400 --> 3:49:56.400]  What about buffaloes?
[3:49:56.400 --> 3:49:57.400]  Got any buffaloes?
[3:49:57.400 --> 3:49:58.400]  Just such a small amount.
[3:49:58.400 --> 3:49:59.400]  You can ask for them.
[3:49:59.400 --> 3:50:00.400]  800-686-2237.
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:07.400]  A few weeks ago, I did an offer, and I had the internal sheet from Midas of what it was,
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:11.400]  where you guys were making what, $0.60 per silver coin profit.
[3:50:11.400 --> 3:50:14.400]  And on gold, it was like $5 a coin.
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:22.400]  Folks, it's razor thin, and with the market up, Ted's losing money because he's not selling
[3:50:22.400 --> 3:50:23.400]  it at the higher amount.
[3:50:23.400 --> 3:50:27.400]  He's selling it from the lower amount he bought it, even though gold and silver's gone up.
[3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:32.400]  So, there's hardly any markup on it, and that's when gold and silver was lower.
[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:35.400]  This is really a great deal on the coins Ted just offered.
[3:50:35.400 --> 3:50:37.400]  So, brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[3:50:37.400 --> 3:50:38.400]  800-686-2237.
[3:50:38.400 --> 3:50:43.400]  Don't trust the bankers with all the stuff that's going on in the world.
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:47.400]  Get some liquid portable private insurance, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:50:47.400 --> 3:50:51.400]  800-686-2237, and you heard him.
[3:50:51.400 --> 3:50:53.400]  He's got some of those great coins at great prices.
[3:50:53.400 --> 3:50:54.400]  Thank you, Ted.
[3:50:54.400 --> 3:50:56.400]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[3:50:56.400 --> 3:50:57.400]  You bet.
[3:50:57.400 --> 3:50:58.400]  Stay with us.
[3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:24.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:28.400 --> 3:51:53.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:53.400 --> 3:52:19.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:52:19.400 --> 3:52:45.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:52:45.400 --> 3:53:00.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:53:15.400 --> 3:53:41.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:53:41.400 --> 3:54:10.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:54:10.400 --> 3:54:36.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:55:02.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:55:02.400 --> 3:55:31.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:55:31.400 --> 3:55:32.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:56:01.400 --> 3:56:04.400]  What did you guys talk about up there, and in your opinion, Governor, why isn't the media
[3:56:04.400 --> 3:56:06.400]  allowed to report on the vote of opinion?
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:07.400]  Sure.
[3:56:07.400 --> 3:56:08.400]  I don't know.
[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:14.400]  I think there's a lot of intrigue and conspiracy theory on that one that really doesn't exist,
[3:56:14.400 --> 3:56:16.400]  at least based on my limited experience.
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:18.400]  And I can't speak for what's happened there over the years.
[3:56:18.400 --> 3:56:21.400]  I was invited by a friend.
[3:56:21.400 --> 3:56:23.400]  He said, you'll learn a lot.
[3:56:23.400 --> 3:56:31.400]  It was apparently originally set up after World War II to try and keep the link between
[3:56:31.400 --> 3:56:34.400]  Europe and America from the standpoint of keeping the conversation going.
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:37.400]  That's largely what went on.
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:44.400]  And so, I mean, with all due respect to conversation, there were a bunch of guys who thought they
[3:56:44.400 --> 3:56:50.400]  were smart, saying, hey, I think this or I think that, but I'm coming.
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:58.400]  So I guess I'd say regardless of who it's with, with the exception of maybe terrorists,
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:01.400]  I don't think conversation is a bad thing.
[3:57:01.400 --> 3:57:04.400]  None of these people had the keys to power.
[3:57:04.400 --> 3:57:08.400]  They were all folks that, well, that's not true.
[3:57:08.400 --> 3:57:10.400]  There were two senators there, and there were two governors.
[3:57:10.400 --> 3:57:17.400]  Those guys were Republican governors and those guys were Democratic governors.
[3:57:17.400 --> 3:57:21.400]  And so they talked about what was going to happen next in the relation with China.
[3:57:21.400 --> 3:57:23.400]  What was going to happen next in relation to Europe?
[3:57:23.400 --> 3:57:25.400]  What was going to happen next in Europe?
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:28.400]  And so I thought it was interesting.
[3:57:28.400 --> 3:57:31.400]  And so I understand that a lot of conservatives are very messed up.
[3:57:31.400 --> 3:57:34.400]  I called a number of friends and called me and said, well, why'd you call?
[3:57:34.400 --> 3:57:35.400]  I said, well, look, a friend has.
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:37.400]  I didn't know there was such a big deal.
[3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:38.400]  Yeah.
[3:57:38.400 --> 3:57:43.400]  If it was 100 and some of the Hollywood top-notch stars, the media would be swarming that thing.
[3:57:43.400 --> 3:57:44.400]  Right.
[3:57:44.400 --> 3:57:47.400]  And so this is 100 and some of the most powerful power brokers across the world.
[3:57:47.400 --> 3:57:48.400]  But they're really not.
[3:57:48.400 --> 3:57:50.400]  I just would all do respect to the folks who were there.
[3:57:50.400 --> 3:57:54.400]  Folks like David Rockefeller and David Rockefeller is a yesterday's news kind of guy.
[3:57:54.400 --> 3:57:55.400]  Hit off.
[3:57:55.400 --> 3:57:56.400]  Henry Paulson was there.
[3:57:56.400 --> 3:57:57.400]  Ben Bernanke.
[3:57:57.400 --> 3:58:00.400]  I mean, that's some heavy hitters there.
[3:58:00.400 --> 3:58:01.400]  Maybe they weren't there.
[3:58:01.400 --> 3:58:02.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:03.400]  Okay.
[3:58:03.400 --> 3:58:04.400]  Are you sure about that?
[3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:05.400]  Oh, yeah.
[3:58:05.400 --> 3:58:06.400]  I got the list right here.
[3:58:06.400 --> 3:58:07.400]  Yeah.
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:08.400]  Let's stop right there.
[3:58:08.400 --> 3:58:09.400]  That's enough.
[3:58:09.400 --> 3:58:10.400]  And then he looks a little deceptive.
[3:58:10.400 --> 3:58:12.400]  But if he is a liar, he's an incredible liar.
[3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:14.400]  See, they bring in politicians.
[3:58:14.400 --> 3:58:18.400]  They want to kind of vet for just like five hour meetings, but it goes on for three days.
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:22.400]  See, just because you've been an attendee doesn't mean you're part of the New World Order.
[3:58:22.400 --> 3:58:24.400]  But if you're a member, definitely.
[3:58:24.400 --> 3:58:26.400]  Now, I don't have time to play it.
[3:58:26.400 --> 3:58:27.400]  I'll play it tomorrow.

[3:58:29.400 --> 3:58:34.400]  This one right here where he's talking about all seeing eyes of God and all this weird,
[3:58:34.400 --> 3:58:35.400]  weird New World Order stuff.
[3:58:35.400 --> 3:58:37.400]  So something's going on with this Sanford guy.
