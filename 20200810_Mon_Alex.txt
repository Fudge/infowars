[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Because he might not want to move out of the White House, doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the United States.
[00:10.000 --> 00:21.000]  And I'm second in line to the presidency and just last week I had my regular continuation of government briefing.
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  This might interest you because I say to them, this is never going to happen. God willing, it never will.
[00:27.000 --> 00:39.000]  But there is a process. It has nothing to do with it. The certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  It's not a geography or location.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  The Democratic panic is in full gear. You can hear it in the warbling of former President Obama as the hellhounds draw nearer.
[00:49.000 --> 01:15.000]  There are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that's going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don't get sick.
[01:15.000 --> 01:32.000]  So we caught President Obama and Biden spying on the campaign. I caught them and we caught them spying using the intelligence apparatus of our country to spy on an opponent's or the opposing party's campaign, both before and after the election.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  How about after the election? I had already won. So that was the story. We caught them spying. Now it's up to our attorney general.
[01:40.000 --> 01:51.000]  As you know, I wanted them to do it. I didn't want to get overly involved. Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't, but I do hear it's breathtaking what they found. That's all I can say, breathtaking.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  You can hear it in Pelosi and Schumer as they failed to support the American people during a pandemic shutdown.
[01:57.000 --> 02:13.000]  At times yesterday, our Republican friends seemed willing to walk away from the negotiating table to do an unworkable, weak and narrow executive orders which are not going to do the job for the American people. We are committed to negotiating.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  And as we said, we are willing to make compromises.
[02:16.000 --> 02:29.000]  Won't millions of Americans now get some extended federal unemployment relief and some protection from evictions? Get that now rather than getting nothing at all.
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.000]  No. In fact, what the president did is I agree with the Republican senator said it was unconstitutional slump.
[02:37.000 --> 02:49.000]  It's not known as a master negotiator, but didn't you mess this one up? Failure to make a deal is going to result in a lot of people and a lot of entities that were in need ending up with nothing.
[02:49.000 --> 03:03.000]  Well, how do you justify tens of billions of dollars to feed the hungry to $250,000 to understand how far apart we are just by that example?
[03:03.000 --> 03:13.000]  We're talking about going to court because if you do, you must know that the practical effect of that would be if you're successful that you would be blocking.
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.000]  I know you'd think that they should be $600 rather than $400, but you would be blocking if you were successful the millions of unemployed workers from getting any federal benefit.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  You can hear it in the New York Times columnist Ben Smith where the entire country is brought to its knees for the sake of political wargaming.
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  Shall we play a game? How about global thermal nuclear war?
[03:38.000 --> 03:49.000]  As Smith writes, a group of former top government officials called the Transition Integrity Project cast John Podesta, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman in the role of Mr. Biden.
[03:49.000 --> 04:02.000]  They expected him when the votes came in to concede just as Mrs. Clinton had, but Mr. Podesta, playing Mr. Biden, shocked the organizers by saying he felt his party wouldn't let him concede, alleging voter suppression.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  He persuaded the governors of Wisconsin and Michigan to send pro-Biden electors to the Electoral College.
[04:08.000 --> 04:18.000]  Tell me this is one of your simulations, Mr. President. All right, flush the bombers, get the subs and launch mode. We are at DEF CON 1.
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  In that scenario, California, Oregon and Washington then threatened to secede from the United States if Mr. Trump took office as planned.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  The house named Mr. Biden President, the Senate and White House stuck with Mr. Trump.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  At that point, the nation stopped looking for the media for cues and waited to see what the military would do.
[04:39.000 --> 04:53.000]  One need look no further than Joe Biden, who is Democrat Panic Incarnate, a blubbering, senile, old school racist, globalist minion representing a portion of America that is so confused that they would willingly support him.
[04:53.000 --> 05:08.000]  John Bowne reporting. Stay with us. We are live. Spread the word now. America and the world should have never been closed. It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives.
[05:08.000 --> 05:20.000]  But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed. It is outrageous.
[05:20.000 --> 05:34.000]  Well, we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America Back to School Special 50 to 60% off all of our top sellers and double patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  And despite the fact that our ultimate turmeric formula bodies is selling out, we still have it at 50% off.
[05:40.000 --> 05:51.000]  But for a limited time, living defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off, vaso beats, amazing concentrated beat extract of all of its benefits, selling out so 50% off.
[05:51.000 --> 06:11.000]  And so much more at infowarstore.com and your purchase funds the info war. A true 360 win.
[06:11.000 --> 06:21.000]  Great Balls of Fire.
[06:21.000 --> 06:27.000]  The political landscape is on fire. I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas.
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  Despite all the enemies attacks to shut us down, you've kept us on air and I salute every man, woman and child across the planet.
[06:34.000 --> 06:42.000]  No matter what color you are, if you stand for freedom, we love you and we appreciate you. We're in this together for a pro human future against the global technocrats.
[06:42.000 --> 06:55.000]  It is Monday, August 10th, 2020, 84 days out from the election. We have some huge guests with breaking news today that is going to be earth shaking concerning Hollywood and their giant satanic pedophile rings.
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  They use for control coming down, including the pedophile rings that have captured control of the Vatican and the Democratic Party.
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  They have a major filmmaker and actor who's been suppressed in his work joining us in the second hour. We'll tell you about that.
[07:10.000 --> 07:22.000]  Here's the good news. You know that for three and a half years, I've been exposing the deep state legal surveillance, the president, how Obama set up.
[07:22.000 --> 07:40.000]  Stay behind networks is the technical term, but basically embeds is what Trump calls them, using CIA mockingbird computer programs with their contacts in the global media and domestic media to engage in psychological warfare against the American people.
[07:40.000 --> 07:54.000]  And Trump has never gotten control of this. I know Pompeo says he's tried, but the way they built these systems is their computer interfaces with holes in the CIA and in the NSA backdoors.
[07:54.000 --> 08:03.000]  So these actors would never be brought out of power. Now, the fact that they have these bad actors, I don't mean Hollywood actors.
[08:03.000 --> 08:14.000]  Now, that's why taking their security clearances that finally happened to Brett and Clapper took over a year and a half was so critical because now when they get into these databases, it's a serious felony.
[08:14.000 --> 08:23.000]  These systems should not even exist. But that's how you'll see an article come out against me put out by the Democrats and by Obama, mainly.
[08:23.000 --> 08:33.000]  That comes out of the PR firm that comes out of media matters. And then it's delivered to one of the operatives of the State Department or CIA, and then you see on the cover of every paper in the country.
[08:33.000 --> 08:48.000]  And of course, zero hedge is a great job back in 2016 reporting Obama set up his own Ministry of Truth, countering foreign disinformation propaganda act that legally put it into place to trigger the operations and billions of dollars of funding against the American people.
[08:48.000 --> 09:00.000]  And then that's how you saw House hearings, Senate hearings, where they would say Jones is a Russian agent, and they would have high level CIA, high level State Department in there saying it with a straight face.
[09:00.000 --> 09:09.000]  They use that to tell the rest of the government, oh, Trump and Stone and Jones, they're all Russian agents. And they desperately needed that to be true, but it never happened.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  They sent operatives to try to set me up with Russian money that was CIA money. They sent operatives to stone to try to set them up.
[09:15.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I reported it. We all reported to the FBI. This is the level. I'm going to ask something to get into it by the FBI. This is the level of what's been going on here behind the scenes.
[09:25.000 --> 09:38.000]  I have personally experienced it, not just read about it. So I was toodling around Friday on Paul Joseph Watson's Twitter because he always has a lot of interesting things.
[09:38.000 --> 09:50.000]  I liked Mike Cernovich's stuff. And I saw Alex Jones's name. Let me see what Mike Cernovich is saying about me. Clicked on it. And it was a link to a New York Times article from five days before that I missed.
[09:50.000 --> 10:03.000]  On the third, where a senior reporter at the New York Times got in on the phone conference with a war game, a tabletop exercise of senior Democrats, including Hillary Clinton's former campaign had John Podesta.
[10:03.000 --> 10:12.000]  And it was everything we'd already said, everything we'd already analyzed off their talking points and pre-programming, but they hadn't told us the final battle plan.
[10:12.000 --> 10:24.000]  Now, we knew it was Civil War, contested elections, Democrat states seceding. Hillary has come out, so has Pelosi, a month ago and said, well, if he just tries to stay in the office, we'll just have our own inauguration.
[10:24.000 --> 10:40.000]  Well, how do you have your own inauguration? They officially say they're going to contest if they don't win. And they are going to have New York, California and a bunch of other states they list secede.
[10:40.000 --> 10:54.000]  That's how the Civil War started in the 1860s. That is Civil War, baby, and that they're going to ignore the Senate, they're going to ignore the Supreme Court, and that they are going to form a new country and have their own inauguration.
[10:54.000 --> 11:11.000]  Again, this came out in the New York Times five days before I even learned of it, because, again, we're so on top of this and beating the drum going, no one's covering this, they're getting ready, they're pre-programming emergency.
[11:11.000 --> 11:25.000]  I mean, I've got hundreds of entertaining clips, hundreds of articles, incredible guests. If I wanted to make the show more popular, I could do it. But instead, they hate the broadcast because when I know something will save the republic and as a key talking point, I will just parrot it and parrot it.
[11:25.000 --> 11:40.000]  Emergency, emergency, they're planning Civil War, secession, they're planning race riots as the cover, emergency, I mean, I'm just, because that's it. I mean, if the Russians were firing missiles at us and I was at a satellite control panel or a radar at the North Pole,
[11:40.000 --> 11:51.000]  I would just be reporting incoming missiles, incoming missiles, incoming missiles, they're now at this many thousands of miles away, they're now, their trajectory is they're going to hit Chicago, New York, I mean, you would just say that over and over again.
[11:51.000 --> 12:04.000]  Not, oh, look at what Pelosi said, or look at what Clinton did, because, or look, Biden's an idiot, he doesn't know what planet he's on. They don't care, he's a placeholder, and we now know.
[12:04.000 --> 12:14.000]  It's not get rid of them at the convention, it's not get rid of the debates, they don't care how embarrassing it is, they're going to contest and split the country up and go into martial law.
[12:14.000 --> 12:25.000]  Under their blue state city areas, you've already seen them do it on the West Coast, telling the feds, do you don't guard your own courthouse when we're burning it down, you don't guard the local police station, you let us do it.
[12:25.000 --> 12:37.000]  And so when they secede, and Trump tries to send in federal troops, they're going to then say, oh, they're racist and use black people to get shot and killed, which will happen when they're literally involved in insurrection.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  It'll be white people running it, that the race war is on.
[12:41.000 --> 12:49.000]  Just like George Jones would say, the race is on, and when it's on, it's on.
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  So Pelosi, a month ago, when she said, we'll fumigate him out of here, we'll have our own inauguration if he refuses to leave.
[12:57.000 --> 13:15.000]  I've met with the military last week in the COG, and that's the key of what the New York Times reports in this bombshell information by Ben Smith, telling us what we already knew, but confirming it.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  That they said, we believe the military at that point will side with us because a civil war is too dangerous.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  So they're going to maneuver us into collapse financially.
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  We're already under a lockdown, and they've canvassed the military, which I told you months ago, then came out and made statements against Trump.
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  The sec def, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, all, a bunch of top generals all ran down the president in the news day after day, unprecedented in U.S. history.
[13:39.000 --> 13:51.000]  And that was there, putting the knee down, tipping the cap, and I don't take that type of insubordination and garbage as a foil to manipulate the left.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  I don't think that's what's happening.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  They breed these generals to be cowards.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  They breed them to follow the orders of the system.
[13:58.000 --> 14:07.000]  They're brainwashed by these globalist PhDs they have to go get, and they're selected because they just are moral cowards.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  And some say, oh, no, it's a Q-level deal.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  It's, Trump's ordering to do it.
[14:13.000 --> 14:20.000]  BS, I've been involved at the highest levels when Trump doesn't know about stuff, and I know what happens once he learns about it.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  And it's, and you heard Pachennic, when I was going, oh, Millie's good.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Like two months ago, he goes, no, he's not.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  You'll have to go too.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  And Pachennic's down there hooked into Special Operations Command in Florida, and he's a great source.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  And he said, no, Millie's been compromised.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  And I'm not going to say that that's the word of God or something.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  I just knew that suddenly Millie ran around like a chicken with his head cut off, talking crap about the president.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  What planet did we just wake up on?
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  They are signaling, and Pelosi has met with them.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  And she said, I'm number two in command.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  So I'm going to say it again.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  The lockdown didn't normal.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  The COVID didn't normal.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  The race riots, none of it's normal.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's all a smokescreen for the real civil war and the secession.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  We'll read it all when we come back.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  But think about the headline on infowars.com right now.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  Think about the headline on infowars.com right now for the live show.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  We can put that up, please, because that's what we're dealing with.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  And that link needs to be shared with absolutely everybody to understand what's unfolding.
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  Red alert, Democrats planning to contest election using state secession.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Plunging America into civil war.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  That headline's not even hardcore enough.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  They believe the crisis will then preempt the military to remove Trump.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  So they're going to hold the country hostage, hold the state's hostage, put us into civil war.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Tell us they're going to blow up the police departments.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  And then it's Trump's fault and the military has to remove him because he's a racist and caused all this.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  When they're engineering the whole damn thing.
[16:24.000 --> 16:40.000]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder there is.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues,
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  You're saying that it's made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  August 2020 is here.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  It's less than 90 days out from the historic election.
[17:02.000 --> 17:10.000]  The Chai comms, the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party and the blue states and blue cities are all battling to keep America shut down
[17:10.000 --> 17:18.000]  and to destroy free speech as well to ensure their final takeover of the United States by removing President Donald John Trump.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  At info wars, we're fighting back harder than ever. So your word of mouth and your prayer is key for the transmission.

[18:25.000 --> 18:33.000]  I want to be very calm about this.
[18:33.000 --> 18:45.000]  But the Democratic DNC highest level war game run by John Podesta, you know who he is of spirit cooking fame,
[18:45.000 --> 18:56.000]  along with his brother, literal commanders of the army of pedophilia.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  They say that they are going to have the states to seed.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  Every Democrat state, they have California, New York lined up.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  They're going to declare Trump illegitimate that'll close the economy and then they'll have the military remove it.
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  And Pelosi, of course, a month ago shed in a four minute rant that she second command.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  No, it's the vice president.
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  She sees that whole regime as an enemy regime like a foreign country.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  They're going to topple.
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  And it doesn't matter what he does or if he doesn't leave the White House.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  Because they're going to have their own inauguration.
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.000]  She told everybody the plan and you can see all the pieces set up.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  It's like your kids like Legos and sometimes, you know, it's out of the box.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  You don't know what it is.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  It's a bag.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  It's like a spaceship.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  Yes, he ray guns and a cockpit and engines and your daughter walks in.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Hey, what is it?
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  Oh, it's a spaceship.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  You can see all the pieces and you're like, oh, there it is.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  And then it's exactly what we said it was like, oh my God.
[20:02.000 --> 20:07.000]  And so praise God, and I mean that from bottom of my heart, that I've been begging you to get the word out.
[20:07.000 --> 20:08.000]  You've done it.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  We've pointed it out.
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.000]  Others have picked it up.
[20:10.000 --> 20:16.000]  It's now on Hannity Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, Breitbart, and hell it's on CNN.
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  They're saying the military is going to overthrow the president.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  And now we know their main plan.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  They might try to change him at the inauguration.
[20:23.000 --> 20:30.000]  They might pull something, you know, especially at the nomination of Biden.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  Something can happen there.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  They could pull another curveball on us, detonate a nuke in a major city, release a more deadly bio weapon.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  I mean, we're in the time of crazy town.
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  But all their pre-programming, the way the lawyers and psychiatrists and psychologists operate,
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  they always tell you what they're going to do because they prepare you in the media with the talking point.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  So when it happens, they're geniuses.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  And so everyone's acclimated and ready for it.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  And so I really wanted to pray on air the last few months, and I'm not a shy person when it comes to covering news.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  I'm not shy in front of a crowd of people.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  I just never have been.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  But praying in front of people is a personal thing with me.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  I do pray a lot.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  It's something that almost feels like I'm a Pharisee doing it.
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  But God has told me in very strong, you know, Holy Spirit push that we need to pray every day on air.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  We need to invoke the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord the Savior, and thank God for sending Jesus to us.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  And we just need to hold up that standard against the enemy flood.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  As the Bible says, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up the standard against it.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  So we start the next segment.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  I'm going to pray and I hope you'll pray with me.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  It's not a prepared prayer.
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.000]  I probably start crying, but because when I pray, I feel the Spirit of God so much stronger.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  And just so much comes to you and it's just so clear.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  So start thinking about it.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  I come into God's presence.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  God's presence is always there.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  When you pray with God, you actually have that connection.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  It just opens up and it's powerful.
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  But this is the time for us to be praying for our children, our future and everything.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  Because we're faced with pure evil and it's going to become extremely obvious what we're facing and what we're dealing with.
[22:14.000 --> 22:23.000]  But just listen to this horrible crone, this ringwraith, this reanimated corpse up there reading her talking points, but going too far.
[22:23.000 --> 22:30.000]  How she met with the military over COG and all the trouble they've stirred up and the sellout of the country.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  She even came out yesterday and said she's on the side of communist China.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  Joe Biden said we should let China run every aspect of our lives.
[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  I mean, they're just out in the open, inoculating you to the fact that they're enemies of the country.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  It's ridiculous what they've trained us to accept.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  Now our kids wear a mask, perfect for child smugglers.
[22:49.000 --> 22:57.000]  All of this is their pervert, freak-o cult world.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  I wouldn't want to be Nancy Pelosi when God gets ahold of her.
[23:02.000 --> 23:08.000]  Because there's no coming back for that witch or her governor, son-in-law or any of those people.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  But here she is, the final pieces fall into place now.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  This is exactly what the New York Times is in on the phone called D&C War Game.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  We're not just going to concede.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  We're going to have the Democrat states break off.
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.000]  We'll have our inauguration, it says it, and make Joe Biden the president and whoever the hell else he signed on.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  He'll step aside.
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  Perfect communist system where it's a committee of the Democrats will decide whoever they want to be president.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  This is like the Politburo in China.
[23:37.000 --> 23:43.000]  Barr came out in the interview last night on Fox News with Mr. Levin.
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  And it was powerful.
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  I saw it this morning and he said, excerpt seven, he said, this is all malice.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  This is a malice playbook.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  You're like, wow, people are like, wow, he's saying malice like you've been saying, it is a malice playbook.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  It's not like they're following my talking points.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  It's what it is.
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.000]  Jesus.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  Here's Pelosi.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  Here she is.
[24:10.000 --> 24:20.000]  Because he might not want to move out of the White House, doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the United States.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  And I just, you know, I'm second in line to the presidency.
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  And just last week I had my regular continuation of government briefing.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  This might interest you because it's, I say to them, this is never going to happen.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  God willing, it never will.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  But there is a process.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  It has nothing to do with it.
[24:40.000 --> 24:49.000]  The certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  It's not a geography or location.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  It's not geography or location.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  It's California.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  It's New York.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  It's Colorado where they happen to have the COG headquarters.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  And then I read the New York Times transcript where they're now introducing to you the plan.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  We're going to go to break.
[25:10.000 --> 25:22.000]  But it's like I told listeners, if you haven't gotten your storeable food before all this happens in 84 days, if you haven't gotten your firearms, if you haven't gotten prepared, if you haven't talked to your neighbors, you're insane.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  And if you're not calling talk radio and going to city council and paying local companies to fly airplanes with messages on them.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  I mean, everybody better do something now and not just say, oh, that's what Trump and Alex Jones do.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  And I'm not bitching at you.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  I'm just saying it's on.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  And I told people, you better buy our products because the supply chain is breaking down.
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  A lot of our supplements we can't even get anymore because of the COVID hysteria and the warehouses locking down and all the fear that was all designed.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  And the food shortages and the food prices are going up, but my patriot hasn't gone up info war store.com.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  Go there.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  It takes two to four weeks to get the food.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  See, I'm so crazy.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  I even got my sunglasses on.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  I didn't realize I've got those on.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  All of this is unfolding, ladies and gentlemen now.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  So get ready.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  And yes, we need funds to go in the future.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  But I don't even know if we'll be here in six months, four months.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  I mean, this is this is on folks.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  Because once they take Trump out and do this session, they're going to be empowered and just run around murdering everybody.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  And a lot of the police are just going to roll over and bow to it.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  And then we're going to be inside the new Soviet Union.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  And it's going to be a one hell of a war.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  And it will be a war and they will pay.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  But seriously, better get your swarable foods now and info war store.com.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  I told you, everybody was buying up and selling out all the food from all these crappy places.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  And I told you, no, now's the time to get the food, not for COVID, but for the crises.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  They're engineering.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  Get your supplements.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  Get your books.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  Get your films.
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  Get your info wars t-shirts while you still can.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  I'm serious.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  I don't know if we'll be here in three months.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  I don't know if the country will be here.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  I hope and pray it will.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  But only about being honest about how much trouble we're in.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Can we get ready and stop it?
[26:52.000 --> 27:11.000]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day that we were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones.
[27:11.000 --> 27:25.000]  And I'm sure you'll realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life, sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with the deep state to impress not just high profile people of the general public.
[27:25.000 --> 27:37.000]  That's why folks are taking back control their lives with these little Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping at every few seconds and track your location.
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  This is the only way to have your privacy and people are taking their privacy back.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  And it's very, very exciting.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  They're at $19.95 a piece at MFullWareStore.com.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  We forward even more huge shipments coming in next week.

[28:54.000 --> 29:13.000]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated and then died. And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be innovation. We know what's going to happen.
[29:13.000 --> 29:26.000]  It's a blue city, same story yet again, and they say her heart gave out. If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record, want everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[29:26.000 --> 29:36.000]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states? It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[29:36.000 --> 29:45.000]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying, it will kill you. But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[29:45.000 --> 30:09.000]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading. Don't end up like Vicki Gibbs or everyone.
[30:09.000 --> 30:19.000]  You look like an angel, look like an angel, walk like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel.
[30:19.000 --> 30:33.000]  But I got wise, but I got wise, you're a devil, you're the devil in disguise. Oh yes you are, but they're not devils in disguise anymore.
[30:33.000 --> 30:47.000]  You fool me with your kisses, you cheated on your skin, heaven knows how you lied to me, and not the way you see.
[30:47.000 --> 30:59.000]  She looks like an angel. You look like an angel, walk like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, talk like an angel.
[30:59.000 --> 31:08.000]  But I got wise, you're the devil in disguise. Oh yes you are.
[31:08.000 --> 31:17.000]  Thanks for joining us today. Okay, I literally, probably out of 150 incredible articles, incredibly important clips, all this stuff's important.
[31:17.000 --> 31:25.000]  I'm just going to tell listeners again, I know you understand, but we're not in normal times anymore.
[31:25.000 --> 31:38.000]  The economy is not going to make its move. They're making their move with the COVID hoax and the lockdown, and the abnormal sea being made normal, and the new normal, and the race riots that are 90% white people,
[31:38.000 --> 31:47.000]  literally funded by Soros and Clinton and Obama, running around, burning, attacking, and then going, gaslighting the public, going, it's insane.
[31:47.000 --> 31:54.000]  The police, the federal building, when they tried to burn it down, they did something, that's terrorism.
[31:54.000 --> 32:05.000]  They're invoking a revolution against what's left of the federal government, which they themselves have built up in control, but now they're in the process of overtaking it and fully conquering it.
[32:05.000 --> 32:13.000]  And of course, they're idiot, $10 an hour, $20 an hour morons that are hired to beat up old ladies and stuff and pour paint on their face.
[32:13.000 --> 32:21.000]  They're never going to have any seat at the table and have power, but they've been promised a Marxist revolutionary takeover.
[32:21.000 --> 32:28.000]  And I'll say this, they couldn't get the Hispanics to do this, some are there, maybe 5%, they couldn't get the blacks to do it.
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  I've been to the events, I've seen thousands of videos show you, it's 90% white.
[32:33.000 --> 32:44.000]  And I'm not blaming whites because they're bad people, but just the idea that this is black people is totally and completely democratic party saying they represent black people,
[32:44.000 --> 32:54.000]  and it's three obese black lesbian women who say they hate men and who say ending the patriarchy and ending nuclear families is what they want.
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.000]  That means ending black people, which they've done a pretty good job of.
[32:59.000 --> 33:09.000]  Because you kicked dad out of the house, the state is dead, although become a leftist and cut their genitals off, that's their plan, or the local gangbangers dead.
[33:09.000 --> 33:21.000]  Black illegitimacy was lower than white illegitimacy in the 30s and 40s, because under pressure and persecution blacks clung to Christ, the Christianity became strong,
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  not defending the institutions of oppression, but what makes a diamond is pressure.
[33:25.000 --> 33:41.000]  Within 20 years of the men being turned out of the house, the women paid to have a bunch of kids with no man around, the black neighborhoods were turned into anarchic hellholes.
[33:41.000 --> 33:51.000]  Because no one was there to whip the ass of the young men when they didn't do their chores or smart off the mom.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  Worked like a charm. Oh, we're freeing you black people.
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  But the letters of LBJ, he said, I'm going to stop these up in the n words while I have them voting Democrat for 200 years.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  And they got it.
[34:04.000 --> 34:12.000]  At least 60 years.
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  Democratic Party is a cancer.
[34:14.000 --> 34:22.000]  The old Republican Party was once a blue blood country club people intimidated by the left because the left controlled the media.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  But I always saw the Republican as the weak point in the enemy structure.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  We could take it over with a populist movement reboot with 1776 ideals for all.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  That'd be a hell of a challenge to globalism and slavery.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And I bet paid off your bet paid off.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  I just believed in you.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  Yeah, I believed in you.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  And you know what? It paid off for all of us. But now we're in the fight.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  It's one thing to take the ball away from the enemy.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  Now we got to score.
[34:53.000 --> 35:05.000]  And we've been scoring, making them come out of the shadows and expose their Satanism, their pedophilia, their anti-Americanism, their chai-com affiliation.
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.000]  And we're going to keep forcing them out.
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  Oh, we're winning.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  They have they've had to throw everything they've got.
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  They've had to uncloak.
[35:10.000 --> 35:18.000]  They've had to just just throw caution in the wind on a suicide mission on a ghost dance against us.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  But they could grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  And I want to make sure they don't get out of the jaws of defeat.
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.000]  I want to make sure they get swallowed because we're so beat down and so turned against each other and so sick and so decadent.
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  With the best government you could imagine, we're going to have trouble getting back to any form of goodness.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  But you know what? Sometimes you don't come up for air until you hit the bottom.
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  I think Russia is the model throwing these Hollywood, globalist comebacks out.
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.000]  And as an example of how we could turn the corner culturally and rediscover who we are.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  I said I was going to pray this segment.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  I just try to do it next segment, but I just I need to do this every day.
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  It's it's a very personal thing for me, but we need to do public prayer and God's told me that I'm going to do it.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  So I'm sure my responsibility right now, but I'll do it.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  Let's do this. Let's just do this.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  Let me go ahead and just read you this report.
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.000]  Here it is in Breitbart Democrats war game for election includes West Coast succession possible civil war.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  I mean, that's what they say.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  And this is at the highest levels of a credit party.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  How the media could get the election story wrong.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  That's the little camouflage Ben Smith headline.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  You read it. It's the battle plan to the faithful.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  So let's read over this.
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.000]  This is Ben Smith at Ben at BE New York Times knew.
[36:52.000 --> 37:01.000]  John Podesta played Biden in election war game and refused to concede in a scenario that looked a bit like 2016.
[37:01.000 --> 37:09.000]  A big popular win for Joe Biden and a narrow electoral defeat presumably reached after weeks of counting the votes in Pennsylvania.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  For their war game, they cashed John Podesta.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  It was Hillary Clinton's campaign share in the role of Mr. Biden.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  They expected him when the votes came in to concede justice.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  Miss Clinton had done.
[37:23.000 --> 37:34.000]  But Mr. Podesta playing Mr. Biden shocked the organizers by saying he felt his party wouldn't let him concede.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  So this is them introducing with Democrats their plan.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  Oh, but it's just a drill.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  It's just like COVID-19 event 201 was the exact attack by Gates.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Just a war game.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  Should we have war games about going and taking all the Democrat leaders?
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  I mean, I'm not saying we should but see that's that's how you cover planning.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  Oh, it's just hypothetical Dungeons and Dragons game we're playing.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  It's not real.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Just a drill.
[37:56.000 --> 38:04.000]  But Mr. Podesta playing Mr. Biden shocked the organizers by saying he felt his party wouldn't let him concede.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  Alleging voter suppression.
[38:06.000 --> 38:14.000]  He persuaded the governors of Wisconsin, Michigan to send pro Biden electors to electoral college that gives the cover of legality.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  It's not.
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  In the scenario, and this is where the real secession comes in the real civil war.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  Notice they think, oh, we'll send electors and the real meat comes in later.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Oh, and by the way, we'll have a secession.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  A new country.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  Just know that's a side topic.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  In the scenario, California, Oregon and Washington then threatened to secede.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  The United States and Mr. Trump took office as planned.
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.000]  The House named Mr. Biden president, the Senate and the White House struck with Trump.
[38:45.000 --> 38:54.000]  At that point, the scenario of the nation stopped looking to the media for cues and wanted to see what the military would do.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  A big popular win for Joe Biden and narrow electoral defeat presumably recent for weeks.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  Counting the votes that goes on.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  That's their plan.
[39:05.000 --> 39:16.000]  And they're sticking to it because Pelosi and Biden and Obama and Hillary for all the illegal spying and being chai-com agents and destroying the borders and devaluing everything.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  And maneuvering us towards financial collapse and saying the dollar is going to die on the news trying to hurt the country.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  I mean, just incredible criminal activity.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  Like a horde of gremlins burning down the castle.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  And then now they're saying the military must remove Trump because he caused this.
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.000]  Wow, you imagine if they remove Trump, what it will be like with these empowered crazies that think they're invincible.
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.000]  These psychotic sociopathic narcissists, what it will be like.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  This is their plan.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  They're going to execute it.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  What are we going to do?
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  84 days.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  84 days.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  I'm telling you, man, this is it.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[39:57.000 --> 40:03.000]  All based on WHO, Bill of Malinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives.
[40:03.000 --> 40:13.000]  But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories, our schools, our parks closed.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  It is outrageous.
[40:15.000 --> 40:26.000]  Well, we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America Back to School Special 50 to 60% off all of our top sellers and double

[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  Our suppliers, the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  And they've got the food with four factories in stock, takes them two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you.

[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  The economic system is collapsing.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  The third world is already starving to death.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  Food prices are exploding here.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  The farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID hoax.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  You need to get your storeable food while you still can at infowarstore.com.

[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  We are back live.
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  Now, let me get into this.
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.000]  If we just look at the looting and the rioting that happened last night in Chicago, it'll be ongoing tonight.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  Oh, it's because of George Floyd.
[44:35.000 --> 44:42.000]  No, a man waving a gun around at police in front of witnesses was shot and was not killed.
[44:42.000 --> 44:53.000]  And so now if police ever engage a criminal in Chicago or Dallas or Austin or New York or Oakland or Portland,
[44:53.000 --> 45:01.000]  or if, you know, people call the cops to a house party they don't want to be going on because of a COVID lockdown and somebody pulls a gun on the cops and the cops shoot them.
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  Well, then it's your time to go out and riot and loot and burn.
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  And this is not predominantly white people that are antifa.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  This is predominantly black people.
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  But a few white folks in Hispanics are in there.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  I've watched a bunch of videos.
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.000]  They're all in infowars.com going around and looting hundreds of stores and setting fires.
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.000]  And while they are stealing the jewelry and the electronics, they're saying, I can't breathe.
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.000]  I can't breathe because that's like the magic get out of jail free card.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  Because I mean, that's why you're doing this.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  That's why you're robbing a store.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  They probably won't come back to your neighborhood.
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  And so this is the idea of what's supposed to happen.
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  The black folks, when the media pushes them to do this are going out on average and looting and robbing.
[45:51.000 --> 45:58.000]  The white folks are there trying to get them to burn down the police stations and the federal buildings, but that's not going too well.
[45:58.000 --> 46:06.000]  But this is all the cover that the media has put out when the McCloskey's, you know, defend their own home from folks saying, we're going to kill you, Whitey.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  We're going to burn down your house, a white group leading a black mob.
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  They come out and point guns legally and they get indicted because the message is you can go out and look.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  You can go out and kill.
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  You can go out and ransack and like something out of a medieval history book.
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.000]  They have all those canals in Chicago right off the great lake there.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  They raise the draw bridges.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  You know, the big bridges that open and close the ships can go through.
[46:36.000 --> 46:44.000]  They raised and lowered the draw bridges, literally show the looters couldn't get to other areas because they were trying to then go into the neighborhoods.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  And I've got all these videos.
[46:47.000 --> 47:03.000]  In fact, chew that up a few minutes of antiflays now in the suburbs of Portland, the suburbs of Colorado, going up to people's houses randomly at night and screaming at 2am, we're going to burn your house down.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  Back that up. Let's play with audio here in a minute.
[47:05.000 --> 47:12.000]  Imagine people randomly come to your house, shine lights in and say, I'm going to burn your house down.
[47:12.000 --> 47:20.000]  It ain't the big bad wolf of I'm going to huff and I'm going to puff and I'm going to burn your house down.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  It's crazy method white people.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  You haven't done and a lot of times it's black people in the houses.
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.000]  They'll jerk black people out of cars.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  They'll beat the hell out of the white cracker heads.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  I mean, this is all you say.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  Well, doesn't make sense.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  It's just the cover for overthrowing Trump saying it's his fault.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  And now the Democrats say that.
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.000]  And that's why the big tech censoring and the media censoring and, oh, not letting you know about the black on white crime or all this crap,
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  because they don't want the public to know they want you to buy that when everything burns down in 84 days,
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.000]  when Trump wins by landslide, which they know is going to happen, that it's because of him.
[47:55.000 --> 48:01.000]  Yes, a roll the audio of people with bullhorns at random houses at night saying we're going to burn your house down.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  That's a threat.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  I got to tell you, man, if people were in my house saying we're going to burn it down,
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  I would train a rifle on them and if they lit up a Molov cocktail, I'd light them up.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  Because I don't want to kill these sacks of garbage, but you're going to kill me.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  You're going to burn my family up, you crazy people.
[48:19.000 --> 48:41.000]  Here, go ahead and roll the video.
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  Can you imagine the police acting like this?
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  If the police acted like this, I'd say they were a tyranny and I'd say overthrow them.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  That's not what's happening.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  We're going to burn your house down because you're white.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  I see a white head pop up. We're going to burn you down, white person.
[49:03.000 --> 49:14.000]  You hear any black sounding, those are white trendies that want to go out and be thug criminals.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  We're going to burn your building down. We're going to kill you and your family.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  We're nice people.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  We're not violent. We're not bad.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  You're like, why would the Democrats do this?
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  Because they failed in their Russiagate.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  They failed in their illegal spine.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  They failed in Ukrainegate. They failed in Sexgate.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  Jeffrey Epstein's in trouble. The Clintons are in trouble.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  Their whole house of cards is coming down. So what are they going to do?
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  They're going to legitimize in the media the criminal element to go out and do whatever they want.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  But I'll give it to the black folks in Chicago.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  They're just going and rob inexpensive stores. That's bad enough, hurting their community.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  But at least they're not threatening to burn down people in their houses.
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  I mean, the scum level of that.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  But let's play the audio and the video of the woman.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  While she's robbing the store, she chants it like it's okay.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  Like she's given absolution, like she's given immunity because I can't breathe.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  I can't breathe. Well, yeah, you're wearing a dumb mask idiot.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  But that's like her mindless chant.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  There's some drugged out guy died in Minnesota with Democrat training.
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  The police are treating him like their social workers.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  The cop has got a crowd around him threatening him.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  He doesn't pay attention that he's got his not on the head, but the carotid artery.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  And the guy dies. The cop wanted to go to jail.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  The cop wants to be indicted for murder one.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  No, no, no, it doesn't do with George Floyd, folks.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  This is about race war as a smoke screen for the martial law that has been announced
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  when they have state secede and they hope the military will take Trump out
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  and they believe the military has agreed to it.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  So I'm saying let's have a national debate about what's coming so they don't hit his flat footed.
[50:53.000 --> 50:59.000]  And the good news is praise the Lord.
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  In fact, I'll say that prayer. I said I'd say it a moment, but just go ahead and roll the lady with her chant.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  I can't breathe while she robs. Here it is.
[51:06.000 --> 51:11.000]  They tried to pull it out, but it ain't coming out.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  I don't know what a f**king key that's all.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  Gee, these bitches not in here.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  Stay on the next floor, though. Let me see what they got to put him here.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  Hold on. Let me see.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  Did I say Valentina?
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  Let's take it. Don't take a bomb.
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.000]  Hold on. Let me find me some first time. Hold on.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  I can't breathe.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  Let me see.
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.000]  These little swaps are slapping.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  What you got?
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  Hey, how you get these Canada Gooses off?
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  How you get these Canada Gooses off?
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  They over there.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  How the f**k you get there?
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.000]  There ain't no scissors in this, bitch.
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  You know it, because I'm a girl, baby.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  Hey, can y'all get this Canada Goose hoodie?
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  Fuck me, y'all.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  And the videos go on and on and on.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  I'm just going to say this right now.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  We have to seek God's face.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  We have to repent for everything we've individually done.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  We've all been decked and we've all been slobs.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  We have to come together and realize this is spiritual evil
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  that has been injected into us to bring down our nation.
[52:29.000 --> 52:35.000]  And I just pray to God that our Heavenly Father through His Son,
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  Jesus Christ, and the debt of blood that was paid for our sins,
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  that the Holy Spirit move across the face of not just America,
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  but the world to awaken people to a revival to say no to evil
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  and to reject what's happened and to stand up against it
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  and have the courage to speak out against this evil attempt
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  to take down our nation.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  We know we don't deserve redemption.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  We know we don't deserve a reprieve.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  We know we're evil and we're bad and our greatest works are dirty rags,
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  but we care about the unborn and we're so close to restricting
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  and banning abortion and we're so close to turn the tide
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  and the enemy's throwing everything at us.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  So I just ask God to move people's hearts at the highest
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  and the lowest level to realize that this is a spiritual choice
[53:20.000 --> 53:25.000]  and that the planet awaken and reject Satan
[53:25.000 --> 53:29.000]  and that the people understand that there is a true ticking time bomb
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  and the secession and the collapse of the Republic
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.000]  and untold suffering and bondage and collapse and just total enslavement.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  And I pray that we be given a reprieve,
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  but we not just take that reprieve and throw it to the side,
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  like spoiled brats, but that we understand now that we have to set
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  about rebuilding civilization and society,
[53:49.000 --> 53:56.000]  not just here, but around the world for a true Christ-based future. Amen.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  That's my best impromptu prayer.
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  And it's not like a real prayer when I'm really reaching out to God
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  because I don't really even speak when I'm praying to God.
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.000]  But it's just, we cannot count the cost here if this goes sideways
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  and it already is.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  And folks, if you think things are bad, it's going to get worse.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  Like when you start sliding on ice and you're going off the road
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  and you kind of hit that first fence and all of a sudden there's a hill.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  It's happened to me once, all of a sudden you're like tumbling down a hillside
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  and your car's rolling, you're like, you hope you make it.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  I mean, we're just now going off the road right now.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  We're like, I mean, it's going to get bad.
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.000]  I'm just saying, brace yourself for impact because this is it.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  We've had it so good so long.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  We conjured these wolves and they're here, folks.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  They're here to take us down.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  It's finally here.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  Available now for 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.000]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power
[55:11.000 --> 55:17.000]  of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  into the ultimate spray formula.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health,
[55:25.000 --> 55:29.000]  healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.000]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off-intro pricing
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[55:36.000 --> 56:05.000]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfowarsStore.com.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  Think about that.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  A woman can kill her baby.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  We pay for illegal aliens' health care.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20-plus times
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  This is about the WHO and the globalists testing their power
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  through the media, over the federal government,
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  to set policy in the United States.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  and the Paris Accord and all of it.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  And by the way, they admit that.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  They say, now you're carbon's down, one way or another.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  You stupid Americans.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:54.000 --> 57:00.000]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's plain to see.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  I'm losing weight and a turn in my tail.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  All right.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  We have a special guest joining us that goes down the mine shafts
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  of the pedophilia.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  It's important.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  It's sickening.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  We're going to cover it.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  The children deserve the truth to come out.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  And I've got a very special Brian Stelter piece.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  I'll play in the third hour and I'll get into all the latest
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  covered fraud as well coming up.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  But before John Paul Rice joins us, the producer, director,
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  and a star called that Hollywood thing comes up.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  Let's go to this special report.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  Brian Stelter's fantasy fun time.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  After years of relentless, shameful, anti-executive office
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  takedown tactics, Brian Stelter actually had this exchange
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  on his fantasy land weekend show.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Aaron, your view of this.
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  You know, when you see entire media companies
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  essentially exist to tear down Joe Biden,
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  is there an equivalent to that on the left tearing down Trump?
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  There really isn't.
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  And, you know, when I would say it's really a diet of this type
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  of information that a lot of these voters are getting.
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  A lot of the voters that I talk to, I can, you know,
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  when I interview them, I do hear them saying a lot of the talking
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  points that sound very familiar from some of these shows,
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  which I try to listen to.
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  You know, you can hear these comments being echoed by voters
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  and you know that this is the diet that they're on,
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  you know, AM radio, you know, conservative talk.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  This is the big number on the main question.
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  Should the Senate vote to convict and remove
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  President Trump from office?
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  A slim majority of Americans in this poll, Breonna,
[58:40.000 --> 58:45.000]  51% say yes, 45% say no.
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  Just think about how far we have slid down
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  these slippery slope of the mountain
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.000]  in just a handful of years.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  This president is impeached for life.
[58:52.000 --> 58:56.000]  There's nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  On the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist.
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  Now people are also saying that the president...
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  I don't know why you'd say that.
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  It's such a racist question.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  There are some people that say that now the Republican Party
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  is seeing a supporting white nationalist
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  because of your rhetoric.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  I don't believe that.
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  What do you make of that?
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.000]  I don't believe that.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  I just, well, I don't know.
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.000]  Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  with African Americans?
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  Do you think Donald Trump is racist?
[59:18.000 --> 59:19.000]  I do.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Why doesn't President Trump condemn racism?
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  His own words and actions tell you why he's a racist.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  Stelter exists in a parallel news universe
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.000]  of his own making where he is America's redeemer
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.000]  and his disciples are sent out among us
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  to rid the world of truths they don't understand.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  Look at this right here.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  The guy that goes around policing
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  and calling for censorship
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  and then claims that Trump's wrong.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  There's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  You are incredibly shameful.
[59:48.000 --> 59:49.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[59:49.000 --> 59:50.000]  You're just a...
[59:50.000 --> 59:51.000]  Look at you.
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  You are literally an anti-American,
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  anti-free speech coward.
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  You're going to go down the history books
[59:57.000 --> 59:58.000]  at the Criminal News Network.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  Only someone like a Brian Stelter
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  who was obviously born yesterday
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  wouldn't have noticed that the 92% of media coverage
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  that is negative against President Trump
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  began even before President Trump set foot
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  in the Oval Office and a portion of it by Stelter himself.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Number one, just how low will the deception
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  go? How deep will the deceit go?
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Trump's defense is predicated on cheap slogans
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  like coup and hoax.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  He's constantly contradicting himself,
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  saying those slogans over and over again.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  You know, one minute he says,
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  read the transcript of his call.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  The next minute he says that Adam Schiff
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  is going to doctor the deposition transcripts.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Well, it reads like a classic organized crime shakedown.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  Shorn of its rambling character
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  and in not so many words,
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  this is the essence of what the president communicates.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  We've been very good to your country, very good.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  No other country has done as much as we have.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  But you know what?
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  I don't see much reciprocity here.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  I hear what you want.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  I have a favor I want from you, though.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  And I'm going to say this only seven times
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  so you better listen good.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Understand lots of it.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  On this and on that,
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I'm going to put you in touch with people,
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  not just any people.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  I'm going to put you in touch with attorney general
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  CNN is a cultural information disease,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  a full-blown propaganda arm
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  shelling out conspiracies of the socialists left
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  for their globalist paychecks.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Anyone held in its sway should see a mental health care provider.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  All right.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  You know if a Winfrey came out last year
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  and said children and joy being molested.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Well, the whole house of cards is coming down.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  We're going to talk about it straight ahead.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  I'm Alex Reynolds, infowars.com.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF frequencies.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  are constantly spying on us,
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location,
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  but recording audio and video as well,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  with or without a battery.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Now, with the Info Wars privacy pouch,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  you can go dark wherever you choose.

[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Welcome back.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  And we've got John Paul Rice,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  who's been an actor in some big films,
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  produced a lot of successful films as well.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  He put out a child's voice that was very popular on Amazon.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  He's put out six films and it got censored.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  It got blocked.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  We're going to play you that trailer coming up here in a few minutes
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  and he'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  But I wanted to set the table here
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  with just some of the things that recently came out
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  in just the last few days.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  First off, Oprah Winfrey said,
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  I've said for years if the abuser is any good,
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  then you won't even know it's happened,
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  that young children enjoyed being molested.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  It feels good.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  We're going to play you that clip in a moment.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  No, it doesn't feel good.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Meanwhile, she defended and supports Faith Healer,
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  who's now been convicted of keeping women
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  in subterranean breeding pits
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  and their children for all sorts of satanic purposes.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  John of God.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  But it seems like every month or so,
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  I see a new article out about transgender baby dolls,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  dolls that you punch the button and it says,
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  I love Satan, have sex with me, you know, stuff like that.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Well, now Hasbro has recalled a toy with secret button,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  wasn't even advertised on private area that makes doll gasp and giggle.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  So this is just a full on assault of this cult.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  They can train us to not care about our children.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  We'll roll over to anything.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  It's the last frontier for the Satanist.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Here's a clip of the video.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Okay, I wanted to do a quick video
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  because I find this disturbing
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  and I find it something that needs to be shared.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  As you all know, stuff that's been going on in the world
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  about the sex trafficking in kids
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  and things that are thrown in our kids' faces
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  to kind of groom them and make them kind of a little bit more oblivious
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  to things that are really happening.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  So it was my daughter's birthday a couple days ago
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  and she turned two and she was given this gift.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  It's like a little puppy doll.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  It's adorable.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  And here's the box.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  So she had a puppy birthday and so they gave her this.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  It's just from the new movie, The Trolls World Tour.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  On the box, it says giggle and sing poppy.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  On the back, it says that if you push her tummy right here.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  Sorry, it's glaring.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  If you push her tummy right here, she makes 10 phrases and sounds
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  and that's all it talks about when it comes with a little comb.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  So, I mean, she does all that.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  She touches her tummy and she makes little singing sounds
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  and she's super cute.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Well, I'm showing her to my husband.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  In a moment, we'll show you where she hits the button
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  and it makes the sound.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  But before we go to that, let's go to what Oprah Winfrey
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  just had to say last year.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  And again, she's part of the secret Epstein group,
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  secret depopulation group with Bill Gates,
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Warren Buffett, Ted Turner.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  She runs orphanages worldwide.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  And she was a child prostitute herself.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  A lot of times, those have become abusers.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  And here she is.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  So, this is what so many people don't understand.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  A big part of the confusion and shame for child victims
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  is that the attention and the seduction from the predator,
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  who is probably going to be somebody you know.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  In order for it to work, it has to be somebody you know,
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  somebody you admire, somebody you respect,
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  or maybe even love.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  And it feels good.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  I mean, if you're seven years old and somebody,
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  which I was trying to say this to my friends who had children,
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  you're seven years old and someone is stroking your penis,
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  it feels good.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Even though you don't have a name for what that is,
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  it feels good.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  And when I first said this years ago,
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  people were like, you're crazy because everybody wants to believe
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  it's like sexual assault and you're being thrown up against the wall
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  and you're being raped.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And I have said for years, if the abuser is any good,
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  you won't even know it's happened.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  You will be in it and you won't even know it's happened.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  And if the abuser is any good, he or she is going to make you feel like
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  you're a part of it.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  I mean, and nothing is more being a part of it
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  than what we discussed earlier,
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  then you say you were married.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  You had marriage vows and you had wings.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Meanwhile, a very famous wrestler,
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  former WE wrestler, Adams, admits killing,
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  pedophile abuser, LGBT media insinuates it was homophobic murder,
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  former WWE superstar, Shawn Michaels,
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  the rockers tag team partner,
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  and they go on to talk about the person raping him,
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  so they killed him and they're saying that's bad.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  This was loving gay sex.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  And again, I don't see myself as abused because it didn't go too far.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  I'm not in a victimology,
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  but Terry Crews talked about in Hollywood,
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  he'd be in a party and he's a big muscular black dude.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  So imagine what they do to kids and women.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And producers would just grab him by the balls.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  I had that happen three times where it was like a handshake with these guys.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  And I threatened to kick their ass twice.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  One time the guy grabbed my balls, jumped in this car and drove away.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  And he was a well-known producer and he'll actually quote a patriot.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  He died soon thereafter of cancer.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And I'm only telling the story because it's real.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Now when I was about three years old,
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  they had a kid lived down the street named Joey,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  who was like, I guess, 12 or so.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And my parents only had him keep it for like an hour.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  He usually had a girl that kept me.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  And he abused me and I pushed him off me when I'm three and I did not like it.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  So I can tell you at three years old having my penis stroke did not feel good.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  And I only tell the story because Oprah, you don't have a penis, you don't know.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  So you may have enjoyed being abused as you would make you were.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  A lot of folks get into it and you abuse others.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  You run orphanages, you're involved with pedophiles, you're involved with Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  You're a prime candidate.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  And the word is you are a pedophile.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  I mean, we know you're a lesbian, but that's legal.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  We're not attacking you for that.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  So that's what all this is about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  And so I'll just go ahead and tell you that stuff on there.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Because that's the reality Oprah.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  No, it was not enjoyable.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I didn't like it.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I have a memory of it.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  I didn't like it.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  I told my dad right away.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  And let's just say there was some blood involved.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Some people got their asses beat.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  So that's the reality of what goes on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  And I did not enjoy it.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  How dare you say something like that?
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  Oh, they enjoy it.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  That's the pedophile entrance.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  And then it's like, oh, make kids where they have a choice, lower the age.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  And that's something that we see being pushed by these people.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  They want to destroy the innocence.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Truly, absolutely, absolutely horrific.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  And then she goes back to the doll once she pushes the button.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  This was being sold in Walmart, Target, everywhere.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  I didn't even tell you it has this other button.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  Has 12 sounds come out of the one on the belly.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  Oh, this is the one on the vagina.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Here it is.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  And I heard some other sounds that I had never heard before.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  And if you look down here, I figured a video was the best way.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  So I just touched her tummy and she's going to sing for a minute.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  But down here is a button right here on her privates.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  And if you push those, she makes these sounds.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  Jocelyn Elders taught to teach babies to masturbate.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  That's the U.S.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  And I know some of you may not like, think this is a big deal.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Oh, it's totally designed for that.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  But since I've had kids, like this is wrong.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  For one, this button, it says nothing about this button on the box.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Nothing.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Oh, it's 100%. And the color is the trans color and the pedophile color.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  That's their flag.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  That light blue on pink.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  So that's it.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  This is their religion.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Like when Tony Podesta was in the 2007 Washington Post saying,
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  yeah, I'm into kids naked.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  I've got a dungeon and it's putting it out in the open in your face.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  John Paul Rice will join us for the rest of the hour.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  We'll play the trailer for a child's voice, which has been silenced by Amazon.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  That's what they do.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  They grab them, they put a mask over their face.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  They cover them up.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  This is perfect for tracking, by the way, because Trump's got face scanning cameras
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  trying to find children.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Well, now all the kids are wearing masks.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Normally you see kids wearing masks out and about getting put in vans.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  You call the police, but now see it's all normal.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  And TSA has trained you to accept this and go along with all this.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  So it's all part of a larger evil satanic plan.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  It's like in every culture that went under, pedophilia, Satanism, sex with virgins.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  That means a child became the mainline operation.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  So John Paul Rice will join us.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  He knows a lot about these rings in Hollywood.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Very eloquent, very powerful Facebook posts.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  We mirrored it banned on video.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  So when we come back, you'll have the floor to get into how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  He wants to come on and talk about pedophile rings and not his film,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  but I want to talk about the film and why they were so scared of it
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  and how people can hopefully amplify it in the one place.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  It's still available for now.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  No restrictions.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  E N T dot com.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  It's on Vimeo.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I'm Alex Jones with info wars dot com.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  The only way we expose this satanic network is by you having the courage to tell the truth
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  and take action in full wars dot com news wars dot com.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  They end up video tomorrow's news today.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Stay with us.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Human freedom.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  The Wild Wild West.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  The Renaissance.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  America.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Human liberty.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  The West built all the freedom, all the choices, all the empowerment we see.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  The general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny brings them prosperity
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  because the last 50 years under psychotic globalist control,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  they have taught us by successive approximation to bow down
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  and each time be given a reward, a treat.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  That's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  and finally one day you lead them into the barn
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  and close the door and butcher them.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  We're now reaching that point in societal development
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  where submission is death, where submission is the human species being destroyed forever
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  on the altar of Satan.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores,
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  our factories, our schools, our parks closed.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  It is outrageous.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  Well, we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America, Back to School Special,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  50 to 60% off all of our top sellers and double patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  And despite the fact that our ultimate turmeric formula bodies is selling out,
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  we still have it at 50% off but for a limited time.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Living Defense, which is beyond probiotics, 50% off.

[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Sushi.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Hi. I'm Tim.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Fuck off.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  So do you know who that was? Of his shooting at you?
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  He was my boyfriend.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Son of a bitch.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Is everything set? Yes.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  This man convinced my boyfriend to start kidnapping kids and stuff.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  And because of shit, can you hear me? Can you hear me?
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Who's there?
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  If you fucking run, Bill will find you and they will hurt you.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  Looks like you need some new clothes.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  I need you to have your shit together.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  You fucking understand?
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  Help me.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  I'm getting stronger.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  I'll help you.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:38.600]  I watched it Saturday, very well done film, very powerful, and it's fiction, but based
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:43.840]  on a lot of real stuff that goes on, imagine that's now censored by Amazon because the
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:45.560]  whole house of cards is coming down.
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.460]  Joining us is John Paul Rice, an independent film producer, six authentic and bold stories
[1:16:50.460 --> 1:16:57.240]  about humans, issues not shown in today's Hollywood movies, 2016 election result motivated
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:01.100]  Rice to do a deep dive on the range of topics over the years to understand how the United
[1:17:01.100 --> 1:17:02.100]  States arrived at Donald Trump.
[1:17:02.100 --> 1:17:07.200]  Being elected president, when researching testimonials from those on the inside, he
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:12.800]  came across Roland Bernard's testimony, which inspired a child's voice.
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:18.120]  His team is in a production on Game Day, a coming of age drama about football family,
[1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:20.360]  family rivalry, and who will win.
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:24.320]  And the new film, again, has been out for a year or so, a child's voice at NoRestrictionsent.com.
[1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:27.360]  So we got about seven minutes till this segment's over.
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:32.000]  We got the floor, a powerful Facebook post you did about what's happening, how you've
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.760]  been censored, and what's coming next.
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:35.760]  Where do you want to start?
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:44.560]  I just want to, first of all, say thank you, Alex, for giving our film, and more importantly,
[1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:50.880]  this issue, a very large platform for which many, many years, there have been brave women
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:57.120]  and men who have tried to come forward and they've lost their lives for doing so.
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:59.020]  They've been silenced.
[1:17:59.020 --> 1:18:05.880]  And I just want to say that what is the most moving part about this whole experience has
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:12.600]  been the thousands of messages from people all over the world who are waking up these
[1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:19.080]  horrors and those who have known about them for decades and heard nothing from the mainstream
[1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:24.760]  media and nothing from the majority of the Washington, D.C. establishment.
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:30.680]  And there are women out there who have messaged me, one who was 53 years old and said, I've
[1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:36.560]  been looking for a reason to live my whole life and hearing your video and seeing the
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:42.680]  response and knowing that there is a way out through EFT, through real healing of these
[1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:44.300]  traumas.
[1:18:44.300 --> 1:18:50.440]  She was motivated to get up and do everything she could to heal herself and prevent this
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:52.640]  from ever happening again.
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:59.560]  And there's other ones out there too that no followers on social media messaged and
[1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:05.600]  said, I have no followers, but I'm going to keep talking about this issue until it breaks
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:07.440]  through.
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:09.360]  And that's why you do this.
[1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:10.720]  That's why you become an artist.
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:16.200]  That's why you get involved with movies that have meaning and purpose because it's not
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.200]  about you.
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:18.600]  It's not about being a star.
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:21.280]  It's not about being famous.
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:27.120]  It's giving something that you learned through the discovery of that journey to be able to
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:32.080]  speak to the world, but you believe, according to what you know, at the time that you're
[1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:38.960]  doing it, and then let everybody else decide what they feel and think about it and do what
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:44.480]  research they wish to do and take what action they wish to take.
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:53.080]  And this movie being censored at this time on Amazon was, as the Wayfair scandal was
[1:19:53.080 --> 1:20:01.240]  coming in, and then the Max, we were building up the Maxwell, the rise of minutes for all
[1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:05.920]  platforms of this film was increasing because people were seeking out information on human
[1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:11.920]  trafficking, and it brings back all of what happened in 2016 with the WikiLeaks and the
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:14.840]  PEDAS talking about Pizzagate.
[1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:17.120]  And you can go back in time and look at the Franklin scandal.
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:18.120]  We can.
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:26.200]  And you can look at all public documents that are out there that have recorded a court case
[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:28.720]  after the court.
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:31.000]  This is not human trafficking.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Absolutely.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.120]  What you're saying is super powerful.
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:37.440]  You're Scott just now started disconnecting, so we're going to reconnect with you right
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:38.440]  now.
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:41.600]  This is so important, and your whole journey and what Hollywood's like and where you
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:42.600]  think this is going.
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:46.200]  You're a very well-spoken gentleman, and we don't want the sky breaking up to get in
[1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:50.280]  the middle of what you have to say, so we'll reconnect with him right now.
[1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:54.800]  You have to understand, listeners, I know because you're not into Satanism, you're not
[1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:55.920]  into hurting people.
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:01.960]  It's a secret currency with the Satanism, with the corrupt, to abuse children because
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:03.960]  you corrupt people that are involved.
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:08.400]  God's hedge of protection is removed from those that are involved, even on the periphery,
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:13.360]  so then the devil can take full control of those people.
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:18.920]  And this film is very, very powerful.
[1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:24.280]  I mean, it's got points where the actors, obviously, you can tell they're actors, but
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:28.320]  then it's got parts that are very, very scary and very, very realistic, so it's got its
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:29.320]  high points.
[1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:33.120]  But the overall message of it is extremely powerful, and that's why you need to see a
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:37.440]  film like this with a $100 million budget, not a, I would guess, a $500 million budget.
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:41.560]  I don't know, we'll talk to the film director, you know, John Paul Reis, which is reconnected.
[1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:44.200]  And he is back with us now.
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:48.240]  Just interestingly enough, I mean, parts of the film are very, very scary, very, very
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:49.240]  realistic.
[1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:50.240]  You obviously did a lot of research for this.
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.520]  Where did you do the research to discover this information?
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:22:03.840]  Well, it was because I was a Democrat, and I had voted here in Los Angeles 19 years for
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:08.280]  Democrats, I followed the primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
[1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:13.600]  And I saw how the media manipulated that whole charade.
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:18.800]  And it devastated and broke my heart, but it wasn't until the election of Donald Trump
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:27.560]  for which it blew a hole through the perception of my reality that I began on my own, nobody
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:37.000]  asking me to ask questions and look as to why we are here now for Donald Trump as president.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:43.240]  Looking at what the media said, and accepting all of that on face value, I went to disprove
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:46.880]  or I went out to prove all of that and disprove all of that.
[1:22:46.880 --> 1:22:49.920]  More importantly, I went back into time.
[1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:56.280]  And I saw the trajectory of how we've arrived to this moment in America and the world and
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:02.040]  human trafficking happened to be one of many rabbit holes that I went down.
[1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:07.520]  But it was the one that it led to the darkest corners of the world and showed me that there
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:11.440]  is something else going on here that is out of sight.
[1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:15.800]  And yet I've seen being out here for 19 years.
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:21.320]  I've seen different versions of that in front of me, not normal.
[1:23:21.320 --> 1:23:22.320]  Stay right there.
[1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:23.320]  Let's come back.
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:24.320]  That's powerful testimony.
[1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:26.520]  So you'd already seen the pieces, but didn't put them together.
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:30.680]  And then once you try to disprove something, you found out, man, this is really going on.
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:31.680]  And then it just blew your mind.
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:32.680]  And that's how it is for all of us.
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:36.520]  I mean, I remember Ted Gunnarsson telling me this stuff 25 years ago in person.
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:41.680]  And he was a credible former FBI high level, ran LA, and he was telling me this stuff.
[1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:42.680]  I thought it was crazy.
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:44.800]  It turned out they even declassified a bunch of it.
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:45.800]  He was dead on.
[1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:46.800]  What a hero.
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:47.800]  They're right back.
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:53.360]  The BBC is state-run media in the U.K. and they've come out with a detailed article that's linked
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:59.760]  to an infowars.com saying, you will have to have forced homunculations multiple times
[1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:05.240]  a year to be able to travel, robots will scan you when you land, you will have a digital
[1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:09.920]  tattoo under your skin to be able to enter the country, but it's going to be so easy
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:12.000]  and so cool and so fun.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.040]  The Microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo.
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.840]  We exposed this six months ago, Bill Gates was funding it, and they had hundreds of news
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:22.640]  articles attacking and saying it wasn't true.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.480]  This is a tactic they used.
[1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:25.480]  First they announced it.
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:26.480]  We say it's a bad idea.
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:27.480]  They say, that's crazy.
[1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:28.480]  We didn't do it.
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:29.480]  They introduced the idea to you.
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:33.160]  Then they come back and announce it again, thinking you have no memory.
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:35.440]  This is a criminal takeover.
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:37.520]  This is the line in the sand.
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:38.720]  We must say no.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:41.120]  We must expose the fraud of COVID-19.
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:43.520]  This entire house of evil is built on.
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:25:09.080]  I'm Alex Jones, never-surrendered-a-territy-info-wars.com.

[1:26:50.800 --> 1:27:08.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:20.440]  All right, John Paul Rice is here, and while he's talking actor, filmmaker, director, I
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:25.520]  was thinking about Vivian Kubrick, and you know Vivian Kubrick was the protege of Stanley
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:28.120]  Kubrick, probably one of the best directors in history.
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:32.040]  I think they say pretty much is the best director ever, and I tend to agree not just
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:38.680]  his style and his skill, but not just the cinematography, but the projects he chose.
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:43.040]  And I asked her, I had a chance to hang out with her a few days in Dallas, I guess ten
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.880]  years ago now, about eight years ago, and then I've had a chance to talk to her some.
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:51.960]  And she told me about Eyes Wide Shut, and you know, there's 25 minutes that got cut
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  out of it.
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:56.960]  And I guess this is just some stream off the internet they found, but there's HD interviews
[1:27:56.960 --> 1:27:57.960]  out there.
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:01.520]  That's not when they deleted my YouTube channel that had five million views.
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:03.280]  So many of those great HD interviews are gone.
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:06.840]  We should find those and re-upload those to Bandai Video, but that's just a personnel
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:07.840]  issue.
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:08.840]  But I'm the crew members.
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:13.920]  I'm not complaining, it's just there's so much to do, but she was like, absolutely,
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:19.720]  my dad never went to one of those events, but it was known in the English countryside
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:25.800]  where they live, but also in the United States and upstate New York, other areas, that that
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:28.520]  type of thing was going on.
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:33.080]  And of course, he fought with, he had final cut on that film, refused to cut the 24 minutes
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:36.520]  technically, and then died of a heart attack during that whole period, and the word is
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:38.080]  he was whacked.
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:39.240]  And you know, she wouldn't go there.
[1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:42.440]  She wouldn't get into all of it, but she told me quite a bit and then said, you know, don't
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:43.440]  tell the public.
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:45.960]  A lot of this, she told me what I could tell people.
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:54.280]  And I separately confirmed a lot of this from other sources.
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:29:00.760]  And so we're witnessing an attempt at coming out of the pedophile ranks because they need
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:04.640]  to normalize what they've done before they get caught, but it's not going well for them.
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:07.240]  So that's why they're destabilizing all of civilization.
[1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:13.840]  So John Paul Rice made the child's voice censored by Amazon after being up there for a long
[1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:17.760]  time, being very successful, having, you know, four star reviews.
[1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:19.720]  Before we hit break there, you're having some sky problems.
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:21.000]  Get back into your awakenings.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  You were investigating this.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  You didn't believe in this.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.360]  And then what was it like as you found things out of them?
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:28.600]  Let's talk about the actual censorship of the film because that's a pretty big, important
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:31.280]  news item.
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:38.320]  So my awakening to this was what you mentioned earlier, Ronald Bernard's testimony.
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:43.440]  He did a five part interview and I sat down and listened to all five parts as they came
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:50.040]  out and then I followed his story because I was just, I was watching a person.
[1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:56.480]  I do a lot of readings and castings with actors and I could feel the truth coming through
[1:29:56.480 --> 1:29:59.680]  this guy that he was authentic.
[1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:03.320]  He was being very honest and truthful and emotional.
[1:30:03.320 --> 1:30:10.120]  And basically what it was is this in the highest echelons of power beyond what we see, there
[1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:16.600]  is a very small group of people in relation to the total population of the world who are
[1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:24.480]  responsible for all the wars, all of our poverty, all of starvation and suffering and humanity
[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:28.720]  to make it look as though we do this to ourselves.
[1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:36.240]  And this 8,500 people, he had worked his way up over the years and had come to understand
[1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:42.200]  that he had found career criminals just like him, but there was another level to it.
[1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:47.880]  And that was when they invited him into a church to sacrifice a child.
[1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:52.320]  And he had total breakdown.
[1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:57.280]  This is a guy who had been involved in all of what I just said before and he could not
[1:30:57.280 --> 1:30:59.280]  bring himself to murder that child.
[1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:03.760]  Well, there have been major famous EU bankers that have come out and said the same thing.
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:04.760]  Yes.
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:10.920]  Yes, this has been a conspiracy, the real conspiracy Alex is the conspiracy of silence.
[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:20.960]  And I know that most people cannot believe because they could not imagine doing such
[1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:25.480]  a thing to their child, even with the child abuse that exists in this country and in the
[1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:27.800]  world that is sanctioned.
[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:32.560]  But even still no one can conceive of doing such horrors to children.
[1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:40.600]  They are our most precious God-like being that we have on the face of this earth.
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:46.000]  The potential of the future that they're a new seed, a pure grid and the enemy wants
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:47.800]  to corrupt that.
[1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:52.400]  Well, yes, they do, but more importantly, they do it because they know what each and
[1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:55.760]  every single human being born on this planet is.
[1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:58.000]  You are a child of God.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:00.640]  You are from a creator of heaven and earth.
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:04.580]  You don't have to have a religious belief to know that truth.
[1:32:04.580 --> 1:32:06.080]  It lives in your heart.
[1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:07.080]  That's right.
[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:08.080]  They hate God.
[1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:09.080]  And so we're making the image of God.
[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:10.080]  They want to destroy us.
[1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:11.080]  Yes.
[1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:12.920]  They want to pervert and corrupt us.
[1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:16.800]  They don't need us to believe in worship and what the dark gods that they do.
[1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:21.160]  It has more to be about deception and turning you away.
[1:32:21.160 --> 1:32:24.840]  This is what the Luciferians had talked about in the state worshipers had talked about in
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:27.200]  numerous interviews that are online.
[1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:32.360]  And all they did was went into neighborhoods and made sure that you did not believe in Jesus
[1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:34.280]  and you did not believe in God.
[1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:40.200]  And those two things gave them the opportunity to come in and put the drugs there, the prostitution
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:41.200]  there.
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:46.400]  All of the crap we're seeing happen across cities in this country.
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:51.920]  It is the real, the real oppressive system is their oppressive system, not our oppressive
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:55.440]  system, not the 99% who occupy this world.
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:32:57.440]  That's right.
[1:32:57.440 --> 1:32:58.440]  The real 1% are Satanists.
[1:32:58.440 --> 1:33:01.000]  That's the secret shadow government.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:05.440]  I think it's bigger than just the label, but these people believe what they believe.
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:06.440]  I agree.
[1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:07.440]  It's bigger than the term Satan.
[1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:10.000]  It is a force to destroy humanity and slaves.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  Yes.
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:14.760]  And it brought me, I mean, you asked why I did what I did.
[1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:15.760]  I had no idea.
[1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:20.560]  If you had told me three years ago or even four years ago that I would be here at this
[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:25.360]  moment right now, believing, not believing, knowing what I know.
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:27.880]  Believing for myself, that's the key.
[1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:30.280]  I didn't have to hold any beliefs.
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:35.880]  I just had to put one plus one plus one together and I just kept adding and trying to disprove
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:37.880]  it at the same time.
[1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:42.120]  And I looked at it from every side and every angle and it's a disbelief.
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:47.440]  It's not a reality that you come lightly to and wanting to believe.
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:51.920]  You don't have many nights where you sleep well when contemplating and learning about
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:52.920]  this.
[1:33:52.920 --> 1:33:54.640]  Everybody has their limit.
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:59.920]  And what I wish to tell the world is this, in the face of this darkness, in the face
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:06.800]  of this concealed darkness, all of us, all human beings on this planet have an opportunity
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:11.000]  to unite together and love together in the face of this darkness.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:19.120]  This one issue, the commitment to end child abuse in this world and give humanity its
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:25.160]  time to start beginning a new story, the real story of humanity that is lived in each and
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:28.320]  every human being's heart.
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:29.960]  That's what this time is about.
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:33.520]  You're absolutely right because any predator targets the babies.
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:38.000]  When you see a lion come out of the woods or something, it goes after the piglets, not
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.240]  the pig, or the shark goes up to the baby seals, not the big seal.
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:43.240]  It's the same thing.
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:46.800]  They're going after the youth because we're not protecting them and we need to protect
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:50.360]  them and guard them and not have this laissez-faire attitude because you're right.
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:53.680]  The Satanists tell you they're atheists and, oh, it's all over and there's no point to
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:55.720]  life and just don't care and have fun.
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:59.120]  But meanwhile, they literally are trying to get power and control.
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:03.320]  They don't want you to know you have that electrochemical spiritual connection to Christ
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:07.160]  and that power to build a new world and go to the stars.
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:11.520]  They want to steal that birthright from us because these entities are so pissed that we're
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:13.160]  so superior to them.
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:17.560]  But they've got a leg up on us because we don't understand our potential.
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:19.040]  That's why they don't want you to know it.
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:20.040]  Right.
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:23.680]  And I just want to point to one study that I would mention.
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:24.680]  Anybody can look up.
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:29.320]  It's called 98% of all children are born with creative genius intellect.
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:34.560]  And that was proven by these doctors who gave a TED talk that showed that every single child,
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:40.120]  98% of all living beings born have a creative genius intellect.
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:42.800]  And they're trying to kill that potentiality.
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:46.440]  And it brings it down by the time we're 30 years old.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:49.760]  It's down to less than 2% of the population.
[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:57.040]  And they cited the exact reason was the education system that fused both divergent and convergent
[1:35:57.040 --> 1:36:02.160]  thinking together so that you didn't have this creative intuition to keep manifesting
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:03.600]  new realities.
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:08.800]  It was so that you would decide, no, yes, maybe I've done that before.
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:13.640]  And then if you introduce child abuse, any, any which way you have self-defeating thoughts
[1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:14.880]  added to that.
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:17.480]  And that's why they teach us we're all victims, that that empowers us.
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:19.720]  No, it makes our brain give up and go into a victim.
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:21.360]  That's why I don't say I'm a victim.
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:22.920]  I decide to overcome those things.
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:24.040]  I don't adapt and submit.
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:25.040]  I overcome.
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:28.320]  I know you got to go to an appointment soon, but I want to do 15 minutes the next hour
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:30.320]  with you because I want you to really roll.
[1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:31.760]  John Paul Rice is a great guy.
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:33.280]  You can tell he's telling the truth.
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:38.400]  And his fiction film has been banned because it was popular and great and telling the truth.
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:41.640]  And that is on the hands now of Jeff Bezos.
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:47.160]  What, what, what a horrible thing to do.
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:51.240]  Introducing InfoWarsLife Pure Turmeric Extract.
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:53.680]  This is taken under the tongue.
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:55.880]  It is pure turmeric.
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:37:00.880]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:05.240]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:09.400]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:10.960]  then absorbed by the stomach.
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:13.560]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:18.040]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated and our first product got rave
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:19.040]  reviews.
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:20.800]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:23.040]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:24.280]  Some like bodies better.
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:28.480]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:29.640]  And they fund the InfoWars.

[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:51.440]  The reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown, the number one reason
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:54.960]  is it serves every one of their purposes.
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:59.360]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:05.000]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  inoculation.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.440]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:19.000]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.120]  once had by design.
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:25.760]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:31.160]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:36.560]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:43.040]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:47.320]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:52.400]  Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to introduce to you a new line of high quality products
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:59.640]  developed by my father, a retired dentist, Dr. David R. Jones, Dr. Jones Naturals, naturally
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:06.080]  fluoride free activated charcoal toothpaste, which cleans your teeth, freshens your breath,
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:07.840]  and is enamel safe.
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:12.480]  This is a concentrated toothpaste, doesn't have all the fillers, it is amazing.
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:15.440]  Folks have loved the other toothpaste that he's developed, if you like those, you're
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:17.600]  really going to love this.
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.800]  And there's also the high quality activated charcoal mouthwash, and then on top of that,
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:30.160]  eight other new products available at infowarstore.com with this new line, Dr. Jones Naturals.
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:37.600]  Again, infowarsstore.com with a new line of Dr. Jones Naturals, or visit drjonesnaturals.com
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:40.520]  and find the entire line on his new shopping cart.
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:45.360]  Again, my dad, who helped watch the info war, is now a major sponsor of the operation.
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:47.680]  Thanks, dad, for all your support.
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:50.760]  I talked to the EMS and I talked to the medical doctor, he said, yeah, what makes you nauseated
[1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:54.240]  is it's not just the smell of the piss, but we call the smell of bum piss, it has this
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:55.240]  sweet nauseating smell.
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:56.240]  Yeah.
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:57.240]  It's something that speaks.
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:58.240]  Well, it does.
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:03.280]  It's a sweet stench that makes me want to throw up, I got to be, it is the crap of dust mites.
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:07.720]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist run neighborhoods?
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:15.120]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and infowarstore has the solution.
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:20.320]  Info wars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:26.560]  on the market with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes,
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:27.560]  dust mites.
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:33.040]  Our lung cleanse plus made with organic and wild cultivated herbs is just what you need
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:38.880]  to survive the unprecedented surge of bum piss and other toxic substances in liberal
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:41.120]  leftist cities everywhere.
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:50.760]  Consider the info wars lifelong cleanse plus supplement today at infowarstore.com.
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:41:06.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:12.560]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:20.240]  So I spent the entire first hour on the New York Times senior writer in a meeting with
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:27.040]  the top Democrats, the DNC Wargaming, the state's seceding and trying to have the military
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:31.560]  remove President Trump if he wins, and they're saying if they lose, they're going to contest
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:33.560]  and do this.
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:36.240]  Pelosi said, this is a crazy time.
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:38.920]  We're being forced out in the open.
[1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:42.720]  I'm always promoting that you should have high quality, swarble food the last 25 years.
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:44.040]  It's really good.
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:48.320]  It's high quality and the profit we make funds this operation.
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:52.040]  People were going crazy back during the COVID when there was a six week wait to get it.
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:55.720]  And I said, listen, I'm worried about the election, the collapse, the world economy,
[1:41:55.720 --> 1:41:57.080]  food prices going up.
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.240]  You need storeable food for what's coming in the future.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:04.120]  COVID's the sign of the lockdown, the sign of them changing the subject from the elephant
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:07.880]  in the room, the pedophilia, the world government, the Satanism.
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:09.440]  And so now there's a two to four week wait.
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:10.440]  They've got the food.
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:14.880]  It's high quality, four factories, the packaging, big plastic, hard tote containers with sealed
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:17.600]  containers inside, transportability is key.
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:22.320]  You can bury it, whatever you need this, and it funds the Info War.
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.200]  When you're under siege, you need to have water filtration, air filtration.
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:27.200]  You need to have firearms.
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:28.200]  Protect yourself.
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:29.200]  We don't sell that.
[1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:30.200]  You'd have storeable food.
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:31.200]  You need to have a plan.
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.040]  Whether you live in a city or the countryside, now is the time to get ready.
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:38.840]  I would order storeable food right now before what's coming with this election because it's
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:40.800]  going to be rough either way.
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:42.320]  And the globalists want you dependent.
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:44.040]  They don't want you self-sufficient.
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:45.040]  They want to control you.
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:47.800]  So take action at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:52.240]  We also have the Reopen America back to school special 50% off all the great supplements
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:53.720]  and double patriot points.
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:57.120]  And we've got a lot of products that are very close to selling out like bodies, ultimate
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:01.400]  turmeric formula that's still 50% off despite that, and of course, DNA Force Plus that is
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:05.920]  so good for your telomeres and your mitochondria and cleaning your cells out.
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:06.920]  That's 50% off as well.
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:07.920]  DNA Force Plus.
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:09.920]  I highly recommend infowarstore.com.
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:11.720]  And that's what funds this platform.
[1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:14.000]  They want to shut down so hard.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:20.560]  So John Paul Rice filmmaker, actor, director, who's made a child's voice is here.
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:22.080]  He's given us some really heavy things.
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:25.360]  I want to ask him some questions about the state of the world today in a moment.
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:29.920]  Let's talk about the film, the specifics of what Amazon did for those that don't know
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:31.840]  how big a deal this is.
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:32.840]  Okay.
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:38.400]  So what happened was we had published Child's Voice in 2018.
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:39.840]  We started doing pretty well.
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:43.280]  We were getting out interviews and doing podcasts.
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:49.120]  And then there was a huge surge last year after the Epstein arrest because then it started
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:50.440]  to connect with a lot of people.
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:55.120]  We were doing this before there was Epstein and Maxwell in the media in the mainstream.
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:44:03.360]  And so we came out with this film and it incorporated all of our research in small disclosure ways
[1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:09.360]  and still tasteful enough that you don't have to get the total gross, you know, you use your
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:15.000]  imagination essentially, but it's in there with this message of love, the road to redemption
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  is through love.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:22.040]  And so what we tried to do through a fiction piece is we took a story about a young boy
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:27.200]  and a young girl on the outside, a heroin addicted homeless kid and a girl who was being
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:32.680]  beaten by her boyfriend who started selling kids for, you know, kids for money.
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:37.520]  And they're brought together by this child who is sacrificed at the beginning of the
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:38.520]  story.
[1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:44.560]  His spirit lives on and he reaches out and calls out for anyone who can hear him.
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:49.760]  And he gets the attention of this boy and he cures him of his heroin withdrawal and
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:55.160]  he sends them on a journey to track down this girl and put the two of them together.
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:45:00.880]  And in their involvement with each other as they begin to speak the truth, they come closer
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:07.120]  together in a spirit of love and they go into the trafficking network.
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:11.600]  And there are two people that stand up in the face of this horror with love in their
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:14.760]  heart, encouraged for one another.
[1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:21.640]  And that is what the whole movie is about when you stand up to this darkness, you say
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:28.680]  I will help every child that I can in my life to make them as strong and as loving a human
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:30.560]  being as possible.
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:32.440]  And I will risk my life to do that.
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:36.480]  And what scared them is valuing children and admitting this is going on.
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:40.040]  And now Trump signed executive orders, the bus grew up 10 plus fold.
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:43.520]  I mean, this is what was it like for you to watch all this unfolding?
[1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:50.200]  Well, it's kind of surreal, but I sort of in a way expect it because these people when
[1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:59.200]  you learn about who they are, they're not the evil villains that you see in your cartoons
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:00.320]  or your movies.
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:04.960]  They always make them, you know, taking over the world rubbing their hands together about
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:07.120]  the destruction that they can cause.
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:13.960]  But these are people who consider themselves to be intelligent, good parents, good lawyers,
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:19.960]  doctors, teachers, whatever it might be that they identify themselves with.
[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:23.160]  They don't believe that they're doing pure evil.
[1:46:23.160 --> 1:46:28.440]  I know that's hard for people to imagine, but they're, they're, they're what most people
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:31.880]  to become a Hitler, you don't notice that person.
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:37.960]  Well, let's expand on that in Germany, it came out in DW.com, biggest TV network there,
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:42.000]  that the government psychiatrist all over the country, they first had one city Berlin
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  and whitewash it.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:49.760]  There were 30,000 children over 30 years were given to thousands of convicted pedophiles
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:55.800]  because the study was, we believe the family's bad sex with a child creates love, think how
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:56.800]  sick.
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:00.080]  So we're like, we're loving children, we're taking them from Christians.
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:03.440]  That was what they said was mentally ill and homeschoolers and giving them to people that
[1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:05.320]  have sex with them to create the new family.
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:09.720]  And of course it created suicide, death, collapse, but that's how sick the mid level
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:11.560]  people are just these white jobs.
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:12.560]  Yes.
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:13.560]  They're the true believers.
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:16.320]  They're the perfect psychopaths to carry this out.
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:18.360]  This is not an act.
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:19.560]  They really believe this.
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:21.040]  They really feel that way.
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:24.000]  And now they're scared though, because they know they're in trouble.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:25.080]  Yes.
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:28.480]  They know they're in trouble and they're on borrowed time because once the collective
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:33.040]  consciousness of the world comes to this understanding, you're not going to have any
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:34.040]  power anymore.
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:37.800]  I mean, that's, it's as simple as an equation as that.
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:43.320]  You can only keep the lie and the illusion going for so long, for example, like Hollywood.
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:44.320]  I'm just looking at it.
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:50.400]  I was about to say, notice how as the pedophilia comes out, Hollywood exponentially collapses.
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:52.600]  And there's silence about it.
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  That's the key.
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:58.440]  That's, that's, that to me, when, when they are silent about an issue, I mean, I'm just
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:47:59.800]  picking a step back for a second.
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:06.840]  If I'm a business owner and I have accusations, a growing amount of my customer base continues
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:12.560]  to find problems with the products that I'm putting out with and in looking at all of
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:18.520]  the people from me too, to Epstein, to Maxwell, that we've learned about who are involved
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:19.520]  in this.
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:23.520]  And we were told these were conspiracies.
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:26.480]  We were told these were conspiracies.
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:30.440]  Doesn't matter what side of the equation you were on politically, it just didn't exist.
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:31.440]  It didn't exist.
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:33.160]  And it was all manufactured.
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:36.200]  And this conspiracy is taking away from the real victims.
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:37.200]  Okay.
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:38.700]  Fine.
[1:48:38.700 --> 1:48:43.160]  Accepting all of that at a hundred percent base value, wouldn't you as a responsible
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:49.920]  business person come out and say, there have been, we understand your concerns.
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:52.960]  We are going to do a full investigation.
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:59.080]  No stone will be left unturned, and we will have full transparency and accountability
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.520]  so that we can not only debunk these claims, but put them to rest.
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:10.200]  And if we do find that there are people who did this to children under whatever circumstance
[1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:16.400]  it was, those people will be brought to justice and the law enforcement and will never serve
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:19.280]  in another position of power within our industry ever again.
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:20.680]  Well, let's go further.
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:21.680]  Absolutely.
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.840]  And now it's all coming out and they cover it up and it's getting worse and worse.
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:31.120]  And now Hollywood's eating itself and Weinstein's gone to jail, been released because of COVID,
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:34.680]  but Epstein's dead and then Maxwell.
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:35.680]  What is the sense of Hollywood?
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:40.040]  I mean, I know when I've been out there, it's hellish now, just the vibe is even worse,
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:41.040]  the homelessness.
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:44.360]  I know most of the Hollywood folks are fleeing right now.
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  That's exactly right.
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:49.640]  I have a lot of friends who are looking to get out of here as quickly as possible.
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:55.520]  They've seen Santa Monica, which was one of the most beautiful cities to visit on the
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:50:01.200]  coast there, just completely get dangerous over the last five or six months.
[1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:05.680]  And see, that's the thing is why can't the left help but wreck everything they touch?
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:06.680]  Because it's satanic.
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:07.920]  It wants to hurt things.
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:08.920]  Yeah.
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:15.360]  And they offer policies that speak in the language of equality and tolerance and diversity
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:19.880]  and empowerment, and they do exactly the opposite of that.
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:25.640]  I don't think it's a, it's like I, I'm telling you, Alex, I was a guy who voted for Barack
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:31.720]  Obama twice and no, you projected your goodness onto their story.
[1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:35.080]  But as soon as you looked at their story, it was the opposite.
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:39.520]  It's that and all the contradictions and all the cognitive dissonance because here's what
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  I tell people to do.
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:43.240]  I said, look, it's very simple.
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:47.200]  If this is true, how is this also true?
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:50.440]  If this is true, how is this also true?
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:55.640]  And that way you can begin to see through the illusion that they're projecting onto you
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:51:01.920]  and using television as a way to literally program your mind so that your thoughts are
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:06.840]  just repetitions of the sound bites that you've heard and the story that you've created.
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:07.840]  Exactly.
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:08.840]  A surface control.
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:09.840]  You're a smart guy.
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:10.840]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:14.640]  You're right, walk us through this, how you wake up people out on the West Coast when we
[1:51:14.640 --> 1:51:15.640]  come back.
[1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:20.080]  A child's voice on Vimeo find links at norestrictionsent.com.
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:24.080]  I watched it very, very powerful, very, very scary because it's reality based and it's
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:25.080]  who these people are.
[1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:28.920]  And the guy you got to play the Satanist mind control guy, he's that guy's a frightening
[1:51:28.920 --> 1:51:29.920]  actor.
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:30.920]  Did a great job though.
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:31.920]  We'll be right back.
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:37.040]  Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:42.720]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:47.440]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:52.800]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense,
[1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:56.040]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:57.040]  world is.
[1:51:57.040 --> 1:52:01.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:06.080]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[1:52:06.080 --> 1:52:11.240]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:15.480]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:20.920]  and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[1:52:20.920 --> 1:52:25.840]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command even if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:27.360]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:33.360]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity and
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:34.360]  against your future.
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:38.680]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:41.240]  America and the world should have never been closed.
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:47.840]  It was all based on WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci NIH lives.
[1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:55.000]  But now here we are already into August and they're trying to keep our stores, our factories,
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.920]  our schools, our parks closed.
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:00.200]  It is outrageous.
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:06.760]  Now we have launched a new big sale titled Reopen America, back to school special, 50

[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:56.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:11.040]  All right I'm your host Alex Jones and I don't tell these stories to try to impress people.
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:14.600]  I grew up in Rockwell, Texas, the richest county in Texas at the time, bedroom community
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:20.760]  of Dallas and I mean I'd be like 13 years old and I was already promiscuous by then.
[1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:28.520]  I look like I was about 16 and I was a lively lad and I'm like a man this is great.
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:35.920]  I've got the 17 year old cheerleader, in fact one of them became a famous porn star later
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:40.920]  I noticed but and I'm like no and all of a sudden I've had sex with them a few times
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:44.480]  and all of a sudden I'm at some mansion and they want me to be part of an occult ritual.
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:48.080]  That happened a few times and I just found out there's this invisible empire.
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:52.320]  The KKK calls it the self invisible empire that came out of Albert Pike and the Illuminati
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:56.080]  but I mean there's all these cults everywhere and they operate.
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:59.960]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up with John Paul Rice, the director and producer
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:02.800]  maker of a child's voice that's been censored.
[1:55:02.800 --> 1:55:06.560]  I want to get back to Amazon briefly because I know you walked through this in the piece
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:11.120]  you did for Facebook where you explained that he's go well stop the direction we're going
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  right now.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:16.000]  Film's out for two years, four star, five star reviews, thousands of reviews.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.360]  It's a fiction movie, it's nothing as shocking as they put out but it's about what's really
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:24.080]  at the bottom of the rat hole, the fact that they did this along with so many other books
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:29.080]  and films exposing it really means they're aiding and abetting it and it shows they're
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.080]  scared.
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:34.920]  Yeah I mean it definitely did the searches, the banning, I mean just to we'll get back
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:41.640]  to Amazon for a second but as a result of this video and others, the one that I did
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:47.280]  and many others that have been coming out, to save the child, save the children hashtag
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:53.160]  on Facebook and to some degree on Twitter has been censored.
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:58.760]  It actually gave a community warning to people that said that this may be unsafe, posts with
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:03.200]  this tag may be unsafe and you just have to ask yourself.
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:06.840]  We got Facebook and Twitter defending Betafiles.
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:10.760]  They're blocking it and they're not saying anything about it and they're not allowing
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:13.160]  this message to come through.
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:19.360]  I mean people are searching now at a record pace than ever before and they're learning
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:24.840]  very quickly that there is something to this, whether you know the whole picture or not,
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:31.080]  there's something to this and the people that are being asked to say hey there's this charge
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:36.080]  against you, they're not denying it, they're just faking themselves, the victim closing
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:39.080]  up their accounts and or not saying anything about it.
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:43.000]  A lot of examples, movie stars, others, people go to their Twitter and it's like celebrating
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.720]  I want to have sex with little girls, I want to do this with a man, people say hey what
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:48.920]  are you doing, I'm a victim, I'm a victim but no what they were doing before, it's
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:54.080]  like the lawyer for Eric Ciramella said I like to represent Betafiles, we're taking
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:57.160]  over Washington and people go hey why are you saying that on Twitter, he goes oh don't
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:57:00.640]  attack me, I mean it's like the calling card isn't it?
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:08.880]  Yeah, it's really something that, it's so disgusting because what you think you know
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:14.200]  when you're talking about people who are messaging to us and who have a certain responsibility
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:22.880]  of awareness and are talking about little children on social media in sexual ways and
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:26.800]  they're and then the moment they're called out for that oh it's a joke, oh he didn't
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:31.280]  mean it, oh you're taking it out of context, the attacks, the attacks and it's like wait
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:37.320]  a minute, are you not aware of the industry that you work in, I'll point to one article,
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:43.520]  go to Deadline.com, Deadline Hollywood, there's an article in there that came out two years
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:49.080]  ago that said the Child Protection, Hollywood's Child Protection Act, why it's ignored and
[1:57:49.080 --> 1:57:56.920]  why it's important and it documents that this law that they all wanted had not even been
[1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:04.560]  followed by the under the under the line crew, this wasn't for actors, this wasn't for directors,
[1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:09.360]  this wasn't for producers, this was for the agents, the managers, the photographers, the
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:16.040]  casting directors and the like to sign a pledge of sorts that would say I am going to make
[1:58:16.040 --> 1:58:21.520]  sure that this does not happen around me and among my people that I'm working with.
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:25.200]  Well and how many directors are convicted, pedophiles and Roman Polanski and standing
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:30.720]  ovations and just all of it, we'll be back to talk about how you wake people up, what
[1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:35.560]  you think's coming next and more people should watch the film, a child's voice that Amazon
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:39.240]  tried to silence back in 60 seconds.
[1:58:39.240 --> 1:58:52.280]  August 2020 is here, it's less than 90 days out from the historic election, the Chi Coms,
[1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:57.040]  the EU, Hollywood, the Democratic Party and the blue states and blue cities are all battling
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:03.120]  to keep America shut down and to destroy free speech as well to ensure their final takeover
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:07.080]  of the United States by removing President Donald John Trump.
[1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:11.440]  At Info Wars we're fighting back harder than ever, so your word of mouth and your prayer

[1:59:59.360 --> 2:00:05.280]  John Paul Rice is a filmmaker, a child's voice has been censored by Amazon, it's been out
[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:09.840]  for almost two years because it deals with the secret currency of Hollywood and what's
[2:00:09.840 --> 2:00:10.840]  coming out.
[2:00:10.840 --> 2:00:15.200]  There's the incredible omissions, there's so many thousands of examples and how these
[2:00:15.200 --> 2:00:18.640]  people all over Twitter, Facebook, brag that they like to have sex with children but then
[2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:22.440]  say it's a joke later when everything they do is about corrupting the children and putting
[2:00:22.440 --> 2:00:23.720]  them on the wrong path of life.
[2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:27.720]  So in the 10 minutes we have left you've got the floor about Hollywood, the future of
[2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:32.440]  the country, the election, where you see this going, what folks in Hollywood are saying,
[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:35.600]  just hit us with all guns blazing.
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:41.240]  Well, where I see this all going and what you've been talking about and many other people
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:47.960]  have been talking about for a long time is that these people know that they're in the
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:56.120]  final season of their show and they're going to do everything they can to keep us divided
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:01:01.400]  and away from the real issues that are going on among their industry, among their political
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:07.800]  parties, among their different institutions of which they have inhabited for a very long
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:08.800]  time.
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:14.240]  See, the structures of power, I want to make this very clear because a lot of my friends
[2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:17.400]  on the left tend to think that we need to destroy the system.
[2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:23.680]  No, the system has been inhabited by a very corrupt and dark group of people and we can
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:28.560]  have all the things that we want in this world to happen, the way we expect them to
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:33.960]  happen through our law enforcement, through our local communities, through all of the
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:38.880]  institutions that we have been told growing up to admire.
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:44.880]  This is not about the institutions themselves failing, it's about the inhabitants of those
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:48.680]  institutions who have made them corrupt to the point that they have failed.
[2:01:48.680 --> 2:01:50.200]  They have failed all of us.
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:54.760]  And they do that on purpose and then collapse it exactly and then bring in their system.
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:01:59.600]  Everything they have at us in this last two months, Hollywood is going to do its part
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:05.320]  to stroke the racial divisions, just like they did from Jesse Smollett to Bubba Wallace
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:12.160]  to now with Oprah and everyone else talking about a white and black issue and reparations.
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:17.040]  And it's not about that any of those things are not issues that we cannot solve.
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:18.140]  That's the key.
[2:02:18.140 --> 2:02:22.120]  We can sit down and have conversation, but the time for debate is over.
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.920]  The time for unification on this issue is now.
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:31.200]  And once we get rid of these individuals out of the picture from all of our ins, purged
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:38.080]  from all of our institutions, we can take back the reins of power and make our own decisions
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:40.920]  through conversation, debate and dialogue.
[2:02:40.920 --> 2:02:42.920]  That's right.
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:43.920]  And you know, it's true.
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:49.320]  We've got to write the ship and these systems are perfect at taking over systems and wrecking
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:53.800]  them to collapse things and bring in even more power and control like the French Revolution.
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:54.800]  But I agree with you.
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:55.800]  They know their time is short.
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:57.400]  So they're not just trying to divide people.
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:01.240]  They're trying to collapse things and they hope the smoke screen of that collapse is
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:03.680]  their ultimate distraction will get them out of this.
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:05.280]  I assure them it's not going to happen.
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:07.920]  As I agree with you, it's critical mass.
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:14.000]  I went to Florida a month ago and I was out in the surf talking to people and most of
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:19.240]  them didn't know who I was, but black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian, they were all
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:23.920]  global government, new world order, pedophile rings, the global reset, Covid's a hoax.
[2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:26.120]  I mean, people really get it now.
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  Yeah.
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:32.640]  No, people, people where I live see through the illusion of all of this with the masks,
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:35.040]  with the epidemic.
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:40.080]  They're starting to question everything because all they keep seeing is changes of positions
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:42.920]  and then new information comes out.
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:45.360]  And the way that people need to look at it is this.
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:49.680]  Human trafficking isn't the only issue that they're lying, they're lying about almost
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:53.880]  everything that they present to you on TV reality.
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:55.480]  It's selective.
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:04:00.800]  It's selective and it pushes forth an agenda that is not, it's actually not liberal in
[2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:02.160]  any which way.
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:06.880]  It's been taken, these political parties have been taken over by a very strong yet small
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:13.160]  group of people who have used fear for a very long time to control the reins of power.
[2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:17.240]  And this is for the people that have been running this show.
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:21.960]  And so when they come in and they crash, like they say, they're here to destroy it, they'll
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:30.040]  destroy it through the mechanisms of capitalism using, excuse me, using predatory capitalism,
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:31.040]  not real capitalism.
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:33.600]  What you and I are doing right now in this talk is real capitalism.
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:38.200]  It's an exchange of ideas and that people find a value for.
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:39.200]  We need to return to that.
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:40.200]  That's right.
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:46.480]  We're the real open free market of ideas and they're creating a monopoly and then blaming
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:51.000]  capitalism for the monopoly that's based off communist China.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:55.160]  And as people, even Rob Lowe was on Joe Rogan the other day and he said, what is it to be
[2:04:55.160 --> 2:04:56.160]  famous anymore?
[2:04:56.160 --> 2:04:57.160]  Everybody hates celebrities.
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:04:58.160]  Everybody's a celebrity.
[2:04:58.160 --> 2:04:59.160]  And it means nothing.
[2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:02.000]  Well, use your fame for good or it doesn't matter.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  The illusion of Hollywood.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  What was the illusion?
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:06.280]  What was the spell?
[2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:07.280]  When did the spell break?
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:11.800]  It broke the last few years, but now it's gone from being a broken spell to a thing
[2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:16.800]  of that that mainline Hollywood is reviled, not just by people that are awake, but everybody
[2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:19.280]  I think now.
[2:05:19.280 --> 2:05:25.560]  The illusion began breaking this last three years with Donald Trump as president.
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:30.800]  And for anybody, like I said, it's not about Donald Trump, he's the mirror, he's standing
[2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:32.800]  up there.
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:37.560]  Whatever they wish to use it, you will see whatever you wish to see, but it's aside from
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:38.560]  personality.
[2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:41.520]  I want you to have a strong finish here.
[2:05:41.520 --> 2:05:42.800]  And again, this is a directive.
[2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:45.840]  Once Skype does this, we always disconnect, we're going to disconnect and call him back
[2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:46.840]  right now.
[2:05:46.840 --> 2:05:48.480]  It really fixes the Skype.
[2:05:48.480 --> 2:05:49.480]  Love the crew.
[2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:50.480]  They're awesome.
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:51.480]  But I direct everything.
[2:05:51.480 --> 2:05:53.880]  And sometimes when I'm not here, Skype's going, it just goes and goes and goes a certain
[2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:54.880]  point.
[2:05:54.880 --> 2:05:56.880]  We got to cut the Skype off, reconnect with them.
[2:05:56.880 --> 2:05:57.880]  And I'm not bitching.
[2:05:57.880 --> 2:05:59.480]  It just seems like things behind the scenes don't get done.
[2:05:59.480 --> 2:06:01.680]  So I say it on air and it gets done.
[2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:04.600]  So we're trying to reconnect with them right now.
[2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:06.760]  Very interesting fellow.
[2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:07.760]  Very well-spoken.
[2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:13.960]  John Paul Rice, the film A Child's Voice, blocked by Amazon, finished the last minute
[2:06:13.960 --> 2:06:14.960]  of what you were saying.
[2:06:14.960 --> 2:06:15.960]  So go ahead.
[2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:21.920]  No, I just want to say what they're doing is they are going to deflect all of these
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:26.600]  issues onto the people as though this country is in a collapse.
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:31.600]  They've been messaging this on MSNBC and other channels months ago about societal collapse
[2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:37.080]  these buzzwords that they sow into the collective consciousness of their viewership.
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:41.720]  And so that when they start seeing those things, they accept them.
[2:06:41.720 --> 2:06:42.720]  They accept them.
[2:06:42.720 --> 2:06:43.720]  That's right.
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:47.200]  Talk about that repetition messaging, the brainwashing and how we counter that.
[2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:49.800]  Explain that to folks because that's key.
[2:06:49.800 --> 2:06:52.160]  Well the key is to learn your subconscious mind.
[2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:54.520]  They know your mind better than you do.
[2:06:54.520 --> 2:06:59.480]  So if you learn about the 10 laws that govern the subconscious mind, you'll be able to be
[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:02.200]  aware of these keys that they do.
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:04.400]  They imprint a lot of their stuff with their brainwashing.
[2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:08.120]  And then their brainwashing has the opposite because you're conscious so you then see their
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:09.480]  template by their brainwashing.
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:12.720]  Instead of it blinding you, it empowers you.
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:13.720]  Yes, exactly.
[2:07:13.720 --> 2:07:18.640]  And it actually gives you deeper layers within yourself to not be affected.
[2:07:18.640 --> 2:07:24.120]  See, the thing is is that when they do this, they're not just messaging to their base.
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:28.920]  They're creating the energy out there that also messages back to the people who see it.
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:32.120]  But the question is, what is your response?
[2:07:32.120 --> 2:07:34.880]  If it's more despair and anger, they're winning.
[2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:37.960]  They're winning because they're creating negative energy.
[2:07:37.960 --> 2:07:41.800]  And they can create more negative, the more negative energy that they can put out there,
[2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:48.040]  whether it be violence, whether it be in words, whether it be in pulling down statues or changing
[2:07:48.040 --> 2:07:51.440]  names and everybody just freaking out with cancel culture.
[2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:54.960]  That's a win for them because it's, you're getting distracted.
[2:07:54.960 --> 2:08:01.760]  They're getting pulled into their operation, but I got to tell you, you offered to fly
[2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:02.960]  here and be in studio.
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:04.280]  I'm impressed with the work you're doing.
[2:08:04.280 --> 2:08:05.280]  You're dead on.
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:06.880]  If you want to come here next week, come on, my show for two hours.
[2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:09.520]  The other shows I'm sure would want to have you on John Paul Rice.
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:10.520]  I'd love to get you here.
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:14.240]  So the sky's not breaking up because what you're saying is dead on and I myself have
[2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:16.720]  to remember God's in control, Christ is in control.
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:21.640]  I just need to be positive and not get despair because that they want to get us despairing
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:27.320]  because then we're not being positive and so we need to be very truthful about the negative
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:31.520]  information, but in a positive way and not get caught up in what they're trying to do
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:32.520]  to us.
[2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:38.000]  That's the key to the whole thing is really this and I said this in the video, I wanted
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:43.760]  to give solutions to people at least to start is that you have to go within yourself during
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:48.800]  this time when the outside world does not make sense to you anymore.
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:54.600]  All you have is yourself and your love and your family and your children.
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:59.960]  And those are the people that matter the most in this time right now, and it will be important
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:06.320]  for us as things roll forward that we also go out and try to heal those who are hurt
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:09.840]  and badly damaged from this system.
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:13.960]  There's going to be a lot of carnage and there's going to be law enforcement, which can only
[2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:18.440]  do so much, but it's really up to the human beings of this planet.
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:22.120]  What future we wish to decide we want to live in.
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:23.720]  And that starts with each everyone.
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:25.800]  John Paul Rice, I'm impressed.
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:26.800]  You're awesome.
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:31.280]  No restrictions, EMT.com, a child's voice on Vimeo, flying to town, we're flying in right
[2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:32.280]  now.
[2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:33.280]  We really appreciate you and God bless my friend.
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:34.280]  Thank you.
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:35.280]  Thank you.
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:36.280]  Powerful.
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:37.280]  That's a great guy right there.
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:38.280]  You can tell.
[2:09:38.280 --> 2:09:39.280]  That's why the soul knows truth when you see him.
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:40.280]  That's a truthful guy.
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:41.280]  And so are you.
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:42.280]  And so am I.
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:43.280]  We all love God.
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:44.280]  We're in this together.
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:45.280]  We'll be right back.
[2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:56.280]  And so we're in this together.
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:01.280]  Now the media admits that almost every app in every company that are on Apple and on
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:06.520]  droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:08.580]  talk to, your relationships.
[2:10:08.580 --> 2:10:13.680]  And they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:18.960]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:24.320]  do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:25.660]  be saved forever.
[2:10:25.660 --> 2:10:29.840]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:30.960]  on information.
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:34.120]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.

[2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:47.880]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day.
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:48.880]  It's really strong.
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:52.720]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive boy and
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:57.680]  the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the choppers mountains.
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:10:59.880]  It's beyond Mexican coffee beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:04.360]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests hand selected
[2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:06.280]  beyond organic while crafted.
[2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:07.520]  Wake up America coffee.
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:09.160]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:13.280]  New stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.

[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:02.920]  I got off the river boat New Orleans in the spring of 82.
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:11.400]  I walked into a gambling house as gamblers often do.
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:15.000]  I had myself a drink and I joined in a poker game.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:21.920]  The dealer was a woman so I asked her for her name.
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:27.920]  She smiled at me so pretty but a hush fell over the place as a big man crossed the table
[2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:32.080]  stood up and slapped my face.
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:42.080]  Welcome back you know that's some pretty heavy stuff we covered the last hour 15 minutes.
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:45.840]  I got a lot more heavy stuff to cover because we don't face it we're going to be destroyed
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:49.280]  as a civilization and society.
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:54.840]  The next segment I've got something positive and funny to play I had an idea this morning
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:13:02.320]  bring to the great job with it because Brian Taylor goes look Joe Biden can ride a bike
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:09.240]  so he's incredible but then he says it's preposterous that Biden has any cognitive problems when
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:14.480]  clearly the man cannot do a one minute interview without sticking his foot in his mouth a half
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:19.360]  dozen times and never is seen outside his bunker I guess until recently he was out riding
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:24.320]  a bicycle so that's all coming up ladies and gentlemen.
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:28.800]  It's not posted a band out video yet it's not posted info wars John bounded report on

[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:02.240]  legally closes them now what they've done is they've hired high school and college students

[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:15.080]  than that but the one piece is 98,000 acre Barton Creek Edwards aquifer recharge zone
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:18.640]  but they spent hundreds of millions of dollars taking people's property adverse possession
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:28.880]  in the 1990s started in 92 with the ordinance they took all the property and they this is
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:33.920]  big canyons and it's a big Barton Creek on third it's beautiful and they started talking

[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:43.200]  all a fraud there's no law here is that report hope you share it with over a hundred thousand
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:48.960]  acres the parks in Austin Texas are known as some of the most beautiful and widespread
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:56.680]  in the country and in 1992 the save our spring's ordinance was adopted as law which opened
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:03.920]  up these beautiful lands to the public Austinites practically live in a national park taxpayers
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:12.080]  paid for it it is ours to enjoy it is the law but now Austin City Mayor Steven Adler
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:19.560]  is attempting to seize control he has erected makeshift registration booths at park entrances
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:25.760]  and hired lifeguards who have lost their jobs as a result of the covid shutdown to take
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:31.400]  reservations and register the names of anyone who enters it's been going on all over the
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:38.440]  nation for decades the United Nations Agenda 21 powerful entities seizing public lands

[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:53.600]  wear them out to political events you can trigger it live darts but one of the biggest reasons is
[2:22:53.600 --> 2:23:01.200]  it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at halloween but on top of that they admit
[2:23:01.200 --> 2:23:05.280]  that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from covid 19 or anything else
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:10.000]  it's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:15.280]  tracing of their openly announcing it's an active submission it's an active like putting a burqa on
[2:23:15.280 --> 2:23:20.640]  your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then in the stores when people ask you
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:26.240]  why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:31.680]  wearing and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:36.240]  covid 19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back at these control
[2:23:36.240 --> 2:23:42.800]  freaks faces you buy one for 9.95 you get four more free they're at cost infowarstore.com
[2:23:42.800 --> 2:24:03.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:11.120]  well the globalist hope that you don't spread the word about this broadcast but you know what
[2:24:11.120 --> 2:24:14.480]  you've been doing it you've been an amazing job and i thank you for myself and my family and your
[2:24:14.480 --> 2:24:19.840]  family because this is a fight between human intelligence if human will and satan and his
[2:24:19.840 --> 2:24:23.840]  minions and their ai garbage they've built that will end up being their downfall
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:32.960]  this morning i got up about six a.m and i saw an article on info wars.com of brian stelter and
[2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:39.120]  his orwellian named reliable sources and he's really a fun guy to talk about because he sounds
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:47.600]  like crispy the clown he's like oh it's incredible they claim biden isn't the greatest orator and
[2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:54.400]  linguist of all of history but in the piece it's like ten minutes long he never shows any clips of
[2:24:54.400 --> 2:25:04.000]  biden every time he talks it's a complete train wreck he obviously is in dimension
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:10.240]  and then he goes at the end he goes look biden's on a bicycle i'm like oh
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:19.120]  like he just walked on the moon or something no one said biden can't ride a bicycle we said he can't
[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:23.840]  talk a normal senate without sounding like there's a bunch of marbles in his mouth
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:31.600]  and so i thought with the piece well there's other things that can ride bicycles as well
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:37.440]  so rhesus monkeys things like that so uh this is an inspired piece that i may bring put together
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:41.760]  so if you needed to have a little um little laugh the video just went live on band dot video
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:49.120]  just minutes ago joe biden brian stelter and a monkey here it is let's go on a trip together
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:54.560]  to a totally alternative universe you never hear what's happening there unless you're tuned
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:59.200]  into right wing talk radio but you need to know what they are saying because the most popular
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:05.600]  most powerful talkers in the country have trained their sights on joe biden the president of the
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:16.720]  united states welcome to kingswood community center actually that's the one down i used to work
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:28.000]  as a joke you didn't know where you were anyway think about it what i got harry legs that turned
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:36.800]  that that that that that turned uh uh um blonde in the sun and i had a nurse at at uh nurses at
[2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:43.280]  walter reed hospital who would they'd actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move to get
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:48.880]  you get me moving and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:54.640]  was straight and then watch the hair come come back up again they look at it so i learned about
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:27:00.400]  roaches i learned about kids jumping on my lap and i love kids jumping on my lap look look whether
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:08.000]  you like biden or not this stuff is offensive and otherworldly keep in mind that news and talk radio
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:13.680]  is still really popular even in the internet age guys like rush limbaugh and sean hannity
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:18.400]  can influence tens of millions of listeners but nowadays if you listen to those shows
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:25.280]  they have shifted to big time biden bashing oh yeah you know what this is this is negative
[2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:30.640]  partisanship oh gosh i shouldn't say i'm gonna say something i don't i probably shouldn't say
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:38.000]  anyway i am uh i am very willing to let the american public judge my physical mental field
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:44.720]  my physical as well as my mental fitness fitness and uh to uh you know to make a judgment about
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:50.480]  who i am babbling brain dead dumbass lawyer joe biden stumbling
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:58.240]  emblematically that's what rules over us it is especially extreme especially vitriolic
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:04.320]  on the right directed at joe biden every day every day this is what's airing on the radio
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:09.280]  there's michael savage saying i pity the man there's mark levin saying i think biden's in a
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:15.680]  nursing home what the heck is going on on these programs look at what fox news saw on saturday
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:22.480]  at rhopeth beach Delaware this is joe biden out there on a vigorous bike ride not wearing a helmet
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:28.560]  but definitely wearing a mask by the way fox's narrative and ray talk radio's narrative for
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:35.040]  months has been that joe biden is falling apart mary is riding the bike out for a bike ride
[2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:43.680]  and fox of all networks is the one that showed it happen you're ready unless you put clips of
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:48.960]  monkeys on bikes because it's like if you're not a bike you can be president right joe biden ryan
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:55.280]  still turned a monkey oh my god but the footage him riding around the middle of the woods with a mask
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:03.680]  on this is ridiculous meanwhile here are the headlines info wars dot com paris imposes mandatory
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:10.880]  face mask in public billionaire hong kong protest backer jimmy lay arrested oh yeah
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:17.440]  covid-19 worked good for the chikoms payroll tax cut they'd be permanent says trump china slaps
[2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:22.480]  retaliatory sanctions on ten crews marco rubio and other china hawks
[2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:27.920]  of course you can see the hasbro video that has a secret button with a
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:35.280]  female troll baby has orgasms these people are sick of course if you just joined us you
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:39.680]  know i really should just be saying this for four hours straight democrats war game for election

[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:50.560]  york times now that means they're gonna go operational with this you're like but that's crazy
[2:29:50.560 --> 2:29:56.000]  well they never got in trouble for everything else and so still the justice department even though
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:59.680]  the elements of it some of them are bad they're like that's too dangerous to go after a much too
[2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:03.600]  dangerous to arrest members of congress that's too dangerous to shut this down okay so you're
[2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:13.440]  gonna let them actually try it okay that's that's that's even more insane but that's where we are
[2:30:13.440 --> 2:30:18.880]  is a bunch of scared men and women watching to see who they think went that's why polosi's like
[2:30:18.880 --> 2:30:23.760]  trouble be gone in months military is about overthrowing that's so all the weak-minded people
[2:30:24.720 --> 2:30:28.800]  embedded in the fbi embedded in the cia embedded in the bureaucracy
[2:30:29.840 --> 2:30:34.400]  yet you have polosi saying that you know china wants to biden to win see that they're preparing

[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:56.720]  churches have been burned in europe and the us hundreds of christian icons have been burned

[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:13.360]  out of control but people now understand that evil was always real it is spiritual and it was just
[2:35:13.360 --> 2:35:18.800]  waiting to make its move building beneath the surface and now it's emerged that's why when i

[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:59.200]  the renaissance america human liberty the west built all the freedom all the choices all the
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:06.480]  empowerment we see the general population has been programmed that submission to tyranny
[2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:12.960]  brings them prosperity because the last 50 years under psychotic globalist control they have
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:20.320]  taught us by successive approximation to bow down and each time be given a reward a treat
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:26.000]  but that's like training wild pigs to come eat out of your hand and finally one day you
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:32.640]  lead them into the barn and close the door and butcher them we're now reaching that point in
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:40.400]  societal development where submission is death where submission is the human species being
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:45.840]  destroyed forever on the altar of satan just a few months ago almost every storeable food
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:50.160]  manufacturer was sold out they were still taking people's orders and many of the companies have
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.560]  still not fulfilled them all the orders we got in have been fulfilled our suppliers the best the
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:36:58.800]  highest quality the best containers to transport it as well and they've got the food with four
[2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:03.360]  factories in stock takes them two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you you need to order
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:08.480]  your storeable food now the world is much more dire the economic system is collapsing the third
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:13.840]  world is already starving to death food prices are exploding here the farms and the production
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:17.600]  plants are shutting down because of the covid hoax you need to get your storeable food while you
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:23.360]  still can at m4store.com so 361 it also funds our operation but you need to get it whether three
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:28.320]  months six months a year you need to get that now and have that checkbox off of being prepared
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:31.920]  and being self-sufficient we also have high quality water filtration and air filtration
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:36.720]  at m4store.com they're absolute must but whatever you do ladies and gentlemen don't wait until a
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:41.200]  bigger crisis comes don't wait till everybody panics take action get ready now
[2:37:41.200 --> 2:38:02.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:15.120]  it's become really shocking every day or so
[2:38:17.600 --> 2:38:26.240]  we get a new video in australia of police choking women around the neck in in like famous rape
[2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:32.640]  choke and then getting them down on the ground and taking them to jail because they're outside
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:38.720]  even with mask in major cities that they're under un plan for paris is going under it now
[2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:45.040]  now they say you can't even leave your house and by the way there's almost no cases of covid
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:50.240]  in australia the whole thing's a hoax i'll get to it in a moment but let's play this audio i mean
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:55.360]  here's the deal the globalist one control the police australian police never became free it's
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:39:00.720]  been a slave colony a prisoner colony they're good people there but there's a very thin veneer of
[2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:09.920]  civilization and behind it is a police state and australia is now literally body slamming women
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:15.040]  attacking women who try to go out during the day or at night some areas have been locked down for
[2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:19.520]  eight weeks you cannot leave your house period food is delivered to you and they have almost no
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:25.840]  deaths no cases it's total fraud this is a crime against humanity but oh it happens to george
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:33.520]  floyd it's the end of the world i'm against what happened to george floyd but it happens all over
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:38.480]  where some black cop beats up a black dude for not wearing a mask now it's not even not wearing a mask
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:43.840]  it's being outside your house it's all to see what they can get away with so let's go ahead and play
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:58.080]  the audio go ahead
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:04.080]  tonight
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:07.600]  two men and a woman they're choking a woman
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:13.600]  he's choking the hell out of her because she's bad another been given authority to do this
[2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:17.360]  these police are going to be arrested god almighty i couldn't watch this
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:20.160]  i body slammer
[2:40:23.280 --> 2:40:29.440]  keep choking her you don't leave your house slave we've got a unedited to run here
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:33.680]  the police really are the enemy of the people in australia
[2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:40.960]  you know during the break i told you guys what clips i wanted now i can't remember i'm just i'm
[2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:44.480]  just too blown away what was the next get here's another woman being arrested in australia play it
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:53.920]  for being outside during the day i want to go outside the cops are even wearing a mask today
[2:40:55.840 --> 2:41:00.640]  and i gotta say it nothing against asians but in australia they're hiring mainly chinese police
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:02.320]  look like most of those cops are chinese
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:18.400]  these cops are such thugs man just like in england they're arresting you if you show the
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:22.560]  noblems coming in illegally on the ships these cops are bad people man
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:33.840]  all right this next one is a father in england
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:40.800]  beating up a migrant he caught trying to kidnap his daughter
[2:41:41.920 --> 2:41:46.480]  because another company girl in many areas of africa the middle east is slave meat
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:49.120]  won't play the audio it hadn't been bleeped out i guess go ahead and roll it
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:52.880]  and again the father catches what's going on and here's the video of that
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:59.520]  so it's going to be war on the streets folks is the police stand down in the u k in australia they
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:06.800]  work for the invasion they work for the takedown and the i mean i'm telling you in the u k the

[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:22.400]  sorrows pays for with muslim men pouring off and these dudes just think i guarantee the police
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:27.200]  are gonna go arrest that father because raping children's not a problem the one crime there is

[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:40.960]  been taken over by muslim a few hundred years ago they just had a celebration to this particular
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:45.600]  hindu deity facebook said you cannot do that because that hindu deity is associated with
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:51.760]  the shrine that muslims have taken over and muslims are upset so hindus can't even have a facebook
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:43:00.080]  event dancing around supporting one of their saints i mean it's just it's unbelievable

[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:51.120]  because he might not want to move out of the white house doesn't mean we won't have an
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:56.640]  inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the united states
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:03.440]  and the uh i just you know i'm second in line uh to the presidency and just last week i had my
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:10.880]  regular continuation of government briefing this might interest you because it's i say to them
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:16.720]  this is never going to happen god willing it never will but there is a process it has nothing to do
[2:57:16.720 --> 2:57:21.920]  with it the certain occupant of the white house doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:28.880]  out of there because the presidency is the presidency it's not a geography or location
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:34.320]  the democratic panic is in full gear you can hear it in the warbling of former president obama as
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:39.360]  the hellhounds draw near there are those in power who are doing their darndest
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:48.400]  to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:56.080]  and students with restrictive id laws even undermining the postal service in the run-up
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:58:02.960]  to an election that's going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don't get sick so we caught
[2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:09.440]  president obama and biden spying on the campaign uh i caught them and we caught them spying using
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:16.240]  the intelligence apparatus of our country to spy on an opponent opponents or the opposing parties
[2:58:16.240 --> 2:58:22.400]  campaign both before and after the election how about after the election i had already won so that
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:28.560]  was a story we caught them spying now it's up to our attorney general uh as you know i've wanted
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:33.840]  them to do it i didn't want to get overly involved maybe i should maybe i shouldn't but i do hear
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:39.200]  it's breathtaking what they found that's all i can say breathtaking you can hear it in polosian
[2:58:39.200 --> 2:58:45.520]  schumer as they failed to support the american people during a pandemic shutdown at times yesterday
[2:58:45.520 --> 2:58:51.600]  our republican friends seem willing to walk away from the negotiating table to do an unworkable
[2:58:51.600 --> 2:58:56.480]  weak and narrow executive orders which are not going to do the job for the american people
[2:58:57.200 --> 2:59:04.640]  we are committed to negotiating and as we said we are willing to make compromises won't millions
[2:59:04.640 --> 2:59:13.200]  of americans now get some extended federal unemployment relief and some protection from evictions
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:20.160]  uh get that now rather than getting nothing at all no in fact what the president did is i agree with
[2:59:20.160 --> 2:59:26.800]  the republican senator said it was unconstitutional slump you're known as a mass master negotiator
[2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:32.160]  but didn't you mess this one up failure to make a deal is going to result in a lot of people
[2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:37.840]  and a lot of entities that were in need ending up with nothing well how do you come how do you
[2:59:37.840 --> 2:59:47.760]  justify tens of billions of dollars to feed the hungry to 250 000 you understand how far apart we
[2:59:47.760 --> 2:59:54.320]  are just by that example are you talking about going to court because if you do you must know
[2:59:54.320 --> 2:59:59.760]  that the practical effect would of that would be if you're successful that you would be blocking
[2:59:59.760 --> 3:00:04.400]  i know you'd think that they should be 600 rather than 400 but you would be blocking if you were
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:09.840]  successful uh the millions of unemployed workers from getting any federal benefit you can hear it
[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:15.440]  in the new york times columnist ben smith where the entire country is brought to its knees for the
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:26.080]  sake of political war gaming shall we play a game how about global ammo nuclear war as smith
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:32.640]  writes a group of former top government officials called the transition integrity project cast john
[3:00:32.640 --> 3:00:37.680]  pedesta who was illy clinton's campaign chairman in the role of mr biden they expected him when
[3:00:37.680 --> 3:00:44.240]  the votes came in to concede just as mrs clinton had but mr pedesta playing mr biden shocked the
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:49.760]  organizers by saying he felt his party wouldn't let him concede alleging voter suppression he
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:54.800]  persuaded the governors of wisconsin and michigan to send pro biden electors to the electoral
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:01:01.840]  college tell me this is one of your simulations not yet all right flush the bombers get the subs
[3:01:01.840 --> 3:01:09.520]  and launch mode we are at def con one in that scenario california or again in washington then
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:15.280]  threatened to secede from the united states if mr trump took office as planned the house named
[3:01:15.280 --> 3:01:21.120]  mr biden president the senate and white house stuck with mr trump at that point the nation stopped
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:27.680]  looking for the media for cues and waited to see what the military would do one need look no further
[3:01:27.680 --> 3:01:34.480]  than joe biden who is democrat panic incarnate a blubbering senile old school racist globalist
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:40.720]  minion representing a portion of america that is so confused that they would willingly support him
[3:01:40.720 --> 3:01:49.520]  john bound reporting so that report is at info wars dot com and band dot video and it's just
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:56.400]  exactly what the democrats are planning on doing just laid out in a fashion of oh you know we're
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:01.920]  just thinking about this or we're just going to do a little drill or we're just practicing in case
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:10.880]  this happens no this is what they plan on doing and in fact i ran an electoral college simulation
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:18.320]  even if the democrats win texas which i think there's a good chance they could this texas gop is
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:24.240]  a mighty failure maybe alan west can save it but i think even if the democrats won texas trump would
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:31.920]  still have enough votes uh at 273 to get him over the top so they are really planning on either faking
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:38.720]  the election results with mainstream news running fake results saying biden won
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:46.080]  or they'll run the results that trump won but then they'll say oh well he had the popular vote in
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:53.440]  these states no longer abide by the electoral college and so they're gonna secede and i'll pepper
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:58.240]  this in right now and i'm gonna get into this more on the war room that i host today at three p.m
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:03:07.520]  central they are now planning their physical front the militant wing of the democrat party is now
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:16.240]  planning starting september 17th occupy the white house which will last for 50 days which is of
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:21.600]  course conveniently right up to the election night so they're gonna have all their people
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:26.320]  just like they had them in lafayette square they're gonna have all their people surrounding
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:32.320]  the white house thousands of them and they'll either force they'll either tell them that
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:35.760]  they're gonna go in and forcefully remove the president of the united states as they're all
[3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:43.440]  hopped up and then that will cause a physical confrontation with police or secret service
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:49.920]  or whoever is out there but this is their plan and they've laid it all out they know that joe
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:57.120]  biden can't win a real election it's really just trump versus anti-trump they won't even
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:04:02.640]  let biden out of the basement but jill biden goes and does in-home interviews for abc news
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:08.560]  and others while they keep joe locked in a basement so savannah hernandez and i will be covering
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:14.320]  that and i also want to open up the phone lines do you think they're going to get away with this
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:18.560]  what do you think is going to happen because they're going to go for an overthrow of the election
[3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:26.240]  we know that this is going to happen within the next 90 days guaranteed 100 and then whatever
[3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:31.600]  happens after that they'll just come back on whatever the inauguration day is and just start
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:40.960]  riding and looting like they did in 2017 but it's rica crescendo now americans are fed up with it
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:47.840]  and it's just the mental illness of the liberal that's out on the street that's willing to go
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:53.040]  destroy property willing to put people's lives in danger because the television and the mainstream
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:04:59.200]  news told them to it's clear that they have no other recourse they have no ability to think for
[3:04:59.200 --> 3:05:04.480]  themselves so whatever the tv and hollywood and the democrats tell them to do they will do and so
[3:05:04.480 --> 3:05:09.840]  that's what they're going to do and that's what they're going to do and that's what they're going to
[3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:15.120]  do and so that's why this is so dangerous so uh savannah hernandez is here with me you've been
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:19.520]  covering and i know you're going to get into some of the violence in chicago over the weekend
[3:05:20.400 --> 3:05:25.440]  yes yeah i mean you know i took a break from twitter as i like to do on the weekend just to
[3:05:25.440 --> 3:05:30.480]  take a good social media break and a news break and of course coming back a monday morning chicago
[3:05:30.480 --> 3:05:34.880]  is burnt with chris and of course anyone who's just getting into politics for the first time one
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:41.120]  of the easiest patterns that we can see is that democrat run cities democrat run you know states
[3:05:41.120 --> 3:05:47.280]  are the ones that have the most violence the most destruction all of these blm and antifa groups are
[3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:54.480]  running rampant and you call them the militant wing of the democratic party and you know i was
[3:05:54.480 --> 3:06:00.080]  listening to lori lightfoot chicago mayor and everything that she had to say about all of the
[3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:05.600]  destruction that happened here i've been listening to to mazy herono to jerry nadler who refused to
[3:06:05.600 --> 3:06:10.960]  denounce antifa violence lori lightfoot who refuses to take responsibility for her bad leadership
[3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:16.720]  for all of the violence from blm in her city and that's exactly what it is these people are the
[3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:20.400]  militant wing of the democratic party and that's why they refuse to denounce them and refuse to
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:25.520]  denounce their violence and you know you also made the point too that it's not really trump versus
[3:06:25.520 --> 3:06:31.280]  joe biden it's trump versus antitrump and just common sense if you take a look around the nation
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:37.520]  right now i've seen more bernie 2016 bumper stickers than i have joe biden or elizabeth
[3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:44.960]  warren or any of that exactly there is introducing infowars life pure tumeric extract this is taken
[3:06:44.960 --> 3:06:51.840]  under the tongue it is pure tumeric it goes together very well with our body's ultimate
[3:06:51.840 --> 3:06:57.920]  tumeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:02.480]  this is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then

[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:09:02.800]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:13.760]  so we're in the fourth hour of the alex jones show olyn shroyer savannah hernandez in studio
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:22.240]  we're going to go to your phone calls 877-789-2539 i'm probably not hysterical enough over the
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:27.600]  fact that the democrats are now planning an open insurrection not the behind the doors coup that
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:37.120]  the obama administration ran but just a open for the public to see insurrection coup against
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:44.880]  president trump and against the united states of america and they're so dead on arrival that
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:52.400]  their only option is to just go beyond what they had planned so i mean just just complete
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:10:00.960]  deception complete reversal of reality complete cultural rot it's all that they have at this point
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:06.880]  and it's sad and frustrating to sit here and watch it but americans are waking up to it so the phone
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:14.160]  number to call in 877-789-2539 if you want to weigh in on the open democrat insurrection against
[3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:18.800]  the country but uh savannah you were talking about over the weekend how all these cities
[3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:26.640]  whether you look at chicago or st louis or new york all run by democrats for 50 years and this is
[3:10:26.640 --> 3:10:31.200]  and this is where you have the most violence this is where you have the most crime which is skyrocketing
[3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:36.160]  now by the way and they blame covid even though the numbers say that that's not true it's all
[3:10:36.160 --> 3:10:40.960]  because of the media hyping up the floyd protest which you're sick of seeing that too because
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:44.640]  well george floyd say what you want about that interaction between him and the minneapolis
[3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:50.720]  police uh he was bombed out of his mind on drugs that day it shows from the police video and by the
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:57.600]  way nobody wants to play that though all the media that shows george floyd dying they didn't show the
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:03.840]  10 to 20 minutes of confrontation before that when floyd was obviously out of his mind on drugs
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:08.400]  and you know that's what's making me so frustrated too is that america has really made a martyr
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:14.400]  out of a man who had overdosed on drugs who had previously held a pregnant woman at gunpoint this
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:20.000]  was not a good person and now you can't walk down any city street here in austin without seeing george
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:26.480]  floyd's name or seeing a george floyd memorial of some type and it enrages me so much because
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:31.440]  we're just being lied to so much by our media and you know prior to coming on the show today
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:35.760]  i was talking to you about how black pilled i've been feeling about everything because of
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:40.560]  the corona virus lies because of the black lives matter lies because of the antifa lies
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:44.880]  and you know even their lori lightfoot what did she tweet out this past weekend she tweeted out
[3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:51.120]  this picture of all of these people outside at the major don't call don't call the homosexual
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:57.680]  sunbathing exercise these people okay be politically correct that is a gay sun bathing ritual my
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:01.280]  apologies thank you for correcting me i'm glad you're here i'm glad you're here you're welcome so
[3:12:01.280 --> 3:12:05.440]  anyway she tweets out this picture because this is what she's anti-gay now by the way she wants to
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:11.120]  focus on people outside sunbathing not social distancing basically saying we're in a pandemic
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:16.960]  no hold on you're not reporting this right she is anti-gay now she's anti-gay no i'm serious
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:23.280]  because if Trump did that he'd be anti-gay ignoring the fact that in her city her city literally
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:28.000]  experienced one of its most in its whole entire history chicago had one of its most dangerous
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:33.520]  weekends in the beginning of june just this past weekend 35 more people were shot what just happened
[3:12:33.520 --> 3:12:39.520]  in the early morning of this morning in chicago there were stores that were looted in ransacked
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:45.040]  and if you look at the complete arrogance and the attitude of blm rioters towards the police
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:51.040]  right now in chicago watch the videos they're not only filming themselves looting these stores
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:54.720]  because they don't care at this point they know the police aren't going to do anything but you can
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:13:00.320]  calmly see them walking out of the stores they just ransacked with their piles of goodies because
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:05.440]  they're not afraid of the police they're not afraid of the mayor she has done nothing she has
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:10.480]  emboldened these people and going back to antifa as well you said it was a militant wing and i wanted
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:16.400]  to expand a little bit more on this because antifa is a left-wing extremist group again
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:21.040]  militant wing like you had said that has been emboldened by democrats in power because they
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:24.720]  allowed them to run rampant in the streets these are domestic terrorists and they're
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:30.240]  continually lying to the american public about this group too saying oh antifa doesn't even exist
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:36.160]  jerry nadler said that mazy harono has said that they refuse to acknowledge this group at all
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:41.600]  while simultaneously allowing them to destroy america stomp on our flag destroy small businesses
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:46.720]  terrorize children in their homes at night blm terrorist organization antifa terrorist
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:51.280]  organization all emboldened by these same democrats and i was talking to you about this too
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:58.000]  let's look at any democrat city st louis chicago los angeles take any of these cities with high
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:04.320]  crime rates high homelessness disease-ridden disgusting crap holes they're all democrat run
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:10.160]  so why in anyone's right mind would they want to put a democrat in office i don't understand why
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:16.080]  people genuinely think that the democrat party is good physically seeing all this going on every
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:20.240]  single day and you know ted wheeler the the mayor of portland as well as come forward and said that
[3:14:20.240 --> 3:14:26.000]  he said y'all need to calm down because at this point you guys are just a campaign uh for getting
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:31.120]  donald trump reelected want to answer the question you say why would they be out here doing this it's
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:36.560]  the same old why why would they vote democrats it's the same old why because the tv is their daddy
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:42.320]  the tv is their teacher the tv is their leader why are they out on the streets riding and protesting
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:46.560]  because of george floyd well why do they even know who george floyd is because the television
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:50.240]  told them and you know what that's the same thing too that's why i have such a frustration with the
[3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:56.160]  coronavirus and the face masks i was out in san antonio this past weekend i was out and out and
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:15:04.240]  at an outdoor nursery and everyone outside was wearing face masks outside we had to keep six
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:08.080]  feet of distance and i just looked around and said this isn't about science anymore are you people
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:12.960]  idiots and i'm so frustrated with america right now because you're right the tv tells you what to
[3:15:12.960 --> 3:15:17.280]  think celebrities tell you what to do that's why when elissa malano tells you to wear a face mask
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:21.920]  you do it i don't understand why we have so many americans who are willingly putting on the face
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:26.480]  mask right now and willingly allowing all of these practices to come into our country the government
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:31.040]  to take away our freedoms you know a lot of people are trying to say oh well i wear a face mask because
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:35.680]  i'm trying to respect a person's private property which i agree with but guess what walk into any
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:39.200]  store right now without a face mask you don't have to put it on no one's going to say anything to you
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:42.720]  i went to hb the other day and i walked past three people and i was waiting for them to say hey before
[3:15:42.720 --> 3:15:46.640]  you come in you need to wear a face mask which i would have gladly done if they tell me to do it
[3:15:46.640 --> 3:15:51.440]  no one ever tells me to do it so people have become so brainwashed now that we are now outside in 93
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:57.360]  degree heat with face masks on in august this is never going to stop because the democrats have
[3:15:57.360 --> 3:16:01.280]  brainwashed everyone as has the media and nobody thinks for themselves and you can take a peek at
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:06.160]  any anything going on in america right now and basically see that the majority of people have no
[3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:10.800]  common sense and i'm just so frustrated with it well i wonder what's going to happen here in austin
[3:16:10.800 --> 3:16:16.080]  august 15th allegedly is when the mask mandate is going to be lifted that's what they told us
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:20.640]  it's not yeah i don't think so either mayor adler was on a national tv interview saying how
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:27.040]  he's learned on how to properly reopen and keep things closed and what's risky and what's not it's
[3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:32.080]  like it's just it's so pathetic meanwhile all the homeless are still peeing in our streets not one
[3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:38.080]  homeless person i've seen with a face mask mind you i didn't see any of the looters in that video
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:42.560]  that we shared wearing face masks which which is striking normally they do to cover their identity
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:47.040]  so it's weird how they would uh that's how arrogant they've gotten now they don't even care because
[3:16:47.040 --> 3:16:51.120]  they know that in these democrat run cities the police aren't going to come hold them accountable
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:55.600]  that the mayor isn't going to hold them accountable that mayor lori lightfoot's going to make sure
[3:16:55.600 --> 3:17:00.080]  that donald trump doesn't send federal troops or the national guard into our city to enact a law in
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:06.400]  order well look i think it's time for the aclu and the adl to look into mayor lori lightfoot's
[3:17:06.400 --> 3:17:14.000]  anti-gay action to shut down a gay sunbathing ritual yeah this is this is this is the most
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:19.760]  homophobic 20 in 2020 of all years unbelievable mayor lori lightfoot you know what letting chicago
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:25.440]  burn to the ground is one thing that's okay but when you shut down a gay sunbathing ritual
[3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:30.880]  because of covet that's where i draw the line that's crossing so mayor lot and i i know a gay
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:36.400]  rights activist gay men have the right to sunbathe too mayor lori lightfoot why are you anti-gay
[3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:40.880]  all right your call is coming up we close and lock our doors and windows at night not because
[3:17:40.880 --> 3:17:46.720]  we're doing anything wrong but because it's about privacy and it's about security and it's something

[3:17:51.760 --> 3:17:56.080]  century at the entrance of the village so we would know if predators or criminals were coming well

[3:21:05.920 --> 3:21:12.720]  troyer
[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:20.240]  there's a video at band.video alex jones confronts mass contact tracers guarding austin public
[3:21:20.240 --> 3:21:25.840]  parks i know that you've dealt with these people before savannah and i was thinking about this
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:32.960]  because i watched that and look i mean i i've been the guy that had to be obnoxious at the
[3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:38.000]  scene of something happening before so i can't you know i can't i can't fault alex for that but
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:45.120]  i'm thinking is there a way to do this without having to get so aggressive and you know without
[3:21:45.120 --> 3:21:51.120]  having to get uppity in people's faces i'm thinking well okay you could you could maybe
[3:21:51.120 --> 3:21:56.000]  kindly stand there and kindly inform people and kindly speak to the officers or whoever's
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  there like hey you know actually this ordinance is not a law and uh also you can't ask me if i
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:05.360]  say i have a medical condition i don't have to wear a mask and by the way you can't make people
[3:22:05.360 --> 3:22:10.160]  wear a mask and you can have polite conversations and then and so this is where you could get
[3:22:10.160 --> 3:22:15.680]  aggressive though if they refuse you entry to a public park or they refuse you entry into a building
[3:22:15.680 --> 3:22:20.800]  or they harass you over a mask that's when you just calmly but politely say okay well you know what
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:26.960]  this conversation is now going to change into a peaceful protest and you just become a peaceful
[3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:31.920]  protester and you can just start saying black lives matter without your cardboard sign you don't
[3:22:31.920 --> 3:22:37.280]  even need a sign just hold the fist up and just black lives matter i can't breathe and it's like
[3:22:37.280 --> 3:22:42.160]  cultural black just take a group of your 10 friends and then just start saying black lives matter
[3:22:42.160 --> 3:22:48.960]  and calmly walk into barton springs that's how we're gonna get through this just water just like
[3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:54.400]  that just like black magic exactly see that's a peaceful protest right there but but seriously
[3:22:54.400 --> 3:22:59.360]  because it'll scramble all the wires because they've been trained not to touch a black lives
[3:22:59.360 --> 3:23:04.560]  matter protester not to touch a liberal protester it's in their training so literally it's like
[3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:10.080]  cultural black magic like dark force like okay well okay i'm gonna have to turn this into a
[3:23:10.080 --> 3:23:15.600]  peaceful protest then and then you just walk in the park black lives matter black lives and then
[3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:19.360]  you're in the park that's the key that's the key you need at least three to four people if you have
[3:23:19.360 --> 3:23:23.840]  that many you're a small group no i genuinely you know i've been thinking about this i'm a three-spirit
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:27.440]  genderqueer i have been thinking about this because you know that not being able to go to
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:31.600]  barton springs has been something that has frustrated me because not only do the taxpayers
[3:23:31.600 --> 3:23:39.120]  pay for this park and is it's public property um but you know basically if we've got 50 people
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:44.960]  just to march in there they can't stop everyone and there we go everyone can see you're still looking
[3:23:44.960 --> 3:23:51.120]  for rational scenarios here i'm going completely irrational into the lefto clown world see i'm
[3:23:51.120 --> 3:23:56.240]  a three-spirit genderqueer therefore i am three people i've been so frustrated in 2020 i think
[3:23:56.240 --> 3:24:02.320]  because i keep looking for rationality no in all of these people in all of these so this is a peaceful
[3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:07.040]  protest now and you just walk into the park or walk into the store and it's just black lives matter
[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:10.800]  and then everybody will leave you alone i'm telling you man just how to go about this all right let's
[3:24:10.800 --> 3:24:15.360]  take phone calls i promised i would oh and shroy or savannah hernan as in studio on the alex jones
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:19.680]  who i'll be jumping over to the war room studio after this to host the war room i got a lot of
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:25.200]  stuff coming up folks austin in virginia austin in virginia you're on the alex jones show go ahead
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:31.360]  hey olyn can you hear me loud and clear well it's good to good to talk to you again sir i was
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:36.320]  going to talk about this liberal insurrection uh that we all know and feel is coming to a crescendo
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:42.080]  this new november but you you mentioned a very great point about how the tv is becoming these
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:48.320]  leftist parents uh i mean pbs has published numerous new episodes these past few weeks
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:55.040]  totally just on the basis of racism and just keeping it alive i mean pbs is pushing the narrative
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:00.400]  of racism and white privilege so when are we gonna stand around and protest and defund pbs
[3:25:01.280 --> 3:25:05.680]  and austin i don't know if you saw this but there was actually a segment on arthur
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:10.480]  so it's directed towards children but it was arthur and buster talking to their teacher about
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:16.640]  racism in george floyd to children arthur like the rodent yeah arthur on pbs they had a whole show
[3:25:16.640 --> 3:25:22.480]  dedicated to george floyd and them talking about hold on hold on i'm confused you're talking about
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:28.240]  arthur like the kids show the kids show arthur okay the show about like rodents and rats and
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:36.720]  stuff and like bunnies yes so this is it they're talking about racism i don't know i didn't know
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:40.400]  arthur how to wait hold on a second i thought he was at art bark this whole time arthur the
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:45.520]  art bark who is apparently black now and his friend who's a white bunny i mean they've been so woke
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:49.280]  and you know who else was featured racist who was the black democrat that just died john lewis
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:54.480]  yeah he was also featured in an episode as well talking about racism and how arthur can stop bullying
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:58.720]  and i was just sitting there like wow back in my day it was just dw and arthur fighting over
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:04.400]  dumb kid stuff and now it's all racism and honestly austin the point you bring up is valid but it's
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:09.840]  so much worse than that i mean the stuff that pbs and npr gets away with all the anti-american
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:15.600]  anti-trump lies it's really even worse than them you know trying to bring racism back for our children
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:21.520]  oh it it's completely treasonous and and they're feeding it right into our school system i mean
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:26.400]  this is where our schools are getting all this liberal liberal indoctrination uh their study
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:31.440]  guide i mean they're taking it right from the higher ups in media what happened to the good
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:37.920]  old days or they just gave you soft homosexual stereotypes like bernie you know now they just
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:43.120]  want to now they just want to jam it down your throat no pun intended oh yeah with the little
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:47.120]  troll doll that they have a special touch me button i you know what i don't even want to go
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:51.760]  down that road honestly hey thanks for the call austin let's go to steven calling in from florida

[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:16.400]  real courage and like alex has been saying that should be the norm it shouldn't be the exceptions
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:20.560]  i just want to commend you guys for what you do well let me just first of all thank you for those
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:27.760]  kind words and i know savannah appreciates it appreciates it too i'm happy that because it's
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:31.600]  come to a point now where if i go out there i have to have a bunch of security and and really i just
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:36.160]  don't want to i just don't want to lark with these kids anymore i'm just sick of it but i'm happy
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:41.200]  that other people are doing it it's not as many as we need it's not as much as we need and it
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:45.280]  obviously doesn't get the media coverage but other people are finally standing up you're
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:50.080]  seeing beaver beverland beady you know wipe out the black lives matter thing other people are
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:54.240]  doing that you saw the young individual write unborn black lives matter and then get arrested
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:27:59.120]  in front of plant parenthood you're seeing proud boys in colorado go stomp a bunch of antifa
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:03.920]  commies into a ditch literally by the way the man that shot that's going to be on the
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:09.440]  war room with me in about an hour so thanks for those kind words i'm glad to see other people
[3:28:09.440 --> 3:28:14.720]  finally rising up what else even yes sir okay man there's so much i want to say so i'll try to keep
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:21.760]  this brief but here's what i see coming and then i'm going to give the solution for this really
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:28.720]  quickly um there's a guy named brandon house i don't know if you ever heard of him b r a n n on
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:35.920]  h o w s e he's been doing this for longer than alex he's got a thing called worldview weekend
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:40.720]  dot com and last night he was interviewing a woman that used to be with the c i a and he's
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:47.120]  got on his website let me read you the title this street insurgency how the marxist black lives matter
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:54.960]  in islamist are united to burn down america what she talked about is the three color code which is
[3:28:54.960 --> 3:29:02.400]  the red the black and the green and she they're showing how the leader of care the council of
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:09.840]  american islamic relations and muslim brotherhood are fully black it backing black lives matter and
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:16.480]  of course the communists as g edward griffin is shown they want to infiltrate the black community
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:21.280]  to turn us into a race war to brainwash them that's why they went to the black churches
[3:29:22.320 --> 3:29:30.400]  but the thing i want to say is this i do not see an election happening this november with these
[3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:37.360]  foot soldiers and these are not anarchists like matt bracken says they are communists but they are
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:43.600]  being funded by people like george soros and the clinton's and obama and others they intend to take
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:50.560]  this to the lowest level let's put that way that they can they're not going to stop and so here's
[3:29:50.560 --> 3:29:55.600]  what i want to let everybody know there's three things you can do to prepare well for first of
[3:29:55.600 --> 3:30:01.440]  all mike adams has what he calls and this is free you can go to natural news dot com it's called the
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:09.360]  global reset survival guide put in for his newsletter and download that it's nine hours of pdf and audio
[3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:18.640]  he put this out free secondly go online and watch the battle of athens tennessee that took place in
[3:30:18.640 --> 3:30:26.720]  1946 and see how americans dealt with tyranny then and then the other thing is go online and read
[3:30:26.720 --> 3:30:33.280]  patrick henry's historic speech that he gave in 19 or 1775 all right steven thanks for that call
[3:30:33.280 --> 3:30:37.920]  all right i'm gonna get to as many colors as we can you got 90 seconds coming up vicki gibbs
[3:30:38.720 --> 3:30:48.640]  57 year old lesbian preacher in houston went in with a cough got intubated and then died and as
[3:30:48.640 --> 3:30:54.240]  soon as i saw her face as soon as i saw the report i said watch it'll be innovation we know what's
[3:30:54.240 --> 3:31:01.040]  going to happen it's a blue city the same story yet again and they say her heart gave out if you
[3:31:01.040 --> 3:31:06.320]  put somebody on a breathing tube in coven 19 as a death sentence it's on record when everyone you
[3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:10.800]  know before they go to the hospital and get killed why are almost all the deaths happening in blue
[3:31:10.800 --> 3:31:16.480]  cities in blue states it's because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and coven 19
[3:31:16.480 --> 3:31:22.160]  is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen the doctors are on records saying
[3:31:22.160 --> 3:31:28.560]  it will kill you but all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders and the
[3:31:28.560 --> 3:31:35.120]  minute i saw this report today i knew what i would be reading don't end up like vicki gibbs or everyone
[3:31:36.400 --> 3:31:40.640]  a lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms about to introduce but
[3:31:40.640 --> 3:31:47.920]  some folks aren't so for those that aren't here they are activated charcoal and then another term
[3:31:47.920 --> 3:31:57.360]  enamel safe activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason
[3:31:57.360 --> 3:32:01.840]  it really really works well we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no
[3:32:01.840 --> 3:32:06.400]  fillers the cleanest type the highest quality with a bunch of high quality and central oils and other

[3:32:16.240 --> 3:32:20.880]  really clean and it's good for your gums but on top of that it doesn't have any ingredients that are
[3:32:20.880 --> 3:32:26.240]  known to hurt enamel i've gone up before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth clean but
[3:32:26.240 --> 3:32:32.480]  eroded enamel of the top so i got in to really safe healthy types of toothpaste and that's what

[3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:45.440]  States cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because Fauci says if we don't
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:52.080]  we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping up the testing
[3:33:52.080 --> 3:33:58.800]  and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent
[3:33:58.800 --> 3:34:05.200]  they cook the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci Bill Gates and
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:12.400]  the Chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab and now it's all over the news
[3:34:12.400 --> 3:34:18.080]  that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin and so is Google and
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:23.600]  they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have to have it to be able to travel
[3:34:23.600 --> 3:34:28.240]  oh and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store and the contact tracers work
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:31.920]  for billable indicates and the Clintons and they're going to come to your house and make sure you're
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:36.720]  inoculated yes we're now inside the mark of the beast resist to be enslaved
[3:34:40.400 --> 3:34:43.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:57.120]  all right we got a bunch of callers here but i'm going to have to give each caller 90 seconds so
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:03.120]  that i can take as many as possible so let's just not hesitate let's go to west calling in from
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:11.040]  england on the alex jones show go ahead west so thanks for the call the UN basically has this tool
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:20.640]  they have a tool that can give member nations to sign on to the new law that was presented in
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:28.240]  2016 the power to send foreign troops into the into each nation that they declare deep requires
[3:35:28.240 --> 3:35:35.840]  humanitarian aid it's called the kigali principles obama basically signed it in 2016 in the lame
[3:35:35.840 --> 3:35:42.080]  dark period i'm convinced that trac basically has defunded the wrong organization it should
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:49.280]  really be defunding the un because the un is about to take him out the mexican national god back in
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:57.920]  2017 was trained by the UN in foreign intervention for called humanitarian aid which includes all
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:36:06.800]  you know like killing locals until they acquiesce to UN authority etc so what i'm basically implying
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:14.000]  is is that we need to defund the UN fast because UN is out to get literally everyone that does not
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:20.560]  submit to the corona pandemic for yeah trump needs to get out ahead of the UN trying to take over
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:28.480]  that's a good point trump needs to get out ahead of it now and lay the groundwork that poses the UN
[3:36:28.480 --> 3:36:34.160]  as an anti-american force so that people know when they arrive boots on the ground uh they'll
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:40.000]  understand that it's a difficult uh it's a difficult thing to weave in and in and out of
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.560]  because you know how the media is going to cover it and you do have to consider that how they get
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:50.240]  everybody hyped up um but there's no doubt we've already covered this at infowars the UN already
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:57.040]  has basically forward operating bases they've set up at like Kellogg's uh big Kellogg's distribution
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:00.560]  places and stuff so they already have their trucks and everything people have seen that
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:05.200]  but yeah they're definitely laying the groundwork thanks for the call west baldy in new york go ahead
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:12.960]  so i refuse to wear a mask uh if a if a business enforces the mask then i either refuse them my
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:19.200]  business or use a curbside option it's getting so bad here in new york state that i have sold my
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:26.880]  house and we are my family and i were moving to a red county within a red state uh but thankfully
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:34.240]  president trump during his five-star weekend i mean a total double thumbs up uh from from pillar to
[3:37:34.240 --> 3:37:40.080]  post from friday to all the way through uh he gave us the cheat code and if you don't want to wear a
[3:37:40.080 --> 3:37:46.240]  mask it's because it's your peacefully protesting so you're clear with that um you know the weekend
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:53.920]  ended with the with the signing uh putting nancy Pelosi and the democrats into a full nelson and
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:38:00.720]  slamming their face into the turnbuckle totally dominating them making him look like fools uh
[3:38:00.720 --> 3:38:05.760]  but unfortunately we got some distressing news in the beginning saying that we may not be seeing
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:09.920]  him for a while yeah but let me baldy let me let's just stop right there because you're saying so
[3:38:09.920 --> 3:38:15.920]  much here i want to address a couple things nobody is going to see that rko out of nowhere that
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:19.920]  donald trump just pulled over nancy plosy because the media is not going to cover it now chris wall
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:25.200]  has kind of touched on it a little bit when nancy plosy was slobbling and smiling like a demon on
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:31.760]  fox news this weekend but trump basically forced the democrats hand to now say that if they don't
[3:38:31.760 --> 3:38:35.360]  sign this bill which they're all saying they're not going to sign because it's president trump's
[3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:41.040]  bill that the homeless will no longer get their benefits uh basically all the benefits of the
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:44.880]  democrats have been promising people forever are wiped out with this bill it's like they didn't
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:50.080]  read it and so trump kind of got them but the media won't even cover that uh so i'm not even sure
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:53.680]  if that political victory really matters uh smanards you want to respond i forgot the first
[3:38:53.680 --> 3:38:58.160]  point baldy brought up there oh yeah the peaceful protest so yeah you don't want to wear a mask you
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:02.080]  want to go to the park you just say okay well you know i tried to explain why the mask isn't
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:06.160]  legal but now i'm just gonna peacefully protest and black lives matter and then you just go about
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:10.880]  your merry way that's what you have to do and like i said one of the best ways you can protest too
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:15.680]  more importantly against those face masks is by not wearing them so good job baldy for not wearing
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:19.520]  a face mask good on you for that yeah i think that's the ticket though somebody comes up to you and
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:23.280]  harasses you you just kindly you know we have a conversation you just say hey look the mask thing
[3:39:23.280 --> 3:39:28.480]  is not legal and actually it doesn't even work and uh you can't make me wear it and you know i do
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:32.640]  have a health issue and you can't ask about it by law and that's the thing too so many people have
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:38.080]  been brainwashed to where they actually think it's a law that you have to do it and if you don't
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:42.560]  you're breaking the law and you should be subjected to jail for not wearing a face mask and then if
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:46.160]  they say no you have to wear the face mask okay well i'm gonna have to actually take my right to
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:52.080]  peacefully protest the face mask now black lives matter uh i can't breathe have a nice day and
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:57.360]  then you go about your way okay uh let's do brandon in california brandon go ahead
[3:39:59.200 --> 3:40:04.640]  greetings i'd like to say hi appreciate you guys and what you guys are doing um i'm gonna try to not
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:09.520]  worry about me i have a lot to say especially sitting on the phone kind of listening to what
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:15.680]  everybody else says that um i think the main issue we're having as humankind is not being able to come
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:24.080]  together under one common thing who are we defunding who are we attacking who don't we agree upon or
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:30.480]  with why can't we all just come together find one thing to get get going and then move on second i'd
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:36.960]  like to say i'm having an issue i understand not wearing a mask me personally i don't wear one either
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:41.680]  but the whole black lives matter protest i thought we were clear on who's funding and where this money
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:46.080]  is coming from who they're associated with and why they're doing this thing so i don't understand
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:50.160]  people no no no here's why i would say do it i would say use it because here's the thing the
[3:40:50.160 --> 3:40:54.640]  left does all this stuff because they know it bothers us if we start saying black lives matter
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:40:58.640]  to get our way to get things that we want to get done then they'll quit saying it
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:06.880]  okay okay i understand like they love black lives matter because it gives them carte blanche to do
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:11.120]  whatever the hell they want as soon as you say they're right black lives matter no face mask then
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:17.440]  they'll be like well what you know so it's just about scrambling their like logistical wires
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:21.200]  and you know i actually saw that in action too because last week when crouter was here
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:25.280]  and tifa came and tried to silence the event so he got a black girl in the crowd and was like hey
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:29.440]  come sit down with me and they started chanting stop silencing black voices and then antifa
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:33.680]  stopped because they realized that they were silencing a black voice so if you do use their
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:37.600]  tactic against them it really scrambles their brain and it's hilarious to see in real time
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:45.680]  anything else brandon all right we lost brandon uh let's go to ken in massachusetts can go ahead
[3:41:46.240 --> 3:41:52.400]  hey what's up bowlin good job guys good job savannah um listen in massachusetts i don't know
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:59.440]  what's going on um this contact trace in certain restaurants i wear a mask people i don't wear a
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:04.880]  mask people look at me funny i do wear a mask it is like three hundred dollar mandate our
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:12.000]  governor's putting on here i mean i'm an independent researcher you know citizen patriot
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:19.200]  and i've worked for local media i've done producing and i've been waking people up slowly in my state
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:25.760]  i've been getting attacked too because i'm a conservative independent and i'm i'm at a loss
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:31.520]  for words where there's a lot of confusion up here in massachusetts and the way i get attacked for
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:36.640]  standing up like you said you need security when your other caller said you know it takes a lot of
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:42.400]  coverage i'm not in texas down there with you guys right here is the front lines i don't know
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:48.400]  i don't know well i'm i'm trying i'm waking people up more people at the local radio station
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:54.720]  that i used to work at i'm waking up stopping to see it but then i got corrupt people doing
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:43:01.520]  certain things to me i can't just i can't explain on here it's crazy it's crazy well ken you know
[3:43:01.520 --> 3:43:06.960]  i'm gonna play a video coming up on the war room that really encapsulates the craziness where
[3:43:07.680 --> 3:43:14.240]  the left has now adopted what are really the fundamentals of info wars just anti establishment
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:20.640]  anti tyranny um and they've literally captured the the resistance and they've captured it all
[3:43:20.640 --> 3:43:24.880]  as if it's in their name and if they're resisting trump who's only who hasn't even been president
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:30.320]  for a full term this guy hasn't and then they side with the media that's been in power for 50 years
[3:43:30.320 --> 3:43:35.520]  they side with the democrats that have been in office for 50 years so i don't know man look i
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:41.120]  understand where you're coming from it's like you can't reach these people but um you know keep
[3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:45.280]  fighting the good fight and uh you know i don't know massachusetts normally a patriotic state but
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:49.200]  just like what they're doing with the left now they're they're they're tearing everything down
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:52.240]  all right let's squeeze in one more uh from erin and kentucky go ahead
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:43:58.720]  hey uh great job today y'all uh you know you were asking earlier owen regarding the stopping the
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:03.520]  election or the attempt of these uh antifa thugs to try to stop the election and i think if we
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:08.160]  watch what's happened in portland and what's going on over there right now they i believe 100
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:12.320]  percent that this camp out that they're going to try to do in washington is going to be moving
[3:44:12.320 --> 3:44:17.120]  towards that end i mean i i don't understand what what what they think is is going to change
[3:44:17.120 --> 3:44:22.480]  because you don't get a new president camping out not shaving or showering refusing to wear deodorant
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:26.400]  because i mean this isn't a gaming competition so i understand what their point in doing this is
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:31.200]  however i think that if we watch their game plan and what they've done in portland and how they've
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:35.840]  attacked not only the cities but they've gone out to the neighborhoods they've attacked old ladies
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:41.280]  they've attacked law by citizens in their homes when they go over in washington i think it's going
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:46.640]  to be along the same lines not only that but years ago when the mayak report came out and we
[3:44:46.640 --> 3:44:52.000]  saw people that were uh being told that if you wear blue jeans or you pay in cash when you go to a
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:56.800]  store that that may be a domestic domestic or non-supporter or supporter if you have a don't
[3:44:56.800 --> 3:45:02.880]  tread on me fly that bra yeah and we got a bad connection with you thanks for the call uh savannah
[3:45:02.880 --> 3:45:07.680]  you want to end in the show with anything no thank you for the call and you know it was great being
[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:12.240]  here today and i'm glad we were able to discuss a lot of these big issues there is zero doubt
[3:45:12.240 --> 3:45:19.280]  that the occupy the white house is uh is their next big thing to create a bunch of chaos in dc
[3:45:19.280 --> 3:45:23.520]  trumps who just leave dc and just hang out at mara lago for the rest of the year just play golf
[3:45:23.520 --> 3:45:42.880]  just make him even more mad
